Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to be talking about my secret for how
I do research and the key to developing the biggest
picture understanding of life possible. What I find on a
very practical level, is that very few people have a
very big picture understanding of life, and what they're doing
here in life, and the reality and much less so
an accurate, big picture understanding of life. So the question
that I always had is, how do I develop such
a picture? What do I need to know? What principles
do I need to follow? What traps must I avoid?
Because if it's such a rare thing, that must mean
that very few people are able to succeed at it.
And why would that be? That's the topic that we're
going to cover today. My secret to how I do
research, how I discover all this information, bring it to
you. And how I've been doing this for for over
a decade now, in my own life, is quite interesting.
The secret is not some gimmick or some technique, or
some gadget that I use, where I can just like
speed read through books, and that that's how I do
it. That's not how I do it actually read pretty
slowly. The secret is not a gimmick, the secret is
having the right epistemic Foundation, which very few people have.
And this is why people fail at developing the big
picture. And this is why you too, will fail. Unless
you make an extraordinary effort to understand what the right
epistemic foundation is. Even very intelligent people, even highly enlightened
people still fail, because they fail to study what the
right epistemic foundation is for really acquiring the understanding and
avoiding all the traps. And by the way, this is
true in most areas where people have deep success is
that the success is not some flimsy gimmick or technique.
It's a structural thing. It's how they approach the entire
problem. It's not just a flimsy add on. So my
own story goes back to high school into college. And
I've talked about this before, but I was kind of
obsessed with philosophy and epistemology, epistemology of the field of
philosophy that is concerned with theory of knowledge. How do
we know what we know? A lot of people like
to talk about how they have the truth, or they
know what's true, or they understand reality. But they've never
investigated how it is that people come to know anything.
That's a very deep field of study. Human beings have
been studying it for over 2000 years, with mixed results
with a lot of blunders. So you got to be
very careful. This is a very delicate field. A lot
of nuance here. So as I went into philosophy, and
I do a lot of philosophy, I became aware of
a couple of things. First is I became aware of
myself doing philosophy. So this is kind of like what
I would call meta philosophy. As I'm sitting there doing
philosophy, I become aware and conscious that, hey, I'm doing
philosophy, and I'm doing it according to certain rules and
certain following certain principles and making certain assumptions. And that's
worth investigating in and of itself. So I started kind
of doing meta philosophy, philosophy on philosophy, asking questions like,
well, what is philosophy? How does philosophy work? What is
it working towards? And by the way, what I use
the word philosophy for you, if you don't like that
word, you can just substitute it with seeking understanding or
seeking truth. That's basically what the aim of philosophy is.
And then how successful is it at actually delivering on
that promise? Well, that's a mixed bag. Depends on how
you do it. Also, what I became aware of is
I became aware of the role of psychology within philosophy.
It's not as though we're just sitting on our chair
and doing philosophy. And we're discovering stuff about reality. It's
not like that psychology, our own personal emotions, desires and
biases, end up playing a huge role in the way
that we do philosophy or the way that we go
about seeking truth or seeking understanding. And this is an
element that many people miss even very intelligent philosophers. So
I became aware of that, and also I became acutely
aware of the limits of philosophy and of reason. And
that there are some things that are outside of philosophy
and outside of reason. And it's important when you're doing
philosophy to realize your limitations. And not to assume that
you can just use philosophy to solve every problem. So
those are some of the things I noticed. And as
I was studying and researching all this stuff, I went
pretty deep with it, and basically my epistemic foundation gelled.
And then I use that epistemic foundation to do an
amazing amount of research in the last five years, a
lot of it I've been sharing with you, a lot
of it I haven't even been able to be able
to share yet because some of the stuff is quite
difficult to articulate. Some of these concepts are very nuanced,
easy to misinterpret, easy to misunderstand. And it takes time
for me just to do the research in my own
mind to understand it before I can come up here
and deliver it to you. But anyways, the important thing
that I want to share with you is my epistemic
foundation, I think that's the most valuable thing I can
really offer you in this entire field of personal development.
Because you can learn about techniques here and there from
other people, what boat very few people teach you is
the epistemic foundation, you need to really develop an accurate
big picture understanding of reality, and to avoid all the
traps that people fall into. And I didn't know this,
but by going through this process, I developed almost like
the superpower, the epistemic foundation became like the superpower that
I had been able to use to grow very quickly
and to discover new fields that I would never, ever,
ever have been able to discover, other than through accident.
And even then I would not be open to them,
I would not even consider them or take them seriously,
let alone do the work to actually live and embody
them in my own life, if I did not have
this foundation. So let's talk about this foundation. Let me
give you a recap of some of the biggest lessons
that I learned from studying epistemology. The first lesson is
that the first position that every human being is in
when they come into this life is that we don't
know what's true. We don't know what's true. Here I
am, starting this process of understanding, trying to get the
big picture, tried to know what all this light is
all about. And the first position I don't know what's
true. Now, that might seem obvious, but then again, nobody
admits this. Nobody really takes this seriously. They always come
into it with all sorts of assumptions about like, well,
but yeah, that's sort of like theoretically, maybe you're rightly
Oh, but you know, we know this is true. We
know that is true. And science has told us this
is true. And you know, some stuff is just obvious.
Some stuff is just self evidence, some stuff is just
like it couldn't be otherwise. No, what I'm saying is
that you literally don't know what's true. That's your starting
point in this inquiry. And if you don't really understand
and appreciate and accept that, you've already made a huge
mistake, because you're gonna bring a lot of assumptions and
biases into this inquiry. And there's a corollary to this
idea that you don't know what's true, the corollary is
that literally anything is possible. And a lot of people
don't appreciate this corollary at all. Because as soon as
they start to do philosophy, as soon as they start
to investigate, immediately, they have all sorts of preconceived notions
about what's possible. And what's worthwhile to investigate. It's like,
Well, I'm not gonna go read that book, because obviously,
it's false. I'm not gonna go study that field, because
it's all bullshit, I'm not going to go investigate that
thing over there, because that can't possibly work. See, and
already, you have crippled yourself in this process, just by
not understanding these two basic points. It's very important that
when you start a research program, that you're open to
every possibility. Because you have to start from the place
of admitting that you don't know where the research could
lead to. You might think that some research Avenue might
be a dead end, and actually it turns out to
lead very far or vice versa. And so when you
really understand this principle, then you have to understand that
everything warrants investigation. You cannot prejudge anything. You can't say,
well, that thing over there, I'm just not going to
worry about it, because it's obviously false. No. grasp the
significance of the first position is that you Don't know
what's true, when you don't know what's true, that means
you also don't know what's possible to be true, and
what's possible to be false. And you don't know which
principles you will use to assess what's true and what's
false. That's how deeply you don't know. You don't know
what is gonna come out of this investigation, maybe nothing
at all, maybe it's gonna be a giant waste of
time, or maybe something glorious will come out of it,
you don't know. And you're not sure how you're going
to get there, you don't know what the path is
going to be. You're just kind of stumbling around in
the dark completely. This is very important to understand. You
cannot rely on the knowledge or information that other human
beings have sort of mind for you and supply to
you in books, because how do you assess which books
are correct, and which are not? There's a lot of
conflicting information in books. Same thing with experts, there's a
lot of different experts in every field, who conflict with
each other and tell you the opposite things. So how
are you going to know which experts to rely on
which books to rely on which fields to study and
which ones to ignore? And the reality is that you
don't. And to admit, that is very important. Because most
people assume that, well, I have a good gut feeling
that that field over there is a stupid field. And
I have a good gut feeling that that book over
there is a bunch of bullshit. And I have a
good feeling of that, that expert that that Guru over
there is full of shit. And as soon as you
get stuck in that sort of paradigm, you've lost it,
you failed, you will never ever recover from that. So
that's an important point. Another lesson I learned is that
self deception is the number one enemy. In doing research,
and developing understanding, self deception, you are your own greatest
enemy. What this means is that you have to watch
your personal biases and weaknesses like a hawk, because they
are the number one factor that will lead you astray.
And of course, what do we do? In our infinite
wisdom? What do we do when we start to go
on this process of research and understanding? We immediately start
to point fingers at other people and say, Oh, that
guy's full of shit. And that's bullshit. That's a lie
over there, that guy's deluded. And look at this, this
nonsense over here, look at those Mormons. Look at those
Christians. Look at those, you know, foolish scientists from 200
years ago, how could they have been also foolish. And
as soon as you again, take that sort of attitude,
you've already failed, because you've oriented yourself outward at pointing
out other people's self deceptions. Meanwhile, neglecting your own and
your own is the only ones that you really should
be worried about. And this requires a lot of emotional
labor to watch your own personal biases and your own
weaknesses come into play as you do the research. Because
what would happen if you need to go research some
topic that will trigger fears in you, that will trigger
your deepest insecurities. That's going to require a lot of
emotional labor, to grapple with some of these nuanced ideas.
It's going to require sort of stepping outside of your
perspective and outside of your paradigm, putting aside your own
biases, and what you want to be true in favor
of seeing what actually is true. What's going to happen
when you hit that fork in the road? Well, I'll
tell you, what's going to happen if you're not very
vigilant, is that you will side with your own personal
biases and weaknesses, you will succumb to them, and you
will ignore what's actually the case. And you will make
a huge epistemic blunder as most people do. Another lesson
that I learned is that every position no matter what
position or perspective, you take on reality has hidden assumptions
behind it. That is a very deep epistemic truth. And
in a sense, the assumptions define the position or they
define the perspective to even have a perspective on a
situation like What's your perspective on religion? What's your perspective
on science? What's your perspective on abortion? What's your perspective
on what reality is? What's your perspective on philosophy? What's
your perspective on what human beings are here on earth
to do? What's your perspective on what life is about?
What's your perspective on the origins of life and evolution?
To have a perspective about that, and you probably have
many of those perspectives, right? You take positions on these
things and you're very adamant about your position. But to
have any perspective on anything at all requires hidden assumptions
that are very difficult to root out and to become
aware of. And then what most people do is they
take a position or perspective. And they don't understand that
there are assumptions there that they've never even questioned or
thought about. Almost like axioms or premises, which defined the
paradigm, or the perspective from which they look at the
world. And that that shapes everything, right, because that's the
first step is the assumptions. From there, everything becomes like
a chain reaction. And when you get the first assumptions
wrong, or you aren't clear about what they are exactly,
or you've never questioned them, then all your other reasoning,
and all your justifications, and everything else that comes on
top of that, it's on a rotten foundation, you see,
the assumptions are the foundation. So it's very important to
look at these hidden assumptions, and to root them out.
And to become very clear about what they are. So
a lot of people go wrong right here. Another lesson
that I learned is that all perspectives are partial. All
perspectives are partial. The biggest trap you can fall into
is this idea that, hey, you know, let me go
find the right perspective for me. And then I'm just
going to adopt that perspective and live from that perspective.
You are not going to develop the biggest picture understanding
of life by doing that. Because no matter what perspective
you adopt, on whatever position, it will only be partial,
it will only be a partial truth, there will be
a lot of other things that you ignore a lot
of nuances from the other side. So one good way
to avoid this problem is to study many, many, many
perspectives, and to be impartial to the perspectives. And to
see that your job is not to adopt a certain
perspective, but really to jump around perspectives and explore them
all sort of like you're at a buffet, you don't
commit to any one dish, you sample the whole thing.
So that's a, that was a lesson I learned pretty
early on. Another lesson I learned is that a model
is not reality. Thinking about reality, is not reality. Coming
up with a schematic representation, in your own mind of
how something works is not the actual thing in the
real world working. And while models can be useful, you
cannot substitute them for reality, this becomes a huge trap.
And in a sense, the better your models become, the
more likely you are to mistake them for reality. And
this becomes very dangerous. And this has been one of
the key pitfalls of good science is that nowadays, our
science is so good and so accurate, and manipulating reality
that we think that Okay, that's it, then we got
the models, we've got reality figured out. And that becomes
a huge trap. Another lesson I learned is that your
web of beliefs, which is the entire collection of all
the beliefs you have about everything that's true or false
in the world, that this web of beliefs is like
a representation of reality, and that it's under constrained. And
this is true for every human being. This is the
nature of how the police works, which means that we
have a few number of hardcore facts that we might
say are facts about reality. And then you have this
giant web of beliefs that you build, which is only
loosely connected to the facts, which means that you can
build different kinds of webs of belief to explain exactly
the same phenomenon, which explains why we have this diversity
of perspectives and diversity of opinions and ideologies around the
world, is that we could have the exact same facts,
but because people interpret the facts in different ways. And
they have all sorts of other elements to the web
of belief that are not based on facts at all.
They just have their own biases and their own preferences,
that those get mixed in there. And so you could
have a web of belief, which is one way explaining
one set of facts, but then somebody else has a
totally different way of beliefs explaining the exact same set
of facts. And this leads to a lot of confusion,
and you got to be able to see through that
and you got to be able to see that other
people are doing that and that you yourself are doing
that. And you got to be willing to question those
beliefs that are not connected to the facts themselves. Because
there you've got this sort of fudge factor. And one
thing that you love your psyche loves or where your
mind loves, is to have this fudge factor where it
can fudge things around. And it can concoct its own
stories and theories about how the world works. It loves
that we're addicted to that. Because human beings are sort
of modeling animals. Another lesson I learned is that foundationalism
is false. foundationalism is the idea that you can take
some theory you have about reality, and that you can
ground all of it down into one fundamental truth. That
is indisputable. This is something that philosophers have been trying
to do for over 2000 years, is they've been trying
to take their philosophy or their notions of the of
the world and how the world works. And they have
to say, okay, so we have these higher level understandings
of reality. But let's kind of boil it down to
the essence, what is the essence what is indisputably true?
That is completely justified and certain. This is something that
Rene Descartes did, and many other philosophers that followed him
did. And every one of them basically failed. And if
you study the history, philosophy, you see the history of
foundationalism, failing over and over and over and over and
over again, because there is nothing that you can ground
your theories in. Absolutely. There is no such thing. Another
lesson that I learned is that rationality is far too
limited, to use as your only tool to explore reality.
And to understand reality. If you think rationality will be
sufficient, you're wrong, and you will fail and you will
make many epistemic blunders. Reality goes far beyond rationality. And
this actually makes a lot of sense, because if you
think about it, what is rationality? Well, rationality is only
one element of reality. Rationality itself is a subset of
this larger superset, which is reality. So of course, you
shouldn't expect that rationality can encompass the entire superset a
subset cannot encompass the superset. You see, rationality has to
arise out of irrationality, before there was rationality, there was
irrationality, rationality has to be evolved, if you take the
standard scientific understanding of it, you know, there was no
rationality until complex mammals evolved, and we had primates, and
then we had human beings, there was no rationality you
before that. And to have evolved to this place, and
then to look backwards, and to backwards, rationalize it and
say, well, but you know, yeah, we need human brains
to be rational. But you know, let's just assume that,
at the beginning of the universe, the rationality was still
there. No, it wasn't human beings. And human brains took
billions of years to evolve. So after billions of years
of evolution, you got rationality, before that there was no
rationality. So you can see, if you take a look,
look at it from that perspective, you can see just
how much of the universe has no rationality in it
whatsoever. And that should humble you. As far as your
attempts go at rationalizing the whole universe. You have to
be open to the idea that maybe the universe can't
be rationalized in principle, and that your attempts to do
so leave a lot of stuff unexplained. Another lesson I
learned is that paradox is good. When you encounter a
paradox, in your research, and in your attempt to understand
the world, that's a good thing. That's not something to
be afraid of. That's not something to run away from.
That's something to embrace. And again, you got to be
open to the possibility that reality might be paradoxical. At
its very core, in which case we do run into
paradoxes. That's fine. That means that that's what reality is.
So don't worry about that. Also, paradox might be the
fallout that you get when you try to rationalize all
of reality. So if you're attempting to rationalize everything, and
you keep getting paradoxes, that might be a sign telling
you, hey, stop trying to rationalize everything. There's more to
reality than rationality. So paradox is something to be embraced.
Another lesson I learned is that direct experience is the
truest thing we've got. So of all the things we
can rely on to begin our investigation, we could rely
on expert authorities, like the Pope, or some scientist, Einstein,
we could rely on authority, but that's not a very
high quality way to do this. And that's negation. We
could also rely on various other things, our thoughts, our
reasoning abilities, our intuitions, and so forth, or we got
just direct experience. So what do we start our investigation
with? Well, I don't have time to go into why
I came to this lesson. But the lesson I came
to, is that direct experience is the truest thing you've
got. If you stick to that, you're going to avoid
a lot of traps. If, however, you're going to go
with different authority figures, different writers and speakers and authors,
that's gonna be very problematic, you're gonna run to a
lot of traps there. Or if you go with your
own reasoning abilities, well, that's a that's even potentially more
dangerous, because your mind is a very tricky thing. It's
like a labyrinth that you can very easily get lost
in. So I'm not saying that you need to now
discount expert authorities, and your own reason, and your own
intuitions. No, all those things are important factors. So we're
not throwing those away. But I'm just saying that the
truest thing you've got is your own direct experience. And
that's a good starting point for this investigation. Now, once
you go further, and then investigation, you might want to
come back and revisit this axiom or this assumption, that
direct experience is the truest thing you've got. And you
might want to question that. But as a starting point
that that principle to go with, because you got to
start somewhere, right? It's not possible to start this investigation
from ground zero. Because you've already got certain beliefs, you've
already got some certain assumptions to do this investigation in
practice, not in theory. But in practice, you have to
make certain assumptions. The key is not to get locked
into your assumptions. The key is to be flexible enough
to come back and revisit those assumptions in the future.
Because you know what, every assumption that you started with
might have been false. And you don't know until you
really check, check it out. That might take a while.
Speaking of direct experience, another lesson I learned, and this
is something I learned more recently, is that there is
a huge spectrum of possible direct experiences. Huge, way larger
than you ever imagined possible, what you think of as
reality and all the experiences you've had in your whole
life, that is a tiny little sliver of all the
vast possible and weird experiences that are possible to have
in this world. And so seeking out new experiences becomes
hugely important. If you accept the axiom, that direct experience
is one of the truest things you have in this
inquiry. Because if you have a very narrow slice of
this entire spectrum, and you're using that slice to create
your models and your understanding, well, you can see how
that can go very wrong. Because you're missing out on
so much of the larger spectrum, you're not accounting for
the whole thing. And by definition, that means you're not
going to have the biggest picture, to have the big
picture, you need to explore more of the spectrum, because
the picture is explaining the spectrum. And a lot of
people the reason they don't have a big picture, and
they don't care about developing a big picture is because
they've committed themselves to a little tiny sliver of the
spectrum. Like they grew up in the same city in
the same state in the same country. They speak one
language, they haven't studied history. They're not very worldly, and
so they haven't experienced much of life. All they do
is they just go to their nine to five job
at Starbucks, they punch the clock, they do the work,
they come home, maybe they have a relationship, they have
a kid, and that's it. And their their experience is
very of life is very limited. They don't study science
and history and religion and philosophy or any of this
kind of stuff. And so then they have very little
that needs explaining to them. They understand everything. Because yeah,
they understand everything. That's just that little piece of life.
But once you start having more diverse experiences, you start
interacting with intelligent people, you start having altered states of
consciousness, you start learning about personal development, you start learning
about weird paranormal phenomena that people talk about, and you
start investigating all this stuff. And all of a sudden,
you have a lot more experienced to explain. And all
the sudden your old big picture what you thought was
the big picture. Explanation doesn't work anymore. Doesn't work to
account for the whole spectrum. So pushing your spectrum out
to both ends is very important. Another lesson I learned
is that the practical level still matters. It's very easy
to get lost in just armchair philosophy and just theorizing
stuff. But it's important to keep in mind But the
reason we're doing this is so that we can move
forward and that we can be more effective in our
lives. So we can be more happier. So we can
master our emotions, so we can be more successful in
the things that we want to accomplish. So if this
entire investigation is not helping you to do that, then
you're losing yourself in theory, and in academic disputes, that
are really not relevant to you living the kind of
life that you want to live. So this entire investigation,
one easy way to see if you're doing it right,
is that your life should be improving. Gradually, over time,
in the long run, not on the short run, but
in the long run, your life should be improving, because
in the short run, you might discover some things in
this investigation, that kind of freak you out. destabilize you,
so that's okay. But in the long run, you should
start to see improvement, that's the practical level got to
keep the practical level in mind. Another lesson I learned
is that the best position to take is no position
at all. To not desire a position to not have
anything to defend. That's really when you know you're doing
good epistemology. When you can just admit to yourself that
you know what, I just want to get to the
bottom of understanding what's true here, I don't care what's
true. I'm open to whatever, I'm not going to be
defending any position, I'm not going to be an ideologue,
I'm not going to be a crusader. I don't care
about debating with people, I don't care about proving my
point. I don't care about writing a book, I don't
care about being famous with some idea that I hold,
I don't care about getting more followers and recruiting more
people to my cause. I don't care about holding some
rally or some riot, or you know, getting people to
pull out their pitchforks. I don't care about any of
that. All of that is a distraction. What I'm interested
in is just getting to the bottom of understanding what
life is and how I should live it. And in
that respect, I have no position. I don't need a
position. A position is something that people need to feel
comfortable like a baby blanket, and I am more mature
than that. That's a really healthy attitude to take. Another
lesson I learned is to seek understanding rather than truth.
So the trap with seeking the halving of truth is
that we think of truth as this tangible object, some
like some sort of Holy Grail, that I will go
and I will find the Holy Grail. And I will
bring it back, and I will put it on my
trophy case at home. That doesn't seem to work very
well. If you take a look at the history of
science and philosophy, over the last couple 1000 years, very
few people have succeeded in bringing home the truth, Holy
Grail and putting it on their mantle. Instead, what you
should be more interested in is just the looser project
of developing understanding. So it's not that I want to
grab hold of something and then claim it and show
to the world as this is the true thing. Not
like that. But instead it's like, I just want to
understand, I want to understand the different fields of life
and how they work. I want to understand the mechanics
understand the traps the pitfalls, so I want to understand
maybe how business works. I don't want to take a
stance on what's the best way to do business. I
just want understand what are the different ways to do
business, for example? And what are the different pros and
cons? What are the different mechanics what's going on at
the metal level? That's what I call understanding. And the
same thing with every other field, personal development, spiritual development,
relationships, health and any other kind of fields you want,
right? It's not about grabbing hold of something there and
say, Okay, now I understand it's not like that understanding
is more of a loose thing. It's sort of like
you see how all the parts are moving and why
they're moving the way they're moving. And you're sort of
like looking at the situation from a bird's eye view.
Right, rather than being a crusader stuck on the ground
level fighting for some specific position. Another lesson I learned
is to seek holism in whatever you're studying or investigating,
and this is as opposed to what a lot of
academics do, which is become hyper specialized, and get lost
in the academic minutiae of some argument or debate, nitpick
everything and, you know, study the hell out of some
little tiny element which has nothing to do with how
you're living your life. It has no bearing on your
relationships, your ability to improve your happiness levels, your emotional
mastery or your The overall sense of consciousness, it has
nothing to do with that. It's just some little minut
academic thing that maybe you can write a paper on
and get it research published in some research journal, or
you could use it to hit someone over the head
with as like a means of saying, Oh, I'm right,
I'm right. Because see, look, I won the debate because
of this little minut little academic point that I was
correct on. To not get lost in that academic minutiae
is very important. And that just means to have the
desire to really integrate everything. The goal is not to
understand your little field, the goal is to understand all
of life, which encompasses every field that there is, right?
Of course, some fields are getting more interested in others,
but overall, your understanding what the hell is going on
in life? And how should I be living my life?
These are the really important questions, not some little nitpicky
academic point in some philosophical journal. And then, the last
lesson that I learned is that argumentation and debate and
justification, that these are tools of the ego, and that
they do not serve truth finding. If your objective is
to find truth, and your objective is to understand, then
you have to let go of argumentation, debate, and justification,
stop doing these things. They are holding you back, they're
sucking you into ego, they're sucking you into this paradigm
of defending some kind of position. And the more you
defend a position, the more stuck you become. And this
is the biggest trap that people make is that they
choose a position they become loyal to it, and then
they defend it to the death. And that's what happens
is that they died holding the same positions that they
held when they were still teenagers. And that's a real
shame. And they never develop the big picture that they
could have developed. So those are some of the biggest
lessons I learned. I didn't go into how I derived
these lessons, because that would take hours and hours and
hours to explain. But you can take these as principles.
Don't just blindly believe them, take them as axioms, use
them for your investigation. And you will discover that you
will progress very fast and into deep and very uncharted
territory. And that's how you'll know that they're working. And
anything that isn't working question. And maybe I'm wrong. Right?
So you got a question, even the stuff that I'm
telling you. Because the first position is that you don't
know what's true. And you certainly don't know if what
I'm telling you is true, just based on the fact
that I'm telling it to you, right, because that would
be the problem of just believing authority. The next question
that I want to talk about is, so if we
zoom out for a second here, and we ask ourselves
the big question, which is, what's the best? What's the
best method for understanding reality? Like, what, what methodology? Or
what attitude should I adopt? If what I care about
is having the biggest picture understanding of reality? Well, let's
explore this, there's a couple of positions or a couple
of basic approaches that you could take. The first approach
is what I call the default position, which is just
going with the flow. This is what will happen if
you don't do anything else. This is the majority of
cases of human beings on earth. In fact, 99% of
all human beings follow this, just go with the flow
attitude, which means that they don't really question life very
deeply. They don't probably even care about developing any kind
of big picture. And that's because they generally assume that
they've already got it figured out, they already have the
big picture. Because what they did is they just absorbed
it from their mainstream culture. Whatever their parents believe, whatever
their teachers told them, whatever they see on TV, what
are they reading the magazines, whatever their basic, naive intuitions
are about reality. They just say that, well, that's good
enough. That's all I need. It's functional. I can just
use that and go to work and have a family.
That's all I basically need. And that's the default position.
The problem with that, though, of course, is that it's
it's not a big picture understanding at all. These these
people hardly understand anything. They don't understand where their anger
comes from. They don't understand where their depression comes from.
They don't understand how to be happy, and they fail
at it every single day. They don't understand why they
have relationship problems and keep breaking up. They don't understand
why they have problems with people pleasing. They don't understand
why they have financial struggles, like they can't get a
good job or they can't please their boss. They don't
understand why. Why religion exists, or why there's a debate
between science and religion, or the opposite approach. They don't
understand why scientists are undermining real Listen. So there's all
these things that they don't understand and that they just
keep struggling with and struggling with and struggling for their
whole life, they struggle with this stuff. They don't master
themselves. They don't live life in a masterful way. They
are not joyful people, they're generally sour, bitter, depressed, people
who are just going through life, just kind of like
toughing it out. Thinking that if they just waited long
enough that eventually happiness will come through some sort of
acquisition of money or relationships, or a house or something
like that. And that will be like the peak of
their life where they get the stuff that they want.
And then after that, they can retire and then hopefully,
die, painless death. Like that's their general sense of how
life works. And, of course, these are people who haven't
really studied personal development all. And as soon as they
do start to study it personal, and they start to
see that their big picture just completely breaks down and
doesn't explain anything, they see all these contradictions, they see
all these things, they can't explain about themselves once they
become a little bit more aware. And then that's when
the sort of existential crisis starts to happen. So that's
the problem there. The other approach you could take to
developing your big picture is the academic approach. And I
already sort of touched on this the problem with the
academic approach. The academic approach is this narrowly specialized approach,
it's like, well, I'm gonna pick one field, like, let's
say, if I want to understand psychology, I'm going to
pick some very narrow fields in psychology. And I'm going
to tell you the shit out of it. And I'm
going to read all the past authors, I'm gonna network
with all the other academics in my field and just
research, research, research, research, Richard Read, read books, and do
a couple of narrow experiments and studies. And that's how
I'm going to really understand there is room for that
kind of work, it is important, but it's not going
to lead to any kind of real big picture understanding.
And it's certainly not going to really be that useful
in your own life, to live a great life. Even
if you can apply some of the things you learned
in your research in this narrow academic field, that's only
going to tackle one little facet of your life, and
all the other facets of your life are largely going
to be misunderstood. And that's why you can have someone
who's very intelligent, knows a lot about psychology in an
academic sense, or a lot about philosophy in an academic
sense. But he has no mastery over his anger, his
depression or whatever emotions he's having. He's unfulfilled in life,
he doesn't know how to get happiness, he doesn't know
how to embody love, and doesn't have much consciousness and
all this stuff, because he's spent his whole life stuck
in a library reading books, or doing some kind of
research on lab rats. See, that becomes a way to
narrow specialization. Another approach you have to developing a big
picture is to pick one spiritual tradition out there from
the many that are there. And just to stick with
it, and to follow it in a very focused way,
so Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, yoga, and all the different
subsets within all those. Pick whichever one you like, commit
to it, and just follow it, do all the practices,
study all the theory, and tell yourself that you're going
to get the biggest picture of the reality. A lot
of people do this. Some people do it in a
very dogmatic, sort of like, fundamentalist, Islamic sort of way,
which, of course, we know isn't healthy. But a lot
of people do it also in the kind of more
New Age sort of way. It's like, well, I'm going
to become a Buddhist. You know, Buddhism is an Islam
Buddhism is nice and peaceful. So I'm just gonna become
a Buddhist. And you know, the Buddha seems like a
guy who really knew what he was talking about. So
what could possibly go wrong if I just follow the
teachings of the Buddha? Of course, the problem with this,
and not just with Buddhism with with any one of
these spiritual traditions, is that, again, it's a partial perspective.
It's got a specific set of assumptions. It's got a
lot of cultural baggage that comes with it. It's a
paradigm, it's a way of looking at the world. And
maybe it will work to get you to enlightenment. Maybe
it won't. That's a mixed bag. Maybe the techniques you
choose will work for you because they fit with your
personality. Maybe they won't. That's a again, you're kind of
just shooting in the dark there. That's the probability thing.
But no matter what, even if they do work, you
will still develop a narrow A sectarian view, and your
big picture will be distorted. Even in the best case
scenario, even if you enroll like in a Zen monastery
and go to Zen monastery for 20 years, and you
learn everything there, and you aced all of their little
tests, and you do everything perfectly, you will wind up
with what? Enlightenment, yeah, maybe, maybe you'll wind up with
alignment, but still, your understanding of the world will be
limited. And it will not be the biggest picture possible.
And you will run into many epistemic traps there, even
if you attain enlightenment. So that's the danger. And of
course, most people won't even get to that most people
don't pick a spiritual teaching, and that spiritual teaching will.
Because they don't study all this epistemic stuff, that spiritual
teaching, they will distort it, they will misunderstand it, they
will not follow through on it. And they won't even
attain enlightenment using it. They'll just become dogmatic about it.
They'll have debates, little arguments and stuff, and they'll believe
in it, and yada, yada, yada. So all the problems
will happen that we've already talked about. So there's that
way, another way is to strictly stick to your direct
experience. So this would be a whole different methodology. Here,
what you would say is you say, Okay, fuck it,
I'm not reading any books, I'm not watching any videos,
I'm not talking to any gurus, I'm not listening to
anybody at all, because the only thing I know for
sure, is my direct experience. So what I'm going to
do, I'm going to lock myself in a room for
10 years, and I'm just going to do direct experience,
and nothing else. And everything else, I'm just going to
throw into the fire. There's that approach. That might seem
like maybe that's the best approach. Because then you can
eliminate any distorting outside influences, which are so ubiquitous. They
come from every corner and angle, the spiritual marketplace that
first developed marketplace, and just society at large. Basically, what
you're doing there is you're cutting yourself off completely from
culture, and from any other sources of human knowledge. And
you're trying to derive everything from the ground up. And
you might think, like, Well, that seems like a hard
path. But it also seems like that would be the
truth path. Except here's the problem. Remember that with epistemology,
the number one danger is self deception. The number one
danger is not others deceiving you, although that can be
a big danger. It's self deception. So when you lock
yourself in a room for 10 years, and you think
that you're going to, you're going to go through direct
experience, and just be very strict about it, and not
listen to anybody. It might work. But also, what's very
likely to happen is that you will get lost in
the labyrinth of your own mind. And you will tell
yourself things, and you'll come up with theories, and you'll
have certain experiences, and you'll misinterpret these experiences. And you
will not develop the biggest picture possible, you will end
up tricking yourself into thinking that you did but actually
didn't. And there will be things again, that you fail
to know. And again, you're gonna miss out on a
very important element, which is that if you're only sticking
to your direct experience, and you're not listening to anybody
else out there, you have to kind of assume that
you're going to be the most motivated, the most strict,
the most self honest human being who's ever lived. And
that you're assuming that you'd like you can discover everything
about reality all by yourself. That's what you're sort of
assuming that becomes very problematic, because again, you can limit
yourself to one narrow band on a large spectrum. And
when you're not coming into contact with other people from
other spiritual religious traditions, from scientific disciplines, different philosophers, when
you're not looking back into history, and you're not learning
from the lessons that humanity has committed throughout history, when
you're not learning from science, and you're not learning from
mysticism, and you're not learning from gurus, and you're not
learning from self help authors, when you completely cut yourself
off, man. That might be the most dangerous path of
ball, in a sense, now that I think about it,
because it's like, I couldn't even imagine how a human
being could avoid all the blunders and traps that are
possible in this inquiry without learning from the lessons of
others. So for me, that becomes a no go This
method doesn't work for me. And the last method is
studying lots of perspectives and lots of sources. So what
I could do is I could tell myself, okay, so
if there's all these problems with all these other methods,
what I could do is I could just go in,
like, read all the books, watch all the videos, listen
to all the gurus. And then I'm gonna have the
biggest picture. The problem with that, though, is that yes,
you can do that. And that might be fairly effective,
you're certainly going to get a very broad set second
hand understanding and appreciation for the spectrum of experience possible.
But if you only do that, and you only read
books, and you only watch videos, and you don't have
the direct experiences, you're not going to go very far.
It's going to actually becomes sort of like the academic
approach. Right? It's too much theory. And you're not going
to know what the theory and the models and the
gurus are talking about, because you haven't had the direct
experience. So then you will, again, fall into a deep
epistemic trap. So each of these methods by itself doesn't
work. It's too limited. So let me share with you
my approach, how do we practically overcome this problem? Which
method? Should I actually use? Leo, it sounds like you're
telling me that any method I use, is going to
be faulty? Well, in a sense, that's true. Because there
is no foolproof. Just Color by Number process for how
to develop the biggest picture, if there was everyone would
have the biggest picture. So you sort of have to
suspect that there isn't one that a lot of judgment
and care and vigilance and attention to detail is required.
If you want to successfully navigate through all the different
landmines that exist in this long research project. So here's
my pragmatic approach. If you follow this approach, I think
that this is the most powerful epistemic approach that you
can follow. And it will not entirely, not entirely eliminate
all your problems. It's not foolproof, but it's going to
give you your best chance. So here it is. First,
what you do is you fully commit to understanding versus
position taking. So you make a vow to yourself, that
I am not going to be taking any positions. And
then I'm going to be super mindful about this. As
I go forward, for the next 1020 3040 years, my
entire life, I'm going to be very mindful of how
I debate and argue my position. And every time I
noticed that I'm going to stop, I'm gonna cut it
off, I'm gonna be very mindful of defending any ideas
that I have about reality myself, how the world works,
and so forth. And anytime that I noticed myself, trying
to defend some ideological position, I'm going to cut that
off, as soon as I notice it. Also, I'm going
to see and look past the semantic squabbles that exist
between all the different perspectives out there. Because I will
be going out and studying many perspectives, hundreds of perspectives.
But in doing that, I recognize a lot of these
perspectives are talking about similar things, but in different language.
And I'm going to look past the language, I'm going
to read between the line and I'm going to get
beyond the terminology. And I'm gonna really go for the
root of what those teachings are pointing at, with the
intent of experience in my own life, not just to
learn it theoretically, but to live it. I'm also not
going to nitpick sources, I'm going to be charitable, I'm
generally going to assume that the things that people are
teaching me if they're reputable people, not just some bum
on the street. But if it's a reputable teacher, I'm
not going to dismiss them as being diluted, or liars,
or charlatans. I'm going to be charitable to them. Even
if a perspective that I encounter is very radically different
than mine. And it seems at first like it's complete
nonsense. I'm going to stay open minded, I'm going to
be charitable, and I'm going to take the burden on
myself to understand that perspective, I'm going to step into
that perspectives, shoes, so to speak. And I am going
to live from that perspective, just to get a taste
of what it's like. And then maybe I'll bounce off
of that and go to some other perspective and some
other perspectives, some other perspective, but I'm really going to
take the effort to step outside my shoes and to
change perspectives. Also, what I'm going to do is I'm
going to pull from hundreds of sources. So I'm not
going to be content with just reading 10 books and
then say okay, I got it off. figured out, I'm
going to pull from hundreds of sources. And I'm going
to combine that with my direct experience. So the stuff
that I'm pulling from all these different sources, it's good,
but it's only the starting point, it's giving me leads
on the stuff I got to follow up with, in
my direct experience. So if I hear somebody over there
talking about something, that sounds cool and interesting and important
to my bigger picture, understanding, okay, I'm gonna, I'm going
to, I'm going to take that on as the hypothesis.
And now like a good scientist, I'm going to go
and test it out. And then when I hear something
over there, I'm going to do the same thing, take
it on, as hypothesis tested out, and I'm gonna keep
doing that. And I'm keep doing that for my whole
life. And I'm never going to stop, and I'm never
going to settle on a position. That's basically my pragmatic
approach. And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cross
cross reference, the different perspectives. So I'm gonna go like,
study with a Buddhist master for a month. And then
I'm gonna go study with a Hindu master. And then
I'm going to study with Islamic master, and then a
Christian master. And then I'm going to, after I did
a month of study with each of them, I'm going
to come bring those together, cross reference them, and then
try to triangulate. What are the common elements? What explains
everything that's going on? And I'm gonna go check that
with my intuition. So any conclusions I come to? I'm
going to check them with my intuition to see okay,
does this have a ring of truth to it. So
it's not just a logical thing I'm doing it's like,
a, a deeply intuitive thing. As you start to build
your deeper, bigger picture, your intuition is going to get
stronger and stronger and stronger. And you're going to find
that truth just stands out, Like a diamond in the
sand, right, you can just see it, it sparkles. There's
something about it that you just kind of like, oh,
there it is, of course, you just pull that little
gem out there. And you pull it on little gem
out from here from that teaching from this teaching from
this perspective, from that perspective, and you do the sort
of pulling process, but you don't just pull theory, you
pull the theory to come up with a model, but
then you go and you directly experience it. And also,
you be careful to notice the minor discrepancies, which might
be important or might not be, as you're comparing these
different perspectives. You can't just throw out all the discrepancies,
because you might be missing something important. The discrepancies are
like leads, you have to follow up on those leads
and see whether they take you you know, that teacher
over there, he talks about something very weird that this
other teacher didn't talk about, ha, well, let me go
follow up on that little lead and see where it
takes me, oh, maybe it'll take me to a dead
end, may it'll just be a waste of time. Or
maybe it'll lead me to an even broader, deeper, more
interesting perspective. So you do that. And as you're doing
all this, everything is held as provisional. So your understanding
is like a building that's being constructed that will never
finish being constructed. It's always provisional, some stuff might be
taken out. You know, that thing I learned here a
year ago, that doesn't apply anymore. That thing I learned
five years ago. That's bullshit. Now, this thing I'm learning
today, okay, that's great. That's the most amazing thing I've
ever learned. But five years from now, might be bullshit.
So you hold everything as provisional. You don't cling to
anything. You don't have any favorites. Like, oh, but this
thing here that I learned from his teacher, you know,
I got to keep that this thing, I can't die
without it. Got to keep it for the rest of
my life. None of that. Also, you got to be
open to being very wrong. Which means that at any
point, somebody can come to you tell you something, and
you got to consider what they told you. And it's
like, yeah, you know what? This whole thing I've been
doing here? Maybe I was just deluded. Maybe I just
spent the last five years of my life going down
some path, which is leading to a dead end. And
then you got to realize that and say, okay, yeah,
that's fine. I knew that could happen from the very
beginning. Because I recognize that you know, what the original
position is that I don't know anything. If I don't
know anything as the original position. That means that I
don't know anything. I don't know where this is leading.
It's like I'm walking around in the wilderness. Not quite
sure where I'm going. But nevertheless, I'm still going somewhere.
So be open to being wrong, very wrong. Not just
on the surface wrong, but deep down wrong, like so
wrong. I want you to be so open to being
wrong, that maybe everything you learned about alignment is wrong.
Maybe there is no such thing as alignment at all.
Maybe it's just a ruse. Maybe it's just another delusion.
Maybe it's a dream within a dream within a dream
within a dream. Maybe How do you know? You don't
know you have to be open to being very raw.
But at the same time, you also have to have
a positive out Look, generally speaking, this positive outlook is
that understanding is possible that there is something larger that
you can understand about reality. And not just theoretically, but
it is going to be of practical value, you sort
of have to trust that it will be worth it
in the end. And how do you develop this trust?
Well, I don't know, I've kind of always had it.
I've always just assumed that the investigation is worthwhile, even
if it doesn't particularly yield the fruits that I hoped
it would. And you know, what, if I keep going
with the investigation, maybe they'll yield fruits that I never
even imagined possible in my wildest dreams. So you got
to have this generally positive outlook, because what I see
people doing committing this other mistake is that they say,
Well, yeah, Leo. So you're it sounds like you're saying
that all this stuff is just, it's impossible. There's all
these traps, and all this, all these mistakes that one
could make. So why not just not do any of
that. And my response to that is, no, you don't
have that option. Because by not making a choice, you've
made a choice, you've made the choice to do the
default position thing. And the default position thing is that
you're going to be just absorbing your paradigm from mainstream
reality. You don't have this option of not doing the
investigation, you're just going to be ignorant, you're going to
fall back into ignorance. That's all that's going to happen
if you don't do this investigation. So this notion that
oh, well leave, there's nothing to understand about reality. And
truth is an illusion. It's just a myth. All this
is pointless, just stop it, just stop it. No, if
you do that, you're gonna wind up in the worst
situation of all, that's the worst thing you can do
is to do nothing. And this sort of do nothing
is very different from their meditative Zen do nothing. The
meditative Zen do nothing is actually a very serious doing
something. That's a conscious do nothing. What you do when
you become this defeatist, and you say, Oh, well, all
this is just a, nobody really knows what the truth
is, and yada, yada, yada, that's a defeatist attitude. That
is not going to get you very far. That's the
worst of all. And that's, that's the majority of people.
That's what the majority people are doing. So if you
take that attitude, you will get what the majority of
people are getting, it's not gonna be very great. The
other thing you need to do, is to not become
loyal to anyone teaching. That's what makes this method different
from just picking some one spiritual tradition and just following
it through to the end. If you become loyal to
any one tradition, you will not develop the big picture,
I pretty much guarantee it, no matter how far you
go in that tradition, you will not because you will
become a loyalist of that tradition. And in fact, the
more results you gain from that tradition, the more loyal
you will become to what you seek, you will use
the fruits of your dedication and loyalty to one teaching.
And I'm not saying there won't be fruits, there will
be fruits, but you will use those fruits to become
a sectarian of that tradition. That's what you will do.
How else could it be? Because you haven't explored all
the other perspectives possible. Another thing you got to keep
in mind is that reality can be absurd, outrageous, irrational,
shocking and counterintuitive. This is something you have to be
open to, like really open to this possibility that everything
thought about reality could be turned upside down, that there
could be weird, shocking plot twists and reversals, that make
Fight Club looks like child's play. In this work, there
might be some days where you discover something so shocking,
that it leaves you speechless for a week. You got
to be open to that kind of thing. As you're
doing this investigation, that's a huge element. Because a lot
of people they limit themselves by saying like, well, if
it's absurd, then it's not worth investigating, and it can't
possibly be true. And if it's so outrageous, it can't
possibly be true. And if it's irrational, and it's not
logical can't possibly be true. And if it leads to
this weird paradox, it can't possibly be true, it's not
worth going any further down that direction. And that becomes
a huge barrier for discovering what's really true. And also,
don't worry too much about lack of utility in your
investigations, because another big trap is that people say well,
but I'm doing this investigation, but it's not it's not
like improving my life immediately. And it doesn't seem like
it's gonna like help me get more sex or it's
not gonna help me get more money. Leo, if this
got me more money than I I'll do it, but
it's not going to. So why should I do it?
You have to see the bigger picture, you have to
see that this is a game that's being played. With
a long time horizon. This is not something you do
for a year or two, this is something you do
for your whole life. You see, when your time horizon
is a year or two, yeah, you can't motivate yourself
to do this work. Because it's not going to yield
to more money. It's not going to lead to more
money, or more sex, or a bigger house, or a
better career in just a year or two. But it
will, if you do it for 1020 30 years, it
definitely will. The foundation of your life, when you start
to change that around, it takes a while for it
to percolate up to the surface of your life. See,
most people are concerned so much about the surface of
their life, that they neglect the foundation because they think
the foundation is disconnected from the surface. No, there's just
a delayed reaction might take you five years for the
real fruits of the foundation to percolate up to the
top. But when they do, your life will become amazing.
And people around you will be asking, like, what did
you do? What's your secret? What's your technique? What's the
magic pill. And inside, you'll kind of laugh and chuckle
because you'll be like, well, it wasn't a magic pill
or technique, it's not something you could have, like take
a shortcut to you can't do it in a week
took me five or 10 years to build a foundation
and to to cultivate and to nurture it to baby
it so that it becomes mature and that it ripens
in it fruits. And that's the kind of success that's
really solid, the kind of success that nobody can steal
from you. You don't lose it through bad luck or
having a bad economy or getting fired from your job
or something like that. That's really deep rock solid success
that's rooted in your being rooted in your being level,
it's who you are not some surface possession that you
have like a nice house, because you can always you
lose your nice house. Another element of this approach of
mine is emphasis on wisdom and growth. Versus just pleasant
theories, or even getting more money or something like that.
So I just said don't focus too much on the
utility of it. But also do don't lose the utility
aspect to the utility of it is important in the
sense that wisdom and growth need to be occurring. As
you're going through this process. This process is not slowly
increasing your wisdom and your growth and improving the quality
of your life. That's a good sign to reevaluate. Whatever
you're doing, you probably are doing this process wrong then
another element of this process is to do or to
use rather metal sources. What are metal sources, metal sources
are other people who have studied hundreds of perspectives and
hundreds of other sources. And now you're using them as
one of your sources. So a meta source or meta
perspective is already a perspective or a source that takes
into account many perspectives. It's already a holistic sort of
source. It's basically a source that's using this method that
I'm teaching you here. And it's been using it for
many years to develop a big picture. So you take
its big picture, and you now combine that with another
big picture from another meta source from another meta source
from a limited source, and you combine it into your
meta meta, big picture. So these are metal sources, so
you could use me as a metal source, because I
pulled from literally hundreds of sources. And I also pulled
from metal sources. So I'm pretty good metaphors. But you
can also find other metal sources. And you can find
that amount of metal sources. And then you can have
your own meta meta source. And the last thing that
you got to keep in mind with this approach is
that there's way more to reality than meets the eye.
There's way more to understand, there's way more to explain
the bigger picture, when you finally get it, it's going
to be much bigger than you ever imagined possible. And
it's always going to be in a state of adjustment
and construction. You're never going to have some monolithic big
picture, which is just like Okay, that's it. It's locked
in stone, here it is, here it is, let me
put it on my display case, it's not going to
be like that. It's going to be an ever evolving
process to the last breath you take in this life.
But it just might be more worthwhile and yield to
amazing results far beyond anything you imagined by just taking
some truth and putting it on your trophy display case.
So what I've shared with you here is sort of
my meta research approach This is my own personal philosophy,
and the principles that I follow to develop my own
big picture, to have my own insights about life and
then to share them with you. The value of developing
this bigger picture is indescribable. It's really tough to articulate,
I struggle to articulate it. Because there are subtleties that
I can only articulate to somebody who has gone through
this process, and who has studied hundreds of sources. And
since most people don't do that, because they're fucking lazy,
since they want to take the easy way out by
just sticking with one tradition. Or by just adopting beliefs
from their culture, or their family or whatever other trap
they want to fall into. Because they want to take
the easy way out. It's hard to communicate the subtleties.
But the subtleties are some of the most delicious facets
of life will come from this process. It'll be delicious.
on an intellectual level, it'll be very satisfying, fulfilling, but
it'll also be very practical, in that you will live
your life in this amazing way where people will look
at you and they'll say, Damn, there's something different about
that guy or that girl? Because the way they're living
their life, like that's so different. What is it about
that person? I wonder what their secret is. And your
secret will be so deep and so foundational, that you
won't even be able to explain it to them. Because,
look, it's taken over an hour. For me just to
gloss over this stuff. And I've just glossed over it,
you better believe that I could spend 10 hours on
this topic. And there will be still more that needs
to be said. Right? There's a lot, a lot to
what I'm talking about here. This is this is really
the foundation of personal growth right here. Even though it
doesn't seem like it even though it seems sort of
abstract. And maybe you're not sure exactly how to go
out and apply it tomorrow. This is the foundation. I
want to read you a quote, a metaphor that I
really love for how this process of big picture construction
works. It's a quote from Otto Neurath, who was a
philosopher and logical positivists, of about 100 years ago. And
here's what he wrote, quote, We are like sailors who
are on the open sea and must reconstruct their ship,
but are never able to start a fresh from the
bottom, where a beam is taken away, a new one
must be put in place at once. And for the
rest of the ship is used as support. In this
way, by using the old dreams and the driftwood, the
ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual
reconstruction. And quote. So what he's talking about here, is
he saying that this process of rearranging your web of
beliefs, is a recursive process. You can never take your
ship, you know, the ship here, you can never take
your rotten ship and just drag it ashore. The ship
is always at sea, there is no shore, there is
no foundation, there is no safe place, there is no
one assumption that you can make that's foolproof, and that
you never have to question or investigate. You start with
this rotten ship. And your object in life is to
construct a healthy, structurally sound ship. And so the way
you do that is by standing on one plank while
you're fixing the other. As you fix one plank, then
you get on the other plank and you fix the
one you were just standing on. And you keep doing
that by moving and fixing and fixing and fixing and
fixing and fixing and fixing. And through that process. You
will have a beautiful ship in the end. But you
can never take for granted that everything on your ship
is fixed. Because there might always be some sneaky little
plank somewhere there might be some termites and some corner
of the ship that you fail to take into account,
which might destroy everything. Right? So this means that you
always must be vigilant. You can never take any of
this for granted. And that your beliefs has to be
in constant and perpetual. Construction and this requires energy and
effort and vigilance for your entire life. And now the
question for you is will you see the value in
doing that? Can you envision that? Because you got to
have a long time horizon here. We're talking about the
whole rest of your life. Basically. Can you envision the
valley Are you this? Because you don't know what the
details of the value will be. You don't know specifically
what this will result in. But you can have an
intuition about that maybe this would be an unorthodox approach
to life that very few people take. And maybe this
will produce some extraordinary results. Maybe. And then you got
to ask yourself, Am I willing to commit and to
follow all these principles, and to watch myself like a
hawk to make sure that I follow through on it,
year after year after year, decade, after decade after decade?
And as something only you can answer for yourself? All
right. Now, let me address some objections here to everything
that I said. First objection is beliau. Won't doing all
this research lead to stuff like researching stupid things like
UFOs? And God knows what other kind of New Age
nonsense? My answer is, yes, it will. That is the
nature of research is that you don't know where research
might lead. So if you want to do a open
ended search, you can't know ahead of time, what's worthwhile
to investigate and what's not. Otherwise you run into catch
22. And it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy, you think
that's something isn't worth researching, you don't research it, and
therefore, you have prejudged it and you have no opportunity
to ever be corrected on that. Because you already think
that what you know, you know, when in fact, you
don't? So will this lead to you wasting your time
researching some stupid stuff? Sure. That's what research is research,
a lot of it is you wasting your time going
down dead ends. But that's okay. Because you're not going
to be lost down every dead end forever. And you
don't need to research every single thing on earth. Just
the things that are relevant to your big picture understanding.
So will you run into some dead ends? You certainly
will, you have to see the bigger picture of this
process. And you have to kind of trust that things
will gel in the end. And that your time, even
though might be wasted in the short term will not
be wasted in the long run long term. Right? That's
what a good researcher does is take that attitude. Another
objection you might have is beliau. Where do you draw
the line? I mean, you start talking about UFOs, and
conspiracy theories and this and that also the crazy stuff,
and where does it end? It sounds like I gotta
research for the rest of my life, all this stupid
shit. Most of its going to be false. So what
do I do? Well, the reality is that you don't
know where to draw the line. You don't. That's your
position, you were born and you don't know where to
draw the fucking line. If you knew where to draw
the lines, you'd be done. You'd know everything. But you
don't know everything. And you don't know where to draw
the lines. So like I said, you're going to have
to go down some dead ends, and just loosen your
requirement for this thing to be very efficient, highly efficient
process, where everything I do leads to some direct, immediate
financial result for me or something like that. It's not
going to work that way. So if you have that
kind of expectation, don't even bother. Don't even bother starting.
Another objection is, Billy, oh, isn't there a risk here
with this process of believing all sorts of silly, wacky
New Age things? Well, this risk is there, no matter
what. You might think that just by sticking with mainstream
culture, that you avoid the risk of believing silly things.
This is not true at all. The only difference is
that with mainstream culture, the silly things that you believe,
are bullies believe by everybody around you, so they don't
feel as silly, because you have the support of your
culture. But if you take a look through history, you
don't have to be a genius to see how many
silly things mainstream culture has believed. And you better believe
that today's mainstream culture still believes a lot of stupid
shit that's flat out false and very unhealthy and toxic
and damaging to to your life. So that this, this
risk of believing silly things, this can't be avoided. This
is the whole epistemic problem. This is why we're doing
epistemology in the first place is because we want to
minimize our believing of silly things. And so this process
that I outlined for you is the Best process that
I know of, at this point in my life, for
how to avoid this, it's your best chance. It's not
foolproof, you will still be tempted to fall into many
of the traps I talked about, even though I've glossed
them over here. Another objection might be what Leo? Isn't
what you're talking about relativism, the idea that there is
no truth and that everything is equally valid. No, not
at all. What I'm talking about is not relativism, because
even though I'm telling you to sample different perspectives, I
am not telling you to take all perspectives equally. And
to just come up with an average of all the
perspectives you sampled, that would not be correct. We're not
averaging perspectives, some perspectives you're gonna explore, you'll explore them
for a couple of months, or even a couple of
minutes. And you'll realize that it's, it's just wrong, it's
wrong. It's false. It's stupid. And so you'll make that
determination, you'll move forward. What I'm talking about is not
relativism, right, you will find that some perspectives are a
lot truer than others. And that is fine. Another objection
might be billy-o, why bother with all this? After all,
nobody really knows the truth. So is there a point.
And I believe I've addressed this already, in that there
is a point. But for somebody who has this objection
of why bother at all, it just seems like a
waste of time and energy, I could do much better
things with my time in this life than wasted reading
books and embodying different perspectives, and so forth. Well, it's
gonna be very difficult for me to convince you because
you're overlooking the subtleties. And the subtleties can be very
significant. Once they stack up. What I'm claiming is that
there will be a snowball effect that gets built every
year, the snowball gets bigger and bigger and bigger and
bigger as you do this work. And then the subtle
effects will have accumulated so much that your entire life
will transform, and you will look back on your life.
And you'll be like, Oh my god, I can't believe
that everybody isn't doing this. This was the best decision
I ever made, is to adopt this approach to my
life. But it's difficult to explain that to somebody who's
just like, oh, Leo, why bother doesn't seem practical, difficult
to convince that kind of person. Right? Because they have
such a myopic view of their life. And they just
want short term results. And that's generally why they won't
be successful. Because they, they keep running away from the
long view, in all the different things that they tried
to do in their life, whether it's business relationships, or
something else, you know, a person who has a short
term view of things was myopic, he's myopic, everywhere, not
just with epistemology, he's myopic, in relationships, and everywhere, and
that's why his life is shit. Generally speaking, another objection
might be billy-o, why not just pursue enlightenment? And let
that solve everything? Why pursue this big picture understanding and
taking all these perspectives? That's just all illusion? What's the
point of exploring all these different illusions, when we know
that enlightenment is the ultimate answer? Again, you don't know
that. You don't know that. You think that's the case.
But remember, the first position is that you know, nothing.
So all the stuff you've heard about enlightenment, even if
you've experienced a few glimpses of enlightenment, and all the
Masters you've read about, and you've got all these workshops,
and retreats, and this and this and that. You don't
know, you don't know. Enlightenment could just be another dream
within a dream with another dream to be another illusion
could be a scam. As far as you know, I'm
not saying it is I'm saying from your epistemic position.
You don't know. Until you become fully enlightened, you don't
know. And even after you become fully enlightened, you don't
know. You don't know. If there's more. You don't know
if there's some perspective you've missed. You don't know if
enlightenment is really the full spectrum. You don't know if
there's other practical things besides enlightenment, you don't know. You
will never know until you just get on this process
and you just follow this process. Right? You just don't
know. So be careful about that. You're playing with fire.
If there's one thing that enlightenment should have taught you.
And I'm not even talking about you becoming aligned, I'm
saying just if you learned about alignment, and now you
kind of are a believer in lightning, say like, Okay,
I know that alignment must be true, even though I
haven't experienced it yet. If you're there, wash out. Because
here's the law. so that a lot of people that
are there are missing. And the lesson is, if enlightenment
has taught you anything, it's that everything you thought before
could easily be wrong, and you won't know why it's
wrong or how it could possibly be that role. So,
there could be huge plot twists in life. That's basically
what you should learn from the existence of enlightenment. Now,
the mistake people make is they think, okay, so if
I just get in line that fixes everything. Not necessarily.
Keep in mind that there might be another huge plot
twist coming after enlightenment. You see that the meta lesson
that you learned from enlightenment, it's not to go become
enlightened. It's that you got to be really fucking careful
about what you believe, and how firmly you believe it.
And this notion, you have that okay, now I really
got it. Now I really figured it out. Because as
soon as you think you've figured it out, that's when
you can you've open yourself to the biggest epistemic blunder
possible. Now, it might seem as though I'm arrogant in
the way I talk about some of these topics. And
it might seem like well, Leo, you're talking about like,
being humble and not taking any positions on things and
being open to stuff and but then you come up
here, and you rant about this, and you rant about
that, and it seems like you're not following your own
advice. Actually, I'm extremely epistemic ly humble. But that's difficult
for people to see. Because that's not something that I
flaunt, make a distinction between one's manner, the way one
speaks, and acts and so forth, and what one actually
does, in how they pursue their understanding. So the thing
you don't see on the videos, and the thing that
I don't talk about that much, is how fucking careful
I am. In studying all these perspectives, and how vigilant
I am and watching myself like a hawk, knowing that
I am my own greatest enemy. I'm not worried about
my critics, and people leaving me stupid comments and stuff.
That's not what worries me deep down, what worries me
deep down inside is myself. And the trickery that I
know that I do below and the labyrinth of my
mind. I'm acutely aware of all that stuff. So aware
that I'm aware that there might be things I'm not
aware of. And this makes me very epistemic, epistemic ly
humble in practice, even though in outward appearance, I can
seem kind of arrogant, and maybe even sometimes you can
mistake this for me having a position or being ideological.
That's not what it really is. Right? It's very difficult
for me to communicate the epistemic humbleness, that I actually
embody, this is my greatest strength, I think, is that
I really am, I'm seriously willing to consider that I'm
rolling on anything. And I don't really care about defending
any position. What I care about is just seeing the
big picture. I care about the meta perspective. I care
about understanding. I care about growing my life in a
practical way. I care about getting extraordinary results. And even
with all these things, I'm still willing to evaluate and
question all of it. There's nothing about myself, or my
views of life that I'm not willing to question. Now
do I have certain assumptions that I'm working on, of
course, you have to, when you're building the boat in
the middle of the sea, you got to stand on
a plank. You can never land the boat on land.
Right? You're always standing on some plank and that plank
you're standing on might be rotten. And I'm very aware
of that. And what this does, is that this this
makes me extremely flexible. This makes me able to study
perspectives that I see very few people being able to
study. I've encountered quite a few enlightened people. And I
don't even see that these people have the kind of
open mindedness that I'm talking about here. I'm talking about
complete, complete open mindedness completely willing to question everything. This
I think is the safest epistemic foundation that one can
have in a world where there are no epistemic foundations.
So that's the paradox of it. Alright, that's it. I'm
done here, kind of a long episode because, boy, this
is a juicy topic. But I'm signing off, post me
your comments down below, please click the like button for
me, share this episode with a friend. And lastly, come
check out actualized. Org right here, this is my website,
and I have my newsletter there for free, you can
stay tuned with new content that I release, I will
be developing new forms of content in the future that
you might not find out about, if you're just watching
me on YouTube, for example. So the newsletter is the
best way to, to stay open to all the new
announcements, check out the forum there, check out my life
purpose course check out the book list. The book list
is a very powerful tool for you, if you want
to follow up on what I talked about here, you
should read at least half the books on my book
list, which is close to 100 books. Because I'm not
kidding, I do pull from hundreds or not just dozens
of sources, I literally pull from hundreds of sources. And
I feel like I'm only getting started. There are so
many sources I want to pull from, I don't have
enough time in the day to read, watch, listen and
study and integrate all of them. I need like a
whole team of researchers to do that, really. And that's,
that's mostly what I'm about these days, you know, I'm
not I'm not interested in coaching people one on one.
I'm mostly just interested in research. I love to do
research in this field of personal development, what are the
best techniques, methods and frameworks and concepts that we can
discover, to help people raise their consciousness. And so that's
what I feel like I'm doing more and more of
every single month is just diving more and more into
research. And I have a lot of really interesting resource
that I'm working on right now. It'll take a few
weeks or a few months for me to distill it
down and just start to share with it with you
here. So, you know, stick with me, because what you
will be getting here is you will really be getting
a meta meta meta perspective on what life is about,
and how to live it in an extraordinary and profound
manner. And some of the research I'll share with you
in the future will be mind blowing research. And if
you think you've heard everything you think you've heard all
the most interesting and fascinating and shocking things that Leo
is going to say no, there will be plot twists
and reversals and really weird oh my god mind blowing
shit that will come in the future. So you just
got to have faith and stick with me here because
reality is a lot weirder and vaster than you ever
imagined.
