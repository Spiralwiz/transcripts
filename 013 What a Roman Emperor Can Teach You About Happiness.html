            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/evCkUWCnNmY' target='_blank'>What a Roman Emperor Can Teach You About Happiness</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius</b>: The Meditations were written by Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius as a personal diary to remind him of his higher self, ideals, and principles. 
</li><li><b>Stoicism Philosophy</b>: Stoicism is a philosophy that emphasizes the importance of maintaining peace of mind by focusing on internal feelings and thoughts rather than external problems. 
</li><li><b>Consolation Function of Meditations</b>: Marcus used Meditations for two purposes  reconnecting with his higher self and seeking consolation when he was feeling down or disoriented. 
</li><li><b>Internal resolution of problems</b>: Aurelius' Stoic philosophy encourages people to find internal solutions to their problems rather than constantly seeking for peace in external things or situations. 
</li><li><b>Notable qualities of Marcus Aurelius</b>: Aurelius was admired for his equanimity, stability, and self-restraint which he developed through regular practice of Stoic principles and self-reflection, as outlined in Meditations.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation of Stoicism</b>: Stoicism is often misunderstood as lacking emotion or achievement-focused. In reality, it helps individuals achieve their goals and manage practical responsibilities while maintaining an internally focused and grounded mindset.
</li><li><b>Life of Marcus Aurelius</b>: As a Roman Emperor, Marcus Aurelius had numerous responsibilities including military campaigns, politics, and family. Despite these external pressures, he remained calm and true to his higher self through the principles of Stoicism. 
</li><li><b>Potential Negligence of Higher Self</b>: Constantly chasing after external rewards in life can undermine a person's higher values leading to neglect of the higher self. 
</li><li><b>Coping with Modern Society influences</b>: In modern society, societal influences and distractions can deter a person from his/her higher self or ideals. Marcus Aureilus' practices are helpful in getting back in touch with one's higher self.
</li><li><b>External pressures and distractions</b>: Certain societal values such as fame, success, and wealth are often shallow and can detract from a grounded, values-oriented mentality. By focusing too much on these external aspects, individuals may neglect their higher ideals.
</li><li><b>Reading and understanding 'Meditations'</b>: Leo suggests actually reading Marcus Aurelius' 'Meditations' to fully understand and appreciate the stoic mindset. The principals and ideas from this book can significantly differ from our regular thinking patterns and offer us new perspectives.
</li><li><b>Consideration of mortality and brevity of life</b>: 'Meditations' puts a significant emphasis on the concept of death, urging individuals to come to terms with their mortality. The insignificance and fleeting nature of our lives can be a worthwhile reminder to pursue meaningful and fulfilling experiences.
</li><li><b>Understanding and controlling desires</b>: Marcus also discusses understanding our desires and maintaining self-restraint. He encourages people to focus on expressing gratitude, finding peace amidst agitation, and handling pain, illness, or death with composure.
</li><li><b>Maintaining connection with higher self</b>: Even when in touch with our higher values and purpose, it is easy to be overwhelmed by life's everyday noise. Consistently reminding ourselves of our higher self and minimizing external distractions can help retain our connection with our higher ideals.
</li><li><b>Danger of forgetting higher purpose</b>: Forgetting to prioritize our higher goals is a common hindrance in personal development. One must consistently reflect on these goals and values, bringing them to the forefront of their thoughts regularly to ensure meaningful personal growth.
</li><li><b>Importance of conscious effort and awareness in changing habits</b>: Leo emphasizes that changing habits is a difficult task due to our tendency to operate on autopilot. As he explains, it requires conscious effort and awareness to break the routine and initiate changes. If a new activity, like going to the gym, is not kept at the forefront of our minds, there's a high chance of forgetting about it amidst other tasks.
</li><li><b>The challenge of subtler changes</b>: Leo notes that when it comes to subtle changes in behavior, there's an even greater chance of forgetting them, using his own attempts to improve eye contact as an illustration. Although eye contact seems like a trivial task, it becomes an unconscious pattern over time. So consciously changing this pattern demands consistent practice and remembrance.
</li><li><b>The role of memory in personal change</b>: As Leo elaborates, our short-term memory, or 'RAM', is limited. If it gets filled with other tasks and activities, our intended changes may get 'thrown out'. This implies a need for consistent and conscious focus on our goals and values. If we don't give them sufficient attention and priority, we might not achieve the desired change.
</li><li><b>Principle of daily recommitment</b>: Emphasizing on his views on Marcus Aurelius' 'Meditations', Leo asserts that it's insufficient to merely have a list of values or goals. Instead, they need to be brought into focus daily. This constant reminder and recommitment facilitate alignment with our higher-self and help make choices in line with our values and goals.
</li><li><b>The role of Stoicism in remembering our ideals and values</b>: Marcus Aurelius used meditations to counter the human tendency to forget important considerations. Similar to the Roman emperor, we can reinforce the values we aspire to live by through regular reflections, like meditating on honesty every morning. This brings our deeper values at the forefront and makes us live in alignment with them.
</li><li><b>Importance of sustained focus for achieving goals</b>: For achieving goals (like launching a new career or healthier lifestyle), our attention needs to be consistently focused on them, otherwise, we may lean towards the status quo.
</li><li><b>Significance of gratitude and remembering accomplishments</b>: Leo highlights Marcus Aurelius' practice of regularly reminding himself of what he already has in life and expressing gratitude for them. He asserts that unless we consciously remember our achievements, we risk taking them for granted. This means even the greatest success can go unappreciated without regular acknowledgement and gratitude.
</li><li><b>The Myth of Money and Fame Leading to Happiness</b>: Many individuals believe that mass accumulation of material possessions, fame, and success ultimately leads to happiness. This section emphasizes that there is no direct correlation between wealth and fame and one's level of happiness; instead, numerous cases suggest the opposite. Successful individuals, like musicians and actors, are cited as examples, many of whom often grapple with drug addiction and destructive behaviors, indicating that wealth and fame do not guarantee contentment.
</li><li><b>Appreciating the Present</b>: We often forget to appreciate our current status and blessings, remaining focused on what we dont possess or what we aspire to accomplish in the future. By comparing our lives with those less fortunate, for instance, people living in impoverished and dangerous countries, we can cultivate gratitude for what we already have.
</li><li><b>Marcus Aurelius' Perspective on Fame</b>: The Roman Emperor had a negative perspective on fame and material success, viewing them as superficial and temporary. The story of him hiring a servant to constantly remind him of his mortality and transience of his worldly achievements serves as an example of his humble and grounded mindset.
</li><li><b>The Practice of Gratitude</b>: Rather than aspiring for more, the essence of happiness lies in practicing gratitude consistently. It needs to be habitual - a mindset of appreciation for what is already there, instead of what could be.
</li><li><b>Creating Personal Meditations</b>: Leo Gura suggests creating personal meditations by penning down personal principles, goals, and values, and then revisiting them regularly. This practice helps in maintaining focus on one's higher self, leading a meaningful life, and making positive changes.
</li><li><b>Applying Principles in Times of Distress</b>: Having a concise list of personal values or principles serves as a powerful tool to redirect focus when upset or dwelling in negativity. Instead of wasting time on frivolous matters, aligning action with these principles contributes to a positive and fulfilling life. 
</li><li><b>Phase to Start Implementing Changes</b>: Realizing the shortness of life, and the limited time we have to accomplish our goals, should compel us to start making changes right away. That looming business idea or postponed diet - cultivating a mindset of the urgency of time supports in finally getting these plans into action. 
</li><li><b>Summary</b>: The key takeaway of this section is to understand that happiness doesn't derive from materialistic possessions or fame. It's important to appreciate what we have, practice gratitude, and focus on personally significant principles and values. Implementing these principles during times of negative emotions can enhance overall wellbeing and happiness. It's also important to remember the brevity of life and start making necessary changes immediately for a more fulfilled life.
