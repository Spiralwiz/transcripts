[Music] the nine stages of ego development part one this
is a two-part series maybe there might need to be
a third part but i hope to do it into
a two-part series on cognitive development how the human mind
evolves and grows so there's a certain sequence in which
this happens which we will be describing in much detail
in part one we're going to cover the pre-conventional and
conventional categories or stages of development and then in part
two we're going to be covering the post-conventional and the
trans-human stages of development really you need to stick around
for part two because part two is the most important
one this one this episode is just the setup it's
just the foundation because it would be weird to start
with part two because what we really need to talk
about are the post-conventional and the transhuman stages that's what's
most relevant to your development but still you will also
find much value in part one so stick around in
fact i should underscore that this is a foundational episode
these two episodes are going to be foundational this is
going to be like the uh the structure or a
certain model that we're going to be using in all
future work that we do on this channel so make
sure you watch this one and take it seriously this
can transform your life this is basically a road map
for the rest of your life for how your mind
is going to develop it's extremely significant so don't overlook
this this is basically me sharing with you another developmental
psychological model so there's a field of psychology called developmental
psychology which specifically creates models and studies how various aspects
of the human psyche evolve and develop over time i've
already shared a very elaborate model called spiral dynamics that
most of you should be familiar with if you're not
that's okay you don't need to be this is a
standalone model here that i'll be presenting and it's it's
from the work of a researcher by the name of
susan cook greuter so i want to give her a
lot of credit here in fact most of this episode
probably 90 percent of the content in this series is
going to be me just quoting her research paper to
you and the paper in particular here is called nine
levels of increasing embrace and ego development subtitle a full
spectrum theory of vertical growth and meaning making that's a
mouthful it doesn't tell you very much uh don't worry
though you'll get it all as we keep exploring these
different stages i highly recommend that you go download this
free research paper it's not overly technical like some research
papers are it's quite easy to read it's very illuminating
it's life transforming it's rather long for a research paper
it's 90 pages long but i recommend that you print
this out don't just have it on computer print it
out sit there with a highlighter and a pen underline
it as you're reading you will find golden nuggets and
hundreds of golden nuggets the way she articulates these stages
is incredible it's really a work of genius this paper
needs to be publicized and taught in all classrooms but
of course it's not nobody knows about it so that's
one of my functions here with actualize.org is to bring
you this amazing content that i find i'll have a
link down below or you can go click and uh
find this pdf so even if you watch this i
still highly recommend that you go download it and read
it to make sure that you extract every last golden
nugget that is there because i can't possibly do it
justice even in these multi-hour long videos that i shoot
this will be one of the most important papers that
you ever read in your life all right so let's
get into the basics of what she calls ego development
theory edt ego development theory this is an empirical scientific
model grounded in sentence completion tests so the way that
this model was developed by susan cook greuter is of
course she was also aware of other models within development
of psychology and she was sort of following in the
footsteps of other great researchers uh of course if you've
watched my spiral dynamics series then you're aware of claire
graves whose work was also based on a sort of
sentence completion tests or various kinds of interviews that he
did with with the with people and she did the
sort of the same thing so what she does basically
is create uh like a a sample of different sorts
of sentence completions she gives this out to various people
in different countries and then collects the data and then
goes through the data and categorizes it and sees what
are the commonality commonalities between different people and different answers
that they give can we make sense of what's really
going on there is a certain a certain order in
which people answer these questions how do they grow over
time and so forth so the first period of data
collection for this particular model was done between 1980 and
1998 but then there was a second phase happening in
the 2000s as well and maybe a third phase i
don't know um but you can see you know that's
like a a solid 20-year chunk of of data collection
if not more so there's there's nine levels of ego
development here it's important to stress that this is a
model every scientific model has its limits it's not going
to be absolutely accurate it's giving you a sort of
abstract idealized picture of what's going on of course in
practice the mind is so complex there's so many variables
happening in there that you can't possibly model all this
perfectly but still you'll be amazed at how accurate this
model can be for pegging yourself your family members and
other people that you know so what does this model
actually model it models how self-identity evolves over time and
by self-identity of course that's just another term for ego
and by ego what we really mean is the very
center of your entire life so if we ask you
what is the center of your life your entire life
what does it revolve around it revolves around what you
you that big fat ego sitting over there listening to
me making sense of the world the owner of your
life that's the ego that's your sense of identity now
most people they take this identity for granted and they
just assume well yeah of course yeah there's me that's
my ego i was born i'm gonna die and that's
just how it is but that's not just how it
is and furthermore there are levels of maturity and development
to this ego so one of the common mistakes that
is made within spiritual circles and spiritual teachings is that
even when they do acknowledge the ego and its problematic
aspects a lot of times it's it's too simplistic in
the other direction so the pendulum swings away from ego
to non-ego and so then we kind of get caught
up on this rat race of trying to eliminate the
ego kill the ego transcend the ego and ego is
bad and all of its functions are bad and uh
you know it doesn't even exist it's illusory why even
talk about the ego because it's just a fiction that's
how it's portrayed sometimes in spiritual circles and so you
might think well what's the point of even studying it
because it's all just [ __ ] it's all just
illusion uh well not quite there are levels of maturity
to an ego and in fact what most people need
is not ego transcendence we'll get there that's going to
be some of the later stages of this model we'll
get to ego transcendence but that's uh you know that's
a very advanced thing for maybe one percent or two
percent of the human population for the rest mostly what
they're in need of in search of is just ego
development and ego maturity and so that's what most of
this model will be explaining you see there's a it's
not just a binary of you have an ego or
you don't have an ego it's a question of more
of like what what kind of ego do you have
how sophisticated is it how nuanced is it how reactive
is it how dense is it so you could kind
of measure the ego in terms of its density in
terms of its sophistication and so forth and so this
model is explaining the various levels of sophistication of the
human mind and psyche as it tries to understand reality
because that's a big function of what your ego is
doing your ego is not just you sitting back and
experiencing life enjoying itself your ego is the thing which
is bringing together and making sense of this field of
phenomenon and experience that you are encountering all the events
and people and things all the different beliefs and ideas
that you're learning over your lifetime what is making sense
of that into some sort of cohesive narrative that's the
ego and how it makes sense of that this varies
quite a lot a lot more than people recognize which
is why this model is so powerful and so helpful
is that it shows you the different ways in which
the ego can understand reality so sometimes as i've talked
about with the model of spiral dynamics and with ken
wilbur's models integral theory uh we talk about different developmental
lines we talk about the cognitive line we talk about
developing your relationships how how mature are you in your
relationships maybe in your sexuality maybe in your uh in
your language how you're using your language maybe in your
emotions there's a moral developmental line so various kinds of
lines this model here is is primarily concerned with cognitive
and mental development although it does also touch upon certain
other lines because usually when you're developing yourself along one
of these lines the other ones come along for the
journey although not perfectly so you can be more evolved
on certain lines than on others so just keep that
in mind but mostly we're talking about mental and cognitive
development here so one of the core things that's being
modeled here is the mind's ability to take perspective at
greater and greater levels it's an increased sophistication and capacity
in perspective taking the higher you go the more developed
you are the higher your perspectives can be the more
inclusive they can be and the lower you are the
narrower your perspectives are it's also modeling how the mind
relates to reality how the mind interprets reality these are
all factors that many people never even think about as
they go about living their life that you can relate
to reality in different ways you can interpret in different
ways very different ways that lead to an entirely different
way of living life and so if you want to
really transform your experience of life what needs to happen
is that you need to transform how your mind relates
to reality thinks about reality interprets reality makes sense and
meaning out of reality so here's the first quote that
i'll give you from susan cook greuter each level of
stage represents a distinct qualitatively different uniquely defined and increasingly
complex view of self and reality a new reality for
the subject a new way of identifying as a self
and a new understanding and relationship of the world end
quote uh so what does it mean to go up
a level on this model it means the following quote
the whole previous meaning system is transformed and restructured into
a new and more expansive and inclusive self-theory and theory
of the world end quote so one of the most
important functions of the ego is meaning making and we'll
be referring to this notion over and over again throughout
these two episodes meaning making how do you make meaning
out of the world because inherently the world has no
meaning it's the ego's job to create that meaning and
as it does so it can do it in a
in a wide variety of ways leading to all sorts
of different outcomes and different ways of relating to reality
so the ego is constantly engaged in this battle of
sense making and there's not just one way to do
it interpretations can become increasingly more sophisticated so it's not
merely that you can have one set of beliefs or
a different set of beliefs so here we're not concerned
with the content of the mind you might say something
like oh yeah of course christians look at the world
one way and muslims look at the world a different
way because they read different holy books and you know
they believe in different teachers or different teachings and principles
and so forth but that's not really what we're interested
in here we're not that all of that i would
call content rather what we're interested in more of is
structure the structure of how your mind thinks of the
world in a certain sense the structure of how a
christian and a fundamentalist muslim look at the world is
very similar even though their content can be contradictory or
different the structure is still the same the structure is
still ideological fundamentalist and so forth you see if you
want to understand that distinction between content and structure in
more detail see my episode an advanced very important episode
that i shot called content versus structure where i go
into a lot of detail explaining that distinction very powerful
episode so here we're looking at the structures of the
mind not the content of the mind we don't care
about any particular belief we care about what the mind
is doing how self-aware is the mind of its own
mechanisms so to speak we also see the ego as
a storyteller and the ego as an integrator of all
aspects of experience because your experience of life is not
this disjointed collection of events and things it seems and
it feels like one cohesive stream of consciousness so the
ego is is what's responsible for holding that together here's
another quote from susan cook reuter on this topic she
says quote our own strongly held values have to be
renegotiated when we enter a new view of reality in
the extreme we can say that with each transformation we
are actually entering a new reality with its own rules
laws and language for this reason the relationship to almost
any concept can be shown to differ along the developmental
path a person's understanding of power feedback time love integrity
and truth for instance all of these things change with
increasing development all right so that's the setup now let's
talk about these stages so here are the stages there
are nine of them and they have various labels and
we're going to break them down into into three categories
basically the pre-conventional the conventional and the post-conventional then if
you want you can add a fourth category at the
end called the transhuman or the transcendent category although sometimes
i will lump that transcendent in with the post conventional
so the pre-conventional includes three stages one is called symbiotic
the next is called impulsive and the next is called
opportunistic now the pre-conventional stages within the u.s is about
five percent of the population adult population now keep in
mind as i'm giving you some of these percentages i'm
taking these directly from susan cook reuters research and the
percentages of course vary depending on which country you sample
the united states is a relatively advanced developed country so
of course you should expect more percentages towards the higher
stages if you're coming from a country like india china
africa somewhere in africa or in south america in these
places of course you're going to have much larger percentages
of the lower stages so just keep that in mind
and in fact you have to be very careful with
how you sample this stuff because there can be sampling
biases you know like if you're going to go sample
college kids in america yeah you're going to get an
elevated overly elevated picture of the stages because just there's
a bias you know there's a sampling bias just in
the fact that you're a college student already you have
to jump through many hurdles to get there you're going
to already have to be at a relatively high stage
just to be admitted into college whereas if you go
and you sample people in in some ghetto or in
the hood somewhere some impoverished region of america yeah you're
going to get a lot more of the pre-conventional stages
then the the second category is the conventional stages this
is the bulk of what most people are in the
world and in in most developed countries and even in
in many underdeveloped countries a lot of people fall into
the conventional category here we have the conformist the expert
and the achiever so the conventional category comprises about 75
to 80 percent of the adult u.s population and this
is what most people take as sort of the baseline
they assume that because this is how they were raised
this was probably the kind of environment they went to
for school for church for university if they went to
university or at their job or their family and friends
and colleagues that they surround themselves with they just sort
of assume that conventional thinking the conventional stage of development
or category of stages of development that this is basically
sort of what defines the parameters of of the human
mind of what is considered normal of what is considered
possible most people don't think that anything beyond the conventional
stages is even possible so it's rare to even encounter
the possibility of post-conventional stages which we'll be talking about
in part two okay so this kind of creates a
sort of a false sense of reality you can really
get stuck in the conventional area because when 80 percent
of adults around you are like this you don't know
any better and anyone who's below you you're going to
think they're crazy or stupid and anyone who's above you
it's going to be so rare that you're going to
think that they're kind of woo or far out there
and you're probably not going to interact with them very
much because you're just hanging around in a different circle
with with friends who are at the conventional level but
then you can get into the post-conventional which comprises about
15 to 20 percent of the us adult population and
here we have the pluralist stage followed by the autonomous
slash strategist stage followed by the construct aware slash ego
aware slash magician stage now some of these stages have
multiple names and labels so just kind of bear with
that i know it can be a little bit confusing
sometimes and then finally we have the transcendent category which
has the unitive stage this is very rare even in
the u.s it's less than one percent of the adult
population the unit of stage is about half a percent
in susan cook greuter's assessments and i would probably put
it as maybe even rarer than that if you really
go out there and take a full sample of the
entire adult population and you don't specifically take college students
or people living in in major urban areas and so
forth so now we're going to be talking about what
each of these stages are that's the bulk of of
our work here is to explain all these because these
are just labels don't mean anything to you unless we
explain them in detail now i want to warn you
you're going to start to want to match up these
stages with those of spiral dynamics if you've already studied
that model which most of you probably have if you
haven't heard of spiral dynamics at all yet that's great
uh you'll take this in with fresh eyes so to
speak and fresh ears but those of you who know
spiral dynamics i encourage you here now to be a
little bit more sophisticated in your thinking and not just
to simplistically try to match colors from spiral dynamics with
these different labels here because even though you're going to
see a lot of similarity i want you to kind
of get in the frame of mind of being able
to look at the world through different models and different
lenses at different times so you can put on your
spiral dynamics lenses and look at the world that way
then you can take those off and you can put
on a different set of lenses and you will see
different things that's one of the things that a most
more advanced mind can do is that it can do
that whereas a less developed mind only looks at the
world through one set of glasses one set of lenses
and it can't take them off to put on and
try on another one right so be careful conflating spiral
dynamics with this model here they should stand on their
own and then later after you're done studying this model
then you can start to make comparisons and and so
forth but at this point i would resist um i
would resist making direct comparisons until you take all this
in with fresh eyes for the next hour or two
as you're watching these episodes in this series just forget
that you ever learned about spiral dynamics take this all
in freshly and i guarantee you that you will learn
additional things this will enrichen your understanding of spiral dynamics
all right so let's get into these stages stage one
is called symbiotic this stage there's not much to say
about it it's extremely primitive this is basically what is
found in infants who are just you know under a
few years old this is a stage in which the
ego hasn't even developed yet because when you start out
life you don't start off life as an ego you
start out life as just this undifferentiated massive phenomenon and
it has to be made sense of and that process
takes a few years to start to get going language
has to come online you have to start to think
you have to start to recognize distinctions and draw literally
invent distinctions between self other and world so at the
symbiotic stage there's a very primitive sense of self other
and world a baby basically doesn't know the difference between
itself the world and others it takes months and years
for it to develop those capacities and abilities uh sometimes
people just think that oh well a baby is born
a baby has a son self no it doesn't another
problem here is that some spiritual people will make the
mistake of thinking like oh well a baby is enlightened
a baby is born enlightened no it isn't a baby
is not born with any sense of self a baby
doesn't know that it's god a baby is not in
some you know super state of high consciousness uh a
baby is basically like an animal it's it hasn't even
differentiated its sense of self yet out from the world
so this can make it appear as though it's enlightened
but it's not really enlightened yeah sure it's it's very
present it's in the moment it doesn't have a very
deep sense of history and time and it's not very
you know the mind isn't loaded with a bunch of
baggage and beliefs and stuff that's good in that sense
it's a little bit closer to enlightenment we might say
because enlightenment kind of takes you to a state of
going beyond the mind but you shouldn't confuse uh this
symbiotic stage with the unitive stage which is going to
be the final stage of this whole model so they're
vastly vastly different so at this symbiotic stage the mind
and the the individual is completely dependent on parents and
culture it can't survive without them it's absorbing and rapidly
learning from the culture it's not able to evaluate what
it's learning from the culture or what the parents are
teaching it so if the parents are teaching it some
kind of nonsense it'll just completely accept it as the
truth it doesn't have any kind of discernment ability and
so here indoctrination starts happening immediately as the baby is
born and it starts to learn it goes to kindergarten
and so forth it starts to interact with parents it's
quickly adopting the mental categories of its culture and its
parents and whoever it's hanging around with and it's not
questioning any of those it's just struggling to learn language
struggling to make sense of the world struggling to make
sense of of conceptual distinctions between self other and world
and it's a struggle to define oneself and individuate oneself
from one's environment so that's all we'll say about the
symbiotic stage it's uh it's not really something that's prevalent
in adults this is this is not even in kids
really we're talking about babies here the second stage is
the impulsive stage this is uh this is more about
where toddlers are found maybe kids that are between five
and ten years old something like that this is a
sensory motor stage where the kid is running around and
trying to make sense of the world through uh sensation
and movement by grabbing things feeling things playing with things
interacting with the environment and trying to make sense of
how stuff works this is the stage at which you
have your earliest memories probably of being born and being
alive you have a sense of rudimentary sense of self
of being human you have a rudimentary sense of time
you're just beginning to make sense of time and you
have a very crude sense of of history but that
this is all coming online very quickly and of course
you're absorbing so much from your culture again without critically
analyzing any of it so you have to be careful
that whatever you absorb from your culture at this stage
it's going to form the foundation or the operating system
of your mind for the rest of your life here
the mind thinks in crude dichotomies things are good or
bad clean or dirty people are nice or mean simple
stuff like that the mind here doesn't have many ways
to deal with setback it's still totally dependent on others
for its survival you're governed by trying to fulfill basic
needs learning how to follow basic basic rules of the
human world uh there's little recourse other than crying screaming
and withdrawing it's easy for the mind at this stage
to get overwhelmed and to feel abandoned and so at
this point the mind is still extremely fragile um if
this toddler is in a difficult situation where there's screaming
and fighting and suffering and abuse this mind this psyche
will get very screwed up it will develop severe dysfunctions
because it doesn't have any kind of sophisticated way of
dealing or coping with these sorts of adult problems we
might say so at this point you know this is
why kids and toddlers are treated like kids and toddlers
we don't tell them all the truths of reality you
know war and and rape and murder and terrorism you
know we don't talk about these things to toddlers for
this reason because they don't have the capacity to really
understand and make sense of these things and it would
be too shocking and uh probably traumatizing uh for such
a mind to you know come to grapple with such
things so this is um this is again a stage
that mostly you find toddlers in kids not adults other
people at this stage are seen as objects to gratify
one's needs not as people who have their own needs
so of course toddlers and kids they tend to be
very very selfish in the sense that they're they're not
considerate of the agendas of other people they're only acting
out their own agenda the self here is still not
fully differentiated out there's a constant and vague sense of
threat and insecurity which is why you know the child
runs to mommy or daddy when something scares him or
something freaks her out there can be adults at this
stage but if they are here they probably have severe
mental handicaps or deficiencies maybe genetic disorders or injuries head
injuries that they suffered in their life so basically adults
at this stage need the guidance of guardians and adult
supervision in order to survive because they can't they won't
be able to make it on their own and that's
it for that stage next we have the opportunist now
this is the first stage where you find a significant
number of adults especially in less developed parts of the
world the opportunist here the mind makes use of magical
thinking to make sense of the world at this stage
individuals are quite what we might call uncivilized arguments and
logic are useless here because the mind isn't capable of
those things the mind is very impulsive the mind is
very instinctual it's still uh very animal-like and very very
self-centered in the sense that it doesn't take into account
the needs and suffering of others that's something that only
comes online in later stages of development the mind here
is not capable of insight into itself or others in
any psychological sense so not only does it not make
sense of others psyches it doesn't make sense of its
own psyche it just acts out without self-reflection at all
there is an awareness now of how to manipulate others
to get one's basic physical needs met and basic crude
emotional needs uh there's an awareness of one's own size
and strength which can be used for intimidation if one
feels strong enough to intimidate others to get what one
wants or if you size up others and you see
that they're bigger than you stronger than you and more
intimidating than you then you're aware of that you can
you can see that and then you will you know
you will adopt various kinds of defenses and other strategies
to to avoid getting overrun by those people life is
seen here as a zero-sum game if i win you
lose if if i lose you win people at this
opportunist stage are people of action not thought or planning
so a lot of times they will act in ways
that we as from a higher elevation from a higher
stage would consider as irresponsible or irrational or impulsive and
we might wonder like how could you do something so
stupid but to them they don't think very far into
the future they're just thinking about right now thinking about
the next hour the next day and they're not thinking
about weeks and months into the future what the consequences
of their action are so there's not a lot of
planning in their life they're just kind of like flying
by the seeds of their pants and oftentimes this gets
them into a lot of trouble because they can for
example get involved with hard drugs without thinking about the
consequences of what that will do and how that will
you know destroy their brain chemistry or how that will
ruin their career or job opportunities or how that might
get them in jail or whatever there's a sense of
self as having two sides uh a real inner self
which is me and then there's a false sense or
front that i put out there for others to shield
myself and to be able to manipulate others so this
kind of duality is created and so there can be
manipulation and lying and dishonesty on that on the fake
front for the sake of getting what the real inner
self wants but of course this leads to problematic consequences
down the road because now there's this kind of split
in the psyche between the the mask one wears and
then one's real true self at this stage rules are
recognized social rules but are mostly followed only for immediate
advantage or to avoid punishment at this stage one is
socially invested in the concrete visible world of things that
one can own so it's kind of like can i
own it can i feel it can i display it
otherwise it doesn't have much value to me at this
stage self-respect is equivalent to my ability to control others
so if i can control and manipulate others then i
can respect myself and if i can't then i don't
respect myself i feel like i'm inadequate at this stage
others are always to blame never oneself because i can't
see how my own mind is creating many of the
problems that i'm causing at this stage one is prone
to anger when frustrated and the anger tends to be
loud and projected outward so at this stage there's not
a lot of suppressing of emotions the emotions are kind
of worn on the person's sleeve and that they can
lash out and uh in this way they don't really
fit in sometimes with society with polite society and they
can be seen as sort of barbaric or uncivilized because
they're just acting out they haven't learned how to control
themselves and how to calm themselves down and how to
conform to the expectations of of polite society so to
speak that happens at the next stage at this stage
actions are only bad if one is caught or punished
there's a shamelessness and a lack of guilt at this
stage because one is just acting out one's impulses and
like an animal an animal doesn't have much shame or
guilt like when a dog craps on the carpet it
doesn't really have a sense that it did something wrong
because it hasn't gone through a sort of a civilizing
process that uh that humans need to go through and
so hasn't yet this stage so this stage shows little
remorse when it is caught and if it is caught
it tends to blame others for its own shortcomings and
it does this as a way to protect itself because
if i have to take responsibility for my own impulses
and behaviors this is a burden in a sense you
can see for the vine this is a burden it's
much easier just to take a crap wherever you want
spit wherever you want say whatever you want emote however
you want without following any rules you see that's sort
of an easy way to live most animals live this
way it's a little bit harder to now take responsibility
for those actions sort of take consideration of other people's
needs and feelings and to start to see you know
what the problem might be of uh you know taking
a [ __ ] in the middle of your classroom
uh and you might be surprised that well how could
someone need to develop their mind in order to understand
that isn't that obvious that taking a [ __ ]
in the middle of the classroom is is bad and
the answer is no that's not obvious that's obvious to
you because you've already grown through these stages and you
take them for granted but it's not obvious for many
people in fact i've heard anecdotal stories of how in
china they have this problem i think i heard this
from joe rogan so i don't know how credible this
is but in china supposedly they have this problem where
you know over the last 50 or 60 or 70
years china has gone through a rapid development where a
lot of people who were just like millions of people
tens of millions of people were living in poverty just
as basic uneducated illiterate farmers and now you know through
rapid industrialization they've lifted millions out of poverty some of
them have become uh you know reasonably successful and wealthy
but in a sense they're not they're not fully civilized
in a sense because they have this problem in china
where uh they will have people just take a [
__ ] in the middle of a shopping mall promenade
they have like apparently videos of this where rare than
going to the toilet there's a toilet right there you
know most malls have toilets and restroom signs but some
of these chinese are so uncivilized and so impulsive probably
because they're at this stage of development that they don't
really respond to that so the idea of actually following
the the you know the toilet signs to go and
go through the hassle of actually going to the toilet
rather than just taking a [ __ ] right where
i am right now because i want to to them
that's an inconvenience they would rather just take a [
__ ] and so apparently they do so just goes
to show you that this stuff is not just theory
you you find examples of it in real life it
helps to explain how that is possible see when you
know when most people see an example like that they
can't make sense of it because they don't have these
models to understand the lower stages and then also they
can't explain the higher stages as well when they see
higher stage individuals so at this stage the individual tends
to create a lot of hurt feelings in others of
course because they don't really care they're too selfish to
care or to even understand what they're doing they don't
see the collateral damage they cause relationships at this stage
tend to be very volatile uh very immature very childish
and they easily blow up and you can get into
a relationship the relationship could be very passionate it could
last for a month or two or for a year
and it and then it just blows up and it
continues to blow up and blow up no matter which
relationships you get into because there's a fundamental lack of
responsibility taking for one's own emotions and behaviors in this
relationship the other one is always to blame and so
you get these uh kind of dysfunctional abusive highly codependent
toxic relationships at this stage especially if both people are
at this level or oftentimes what happens is that the
woman for example could be one level above but the
guy she's dating or marrying is one level below at
this opportunist stage and then she can't make sense of
why this guy's abusing her and being an [ __
] and doing this criminal activity and so forth you
know she's trying to to reason with him and because
she's at a one stage above and she's beyond this
but he isn't uh but but she's she's too attracted
to him and she's too in love with him and
she cares about him too much uh and you know
that's what creates sort of a classic abusive relationship that
many women fall into at this stage there's little reflection
on one's own emotions one is acting out emotions rather
than introspecting about them or labeling them so one can
be angry but not even really be aware of one's
anger for example at this stage things are unpredictable unreasonable
manipulative and exploitative those are the kind of tendencies of
these people success can be achieved from this stage in
business so it's not uh it's not like this kind
of person cannot be successful in the world this person
can be successful especially though when business is about opportunism
and you love unilateral power when opportunism opportunism and unilateral
power is rewarded that's where these people can really excel
and do quite well for themselves and oftentimes the business
here will be shady business illegal business scamming con artistry
theft ponzi schemes this this kind of business it's not
like a very conscious way of doing business it's business
as exploitation to get what i want if i can
fleece my customers what's the problem i'm going to get
more money and then i can use that money to
go buy drugs or have more sex or whatever buy
a boat that sort of thinking showing weakness at this
stage is seen as dangerous so there can be sort
of a posturing going on to avoid showing weakness there
can be a sense as follows that the more others
know about me the more they can take advantage of
me so one is sort of trying to hide one's
true self from others so that it doesn't get taken
advantage of morality at this stage is oftentimes non-existent it
just doesn't compute for the mind because for morality to
come online that that's further stages that are able to
take the perspectives of other people which this stage cannot
do there's a lot of black and white thinking here
the problem solving style of this stage you know if
you come to this person with your problems the person
will just say something like that's your problem not my
problem problem solved because there's only a problem if it's
a problem for me if there's a problem for you
that's your problem not my so there's not a lot
of empathy going on here these people are not going
to saw help you really to solve your problems they
only care about themselves the defense mechanisms at this stage
are blaming lots of blaming distortions to minimize one's own
anxiety fantasy acting out projection and twisting the truth around
to basically suit one's own self maybe you know some
of these types of people who just they don't have
a concept of truth to them the truth is just
whatever is going to help them to survive that is
what's common here there's a preoccupation with domination gaining control
and advantage and deceptive maneuvers these people tend to be
self-protective bull-headed have tunnel vision and are constantly blowing up
and blaming others for their own blow-ups there's a showing
of prejudice these people polarize arguments rather than trying to
find common ground and they try to exploit others weaknesses
because they don't see a problem with that from their
point of view the language style of these sorts of
opportunist people is often to use physical words simple straightforward
language for non-physical concepts so they're not able to really
do a lot of complex sophisticated abstract thinking they try
to deal with the world at a material gross level
negative emotions are expressed loudly and unabashedly and basically this
mind is concerned with its own little concrete world which
now takes us out of the pre-conventional into the conventional
category so those were the three pre-conventional stages now we're
getting into the conventional and here the first stage is
called the conformist or the diplomat and here what's going
on is the ego mind is moving beyond the previous
opportunist stage and it's discovering a new we space the
space of us as a group as a community now
i am part of a community and now it's not
just about my own needs being met but also about
fitting in and playing by the rules so here the
ego wants to play by the rules and so it
goes all the way swings his pendulum all the way
towards group centered thinking and the groups here are only
of two types it's very simple it's very crude there's
an in-group and there's an out group us and them
there's my family my tribe my team my group my
nation my party my company and then there's everybody else
who's different and who's wrong and who's stupid and who's
evil everything fits into these two simple categories there's a
confused boundary between self and the in group so if
i'm for example a muslim fundamentalist muslim at this conformist
stage i'm completely bought into islam and there's not much
of a distinction made between myself my own identity and
islam as a belief system or as a philosophy that
distinction isn't made so when someone criticizes islam or the
prophet muhammad or whatever i take that very personally because
that feels like an attack on me you're attacking my
tribe you're attacking my team you're attacking my religion you're
attacking me because there is no distinction between like well
i'm an individual and i happen to subscribe to the
philosophy of islam which is a philosophy and there can
be different kinds different interpretations of it no i am
islam my version of islam is the only version of
islam that's how the mind thinks at this conformist stage
being part of a group offers protection and a share
of its power but the price to pay is for
this inclusion is loyalty and obedience so at this stage
uh there's a lot of loyalty and obedience going on
there is a deep fear of ostracism and being shunned
because it's important to fit into the group without which
survival could be severely hampered you might remember going through
this stage as a child when you were in elementary
school i remember i did in the sense that i
really cared a lot about fitting in about being perceived
as normal about not being shunned being part of the
cool kids that sort of stuff so many children and
teens all up through high school and maybe even college
they go through this stage when they start to you
know hang out in groups it becomes important what your
friends think of you everything gets filtered through your friends
you're not thinking independently you're not trying to be a
unique individual you're trying to you know do what your
friends are doing and then what your friends are doing
are probably what other people are doing in the media
or the music you listen to you know whatever the
rappers are doing whatever's cool on tv whatever is hip
in the culture it's it's a very conformist stage and
one's identity becomes about that what kind of music do
you listen do you listen to the cool music or
the lame music do you watch the cool movies or
the lame movies are you a dork or are you
one of the cool kids and this is this sort
of thing and then your survival becomes all about that
and if you if you fail to integrate this stage
properly then you're going to feel like a loner you're
going to feel left out you're not going to be
able to socialize very well this stage accepts norms without
introspection or questioning this stage is very sheep-like so when
people talk about sheeple this is what they mean this
conformance stage this is the sheeple stage there is a
relishing in group dependency the world is divided into simple
external absolute categories of people and things uh people are
either perceived as your allies or your enemies in this
sort of binary sense there's not a lot of gray
it's very black and white thinking still here at this
stage these people feel honored to be part of a
group with high status and so there's a lot of
energy put into gaining more and more status becoming cooler
rising up the ladder up the hierarchy it's a very
hierarchical system there's a sense of being part of the
special chosen few the in-group which is of course superior
to everybody else from the perspective of this group this
gives the ego a sense of love and acceptance and
approval so now the ego's love is not just coming
from its mother and its father it's coming from its
peer group as well in fact this becomes an overriding
more important source of love and then that's why there
can be sort of a rebellion against the parents and
so forth there's a sense that our group's truth is
the only truth and the ultimate truth and everybody else
is doomed or evil and the reason that there is
this sense is because you have to understand that at
this level of cognitive development the mind is unable to
take the perspectives of other groups there's not a sense
of like well there are christians who have one perspective
on the world there are muslims who have another perspective
on the world then there are atheists who have a
third perspective on the world there are agnostics who have
a fourth perspective on the world and all of them
have their pros and cons like no there is yes
there's all those other groups at this stage you can
see those other groups but you only look at the
world from your own perspective you can't truly see what
it means to be a muslim if you're a christian
or what it means to be a christian if you're
a muslim at this stage you're completely locked into the
paradigm of whatever you were indoctrinated with by your group
and your culture and your society so there's no ability
to step outside of your group's perspective and because of
this how does one explain the existence of all these
other groups who have very different perspectives different beliefs different
value systems and different behaviors you explain it as them
being evil and them being wrong so for example if
a fundamentalist christian travels to india and tries to study
the different hindu traditions and religions and culture they're not
going to get very far because they're always going to
be looking at them from within their christian framework they're
not going to be able to step outside of christianity
and look at various hindu deities and traditions and practices
in its own right on its own terms there's no
sense of relativity here at this stage it's very absolutistic
and so when a christian or a westerner you know
goes to india and looks at these hindus they will
see them as uncivilized as barbaric as being you know
into witchcraft and sorcery and hedonism and worshiping false idols
and this sort of stuff because that's what it looks
like from within the christian paradigm now of course christianity
is not only limited to this stage christianity can be
much more advanced much more sophisticated but we're just talking
about fundamentalist religion here basically any fundamentalist religion falls into
this stage and the kind of spirituality that happens at
this stage is very material so these fundamentalists even though
it might seem like they're spiritual in a certain sense
they're not very spiritual because their spirituality is highly material
when they think about heaven or hell they're thinking about
physical material places that one goes to heaven is filled
with mountains of gold and uh sexy virgins and fast
cars and god is a is going to be sitting
there he's an actual man sitting on a gold throne
with diamonds wearing a crown holding a scepter with a
big beard and he and he you know he looks
exactly the way that i imagine he does he's a
human he will talk to me and you know tell
me that i've been good and that i followed his
rules that's the kind of sense then hell hell is
a literal place that you go to the devil satan
is actually real he's got horns he's colored red he's
got a pointy tail and literally in hell uh you
will be you know burned with fire and all sorts
of stuff like that it's material there's no sense of
possibility for this kind of mind that maybe heaven when
jesus was talking about heaven he wasn't talking about a
physical place you go to maybe jesus was using that
as a metaphor for a internal state of mind no
no this doesn't compute at this stage nor does hell
compute as an internal state of mind maybe what hell
is is your egoic style of existence again that doesn't
compute at this stage because everything is taken literally rather
than metaphorically this is why this stage easily confuses many
advanced spiritual teachings and it sort of brings them down
to a very crude gross material level and here spirituality
can even involve ideas like earning lots of money so
some christians and these these prosperity gospel preachers you know
they will they will talk about how earning lots of
money is really god's sign that you are the chosen
one that's how they justify their their chasing of money
at this stage the mind cannot understand that other groups
hold absolute beliefs as well and if you have a
bunch of different groups all holding absolute beliefs how do
you know that your group has the right one what
are the chances the chances are pretty low if you
think about it just probabilistically this doesn't compute for the
mind yet the mind at this stage cannot distinguish between
belief and reality belief is taken as reality there's no
distinction between belief and experience either there's no sense of
recognition that beliefs can be wrong the idea that you
can fervently believe something but that then it is wrong
just that notion doesn't really compute at this stage if
i believe it how can it be wrong that's how
the mind thinks here the mind at this stage tries
to uphold tradition and avoid rocking the boat in order
to fit in feedback here is experienced as an attack
as critique of wrongdoing so these kinds of minds are
not good at taking feedback sort of constructive criticism they
will take it personally as them not fitting in well
enough the mind here does not have a strong personal
opinion to express about things because it's so preoccupied with
fitting in it doesn't evaluate things independently it doesn't really
have its own independent moral system or a set of
principles by which it operates in the world it just
moves with the herd and its notion of what is
right and good is whatever the herd is doing there
is no independence sense of right and wrong the mind
at this stage is not ready to stand up against
the group so if my group is doing something heinous
or something what we would consider immoral like if i'm
part of a military unit and the military unit now
starts to you know commit war crimes i'm not going
to be able to stand up at this stage and
challenge them and say hey guys what are you doing
you're you're coming you're killing civilians you're shooting at civilians
this is wrong we shouldn't do this this this doesn't
happen at this stage that requires a higher level of
cognitive development so at this stage i will actually join
in with the group and i will participate with them
in the war crimes and i will justify it as
good because anything our group does by definition is good
because we have the absolute best superior perspective on the
world and if we're killing civilians that means those civilians
deserve it the mind will justify in whatever way is
necessary it will do any kind of mental gymnastics to
justify this kind of action this is what leads to
a lot of atrocities genocide uh you know religious violence
uh bigotry racism and so forth uh you know if
all of my neighbors own slaves they'll all own slaves
too and it'll be good and normal because hey if
if god didn't want us to own slaves then we
wouldn't own them right like if god i mean we're
the chosen people and if we're good christians and we're
we're all slave owners then that means owning slaves must
be exactly what god wants there's no sense of like
sitting down and thinking through like wait a minute maybe
the things i've been told about what god wants maybe
that's not really what god wants the mind doesn't work
like that at this stage it's too conformist at this
stage the mind likes to take on preset roles in
the group so many organizations at this stage like churches
the military traditional hierarchical organizations or the government uh they
have fixed predefined roles i enter this role i do
what is required of me there there's not a lot
of creative thinking going on there's not a lot of
independent evaluating or analysis i'm just gonna do what needs
to be done and it's it's a very sort of
simplistic way to do work so you know if i'm
gonna go sign up for a church maybe i'm gonna
get into missionary work i'm gonna become a missionary i'm
gonna go do exactly what the you know the instructions
tell me on how to be a missionary i'm not
going to innovate i'm not going to deviate that's why
a lot of these sorts of conformist people they gravitate
towards the military towards traditional roles like this they also
like traditional family roles so they like the idea of
i'm the provider husband or i'm the caretaker wife and
i'm raising the children while my husband is out there
providing for the children and those are our roles we
know our roles it's very clear we're not going to
blur those boundaries in any ways i'm a man she's
a woman this kind of thinking and this is why
these sorts of people have difficulty dealing with blurring of
boundaries between roles whether these are social roles or cultural
roles roles at work gender roles this sort of stuff
they want these to be rigid and absolute morality at
this stage is black and white every decision every idea
every person every action fits into either good or bad
there's no gray you're either on god's side or you're
not you're either working for the good guys or you're
you're an evil devil action here is carried out with
absolute conviction because the mind's world view is so certain
it's almost like you can you can imagine the mind
as either being a fluid like a big bag of
water like a water balloon big water balloon you know
jiggles around or you can imagine the mind as a
concrete solid block like if we take that water balloon
and we stick it in the refrigerator freeze it it's
just a solid block it doesn't move uh that's how
the the mind is at this stage it's very very
stubborn it's very very closed-minded and because of this there
are certain advantages one of those advantages that you don't
have to doubt yourself very much you're so convinced that
you're on the good side and that anything you do
is good and that you can do no wrong that
of course you can go out there you can you
can you can do some crazy things some far out
things that won't be possible at higher stages because you're
so convinced that you're right of course this can lead
to disastrous consequences because there's a lack of self-reflection and
self-doubt self-skepticism there's no sense at this stage that the
mind can be tricking itself there's a strong sense of
guilt and shame at this stage because those are the
primary tools by which the mind conforms it feels guilty
and shameful when it doesn't follow along with the herd
that's what keeps it in line there's actually a pride
in conformity here so like in the military they take
pride in how well they're able to conform and follow
the instructions to the letter and the military will try
to instill that in you you know through boot camp
and so forth here the mind is confused and threatened
by different perspectives diversity complexity paradox and multiculturalism because the
mind is so rigid and so fixed in its worldview
it has a difficult time dealing with anything that contradicts
that worldview so different perspectives different races different ethnicities different
genders different sexual orientations transgender people homosexual people different cultures
different cuisines different backgrounds different ways of thinking paradox all
of this is very threatening to the mind because as
soon as the mind starts to take seriously other perspectives
and diversity and multiculturalism all of a sudden this creates
a a big sense of responsibility see with every stage
you're taking on more and more responsibility for how your
mind is creating and constructing reality at this stage there's
no sense that the mind is constructing reality at this
stage reality is this solid firm thing the problem though
is that reality is constantly evolving changing and morphing society
is evolving culture is evolving all religions evolve language is
evolving science is evolving human understanding is evolving the human
body and organism is also evolving uh technology new technologies
is coming online every every year and every decade so
in a constantly evolving world like this how does someone
with a very rigid mindset how do they survive well
there's only two options basically one option is to open
oneself up to this evolution and to accept different perspectives
and different cultures and so forth and then to try
to grapple and deal with all that but the problem
is that that that takes a lot of responsibility and
emotional labor because now all of a sudden i have
to question whether my you know my christian beliefs whether
they're all true or not as soon as i even
let a little a little shred of doubt maybe the
bible wasn't written by god maybe the bible was written
by humans who were fallible and who misinterpreted some of
the things jesus said maybe the bible was written by
people who didn't even know jesus you know as soon
as i start to entertain these ideas this is this
becomes so threatening because my whole sense of reality and
sense of self was grounded on conforming to this belief
system that i held as absolutely true and now you're
telling me that it could all be nonsense this is
extremely threatening it can be very painful and so a
lot of times what the mind does is rather than
opening up it doubles down and closes up it denies
all these other perspectives it denies the validity of diversity
and complexity and multiculturalism and it it instead demonizes these
things and so it just says well clearly all of
that is evil all of that is sinfulness and that's
a very convenient way of not having to research and
to look into all those things you know evolution well
that's the work of the devil and but what about
islam well that's also the work of the devil and
what about hinduism that's also the word what about the
buddha yeah he was the devil too that that's very
convenient because then you have to study any of that
stuff studying that stuff and trying to integrate it into
your worldview is very challenging if you're a fundamentalist christian
and don't think that this applies only to christians i'm
just using christianity here as as one example but you
see this with fundamentalist hinduism you see this with fundamentalist
islam you see this even with fundamentalist buddhists they fall
into this trap sexuality tends to be suppressed and denied
out of fear and shame at this stage sexuality is
treated like a sort of an animalistic instinct that needs
to be controlled and because of this a lot of
times there develops a sort of a sexual shadow uh
because these sexual impulses you know they're very strong they're
not going to go away in general you have all
sorts of animal impulses but you haven't fully learned how
to control them so at this stage you're just kind
of suppressing them and you're denying that they even exist
and you're sort of uh you're not really in touch
with your feelings and your emotions very well and so
this can uh manifest itself in all sorts of toxic
and dysfunctional ways where rather than just being open about
your sexuality and being comfortable with it you're denying it
and suppressing it but of course you can't fully contain
it so it'll pop up somewhere else this is where
you see you know uh sexual abuse in the church
and a lot of these pastors and so forth they
actually even though they speak about how evil homosexuality is
they themselves end up being homosexuals of course in the
closet in secret um and then eventually it spills out
into the public and it turns into a scandal so
this sort of stuff or they have sorts of weird
sexual perversions and and deviances which are only strengthened by
the fact that they're suppressing and denying because on the
surface you're trying to be the good moral boy or
girl they don't want to come off as a [
__ ] or as being sexually promiscuous or as being
homosexual or as you know not being clearly in one
category of man or or woman and so that they
struggle with that there's a lot of internal hidden guilt
and shame underneath the sort of smile that they put
on for everybody else in order to fit in socially
one must fit in and be liked at this stage
therefore you must be nice pleasant and accommodating you must
be neat you must present an outward appearance of cleanliness
and orderliness even though on the inside you can be
a total mess these people value being nice and helpful
to others that's how they fit in at least within
their in-group as far as their out group goes they
can be very vicious and because they don't even consider
those people to be human they're sub-human questioning truth at
this stage can be seen as treason or sin so
if you take a fundamentalist muslim and you just sit
down try to have a conversation with him and try
to you know open his mind to the possibility that
you know maybe maybe islam isn't the ultimate maybe there
are other philosophies that are better do you want to
consider and explore some of those other philosophies a fundamentalist
muslim can't do that in his mind that's treason that's
sin if he was to do that that would be
like listening to the devil and of course he will
perceive you as a devil for trying to lure him
away from his one true ultimate islam people at this
stage tend to be very judgmental because they need to
be in order to protect themselves from having to explore
other diverse perspectives this is the mind's way of shutting
out all the evidence that is contrary to his worldview
and at this stage the worldview is so limited that
it can't deal with all of the global complexity that
exists today in the 21st century so these people struggle
very much to live in the 21st century because they
have to deny a lot of stuff they have to
deny evolution they have to deny changes in the climate
they have to deny the fact that sexual identity is
a fluid thing they have to deny that different cultures
have have different strengths and weaknesses and that western culture
may not be the best there may be other cultures
that are superior for example if you take a christian
and you try to explain to him in a fundamental
christian you try to explain to him some of the
benefits and strengths of of hinduism you know hinduism has
a rich deep spiritual tradition that's older than christianity and
it has some amazing saints and yogis there and if
you try to tell this christian that you know hey
you know jesus was great but you know there exist
amazing yogis and saints in india you can go find
these saints who were as amazing and special as jesus
this can't compute in a fundamentalist christian's mind see because
uh that's not what his holy book says and his
holy book contains the absolute truth and if he was
to open his possibility to the fact that maybe hinduism
actually does certain things better maybe hindu spirituality is more
advanced than western spirituality this would be this would be
an existential crisis for this person because he was raised
to believe since he was five years old that the
the hindus are heathens and that the christians are the
the ultimate faith sometimes conformity at this stage happens in
a non-conformist way which should be a little bit twisted
and tricky so sometimes you're going to conform to the
traditional mainstream groups like christians muslims buddhists hindus whatever other
times though and you see this a lot of times
like in high school is that kids will conform in
a non-conformist way like they will become goths or they
will become punks or they will become like these emo
kids or whatever where they they conform to some kind
of subculture they turn that into a dogma you know
they start getting all the same tattoos the same piercings
dressing all the same believing the same stuff having the
same gripes and criticisms of society and whatever reading the
same existentialist philosophy you know nihilism or whatever and they
think that in this way they think that they're being
rebellious or non-conformist when actually the structure there the content
might be non-conformist but the structure of the mind is
very conformist and then of course they will probably grow
out of that as they get older so so watch
out for that you know conformity doesn't mean that you
only conform to the mainstream content sometimes you will conform
to some sort of niche content but you're still very
conformist about it like you can join a cult which
believes some crazy things you know you can join a
cult which believes that aliens from mars are coming to
save us uh from you know from destruction from nuclear
annihilation whatever you can believe that you could think that
well but i'm not being conformist because i'm believing in
aliens and i'm believing in you know things that are
contrary to christian mainstream uh beliefs in my culture but
actually you're part of a cult so yeah you're very
very conformist in fact that could even be worse because
at least mainstream conformity has been sort of mollified to
a point where you know mainstream christianity it's not completely
[ __ ] crazy uh because it was in the
past but we've sort of we've toned it down the
mainstream christianity is sort of it's nice it's it's not
too violent and so forth but then when you get
into some some crazy esoteric sect of christianity or of
islam that's when things get crazy that's when you know
it can get very violent or um abusive in various
sorts of ways and that's actually what fundament that's what
like wahhabism is with islam you know mainstream islam is
it's pretty tame it's not too violent or or crazy
but then when you get into some of these radical
strains of it that's that's when it can get very
dangerous that's where a lot of the sort of terrorists
come from it's not mainstream islam so that's a distinction
that of course many people fail to make at this
stage anger at this stage is suppressed for the sake
of conformity so a lot of times a conformist can
be seething with anger on the inside but they will
hide it in public which again can bubble up and
explode in very dangerous ways at certain times the main
defense mechanisms at this stage are projection and demonization sense
of self denied by others relationships have a needy quality
to them at this stage there's a sort of sense
of like i will conform for you and then that
means you have to conform for me and if you
fail to conform for me then i get angry and
upset with you and so that creates sort of a
codependency there uh at this stage there is an interest
in the concrete and visible aspects of reality this stage
thinks and feels in cliches but takes them as not
cliches this is an interesting point you might have noticed
this where you you you see this with conservatives a
lot on tv they will start talking in cliches or
if you start to debate for example a fundamentalist person
they will start to issue talking points to you and
you can tell very clearly if you're at an advanced
stage you can tell that they're just parroting talking points
that they absorbed from somebody who told them these talking
points and that they never actually sat down and thought
through these talking points themselves they're just parroting them they
don't know what they really mean they don't know what
they're talking about but they're using these cliches and talking
points as though they're not cliches as though they're original
thinking so they're parroting stuff but they don't even know
that they're a parent or a robot that they've been
culturally programmed with this stuff and they're just they're basically
just transferring this mind virus from one conformist person to
another it can be quite amusing and baffling but at
this stage the mind isn't able to self-reflect enough to
see these cliches great value is put upon appearance status
symbols material possessions reputation and prestige this stage cares deeply
about others opinions of them the main anxiety of this
stage is not to belong it's being rejected by the
group it's a loss of self as defined relative to
others so here the self the ego is very much
defined by its relationship to its in group at this
stage emerging problems tend to be denied relabeled and whitewashed
um and you see this a lot with with climate
change for example there's a lot of denial about it
it's a serious emerging problem but but conformist people like
i said before their minds are so rigid that they're
poor at dealing and adapting to evolutionary changes and since
reality is evolving all the time we're constantly being forced
to deal with new survival challenges and so this can
be a severe disadvantage for a conformist person because the
conformance person is just used to you know fitting a
certain predefined role and just doing things the way that
our ancestors have traditionally done them now that can be
very effective as long as the environment and culture in
which we're doing things is the same but if things
are changing for example our ancestors never had to deal
with climate change so of course today's conformists they have
a hard time wrapping their mind around climate change because
it's not part of their tradition because of course it's
a new emerging dynamic and there's always new stuff emerging
there's new technologies and of course these conformist people oftentimes
have a very difficult time dealing with new technology and
so they can come off sort of like cavemen uh
because you know they will be against birth control that's
a technology they will be against uh what um against
pornography that's a new technology they will be against media
like for example certain you know puritanical sects of christianity
like the shakers and quakers and uh and mennonites and
so forth you know they live this very simple kind
of lifestyle where they don't even drive cars they don't
use computers again because they want to live in a
very traditional way and they think that that's going to
work but it's not you can't survive in the world
just by maintaining your old traditions and being a quaker
because like the world is going to take you take
you over there's competition you need to be always adapting
to you know to new challenges so of course that
doesn't mean technology is always a positive there's always positives
and negatives with technology but you see to deal with
those positives and negatives both this requires a sort of
mental flexibility and taking on that challenge as a responsibility
so again the mind can either take that challenge on
or it can deny that challenge and say no i
have nothing to do with that thing at all i'm
not going to even allow that into my field of
vision a lot of conformist people will will choose to
behave that way about certain aspects of society or technology
or the media or whatever that's why conservatives are often
against stuff like genetic engineering stem cells they used to
be against those cloning now of course that doesn't mean
that there's not problems there are serious problems with cloning
and genetic engineering but usually it's the conservatives who tend
to yell and [ __ ] and moan about these
things because their mind simply doesn't know how to grapple
with these new challenges and of course there are very
serious challenges that come with these new technologies how do
we make sure they're not abused how do we adapt
our moral system to take into account the new possibilities
that are opened up by new technologies but see when
you have a rigid absolutist moral system which is basically
grounded in the technologies of 2000 years ago how does
a modern day christian who's a fundamentalist and believes in
the ten commandments how's he or she gonna deal with
cloning and stem cells and genetic engineering and birth control
these things which didn't exist back then they want to
try to drag a you know a philosophy and a
moral system from 2 000 years ago into the present
and try to use that to make sense of of
current reality and it is it doesn't work because we've
we've evolved so much but their worldview doesn't even acknowledge
this evolution it's not even as bad as they think
you know they think that all well evolution just applies
to animals no it's much worse than that the problem
is much deeper than evolution applies to to culture to
religion to language to society to everything even christianity itself
has evolved so much over the last 2000 years that
the christianity of today has nothing to do with the
christianity of 2000 years ago but of course there's no
way they can admit that that's way too threatening to
admit that christianity evolves at this stage asking a superior
what to do is the most natural way to deal
with difficulties so people who are in jobs at the
conformist stage they're not outside the box thinkers they're not
going to be out there creating crazy new innovations finding
new ways of doing things they're just going to be
doing things the old way so if your business requires
a lot of innovation these people they're not going to
fit well with your business conformance people try to avoid
conflict because they don't want to upset the group at
least conflict within their in-group they're fine with conflict between
their in-group and everybody else the out group these people
are drawn to organizations with clearly defined identity and hierarchy
these people want clear instructions orders and a role to
fill conformist people love to tell others what to do
and exactly how to do it in a black and
white way so you might relate to this example probably
your parents many of your parents will be from the
conformist stage and so your parents might love to give
you advice about how to live your life and they
will tell you exactly how you should live your life
what kind of clothes you should buy what kind of
car you should drive what kind of job you should
get how you should comb your hair what kind of
music you should listen to like they have you know
they have very strong opinions about this and they are
absolute and confident so confident in uh in their advice
for you that there's no possibility of these people guiding
you and being open to the fact that you're an
individual with your own set of values your own worldview
your own preferences and that maybe the way that your
mom wants you to comb your hair is not how
you want to comb your hair and the kind of
music your mom listens to is not the kind of
music you want to listen to and you know when
your parents go to church maybe you don't agree with
going to church you have a different you know style
or whatever maybe for you spirituality it's not about going
to church if it's about meditation or smoking pot but
of course your mom and your dad are not going
to be open to that because for them there's just
a black and white way of doing things their way
they can't see beyond their own preferences they think at
this stage the mind thinks that the mind's preferences are
what everybody's preferences are and ought to be and if
they aren't this way that means because you're evil not
because you have a different value system which is equally
valid just different and that there are different ways of
living in the world different styles of living different ways
of surviving you know different generations have different needs no
they're just evil and wrong this is why your mom
gives you the kind of advice she does and she
keeps you know she you keep telling her no mom
i want to live my life my way the way
i want to live it what you're telling me might
work for you but it doesn't work for me that
doesn't compute in her mind see everything is evaluated according
to one's own preferences the vocabulary at this stage for
feelings is very simple and undifferentiated these people don't have
a rich awareness of the different subtleties and different emotions
that can be felt because a lot of times they're
suppressing their emotions they're also suppressing their own needs and
wants the ego has certain unique needs and wants but
these need to be suppressed to fit in for the
good of the tribe for the good of the group
at this stage the mind must use discipline to fit
in and to deny unacceptable emotions and animal urges in
order to be good and therefore to be accepted and
praised by the in-group and so a lot of the
reward for the mind is the approval it gets from
it's in group and at this stage the mind values
gaining rank and status within one's in group all right
so we've covered that in a lot of detail let's
move on to the next stage the expert stage this
is still within the conventional stages the expert is able
to step back and look at oneself as an object
from a distance there's beginnings of self-reflection but they are
rudimentary it's rudimentary self-reflection mostly the mind is still focused
outwards now there's a want to be different from others
to be unique so at this stage the mind works
hard to differentiate itself from the family and to express
its newly found personhood it feels good being noticed as
unique uh at this stage there's a want to be
respected for one's knowledge and one's abilities there's an emphasis
on agency and individualism there's a focus on finding one's
own voice the mind now is capable of dealing with
abstract objects and concepts and it starts to assert itself
and its unique needs and wants the old conformist sense
of self is now seen as fake and inauthentic and
uh not so important as it once was there is
a vision now of how one would like to change
to be more successful success personal success takes precedence over
conformity to the group or the pleasure that one gets
for conforming now the pleasure is about being unique and
taking ownership of that uniqueness uh there tends to be
a compulsive perfectionistic tendency here to outdo oneself to be
the best and the ego gets a lot of pride
and sense of fulfillment and meaning from knowing that it's
the best the best in sports the best in business
the best father the best mother the best um whatever
this stage perceives negative feedback as a personal rebuke so
it's still defensive and not really able to take constructive
criticism here inadequacies of others are seen as what makes
life difficult so if only others weren't so inadequate then
life would be great but my life is difficult because
everybody else is being stupid and not stepping up and
being successful this stage enjoys criticizing others as a way
to establish one's own sense of superiority and power so
you know these people you see these people on youtube
all the time these youtubers whose entire lives is about
the joy of criticizing others ranting about the other side
whether it's liberals or conservatives that they're ranting against or
they're ranting against religious people or they're enhanced atheists whatever
they're ranting against or they're ranting in spiritual hippies they
just make a whole identity out of ranting about them
and just bashing them and just this sort of intellectual
superiority at this stage the mind starts to question authority
and group dogma so a lot of times the mind
starts to feel like it's so smart because hey you
know everybody else is a sheep and i'm not a
sheep i'm this unique individual and look at how smart
i am i'm questioning authority of course in reality uh
the mind here is just tricking itself on a higher
level and it's still being a sheep and it's still
not really truly questioning authority very deeply it's only questioning
the most flagrant and idiotic forms of authority there's still
many ways in which authority is not fully questioned and
understood at this stage the one's own way of doing
things is seen as the right way and as the
best way the superior way the mind here is identified
with cutting edge knowledge and expertise it loves to acquire
knowledge knowledge and expertise is what makes one special and
better than all of those sheep who just believe in
religious fundamentalist myths knowledge and expertise that's the truth it's
not myth the mind here becomes overly focused on details
versus the big picture it's focused on doing the task
right rather than doing the right task it's still not
very good about thinking about is this task really important
in the big picture what is this really going to
do for mankind that's still not something this level of
development is good at thinking about but it is good
at doing tasks well and doing them efficiently so there's
difficulty prioritizing and applying wisdom to one's decisions this stage
tends to reject old conformist and family beliefs in favor
of professional peer groups degrees authorities and reference books and
science here authority is given to science and science now
becomes the new religion except it's not seen as a
religion it's seen as the opposite of religion it's seen
as the true way for how to understand reality there's
religion and myth which is all [ __ ] and
there's science which everybody knows is true and if you
don't understand that science is true and that religion and
myth is [ __ ] then you're an idiot that's
how a person at this stage thinks and then there's
a there's a superiority complex that comes with that it's
like oh i'm so smart because i can see that
myth and religion and fundamentalism is stupid well you're not
as smart as you think you are there's a lot
of arrogance at this stage this sage tend to think
tends to feel righteous and superior it tends to feel
like it it knows everything now it tends to feel
like it can explain the whole world because it's shed
the mythology of religion and it's like oh yeah the
religion was so stupid and i've transcended that i've moved
beyond it and now i'm at the top it's this
kind of sense of course that's nowhere near true you're
only at the top in your own mind um there
can be a sort of um a faking in your
mind there's like a fantasy built up of how great
you are of how you're the best you're at the
top you're the you have the most expertise the most
wisdom the most knowledge when in fact you don't but
your mind is faking it because your ego needs that
so much to feel like it's truly the best within
this profession or within its worldview or within the group
or whatever there's an interesting relationship with the group your
group is still needed at this point but one stands
out at the periphery of the group threatening to leave
the group without ever mustering the courage to leave so
you're still kind of reliant on the validation of others
but at the same time you're not completely hinging your
whole identity on it so you're kind of stuck in
the middle there the self feels like it has life
all figured out at this stage and that it knows
all the answers it feels disappointed in oneself for not
performing better because there's a sense of that you have
to be this performer and you have to be successful
there's still a strong sense of shoulds and odds at
this stage of how you should behave what's correct what's
incorrect this stage doesn't easily collaborate with others because it
wants to be the sole contributor and it wants to
get all the glory for itself this stage tends to
be very argumentative and opinionated with intellect weaponized and the
intellect becomes aggressive there's a severe criticism of how others
think and there's a severe superiority and the superiority complex
is very easily activated by the by the stupidity of
others uh this sort of ego lives in a world
where things are sure and clear it doesn't recogni uh
realize that one's perspective is one of many valid perspectives
it knows the truth and it knows that the best
that its approach is the best approach it loves to
create efficiencies and perfected processes it gets a lot of
satisfaction out of being efficient with work with business with
its morning routine and with its diet and with its
exercise and all this sorts of stuff this is the
sort of stage at which people start to tap into
a little bit of self-help and self-improvement they might start
weight they might start trying to become better at their
job trying to become the best at their work starting
to read books to help them to do that but
also often at this stage the person is overworked because
they're trying so hard to be the best and to
be so efficient at this stage the mind has a
hard time delegating tasks because it's perfectionistic it'll often delegate
a task but then take the task back because the
task wasn't done to its overly perfectionistic anal standards smarter
aciry is very common smartassery is common at this stage
the ego at this stage loves to have the last
word something could be told to the ego then the
ego will say yes yes yes i understood all that
but let me have the last word and tell you
why i'm ultimately right there can be a hostile sense
of humor here ridiculing others as sport becomes popular the
defense mechanism at this stage is hyper rationalism everything is
intellectualized rationalized and explained away anything that doesn't fit one's
rational world view is just dismissed as myth and religion
and nonsense without realizing that rationality itself is just one
epistemic modality and that it has severe limits and that
there can be things that are true and very important
and profound but which cannot be rationalized or explained with
logic or with traditional materialistic science all of that stuff
is seen as woo hippie [ __ ] this is
this is this is the stage from which a lot
of people love to judge and to sort of demonize
deepak chopra people who quote deepak chopra as like the
bad guy these are the ultra rationalists a lot of
people at this expert stage they tend to be technocrats
bureaucrats highly educated specialists they relish being movers and initiators
of course a lot of business types and executive types
have to come from these stages a lot of pickup
people come from these stages um where you're trying to
take ownership over your sexuality and over your dating life
here of course sexuality starts to sort of open up
now sexuality is not so repressed as it used to
be and so here the pendulum can swing in the
opposite direction where before you were this choir boy who
didn't want to have sex until marriage and now you
swing the pendulum in the other way where now you
become this sort of douchebag pick up artist where you
want to have sex with hundreds of women um just
for the sake of having sex with them and then
you don't even want to have relationships with them just
sex and all you care about is how many women
you have sex with and how hot they are and
you rank every woman on a scale of 1 to
10 and so forth so the pendulum swings like that
[Music] at this stage the ego feels entitled to impose
its sense of its its views on others there's a
pragmatic leadership style that's unencumbered by existential questions or complexities
or externalities and collateral damage like if we can get
something done let's just do it earn some money that
means it's good we don't have to think about the
repercussions on the environment or should we even do this
is this spiritually right is this moral is this conscious
none of that matters at this stage the c the
superego is is very strong at this stage but it's
unavailable for introspection the superego is that part of your
mind which tells you what is right and what is
wrong and what you should be doing this stage is
concerned with fulfilling adult responsibilities and duties it's very adept
at finding new and different solutions better ideas and more
perfect procedures and ways of doing things there's a sense
and attitude at this stage of if i can do
it you can do it too you know just like
pick yourself up by your bootstraps work harder sleep less
and just get it done just do it stop being
lazy stop creating excuses just go out there and do
it and this is seen to be sort of like
the solution to all of mankind's problems um this stage
often blames the structure tools or incompetence of others for
things that are not working in the world or within
its own sphere no one can tell an expert anything
they don't already know the main anxiety at this stage
is losing one's sense of specialness the expert shows a
strong front by not admitting ignorance or vulnerability so not
knowing is seen as a very bad thing there's no
openness to not knowing everything must be known and if
there's something i don't know and i admit it that
means something's wrong with me i'm being weak language is
starting to become more nuanced at this stage of development
there's a minor use of qualifications and conditionals now so
when someone is speaking they're qualifying their statements they're not
saying that this is absolutely true they're saying if this
then that or they're saying this is probably true it's
probabilistic there's 99 chance that god doesn't exist stuff like
that so there's there's a little bit of openness there's
a there's maybe a one percent openness that maybe god
could exist but 99 chance that he doesn't that's how
an expert tends to think and there tends to be
a now an early interest in causality the question of
why something is happening starts to become a little bit
important but not really just a little bit the expert
starts to wonder why why is this happening why am
i here why does life exist this a little bit
of this kind of thinking starts to come online just
a little bit which brings us to the last conventional
stage which is the achiever so after expert comes achiever
achievers a little bit more developed the achiever wants to
discover oneself by exploring past experiences and thinking about one's
ideal self the achiever has a five to ten years
forwards and backwards time frame envisioning where you're going to
be in five years where you were five years ago
uh the achiever realizes that you can continue to grow
in mind and heart as an adult so here this
sort of attitude that i talk about of lifelong learning
comes online at the achiever stage the achiever is excited
by self-knowledge and self-improvement so this is really where self-help
becomes popular this is probably the stage at which you
will discover serious self-help uh many of you probably got
on board with actualize.org at this stage if you were
following me from the very beginning before i was even
talking about any kind of spiritual topics and this is
this is where people get into tony robbins and that
type of success-oriented self-help and also basic psychology now you're
interested in psychology more you're interested in your own emotions
and how your own mind works a little bit more
than previous stages which didn't really care this is also
why when you try to introduce self-help or actualize that
org to your parents or your friends who are at
the lower conventional stages they don't get it or they
don't care or they don't understand the significance of the
discovery because you're probably at the achiever stage which is
towards the high end of the conventional stages and they
are at the lower end of the conventional stages like
the conformist or the expert where they don't yet see
the value of psychological understanding of psychoanalysis of of self
reading self-help books and so forth see and so you
won't be able to get through to them until they
rise to this achiever stage there is now an increasing
independence and self-authorship you're really starting to take ownership of
your unique qualities and actualizing yourself you're beginning to appreciate
conceptual complexity you can see alternatives in problem solving there's
not just one right way to solve a problem there
are a multitude of ways to choose from the the
achiever can see that the way a problem is framed
is the problem itself so it's a little bit of
a more meta style of problem solving the achiever can
now notice contradiction and inconsistencies both within himself and his
belief systems the achiever is planful and capable of orienting
towards new goals the achiever is still convinced very much
in the scientific method and doesn't question it very much
the achiever is looking for rational laws that explain human
behavior and how the universe works much of science is
done from this achiever stage it's sort of traditional material
of science the kind of stuff that you see in
universities a lot um the achiever worked towards the betterment
of humanity now more and more so this is going
to be happening as we move up the stages the
achiever is convinced that one's solutions his solutions will be
the best for all of mankind there's not yet a
sense that different people from different perspectives need different solutions
this doesn't compute yet at this level the achiever is
better at working in a collaborative environment they are less
lone wolves the achiever recognizes that making new distinctions is
important for expanding one's mind the achiever can create complex
theories and models but even though they're able to do
that their models and theories tend to stay at the
intellectual level and it doesn't really end up transforming their
internal consciousness very much so they can have all sorts
of lofty theories about mankind in the mind and the
world and evolution and so forth but the way they
actually live their life isn't touched by that as it
will be in higher levels the achiever actively asks to
find out what makes others tick the achiever now cares
what makes others tick whereas lower stages did not care
the achiever explores causes of oneselfs and others behaviors so
now we're getting more psychological the achiever is starting to
notice how much psychology is shaping life and one's ability
to be successful and to achieve and so the achiever
now starts to care about one's own psychology and the
psychology of others it becomes sort of a curiosity the
achiever trusts in the potential to improve oneself through effort
learning and feedback which is sort of a prerequisite for
self-help the achiever can take feedback now unlike the earlier
stages uh without his identity being threatened so constructive criticism
becomes possible now and the achiever can now even take
misguided criticism and see it as useful find utility in
it at this stage people tend to be interested in
taking personality tests courses retreats and workshops so you'll find
a lot of these achiever types at these sorts of
retreats and workshops if you attend them there's a concern
now with reasons causes goals consequences and effective use of
one's time now the mind is able to understand itself
backwards and forwards through time so now you're thinking about
your childhood and your early adolescence and adulthood and you're
you're kind of connecting dots and saying like oh yeah
today i have certain preferences and biases because that's how
i was raised that's the culture i came from you
connect all those dots from the past to the present
sort of a psychoanalytic perspective there's a motivation to classify
and understand other human beings the achiever is interested in
knowing the root causes and reasons for unwanted behavior so
they're less defensive and more open to really taking responsibility
for their behavior and introspecting and really trying to get
to the bottom of why this unwanted behavior keep happening
in my life the achiever starts to realize that self-deception
is a thing and the importance of distinguishing appearance from
reality feeling and what is being said versus what is
being left unsaid so even though the achiever does start
to realize a little bit of self-deception uh the achiever
still has almost no idea of how profound self-deception is
and how deeply the mind is able to trick itself
in constructing reality just basic self-deception is starting to be
realized the achiever for example many achievers will start to
talk about things like cognitive biases confirmation bias sampling bias
etc but even when they talk about these cognitive biases
they really have no depth of understanding of of how
deep the mind's biases run and so in a sense
talking about cognitive biases itself just becomes one more further
extra layer of self-deception which prevents the mind from understanding
how deep the self-deception really goes because when people start
talking about self-deception or self-bi or i mean cognitive biases
they're talking about on such a superficial level and a
lot of times they're they're externalizing it like oh well
yeah i can see the self-deception in others i can
see how others are engaging in these various cognitive biases
but i can't quite see the depth of it within
myself i can't see how rationality itself is a cognitive
bias science itself is a cognitive bias there's a willingness
of achievers now to explore feelings that don't fit their
current understanding of themselves so you're starting to connect more
with feelings that were suppressed and denied but still very
much achievers are living in their heads rather than in
their bodies achievers are less likely to ignore deny and
project onto others although they will still do so to
some extent achievers are becoming familiar with their own biases
and defenses but again just mildly so at this stage
one can consciously use negative energy in productive ways at
this stage there's an exaggerated sense of responsibility for actualizing
one's potential you start to take self-actualization seriously there's guilt
for not being more successful or more developed at this
stage the achiever doesn't yet see oneself as interdep as
an interdependent part of multiple overarching systems it still sort
of stands as an individual apart from different systems social
systems and so on the environment and so on there's
a desire to live according to one's chosen values rather
than the values of society or family now the achiever
questions the shoulds of society and of one's profession so
here you can start to become a little more creative
and an outside the box thinker with your profession and
not just do things the way that they've been traditionally
done now you can actually innovate a bit more there's
guilt for having made wrong choices and regret for missed
opportunities you might look back into your life and you
might sort of kick yourself and say damn i wish
i discovered self-help 20 years ago what that would have
done for me but of course 20 years ago even
if you discovered it you would have just thrown it
away because you were at a stage probably lower than
achiever where you wouldn't have been able to see its
importance only now you can see its importance severe self-criticism
is a common fault of this stage the achiever doesn't
yet understand that not everyone is at their level of
development they don't see differences in development they expect everyone
to be achievers which of course is silly and leads
to all sorts of absurdities and problems and misunderstandings the
achiever is more appreciative of diversity of people and perspective
than the prior stages interpersonal relationships now become more intense
and more important for the achiever they're not just selfishly
using people to gratify themselves now they're actually more interested
in actually forming some deeper relationships others can now be
valued for who they are rather than how they serve
oneself the achi the achiever chooses how to proceed based
on one's own critical examination of what works and what
is important the achiever no longer derives meaning exclusively from
one's narrow professional expertise there's a sort of a broadening
sense of one's self-image and importance and one's function in
the world it's not just my little narrow profession but
something more than that it's about growing myself it's about
actualizing myself the achiever values knowledge and wisdom from thought
leaders so now the achiever starts watching ted talks incessantly
valuing all this profound knowledge that these ted talks seem
to provide although ted talks are actually a very crude
form of knowledge and wisdom but it can seem very
profound if you've just discovered them the achiever can belong
to multiple diverse groups with different identities and agendas at
the same time without being internally mentally torn apart they
can sort of hold multiple groups in their mind whereas
like the conformist couldn't do that the achiever is driven
to improve the world so a lot of times entrepreneurs
and silicon valley types will be these achiever types there's
a feeling of urgency now as time is ticking and
there's so much left to do there's so many ways
in which the world can be improved there's so many
cool technologies that can be built and developed and yet
not enough time to do it all this is why
the achievers often times overworked and overstressed the achiever can
get preoccupied with getting things done with responsibility conscientiousness and
expediency issues of legacy and contribution to society start to
become an important factor in one's self-image at this stage
achievers may create complex theories of psychology or philosophy but
mostly they're still at the level of theories and they're
not they're still not very holistic theories there's a drive
to achieve uh that can lead to over exhaustion and
burnout uh it can be hard for achievers to slow
down and to appreciate the present moment because they're so
future oriented and because of that work-life balance issues become
very common if you've seen sort of motivational speakers and
business coaches on youtube talking about how you need to
be working you know 12 hours a day 14 hours
a day and so forth this this is what creates
work-life balance problems and burnout at this stage not trying
to figure things out is no longer an option achievers
tend to be obsessed with scientific rationality and analysis their
mode of understanding the world is analyzing everything to death
intellectual skepticism is exhibited towards things that are not yet
proven in a material demonstrable official way so everything needs
to be scientific everything needs to be logical and mathematically
formulable quantifiable achievers are very big on quantification of things
if it can't be quantified it isn't real there's a
belief that the laws of the universe can be figured
out and proven if we just try hard enough so
even if even if we haven't proven everything yet eventually
we can we just need to keep doing more science
do it faster and it will prove more and then
eventually we'll understand everything that's the idea here the achiever
feels in control of life generally speaking this can feel
very empowering but also it comes with a downside in
that if you ever start to lose control this can
be a major threat to your identity much energy goes
towards reaching one's goals at this stage while remaining independent
there's a strong push towards independence there's a fear of
losing independence and autonomy achievers have a sense of responsibility
towards others even while pursuing their own agenda so they're
pursuing business a little bit more consciously than prior stages
there is now a consciousness of the importance of communication
and an appreciation for the mutual expression of different feelings
and ideas achievers are interested in analyzing and questioning their
own thoughts feelings and behaviors they are open to continuous
learning and self-improvement unlike earlier stages common defense mechanisms here
are intellectualization rationalization and suppression of the shadow achievers often
suffer from depression due to guilt for not living up
to their ideals so every stage has its own versions
of depression it gets depressed in different ways and so
this one here at this stage has a lot to
do with underachieving obviously enough there is a fear of
loss of control and autonomy there's a fear of getting
sucked back into conformity or subsumed into someone else's scheme
there's a fear of loss of progress achievers have a
greater ability to listen to others experiences without projecting their
own interpretations onto them achievers are able to encourage others
to discover their own solutions more so than prior stages
achievers accept facts and the material world as real so
very much materialism reigns here at this stage there's a
blindness to the way that beliefs shape reality there's a
blindness to how materialism itself is a construction of the
mind science is taken for granted as true here scientific
assumptions are rarely questioned knowledge measurement and prediction are taken
for granted and beliefs at this stage the achiever believes
that most problems can be solved with technology so that
concludes the achiever portion and that really concludes part one
now at this point we've covered the pre-conventional and all
the conventional stages but wait don't go yet we're not
done i want to make some general remarks about this
ego development model and then we'll talk about part two
a little bit too so what you need to understand
about this model is that people's responses don't all fit
into one category you're not just going to be an
achiever or just a conformist or just an opportunist people's
responses tend to fall into three adjacent levels all right
so if i was reading these different points to you
and you were resonating with a little bit of the
conformist and some of the expert and then a lot
of the achiever that's not wrong that's exactly right you
have a center of gravity of where you fall and
then your center of gravity is what is consistently accessible
to you under ordinary circumstances so depending on how stressed
you are you're going to slide further down this scale
to the lower stages and then if your life is
going great and everything is working out for you you're
probably going to be peaking into one stage higher beyond
your center of gravity and experiencing what that feels like
but then you're probably going to fall back down to
your sort of baseline where you are when your life
isn't too great and it isn't too bad sort of
in the middle that's your that's your baseline that's your
center of gravity so just keep that in mind uh
it's okay if if you resonate with multiple of these
also you should probably notice that throughout your life you've
resonated with one of the earlier stages more so and
now you've kind of outgrown it and moved up to
higher stages also you should distinguish between horizontal development and
vertical development so this model is all about vertical development
vertical development means changing the structure of your reality and
sense of self which is more significant than horizontal development
horizontal development is expansion at the same plane within the
same structure sort of like sifting through more content within
the same ego structure and the same mental models of
reality for example you can get better and better at
your career as an achiever you can keep getting better
and better learning more reading more books of the same
basic sort learning more science building up your materialist world
view um questioning religion more and more but that still
keeps you within that achiever range or maybe you're a
conformist you know fundamentalist christian and you can keep you
know being a better christian you can rise through the
christian organizations gain rank and status become a priest or
a preacher or whatever or a missionary and you can
learn more about the bible and you can become more
moral and you can grow you can eat healthier and
you can you can be a better father and a
better mother but all still within that fundamentalist christian paradigm
so this is what we call horizontal movement whereas vertical
movement would be realizing that oh that entire christian paradigm
that was all construction of my mind and now i'm
moving beyond that that would be vertical so vertical is
more difficult than horizontal most people who do self-help do
it in the horizontal direction because it's more safe for
the ego and most self-help material is designed just to
do horizontal growth not vertical growth because vertical growth is
more scary it requires more more depth it requires more
time more effort it requires a a longer vision because
it takes more time usually to move up one vertical
stage takes five years of solid consistent work and most
people aren't even doing any self-improvement work at all so
they're not even growing horizontally most people your parents probably
aren't even growing horizontally but still plenty of people grow
horizontally as well very few people grow vertically especially beyond
the conventional stages see it's easy to grow vertically to
the achiever stage to the last conventional stage because that's
sort of like what our culture in a developed society
in america in canada in western europe uh in scandinavia
in japan maybe like you know in these countries the
achiever stage is seen as sort of the pinnacle of
what it means to be a highly functioning adult this
is what many business leaders and educators and scientists and
politicians strive to be this is what many celebrities are
and strive to be this is a lot of what
our culture is about our education system is about trying
to basically make you an achiever even most self-help books
and courses are about how to turn you into an
achiever and then nothing beyond that is really conveyed or
even marketed to you our entire marketing system does not
go above post-conventional basically and so it's very easy to
rise up to the achiever stage and then get stuck
there permanently because how would you ever find out about
anything beyond that so that's why part two is going
to be so important to open your mind to those
new higher possibilities also what i should point out about
this model is that the levels alternate in a snaking
sort of motion you can think of a swinging pendulum
between differentiation and integration of the ego self so what
this means is that when you start off in that
unit not unity but that symbiotic stage your sense of
self is so undifferentiated that there's no difference between self
and world and other but then there's a differentiation that
happens and you start to see yourself more as an
individual separate from your parents separate from your uh from
the external world or environment you become an individual but
then as you do that you sort of become a
loner to individualized and then you realize that wait a
minute that's too painful it doesn't work because i'm part
of a society part of a community part of a
group now you start to reintegrate with society and now
you become more of a conformist you start to you
know go to church and um conform with your friends
and play nice at work and so on and so
you integrate but then if there you know the next
stage the uh after the conformance you know the the
expert it shifts backwards towards differentiation now you realize that
oh i was too conformist i was being too much
of a sheeple and now i'm gonna you know i'm
gonna i'm gonna develop myself and i'm going to be
more unique i'm going to try to play up my
uniqueness i'm going to get more value for my own
uniqueness so there's that differentiation then of course it reintegrates
back and forth and this keeps happening but it's not
just a ball that bounces back and forth there's also
movement so it bounces back and forth but it also
goes up in fact that's why we call it a
spiral because it it circles around but it it it
moves upwards as well and you should also just i
think it's helpful to really see the significance of each
stage by just reaffirming to yourself that basically each stage
has its own bubble its own separate reality a person
stuck in one of these stages they really are living
in a different reality because the way there's no such
thing as reality in an absolute sense so to speak
what there is is there's different perspectives upon reality but
most people don't realize that so they just conflate their
perspective with reality itself uh you don't realize what i
just said is true until you get to the post-conventional
stages which we haven't even talked about yet um which
is why there can be this sort of sense that
some people are so crazy like conservatives seem crazy to
liberals and conversely liberals seem crazy to conservatives it's almost
as though they're living in different realities that's because they
are that's because there's a liberal reality and there's a
conservative reality there's a christian reality there's a muslim reality
there's a buddhist reality there's a hindu reality there's a
male reality there's a female reality there's an achiever reality
an expert reality conformist reality all these different realities but
none of this is recognized at the conventional and pre-conventional
stages and you can see how problematic and dangerous that
is because everyone just assumes that there's only one reality
their reality they're confusing their perspective with reality itself lastly
let me just say why this model is so valuable
and important if you can't see it already let me
make it explicit for you first of all this model
is so important because it shows you what healthy human
development and maturity looks like these stages follow in a
certain simple sequence this is how you will develop and
evolve you're not some special unique snowflake such that you
are above this model this is a road map this
is a road map for your own growth and development
also the reason this roadmap is so valuable i mean
you can literally use this to grow yourself and in
fact i'll show you how to do that in future
episodes um if you haven't figured out yourself yet this
model shows you the traps all the traps that you
make that people make where they get stuck for years
and decades you can avoid those traps if you just
take this model seriously and you look one stage ahead
you can see the traps that's invaluable and lastly the
reason this model is so important is that it helps
you to understand others without demonizing or judging them whether
others are lower than you or higher than you on
this model doesn't matter this model will help you to
understand where others are coming from it'll help you to
appreciate that and that itself will give you the perspective
that you need in order to grow remember what growth
ultimately is here for the mind is just higher and
higher perspective taking see so just by exposing yourself to
more perspectives to deeper and broader perspectives that in and
of itself is going to grow you and help you
to avoid many of these traps all right that's it
