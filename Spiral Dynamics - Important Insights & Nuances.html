[Music] welcome to another edition of an episode for bi
miniseries about spiral dynamics in this episode we're going to
add on top of the six episodes that I already
released go see that mini-series on Spile that AMEX it
starts with stage blue to orange to green to yellow
to turquoise and I might go back and add stage
purple and red in the future but we're gonna be
adding to that with a very important episode that's gonna
cover a lot of important nuances and points that address
and relate to the entire model as a whole and
how to apply this model properly which I didn't really
have room to discuss in that long miniseries because each
one of those focused on individual colors and here I
need to say certain things about the whole model as
a whole you might think you've heard everything there is
to hear about smile dynamics but I promise you you
haven't until you've watched at least this episode and we
have a lot of material to cover here this is
gonna be a multi hour episode so get ready very
information dense material here so the reason that I felt
this episode was necessary was because I see a lot
of sloppy application of smile dynamics and that's very understandable
because smile dynamics is very complicated and nuanced and rich
model and that's exactly what makes it so powerful is
all of the nuance that's there but it's precisely because
it's now so complicated and nuanced that it takes so
many hours to properly explain it to people and then
to have them try to apply it and fail over
and over until they learn the lessons and then you
know maybe after 20 30 40 hours of trying studying
this model reading various books listening to various videos and
lectures and then applying it in your own life and
then seeing where you're making mistakes and getting corrections to
all that only then do you become really good at
using this model and only then does it really reveal
its full potential because it very much is possible to
just sort of hear this model and then apply it
willy-nilly and then use it to judge people and to
classify people and pigeonhole people and not get the full
fruit of it so we're gonna correct that today and
you know it's taken me a long while of study
you know dozens of hours of study and application of
this stuff to really start to understand the nuances of
this model and how it gets Mis applied because I've
certainly miss applied it myself so first I want to
just show you the chart here that I made which
shows the entire model shows all the colors now I'm
not going to rehash the same material that I covered
in those six-part episodes so you know I already covered
blue and orange and green and yellow and turquoise those
are the most important ones you got to worry about
and I'll probably cover purple and red in the future
so you see the the spiral here displayed for you
and basically what this shows this is that human individuals
and societies develop across the screen from beige to coral
but also you see there's three other lines here that
I want you to be aware of and these are
just additional ways of sort of slicing and dicing the
same thing and talking about human development and the evolution
of consciousness but they can be important so here you
see that timeline the first one that says epochs and
that one is archaic magic mythic rational postmodern integral mystical
and non dual so what do these labels really mean
well these are just additional vocabulary for understanding sort of
the evolution of mankind and you even think of mankind
is having evolved through these sorts of stages that can
be useful the reason I bring it up here is
just that you're aware of these terms and I might
be using these terms in the future in various episodes
just so you kind of understand what those words mean
and where those words now are situated across the the
colors that you understand from Sproul dynamics so when I
say rational you understand that falls into rather the sort
of the upper blue or the orange range when when
we say postmodern the you know that falls into the
upper orange and green range and so on the next
two lines is the moral development line and the cognitive
development line and this is something I'm going to talk
a lot more about later in this episode is lines
of development so here are two some of the most
important lines that there are which is moral development and
cognitive development and these can be developed individually so for
example you can have high cognitive development but low moral
development and vice versa moral development roughly breaks into four
different phases egocentric which saw about the self ethnocentric which
is all about my community worldcentric which is concern about
the world and then cosmos centric which is concerned for
the whole cosmos and this you can clearly see how
one circle of concern is expanding ever wider and wider
with each of these stages and then you have cognitive
development and some of the words here you don't need
to know some of these terms like sensory motor sensory
motor just basically refers to the basic cognitive development that
toddler child baby goes through then you have the emotional
stage which also toddlers and babies go through then you
have conop which stands for conventional operational and then you
have form op which is formal operational and these come
from Piaget x' work on human development and then most
adults stop their cognitive development and roughly formal operational which
is roughly it's the sort of rationalist cognitive function but
then there's more there's post formal which is sort of
the postmodern then there's vision logic and this is a
very advanced form of thinking and reasoning which really goes
beyond visioning and beyond reasoning into vision and into higher
states of intuitive understanding and that's mostly what actualized org
is an example of all of my content if you
think that there's something unique about the way that I
present material it's sort of beyond just your regular ordinary
rational presentation of content and it's even beyond postmodern it's
really vision logic that's what actualize that I'm really good
at that I love that then beyond that there's psychic
and beyond that there's non-dual so this just gives you
a little bit of an idea of what we're talking
about here so now let's get into the meat of
what I got to say so firstly to apply the
model properly you have to understand this notion of what
I call the center of gravity of a stage so
what that means is when I say that such and
such a person or such in such a country is
at stage Orange what we really mean by that is
not that that person or that country is at 100%
orange and that they don't have any qualities of any
of the other stages rather what we mean is there
are 50% orange that's their center of gravity and then
25% spills over into green one stage above and then
25% spills down into the lower stage from which it
came which in this case would be blue sea so
very few people or collective entities like corporations groups countries
religious groups are 100% any particular color this is what
makes this model a little bit messy and this is
why when you're trying to diagnose yourself or you're trying
to apply this model to other people you've probably found
that but wait a minute Leo it doesn't fit not
everyone fits into these clear pigeon holes that you've painted
not everyone just a pure rationalist or a purely dogmatic
fundamentalist or a pure postmodernist and that's correct because you're
moving up the spiral from this direction from your from
your perspective you're moving up the spiral this way and
as you're doing that you know your progress is incremental
so it's not that you're you're just jumping by increments
of a hundred percent from stage to stage but you're
sort of like slowly inching your way up so you
should expect that you're not gonna be a hundred percent
at any particular color and this of course applies to
societies as well and in fact it applies even more
so to societies because the society has even more diverse
elements in it than of course the individual psyche does
have quite a bit of diversity and people are complex
we can't just boil them down to one single dimension
or one single color with societies even more so you
know societies have different regions the north the South the
East the west we have different subcultures and subgroups we
have cities in rural areas some parts of the country
are more advanced than other parts some subcultures are more
regressive others are more progressive so of course within a
society you have to be careful in how you're applying
this so we might say something like the Middle East
is roughly around stage blue of course but there's many
parts within the Middle East some are more evolved some
are less evolved so keep that in mind also what
you have to understand very importantly is that these stages
stack on top of each other which means that every
stage is necessary in the same way that fifth grade
stacks on top of fourth grade and the material you
learn in fourth grade stacks and builds on top of
the material you learn in third grade and so on
so it's not like you get to fifth grade and
you throw away all the information and knowledge and wisdom
that you learned in first grade and that then you
you demonize and you ridicule and you judge first graders
know because it's a progressive ladder that we're all climbing
collectively together and just because you're at fifth grade and
somebody's at first grade doesn't mean the persons at first
grade is somehow deficient or bad or wrong you know
maybe you could criticize them if they've been stuck in
first grade for ten years okay maybe then you have
a legitimate point but for most people who are just
passing through first grade you know they have to pass
through first grade to get to second grade to ultimately
get to fifth grade where you're at and you know
what just because you're fifth grade doesn't make you a
hotshot because there are many grades above you so keep
that in mind it's only by understanding the necessity of
all these stages that you can stop demonizing and judging
them so perhaps one of the biggest mistakes that newbies
make when they try to apply Sproul dynamics is they
think we well leo now on that stage green and
look at how bad stage oranges let me go criticizing
stage orange and let me throw away all the lessons
from stage orange know what it means to be at
stage green is that stage green incorporates in it the
lessons from stage orange and blue and red and purple
and below C so acknowledge the necessity of the lower
stages otherwise you're gonna create a shadow and you're gonna
get stuck another way to look at it is that
turquoise cannot be the only stage because nobody is born
automatically into turquoise turquoise getting up there takes a lot
of work takes decades to get there you have to
go through all the lessons and all the challenges and
all the transformational dilemmas that come from all the lower
stages before you can work your way up to turquoise
you'd be lucky if you ever get the turquoise in
your life most human beings would be lucky so the
term is used transcend and include when you evolve up
a stage you're transcending that particular stage you transcend orange
into green but then you also include and bring orange
with you you brings the healthy elements of orange with
you and you leave behind the pathological and dysfunctional elements
the limiting elements of orange so you transcend it include
not transcend and demonize and not transcend and judge not
transcend and then look down your nose at the other
stages also understand that just because you yourself are let's
say at stage green or yellow or one of these
other high stages that doesn't mean that everyone in the
world can be this is very important to understand you
need to be very cognizant of your own privilege and
of basically the good luck that you received as a
child growing up because look you were born if you
staged green or yellow chances are you are that way
because you were born into a first world country that
had a stable democracy a good legal system had a
relatively peaceful upbringing you had a decent family that didn't
abuse you you didn't have drug-addicted parents and so forth
and you had a decent economic situation and you were
able to go to school and you were able to
finish twelve grades and you were probably even able to
go to college and university and by virtue of this
by virtue of the development of your society by virtue
of the fact that your society already gave you access
to the internet computers books and the greatest philosophers and
teachers in history in the form of of our education
system you're standing on the shoulders of giants and only
because of that argue now let's say at stage green
so be careful not to then expect the rest of
the world to already be there this is a relatively
recent development stage green and these various technologies and luxuries
that you have you know they didn't even exist a
hundred years ago even in modern first world countries and
most of the world does not have access to these
resources and even many people in your own country like
in in Europe or in America the most developed countries
in the world even many people there are still live
in poverty and still don't have access to education they
didn't go to university because their parents couldn't afford to
pay them right and so of course don't expect them
to be at green this explains why they're not at
Green you need to acknowledge how lucky you were it's
really just a matter of chance that you weren't born
in some remote village in Africa that didn't have any
of these luxuries and so of course now you're at
stage like red living in a village may be blue
but no higher than that of course so you know
you also have to give slack to these various underdeveloped
countries and regions of the world because not all of
us grow up together so just because Northern Europe is
more or America is more advanced you know well America
in Northern Europe had certain advantages that other nations didn't
have it got really a head start so some people
like to criticize and demonize the Middle East or Africa
or South America or other parts of the world like
this in Asia maybe for you know well they're not
as advanced as the European race as a European countries
that's just an accident it's really just an accident so
you know watch out maybe in the next lifetime you'll
be born into one of these less developed regions of
the world and then you'll realize how difficult it is
to evolve up to spiral you have to understand that
every child starched life from ground zero basically from beige
and then you have to quickly evolve upwards now society
and culture are always evolving and inching their way up
the spiral and we've had several thousands of years of
evolution culturally and this is a really positive thing because
if you were off on your own trying to figure
all of this staff stuff out out in the middle
of the forest or the desert somewhere you would be
at the very lowest stages beige and purple the only
reason that you're at orange or green or yellow is
precisely because of how much society and your culture has
helped you Society has a pulling up effect but also
pulling down effect and this depends on the center of
gravity of your society so for example let's say we
take a person who's that stage red and we throw
that person into a stage orange Society what's going to
happen is that the gravitational pull of the society is
a few stages higher than the individual so it's gonna
be very easy for that individual to make progress rapid
progress up the spiral towards orange because all of the
media he's gonna be exposed to all of the all
of his friends and all of his co-workers and everything
he sees on TV and on the internet and all
the books that he reads in all schools he goes
to all of that will program him with the society
center of gravity which is let's say orange in America
and so that person will quickly and rather effortlessly move
up towards horse now of course it's not guaranteed you
can still stay suck at red if you really want
to but most people will evolve up but here's the
downside of that is that once that person gets to
Orange now growth and development becomes a lot harder because
to go beyond orange towards green or yellow or beyond
well now the society is gonna have the opposite effect
it's gonna pull in the opposite direction because you're still
exposed to all of the cultural programming and all the
media and all that from your peers and that's gonna
be all highly orange so to evolve beyond the center
of gravity or society that's very rare probably less than
five or ten percent of the entire population will go
much further beyond the center of gravity of their society
in their culture because that now requires that you don't
just sit back and coast your way to success or
to development now you have to actually do the work
independently now you have to go out there to find
those rare teachers and sources and books which are like
the top cream of the crop of your culture and
society which usually you know you don't see advertised on
TV or in mainstream media your friends aren't going to
be supportive of your efforts your family is not going
to understand what you're doing and in fact they're all
gonna do that sort of crabs in a bucket effect
we're gonna try to pull you down to their level
and they're gonna think you're a little bit nuts for
trying to go beyond and that's just how it always
was if you look at human history that's exactly how
it always was the most advanced human beings have always
had to struggle against the the commoners and the giant
mass of lower consciousness people and they have to drag
and pull society up and so that's what happens and
that's what we see all the wars and all the
culture wars and all the intellectual debates that go on
it's all about the few individuals who have seeing the
peaks of what human development and human society can be
trying to pull the rest of the giant herd up
the mountain so to speak but the herd doesn't want
to go and it tries to pull them back down
and so that requires initiative and leadership on your part
if you want to go beyond the center of gravity
of your culture your family and your society and that's
of course where actualize that aura comes in and then
of course if you want to go way beyond actualized
org well you know good luck with that you're gonna
find some other source that's beyond me that will help
you to go even further because you know us at
a certain point if you evolve really really high you
will out evolve me and then the actual eyes that
are content if you keep watching it it'll actually pull
you down now of course I grow pretty quickly so
I'm not standing still I'm also growing the entire channel
so then the question is who's gonna be growing faster
me are you that's up to you all grow faster
than most of you but a few of you will
outgrow me and of course by no means don't let
me limit you and you will probably reach a point
someday a few of you will wear you out grow
actualize that org and that's fine that's exactly how it
should be you know you don't stay in first grade
forever you outgrow first grade and you outgrow your first
grade teacher and so forth now there's an interesting catch-22
for raising the consciousness of mankind that I've been thinking
about lately I want to share that with you and
that is as follows here's the catch-22 we start off
as humanity as a society at a relatively low level
of consciousness and then we want to develop higher but
we can't because most of the individuals comprising the society
are all at low levels of development and consciousness so
what we need to do to really help to elevate
them up to higher levels is we need to evolve
our culture in our society but of course we can't
do that precisely because all of the people who are
voting and making the decisions are all conscious people and
low conscious people create a low conscious Society so we
need high consciousness individuals to raise the level of society
upwards we need high consciousness leaders but it's precisely because
the level of our society is low that we don't
have a lot of high consciousness leaders see and so
this keeps us stuck but also you might now say
well Leo so then is it hopeless it's not hopeless
it's just that it takes time and we have to
inch ourselves up and we have to bootstrap ourselves and
that's what we've been doing for the last several thousand
years as a species and you know what actually we've
made a lot of progress a lot of progress which
you can easily see by comparing an advanced country like
America or some Scandinavian northern European country with some remote
village in Africa you can see how different the levels
of development are there and that just kind of goes
to show you how much growth is possible and then
you can kind of project forward and see how much
more growth is possible that you can't even see yet
societies don't even exist yet at the turquoise and yellow
levels and beyond so that will be very interesting as
that develops right so yes it's a struggle raising consciousness
is a struggle it's a bootstrapping process it's a sort
of clawing your way up the mountain up the cliff
inch by inch by inch it comes it comes hard
it comes hard especially when you're trying to go beyond
the center of gravity of your culture but it's precisely
those people who are bold enough and are willing to
do the work of climbing up that sheer cliff they're
the ones who end up pulling the rest of society
upwards and then your children and your grandchildren your great
great grandchildren they will be able to take all of
that for granted because it'll come to them easily because
now they'll have books and they'll have internet videos and
they'll have virtual reality and they'll have all this technology
and all this stuff that we've built up which is
going to propel them very quickly from birth to stage
yellow and turquoise and beyond it's just that most of
us take this for granted most people who are born
in a first world country they are already in an
orange or in a green society and they just take
it for granted and then what they'd like to do
is they like to demonize and criticize the third-world countries
the blue and the and the Reds and the Purple's
for not being advanced enough for being too religious and
too fundamentalists and all this well look you were just
lucky you were just lucky to be born where you
were born and to go to the schools that you
into and to have all these advantages because you're standing
on the shoulders of giants now let's move on to
talk about what the stagers really represent there's a couple
infant ways of looking at it first each color stage
represents density of ego so red has a more dense
ego than blue then orange then green then yellow then
turquoise so that's an expanding of what you're identifying with
and so basically if you think of the void or
formlessness the the I am that true sense of I
am nough State you are that enlightened self that that
sense of formless within you is identifying with more and
more form so first it starts with just your physical
body then it expands beyond that to your tribe into
your nation then beyond that to you to your maybe
to your entire race and part of the world then
beyond that to the entire human species and beyond that
to include all animals and and then everything in the
entire cosmos and then you know ultimately at the very
end you identify literally with everything in the universe because
generally that's what consciousness is doing spiral dynamics is not
just a human thing really it's just one particular case
or example of evolution as a whole and what the
evolution of the universe is doing as a whole is
its developing more complexity and it's expanding a sense of
identification consciousness you can see it for example with the
evolution of life starting from little microbes all the way
up to mammals and chimps and then humans and then
whatever comes after that maybe artificial intelligence or something like
that the other way you can look at what these
stages represent is they represent levels of cognitive development and
what that means is that it's how you think it's
how your mind works every color of stage represents a
more sophisticated nuanced and complex way of thinking about reality
and understanding reality a way of thinking which builds on
top of older ways of thinking so it's sort of
like you have the reptilian brain then you have the
evolution of the mammalian brain which sits on top of
the reptilian brain and then in humans you have an
additional layer which is the frontal cortex which sits on
top of the mammalian brain and it doesn't stop there
there's look there's more levels to it right then it's
how you're using your neocortex it's the software that's running
it and so I'm sort of like you're upgrading your
software from 1.0 to 2.0 to 3.0 and so on
and your cognitive development really determines your value system which
is what these stages represent is different values and also
the needs that you have the quality of the needs
that you're satisfying so the reptilian brain it's only concerned
with the most basic needs Maslow's hierarchy of needs of
like sex and food and survival but then once you
satisfied those and you're moving beyond that and now your
values include stuff that's beyond just basic necessities of survival
and now include stuff like love and arts and self-actualization
needs and even then even self transcendence needs and so
forth and then the third way of thinking about these
stages represent and this here is critical this is a
huge insight so pay attention each stage represents the ability
to take on more perspective more perspective this is one
of the keys to understanding how to climb the spiral
quickly it's about taking on more points of view beyond
your limited personal egoic perspective which is sort of where
you start life with I talk a lot about perspective
and I try to introduce you to lots of different
kinds of perspectives and this is just something that's been
a strength of mine for my entire life I've always
been good at this and that's one of the things
that I bring with actualize that org is that I
can bring you to higher perspectives I'm really good that
and I didn't realize this until recently that that's what's
piled I nameks is about it's about being able to
explore new perspectives and being open-minded to new perspectives and
so the thing that keeps people stuck at their level
and not evolving is that they get stuck in one
perspective or another now a mistake that many people who
are good at dealing with different perspectives and looking at
the world through different lenses you know if you're like
me and you're good at doing that you tend to
assume that well everybody can do this right it's like
it's not rocket science to see for example that if
I'm a Christian then that's just one perspective and then
you know if I'm a Muslim that's another perspective and
the Buddhists have their own perspective and so every religion
is just like a different perspective it's not rocket science
everyone can do that right no not at all the
majority of mankind at where we are today in the
21st century is incapable of doing this looking at the
world from multiple perspectives and being able to be mentally
and cognitively flexible enough to jump and abandon your own
perspective and look at different points of view that's like
a skill think of it like trigonometry that's a skill
you had to learn now maybe some people are more
adept trigonometry than others but you still have to learn
it you don't really start off with that ability and
so most of the world doesn't know how to do
this especially stage blue and below they're very poor at
being able to see from any point of view beyond
their own in fact they don't even recognize the existence
of perspective or the importance of perspective there's no such
thing to these people to these people there's just like
reality and just like the truth and whatever my perspective
is that is the truth that is reality so you
got to understand this to understand why people get so
dogmatic and so stuck and closed-minded especially at stages like
blue or orange or even green these people are not
able to go to higher and higher perspectives so for
example don't be surprised that stage blue people are fundamentalist
religious and can't see the interconnectedness of all the different
religions in the world and all the different cultures and
that stage blue you know it's very ethnocentric and therefore
it can be quite racist don't be surprised by that
a lot of people are kind of surprised by racism
as though it's this disgusting thing like how dare these
people still act racist in the 21st century oh you
don't understand the majority of the entire population in the
world is at a stage of cognitive development where they
are supposed to be racist this is not a mistake
this is something that still needs to be worked out
stage blue can't help but be racist this isn't a
demonization of them this is just how that mind works
at that level of development you were that way your
ancestors were that way at one point and you know
if not for for a lucky coincidence you would have
been born a part of the world where you would
have been at stage blue and you would have been
racist and it would've been considered totally normal nothing wrong
with it at all yeah of course I'm not saying
this to justify racism I'm just explaining to you that
you know you got to stop taking modern developments for
granted the shedding of racist perspectives is a very modern
development which has happened like in the last 50 to
a hundred years in the most advanced countries on the
planet - maybe like 10% of the global population all
right you got to understand that that appreciate that that
explains a lot of the stuff that's going on in
the world today so don't be surprised when stage blue
for example turns spirituality and mysticism into religious fundamentalism and
dogma or goes to war over these various spiritual ideas
don't be surprised by that because that's their level of
cognitive development so what do I mean really when I
say that each perspective or rather each stage is the
ability to see more perspectives so here's what I mean
so let's start with stage blue stage blue is the
ability to see for the perspective of your civilisation and
your culture and defending that and working towards it which
is a great evolutionary step because before that people were
very very egocentric so this is an evolution to ethnocentric
but the stage blue person is unable to step outside
of the perspective of his culture his race his ethnicity
his religion so it's like just it doesn't compute for
the mind right the mind can't do this the mind
like needs a software upgrade to be able to move
to orange and at orange now orange becomes a little
bit less ethnocentric more world centric now orange can start
to see that wait a minute my civilization my culture
is not the best one there's various other kinds out
there and now orange moves into sort of at the
rational perspective everything is rational and scientific but orange still
is not able to take higher perspectives orange now become
stuck within rationalism and within science and now orange thinks
that science and rationalism is the most true the best
perspective its objective its factual well that turns out to
be an illusion and if you go beyond that you
can evolve to green which requires that you take an
additional level of perspective and you see that oh wait
a minute science and rationality that was just one perspective
out of many others and that moves you into postmodern
but then at that point you start to think that
well now I've gotten to the end now I'm at
the highest level of perspective-taking that's possible because Leo now
I acknowledge all perspectives look I'm okay with different religions
and different cultures in fact I value a multicultural I
value different perspectives I want to hear from different cultures
I don't want to oppress any cultures and I want
to fight for human rights and equality and justice for
everybody but what you're missing there is that that itself
is also just one perspective out of many others and
it's not the best and there's no normative reason for
why everyone should be at that level and when you
understand that then you move up to yellow and that
yellow now for the first time you're able to see
the full spiral you're able to see that people are
at different levels of development you're able to understand that
all of these levels have certain need and serve a
certain function in the same way that different levels within
a skyscraper are all necessary to make up the whole
skyscraper you can't just get rid of the the third
floor in a skyscraper because all the other above above
floors depend on the third floor and so yellow takes
the perspective that all of reality is a matter of
perspectives and that all perspectives are partial and that we
need to integrate various perspectives together and make sense of
them all and be holistic and that's great that's a
huge leap beyond all the other colors that came before
but then there's even an additional level of higher perspective
you can take which is that past yellow into turquoise
now you start to transcend the perspective of a human
being and now you start to take on mystical perspectives
and cosmic perspectives which are no longer rational no longer
human even and really transcend even the idea of perspective
ultimately you get to non duality and a non duality
you're sort of in the non perspective perspective which is
you're at the absolute which is how reality looks when
you're not looking at it from any particular point of
view see so so keep this in mind if you
want to evolve up the spiral very quickly you got
to get very good at dropping your old perspectives and
taking on new perspectives and this is not easy to
do looking at the world from a new perspective is
difficult it's challenging for the mind it's taxing for the
mind to see a problem in a new creative way
that's what new perspectives amount to but you can train
yourself to get good at this so by no means
am i condemning the rest of the world by saying
that well they're just stuck and they can't take more
perspectives they certainly can they can be taught too but
they need to be taught which requires work and time
and effort like if we spend billions of dollars creating
all the right books and the videos and the teachings
and the courses and the universities in Africa that are
necessary then we will quickly grow Africa into a higher
developmental stages but of course we aren't doing that not
nearly enough which is why the rest of the world
is not developing as quickly as we'd like them to
you know if you want a solution to the world's
greatest evils like terrorism and Nazism and races and slavery
and corruption and mafia and criminal gangs and online syndicates
you know criminal syndicates that steal credit cards insult if
you want to solve that problem what you need to
do is that the first world countries need to pool
their money together to help to raise the third world
countries to higher stages up the spiral to at least
blue or orange and then most of that stuff would
just automatically stop because that behavior only comes from people
who are at stage red or low blue on the
spiral you won't get those kinds of behaviors from orange
or from from green people as society evolves survival needs
change and that's another way to look at Spile dynamics
well smile dynamic stages are their responses to various kinds
of survival needs but look at how this works like
if if an animal is living in the forest it
has certain survival needs if an animal is living in
the desert it has a different set of survival needs
if it's living in the tundra in the wilderness and
the Arctic it has a different set of survival needs
each set of survival needs corresponds to the particular environment
that it needs to survive in but look what happens
with mankind mankind shapes and creates its own environment which
adds a very interesting extra layer of depth to this
whole survival needs issue because mankind doesn't survive in a
forest for the most part or in a desert or
in the tundra we survive within the society and culture
that we create most of our society is collective so
think of it as like we are like ants building
an ant colony or were like termites building this giant
termite colony so we are creating literally our own environment
we are terraforming the planet around us to suit ourselves
but as we do that we then become our own
greatest enemies because it's our changing social climate and all
the changing technological advances that are happening the cities that
we're building and so forth that now creates new sets
of survival needs now it's no longer about who has
the biggest muscles and who can physically dominate nearby tribes
we have outgrown that now it's about how capable are
you at socializing and schmoozing and playing politics that's what
you need to ascend and to survive with in modern
society how good are you are using technology if you're
a good tech user to the point where let's say
you can be a programmer you know program it gets
paid very well by society so if you want to
survive in in modern times become a programmer it becomes
very easy to survive and to feed yourself and to
feed your family because our social environment the structure of
our ant colony has gotten to the point where we
need a lot of programmers because we have a lot
of computers and computers are very powerful at shifting information
we're in the Information Age see and then you know
in a hundred years or a thousand years it'll be
something else it won't be programmers we'll need somebody else
and all the programmers they'll go hungry and broke so
so you got to understand that you know as our
society changes what you need to survive within that society
changes certain things become less important certain things become more
important like having big muscles is not important these days
knowing how to use your mind though that's very important
that's very powerful knowing how to use your mind properly
can earn you millions and billions of dollars knowing the
right skill sets how to program how to socialize how
to network with people these sorts of soft skills as
you might think of them are way more important than
the hard skills of like being a lumberjack cutting down
a tree or being able to drive a bulldozer or
something like that these are much higher value than than
those old kind of skills because we don't need them
as much so mankind is in a process of bootstrapping
itself and ultimately what's happening within our society what our
society the environment that we're creating with our society our
ant colony our ant colony is making it easier and
easier for more people to be more conscious today the
21st century we have access to books and videos and
resources and institutions and education that can quickly get you
to stage green and beyond and so ultimately we're engineering
and this is all happening spontaneously nobody is masterminding this
no individual human really even understands this is happening is
that this ant colony is sort of naturally evolving to
the point where in the future in a thousand years
most kids who will be born and they will be
quickly transitioned into stage turquoise and Beyond and they will
have very high levels of consciousness very quickly because their
ant colony will have been designed by thousands of years
of evolution and struggle and hard work to make that
just effortless and easy in the same way that you
know today if you grow up in a first world
country you're gonna be literate 99% of people in America
who are born today are gonna be literate it wasn't
like that 300 years ago it's not like that in
many other places in the world you know in Africa
I don't know what the percentages are but they're low
in certain parts of Africa there will be less than
50% of kids who are literate who we even are
able to go to school because there are no schools
or because the the area is so dangerous that just
going to school is a is a risky affair see
likewise you know in the future enlightened will be very
easy for people because you'll be just told about it
from the very very beginning from first grade you will
already hear about it from kindergarten and it won't seem
weird or woo-woo or new-age or any of this sort
of stuff it'll just be easy your parents will already
be inlined all your friends will be enlightened your teachers
will be enlightened so of course you'll get enlightened super
easy but not in our lifetime that'll take some number
of hundreds of years to get there maybe thousands of
years so I just want you to understand what's happening
at the very big picture level at the big picture
level consciousness is bootstrapping itself and it's building the infrastructure
that it needs to facilitate more consciousness that's pretty cool
a common mistake that people make especially stage green people
is they like to romanticize early phases of human society
the hunter gathers that lived before the agrarian age and
they were the spiritual ones they were the peaceful ones
they didn't have this toxic masculinity they didn't start any
wars they didn't have any nuclear weapons they you know
they were just peaceful and simple people and then and
then was when agriculture came along that's when everything became
violent and then there's war and military and conquests and
dictators and tyrants and all of this and ever since
mankind has been going downhill that's not a correct view
because if you actually go and you study these hunter-gatherer
tribes who still exist in certain parts of the world
in South America in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia and
Africa in certain areas what you see with these tribals
people is that in a certain sense yes they are
peaceful and in a certain sense yes they are spiritual
but really the majority of them are at stage purple
which is very low this makes them superstitious they're highly
uneducated they're not able to reason properly their scientific understanding
the world is very limited these people are also very
racist and bigoted they're closed-minded they're not open-minded people they're
not open to all sorts of worldly cosmopolitan perspectives because
Ted takes development these people have slavery hunter-gatherer tribes all
around the world through all of human history had slavery
and it was perfectly acceptable slavery was only abolished around
stage Orange they also engage in tribal warfare where each
tribe although it might be peaceful and spiritual with itself
with its own members it will fight to the death
over very silly matters with neighboring tribes like a neighboring
tribe could steal a pig and then they'll go to
war for decades clan warfare that stuff still goes on
in the Middle East clan warfare very tribal culture because
a lot of them in least is still stuck in
purple they have no legal system so it's hard to
get justice they don't really have any corporations or businesses
they don't really have a solid economic system it's difficult
to to make transactions because everything has to be bartered
and traded there's no currency or if there is it
can be easily manipulated and exploited these tribes they rape
in they pillage and all so what you have to
understand is that in a certain sense it's easy for
these tribes because they're still at a very low scale
they're not at mass scale we're only talking about hundreds
maybe thousands of individuals and one of these hunter-gatherer tribes
but what people don't understand is the kind of stuff
that is easy and that works the solutions that work
the structure the infrastructure that works at low scales of
humans does not scale up without huge problems when you
start talking about hundreds of thousands and millions of people
what happens when you take ten million people and you
put them into a densely packed area together how do
you make sure that they don't rape thief and slay
each other's throats that's a real challenge a real challenge
and what happens when you throw technology advanced technology into
the mix what happens when you throw rocket launchers into
the mix and automatic weapons land mines pollution waste gas
and nuclear weapons how do you make sure that those
people don't all kill each other well that's a real
challenge and that's what society has been coping with and
it was gradually evolving itself to deal with these challenges
and to scale up so even though these hunter-gatherer tribes
might seem like they have it all figured out they
live peacefully with nature that's only because they're doing at
a low scale that's easy that's easy it's easy to
get ten people to live and harmony together try doing
it with 10 million try doing it with 10 billion
when you start to have so many people that there's
actually a strain on the resources of your environment like
for example on Easter Island these hunter-gatherers lived on Easter
Island but then they ended up chopping down all the
trees and over farming the entire land to the point
where they couldn't sustain themselves on that island they all
died out that's precisely what happens and that what that's
what could happen with the entire globe if we're not
careful so what needs to happen is that we need
to keep evolving forward to solve these problems and in
a sense because we're building our own environment our own
ant colony we are our own greatest enemies so we
have to be cognizant of what kind of ant colony
are we building but in the end no one person
is in control there's an intelligence that's guiding this entire
process that you can sort of have faith in you
know mankind has solved a lot of problems over the
last 5000 years so you can probably expect that will
solve a lot more in the next few thousand years
at least if you want to be hopeful and optimistic
because no one is running the show no one individual
is smart enough no dictator no businessman no L on
musk figure is going to be smart enough to solve
all of these problems for us it's going to be
solved by the collective intelligence of all of mankind and
really all of the entire force of evolution the force
that's responsible for designing your body and all of these
cells that are working together trillions of cells all working
together create this organism here that force is going to
be responsible for creating the optimal society to help elevate
the consciousness of all of mankind and ultimately the entire
universe now let's move on to the next topic which
is a super important topic so pay attention here and
this is the distinction between stages states types and lines
of development and this is an idea a brilliant idea
that I got from Ken Wilber who's a really a
visionary thinker when it comes to these topics so with
spiral dynamics the different color stages those are what we
call stages of development that's good but that doesn't explain
everything on top of that we have an additional layer
that we need to add in of complexity called States
so the stages are purple red blue orange green yellow
turquoise the states are waking dreaming deep sleep various mystical
states various non dual States psychedelic States meditative states emotional
states so when you're asleep tonight that's going to be
the Dreaming state and then when you wake up that's
gonna be the waking state and then there's gonna be
a mystical state that you might achieve on some psychedelic
and so forth when you are in a you know
something terrible happens to you like you get a divorce
or something or a loved one dies now you're in
a terrible depressed emotional state so what you got to
understand about these stages and states and types and lines
which I'll cover in a second is that these are
independent axes so for example you can be at stage
Orange waking dreaming deep sleep or in a mystical experience
in a meditative state or in a state of depression
or in a state of excitement and inspiration but you're
still at an orange level of development along all that
changes in States so this gives a lot more complexity
and nuance to Spile dynamics a lot of people mistake
States for stages like they might be meditating and they
might be some in some meditative peak state where they
feel like they're one with the universe but then when
they stop doing that they come back and they're just
at an orange level of development they're still pursuing money
and sex and food and just like basic orange type
stuff and they're working on their business that's very different
from a stage turquoise because a stage turquoise might have
locked in that peak meditative state to something that is
like there all the time for that stage turquoise person
it's also very important that you understand that mystical states
are possible at any stage so again this confuses a
lot of people because people think that well leo so
I will get enlightened when I get to stage turquoise
that's not really how it works how it works is
that you can have an Enlightenment experience at any stage
you're never limited that's why enlightenment is always available to
you you don't need to be at a particular level
of development stage blue people can have a mystical state
they screen people yellow people struck which people they're of
course the higher your level of cognitive development the easier
it will be for you to have a mystical state
because you're not going to be so preoccupied with low-level
concerns like survival needs you're much more likely to be
interested in meditation if you're at stage green or yellow
than if you're at red or blue but nevertheless for
example uh many blue religious people have genuine mystical States
the problem though is that your mystical state whatever stage
you have it at will be interpreted through the lens
of the stage that you're at so when a blue
fundamentalist Islamic person has a mystical experience he's gonna interpret
that in a very limited ethnocentric way of like oh
I experienced Allah for example and that proves that Islam
is the greatest religion and that all the other ones
are false Buddhism is false Christianity is false now I
know for sure they're false because I had this mystical
experience and likewise for example in a stage blue evangelical
has his mystical experience and he sees Christ the vision
of Christ comes to him and that validates in his
mind that Christianity in Christ is the one true prophet
and Savior and that all others are false and there's
nothing to learn from Buddhism or from Islam or from
anybody else all those people are obviously wrong and see
in this way it's possible to have genuine mystical experiences
but then still to interpret them through a very limited
level of cognitive development because look how it works yes
it's true that the absolute is one and it doesn't
change and it doesn't really evolve if you have a
mystical experience of absolute truth or awakening or enlightenment and
that's by the way not the only kind of mystical
state you can have there are lesser mystical States you
can have all sorts of visions of deities and all
sorts of stuff but if let's say you're at stage
blue and you do have a pure experience of the
absolute well yeah when you're in that frame of mind
that absolute is the same no matter what stage you're
at doesn't matter if you're blue orange green or anything
and in that sense it doesn't matter in that sense
you could say you had a genuine enlightenment and it
doesn't matter what color stage you were at but of
course in practice it does matter because then you're back
into your everyday life and you're in the relative domain
of forms yes the formless is the same its nothingness
its emptiness it's void it's always the absolute but then
form form changes and how you interact with form how
you live in the dream that very much depends on
your level of development and also how you interpret the
formless and how you embody it in the formed realm
that of course very much depends on your level of
cognitive development your ability to take perspectives so it's very
important that you make this distinction between awakening to the
absolute on the one hand and development on the other
hand these are independent things now there is some correlation
so the more developed you are the more likely you
are to awaken the more likely you are to be
interested in awakening and vice-versa the more awake you are
the more likely you are to be developed and to
be interested in development but they're not perfectly correlated and
it's very easy to awaken for example but then stay
stuck in stage blue it's also very easy to evolve
to stage yellow or even turquoise but never fully deeply
awakened and you really want both what I'm pushing for
with my content with actualize that org what I really
advise for you is to pursue both awakening is about
waking up from the dream realizing that none of this
is real it's all a hallucination that's very important because
that detaches you from the dream you stop taking it
so seriously but [Music] you're still going to be in
the dream so long as you're alive you're still gonna
be in the dream and as long as you're in
the dream you might as well play the dream out
well excellently develop yourself within the dream development is about
being able to play within the dream in an excellent
manner in a sort of more integrated more holistic manner
to understand more of the dream to appreciate more of
the dream to explore more of the dream so you
can be awake but you know just because you're awake
the dream doesn't end it keeps rolling along no matter
what so no matter what choice you make the dream
will keep unfolding until you're dead physically dead so it
makes sense that if the dream is gonna unfold no
matter what you might as well try to play the
dream out to be the best dream that it can
be so both now that was an explanation of States
and stages now also we gotta add an additional layer
types types are things like masculine versus feminine the various
myers-briggs personality types there's 16 them the Enneagram types there's
nine of them or if you're a left brained person
or more of a right brained person that's two types
right there and perhaps there are other types as well
but those are the most common ones that I have
studied so what types mean is that for example you
can be at stage Orange obviously and you can be
a masculine stage Orange or you could be a feminine
stage Orange or you can be one myers-briggs type like
an intp which is what I am at let's say
stage yellow or you can be an intp at stage
red a common mistake that people make is they think
of well leo but like stage green that's the feminine
stage stage or that's the masculine stage and like intps
those are the yellow people and some other Myers Brigg
thing type is like a rent person no no no
you could be masking or feminine at every color of
the spiral every myers-briggs type can exist at every color
stage every Enneagram type as well so that adds an
additional independent axis to consider an additional dimension so you
see how this model is now getting very very complicated
but also as it gets more complicated it becomes better
at explaining human behavior now human behaviors not just as
simple as slapping on a label like orange or green
or yellow but now you have to also take into
account well yes this person is orange but also they
have a like a a masculine skew of orange and
also they they've had a mystical state or they haven't
had a mystical state those are all independent factors and
variables and then if that wasn't enough now there's the
fourth final dimension which is lines lines of development so
the human psyche has different facets to it mostly when
we're talking about Spile dynamic stage is what we're talking
about is we're talking about one line called the cognitive
development line and also values what are your values and
that's a very important developmental line but there's more for
example you can have a high level of cognitive development
but a low level of emotional development or moral development
so let me give you these various lines these are
the most important ones cognitive and values which we talked
about a lot then the emotional line the moral line
career and livelihood health and nutrition and diet interpersonal relationships
the meta physical and spiritual line your education your political
development your psychosexual development and kinesthetic development so if you
think of yourself as like an RPG character in a
video game you know these RPG characters they have different
things you can put points into so it's kind of
like that so for example you can be at a
stage orange cognitive development but your moral development can be
a stage red which means that you're gonna be a
criminal and you're gonna hurt a lot of people because
you're at an egocentric level of moral development and also
maybe your interpersonal relationships the development you know how developed
are you when you're relating with other people that can
also be very low or maybe for some other person
they're metaphysical or spiritual development will be very very high
at turquoise but then their cognitive level of development will
only be at orange or blue and maybe their moral
development will also be very very high think of someone
like a Gandhi or a mother Teresa who has a
rather high moral development but you know they might have
a poor development in in politics or in career or
in the interpersonal realm so you can see when we
add a sedition level of lines now now the model
becomes like four dimensional now we have all these independent
axes all these variables to consider so if you were
trying to peg yourself at some color like orange or
green and you weren't quite sure where you fit and
you were kind of confused and you were thinking like
well Billy oh I have certain aspects of myself which
are orange certain aspects which are blue certain aspects which
are green and yellow well that's right because the psyche
is complex and it has these four facets so now
it helps you to be more specific it helps to
ask the question if you're trying to evaluate yourself or
somebody else you can ask the question of like well
let's focus on the moral line how morally developed is
this person are they green orange or blue and then
whatever that turns out to be then we can still
ask the question well how how is their interpersonal development
green orange or blue and those can be different and
so of course if you really want to develop yourself
you sort of want to become a well-rounded human being
especially certain of these lines are important to increase otherwise
they're gonna be sticking points for you and they're gonna
drag you down and they could even ruin your entire
life for example if you even if you've been spending
a lot of your time increasing your cognitive development and
your your health and diet and maybe your interpersonal relationship
but your moral line is very very low and you're
not doing any work to increase that then that could
derail your whole life because you might be engaged with
some kind of criminal activity that will ultimately get you
arrested and thrown into prison see now this also doesn't
mean that you need to be perfect in every line
so don't get to obsessive thinking that okay I got
to be a sage turquoise on everything across the board
in practice that's gonna be very difficult to do because
even raising one of these lines takes a lot of
work but you know that's that's why we spend years
and years doing this work you know there's so many
topics to cover because growing up to be a well
rounded and developed human being is a complex affair and
lopsided development is very common most people are lopsided nobody
is the same color across the board on every line
that's very very rare now these lines that I've talked
about these were lines when you're considering an individual human
psyche but what about when we're applying this model to
collective groups like corporations nations religions sports teams and Families
what are the lines there there's different lines there as
well for example if we're considering a country the lines
there might be the economy or the religion or culture
or the media or the food or the politics of
the country or the science and technological development level of
the country or it's medicine system or its education system
or the way does business and marketing or its legal
system and its human rights or its law enforcement system
its prison system its mental health how family and marriage
is viewed within that country or art so each of
these lines can have different levels of development so a
country for example can be very highly developed economically but
at a low spiritual level of development which is rather
where America is today or vice versa some some countries
can have a very high level of spiritual development for
example like India but then there are science and technology
or their economy isn't very well developed and so all
of those factors are important to take into account so
if you were seriously gonna apply Sproul that damage to
a complex problem like you wanted to apply it with
in business or you wanted to apply it to create
public policy you would really want to break it down
into all these individual lines and you would want to
be very specific and say well you know if I'm
trying to reform our legal system what stage of the
spiral is our legal system at in America and you
might say well it's rather orange what would a green
legal system look like what would a yellow legal system
look like and and then you can get a lot
of actionable solutions to try out there let's take a
look at an example of how the masculine and feminine
and moral developmental line how these types and these lines
actually play out sort of in the real world so
masculine and feminine remember is a type so there's a
sort of a masculine set of values and a feminine
set of values which skews whichever color of the stage
you're at so for example what's the difference between masculine
and it boils down to this essential thing for the
masculine there's an emphasis on rights autonomy individuality agency thinking
and freedom and for the feminine there's an emphasis on
the value of care connection compassion feeling rather than thinking
relationship and community so you see it's a slightly different
emphasis so most men would lean towards the mask and
most feminine most women would lean towards the the feminine
but of course you know this this change is depending
on your hormones and your sexual orientation and so forth
and your gender identity and and so look this did
this this masculine feminine will play out at different colors
of the spiral in different ways like what does autonomy
look like a stage red versus what does autonomy look
like that stage orange or stage yellow for a man
and then what does for example compassion or relationship mean
for a woman at red versus orange vs. yellow you're
gonna see an evolution of that and so now let's
also look at at the moral developmental line so how
does this evolve it basically can be broken down to
three simple phases first at the most crude level is
you have just a purely selfish orientation towards the world
then there is a caring orientation towards the world and
there's what's called universal care so from selfish to care
to universal care or we could say it as me
we or the entire globe and uh if we want
to break it down even further even finer than the
way that basically morality develops within human beings is as
follows when you're born all you basically care about is
you so it's all me me me then as you
get socialized you start going to school and become part
of a community now it can't just be all about
me now it has to be about us the family
the tribe the city the nation the team the corporation
that's a shift in your moral development then there's another
shift where you realize that it can't just be about
us and my tribe it has to include all decent
human beings which means now I care my level of
care extends to every human being who isn't evil but
not to the evil ones the evil ones I don't
care about then there's the next level well you realize
you know what I got to care about the evil
ones too because they're also part of this human species
they're all part of the community so now my level
of concern expands to all human beings without exception but
then I realize wait a minute it can't just be
human beings it has to be all creatures on the
entire planet and so now expands to all living beings
on earth without exception but then I realize wait a
minute the earth is just one little speck in this
giant cosmos so now my concern expands to all sentient
beings in all places on all planets and in all
realms if there's some astral realm where there's some DMT
alien I got to care about him too can't exclude
him and then ultimately when you get to the highest
level to the ultimate non-dual levels you realize that your
care isn't even just limited to sentient beings because the
idea of sentient breaks down and so your care is
for all of reality past present and future in all
the ways that it can manifest you're concerned about it
all and you want the best for all of it
rather than just wanting the best for yourself or for
your family or for your tribe or for your species
or for your race or for the planet Earth you
want the best for everything and that's sort of God's
perspective if you think about it you know God sort
of you might imagine was sort of the best for
the entire universe and so you can see you know
where are you on this level of development this moral
development in the level and where are you resisting going
further you know some people get stuck at the at
the level where they okay leo yeah I'm willing to
care about all human beings on the planet but you
know I'm not willing to care about the Hitler's and
Stalin's and terrorists of the world and the criminals you
know they we just got to kill them them I
don't care about them that's where you're at that's your
level of development and then at some point if you
keep evolving you will realize that wait we have to
include them as well we can't exclude them just because
they're evil and selfish and kill people doesn't mean that
we stop caring for them and if you're resistant to
that well that's something that you got to work on
that's what development will correct in you it will it
will open up your eyes and your perspective such that
you realize that you were too limited your care was
too limited and that you need to expand further so
it's all about expansion expansion expansion expansion so as I've
been giving you these examples of masculine feminine in the
moral line of development this helps us to understand a
common problem for example that we see you know some
feminists make this problem is they make this mistake of
thinking that well if we look throughout history history was
so vile there's so much war and that was because
the men it was this toxic masculinity that was dominating
society and now finally now we're getting some equality between
the masculine and the feminine and if society just got
more feminine energy if if more females ruled the world
and we're in positions of power that will solve all
of mankind's problems and we would all live in peace
and harmony together well that's not true if you understand
the nuances of states stages lines and types because what
you got to understand is that there's different stages of
feminine so what stage of feminine are you talking about
when you're talking about increasing feminine you need the right
stage because if you add a bunch of stage red
feminine to a masculine orange society you're actually gonna make
it worse not better because feminine can still be cruel
feminine can still be limited feminine can still be racist
feminine can be still be homophobic feminine can still be
tolerant of slavery now of course what many feminists mean
is they mean adding green feminine stage green feminine now
it's true if you add a bunch of stage Green
feminine to an orange male dominant Society like in the
u.s. then that probably will elevate the society and probably
will lead to more peace and more compassion that's true
but that you know is that because you're adding mass
feminine or is that because you're adding green feminine that's
an important distinction and because if you understand this distinction
you'll also understand this additional nuance that masculine isn't the
enemy per se because there's different flavors of masculine red
masculine certainly is a problem and maybe even Orange masculine
is a problem but there's also green masculine so maybe
what we need more of is not just green feminine
but also green masculine because the problem is that if
you juice a lot of green feminine you're gonna sure
you may be you solve certain problems in society but
then you create new problems because now you still have
50% of the population who are masculine the men but
now these men feel feminized they don't feel connection with
their masculine energy and now they become dysfunctional and start
to misbehave which we're seeing with some of these in
cells and and men's rights movements and so forth right
they're reacting against feminine not realizing that feminine and green
aren't necessarily the same thing there's also a green version
of masculine so that's why these additional nuances can make
a big difference not as simple as it seems here's
another very important thing to understand is that these different
color stages cannot be seen through introspection when you're sitting
on a meditation cushion they require wide scientific research you
have to go out and actually study lots of groups
of individuals across the whole world different cultures different societies
different races and you have to compile all the data
and only then do you see this entire developmental model
like spiral dynamics unfold and this these developmental stages they
were only discovered in last hundred years so what this
means is that most religious and spiritual traditions around the
world which are hundreds or thousands of years old do
not understand the idea of stages or types or lines
of development and most of these spiritual traditions they were
developed by advanced meditators who would sit on a cushion
and introspect for many many hours to attain very high
mystical states but see mystical states are separate from stages
of development so just because you're at a high mystical
state doesn't necessarily mean that you're gonna understand and see
the entire spiral and all of the possibilities of development
that exist and so one of the biggest problems right
now with all the traditional religions Islam Hinduism Christianity Judaism
and even Buddhism is that none of these religions basically
understand Spile dynamics and they don't account for development very
much most of them are focused on helping you to
attain higher states if that and then you know a
lot of them only focus on just filling your head
with Dogma which is which is even worse so you
don't even get the mystical states so you got understand
that and and this also explains why you know those
people who say Oh leo but this smile dynamic stuff
it's all just concepts and models it's all if you
just sit and you're just present in the moment there
there is no spiral there are no stages yes of
course that's true it's finally name is a conceptual framework
but but just because that's true doesn't mean that Spa
that Amex isn't useful and that you're not missing something
and in fact you are missing something if all you
do for the rest of your life is you just
sit on a cushion and you introspect and you practice
mindfulness and you practice meditation and you become fully enlightened
they're still gonna be something that you're missing and you're
not gonna be fully developed and you're not gonna fully
know how to analyze the various problems that are happening
in the world socially collectively because our social eclectic problems
mostly have to do not well some of them have
to do with the fact that people aren't awake of
course they do but they also have a large component
of people just lacking in development organizations and and countries
and legal systems lacking and development and that's important because
our society and our culture contributes enormous ly to our
ability and potential to wake up so if you want
to wake up a lot of people you can't just
teach them techniques for sitting on a cushion and meditating
all day that's great that's a very direct path and
of course for some tiny percentage of the population that
will work great but for the vast majority of the
population it won't work at all because they're not at
a level of development where they can even hear you
and understand your teachings or even be open minded to
your teachings because to assume that a person is open-minded
enough to hear non dual teachings they already have to
be at like stage green or beyond otherwise they'll they'll
demonize you maybe even burn you at the stake and
it would be nice to understand that so if we
really want to wake up the whole world we got
to also take into account development in light emits itself
it's very important understand has no stages enlightenment is absolute
but how you interpret that enlightenment very much depends what
stage you're at and and how holistic and integrative are
you with your understanding of spirituality and all of religion
and science and how much do you integrate it all
together that very much depends on your level of development
a stage blue-lined person can still be racist sexist could
even potentially own slaves or condone slavery or have some
sort of crude archaic political views for example or might
be very biased towards his own culture might be very
ethnocentric might be very biased and partial to his own
religious tradition like some you know some Hindu guru master
might just be all about Hinduism but discount the value
of Buddhism or Islam and there might be some valuable
nuggets within Buddhism or Islam that that person is missing
maybe some valuable techniques may be some valuable moral teachings
or whatever that would help round out this Hindu master
that's the value of a more holistic integrative approach it's
also much more enjoyable to see the interconnectedness of everything
because that's one thing that consciousness is doing because consciousness
is one we're talking about oneness here yes you can
awaken to the infinite void the emptiness the nothingness yes
you of course you awaken to that that's that's that's
critical but then what you do for the rest of
your life is now you're still navigating this dream you're
navigating this infinite creative with all these forms and shapes
and all this stuff that's happening you're navigating it and
what you're seeing then your mind is integrating it all
together and you're seeing all the nuanced interconnectedness of everything
you're seeing for example how Buddhism is talking about this
and Islam's talking about the same thing and and then
Hinduism is also talking about it but it it's all
being talked about in different ways and then you see
the beauty of that and then you see for example
like Hindu art and Islamic art and Christian art and
you see how all of that fits in together and
so you're seeing more and more of the interconnectedness of
everything and in this way your awakening becomes richer more
holistic more integrated and more beautiful it's also important understand
that spiral dynamics doesn't account for everything there are factors
which are just independent of spiral dynamics for example maybe
IQ like you could have a different level of IQ
at every stage that's an independent variable or your level
of spiritual attunement people might have a natural spiritual talent
for spiritual work or for meditation that would be separate
from whatever stage of development they're at or maybe karma
that would be a separate factor genetics and environment those
can also be separate factors early trauma that you might
have suffered as a child maybe you were abused or
you were in a near-death situation or you were molested
or you have some PTSD you know that would be
a complicating factor which is independent of your spiral stage
maybe you have some kind of physical illness maybe have
a mental illness and a disability you know father name
is doesn't account for things like Psychopaths and sociopaths and
criminals it accounts for criminality in some ways but but
you know you can still be a criminal pretty much
at any stage it doesn't account for racial differences if
there are any class differences economic status you know these
are all further complicating factors in fact let me give
you an even more elaborate list of various cycle factors
and things which are independent of your stage on the
spiral I'll run through the whole list it's pretty big
list I'll run through the whole list real quickly and
then I'll I'll expand on certain parts of it so
judgment and as I'm saying each one what this means
is that this this word that I'm saying like judgment
this thing can happen at any stage in the spiral
because sometimes people think that oh well judgment that can
only happen a stage blue and a stage green person
can't possibly be judgmental so if I ever encountered a
judgmental person that immediately places them in the blue category
no that's wrong judgment can happen even at Kirk wise
now of course a stage red person will be much
much more likely to be judgmental than a stage turquoise
person but judgment can still happen it's just that judgment
looks differently judgment evolves through all of these stages is
very difficult to transcend all judgment entirely you know that's
very very rare so judgment hatred addiction fear demonization projection
radicalization ideology and Dogma is not limited to blue it
can happen all along the spiral paradigm Locke duality justification
distractions self bias ignorant bad public policy do not assume
that just because someone is a stage turquoise guru that
he can't have some loony wacky public policy proposals that
would be terrible and that would hurt lots of people
that can certainly happen emotional reactivity happens at all stages
getting triggered closed-mindedness can even exist at turquoise passion you
can be passionate at every stage you can be a
super passionate su we're charismatic stage red pirates for example
you could be passionate about killing people or you can
be passionate about loving people you see these are independent
variables lying you can lie at every stage selfishness there's
different forms of selfishness at every stage abuse of power
you think stage turquois gurus can't abuse their power they
certainly can fame you can be famous at any stage
spirituality happens at every stage crime can happen at every
stage you can be a stage turquoise criminal now of
course that's much more like less likely than if your
stage red but it can still happen manipulation each stage
manipulates in its own way hypocrisy injustice and inequality love
don't think that only the highest stages can love all
the stages can love even a stage red tyrant can
still love and no I don't mean in the sense
that he loves to kill people I mean he can
he you know a stage red tyrant can genuinely love
his daughter or his wife a problem horniness you can
be horny in every stage don't think that a stage
turquoise guru doesn't have sexual cravings mistakes can happen in
every stage business and wealth can happen at every stage
people make the silly mistake of thinking that well if
it's a business if this is a business person they
must be automatically staged orange because orange is all about
business and making money that's generally true but you have
businesses at every stage of the spiral they just look
different they have different values you could have lots of
money at every stage of the spiral you could have
lots of money as a red tyrant lots of money
as an orange Wall Street broker or even lots of
money as a stage turquoise guru like osho with his
90-some for all choices denial can happen every stage gender
happens at every stage playing victim the victim mentality laziness
you can be lazy at high stages pathology groupthink misunderstanding
miscommunication happens at all stages reasoning don't think that reason
and rationality are limited exclusively to stage Orange yes it's
generally true that stage Orange is the sort of the
rational one but you know stage blue people can reason
even stage purple tribal people in the Amazon and in
Africa and in Papua New Guinea they they use reason
it's just a different kind of reason used for different
purposes obesity can happen at every stage don't think that
just because a person is fat you see some fat
guru and then you think that well a fat guru
can't be turquoise because turquoise people they're supposed to be
healthy and fit no nobody said that those are independent
variables mental disorders can happen at any stage and a
self-deception happens at all stages also even the very highest
stages you get self-deception I have a three-part miniseries called
self-deception where I outline like 50 different self-deception mechanisms all
of those sub deception mechanisms can happen at every level
of the spiral now of course the higher up you
are the the more aware you will be of them
but you're never going to be fully immune from them
all right so let's take an intermission right here we've
covered a lot of ground but we still have a
lot more to go all right let's continue so the
way that I like to think about spiral dynamics and
reality as a whole is that there really is no
such thing as one reality what you do is you
replace this notion of one reality instead with spiral dynamics
which means that every stage is a new reality you're
sort of living in your own bubble at every stage
and you see all these different facets of life in
different ways corresponding to the lens that you're looking through
which is the color of your stage so what that
means is very practically is that love is different at
each stage spirituality is different at each stage religion is
different at each stage and that's very important to understand
let's pause and elaborate on this point about religion it's
very easy to fall into the trap of oversimplifying religion
and thinking that religion is just a stage blue activity
it's just fundamentalist dogma and that that's what Christianity is
that's what Islam is that's even maybe you think that's
what Buddhism is and Hinduism that's not quite right there
are green versions of Christianity for example there can be
yellow and turquoise versions of Islam now I'm not saying
they're common and maybe even they don't really exist yet
but they will in the future and so on with
all the other religions alright so the mistake that's commonly
made when people demonize a particular religion is that it's
assumed as though the religion is this one monolithic static
thing and that it's never gonna evolve or change and
that's just not true religion has always evolved even very
fundamentalist religious people who tend to treat religion as a
monolith still if you look historically if you study history
if you study the history of Christianity Islam and Buddhism
you know there's always been evolution and change within all
of these traditions it's inevitable because everything changes and everything
evolves that's just the nature of all form so you
know in two hundred three hundred years I very much
foresee that there will be a yellow version of Islam
a green version of Islam a turquoise version of Islam
it's not like these religions are really going away they're
gonna be there they're gonna soften at the edges they're
gonna take on a more pluralistic perspective and most point
more relativistic perspective they're going to become less dogmatic less
ideological less violent more more loving having a sense of
more universal inclusiveness and then ultimately they're going to incorporate
mystical and non dual insights now of course the mystical
and non dual insights are there right now if you
look at Islam or Judaism or Christianity non-duality was there
from the very very beginning that's how they were founded
they were founded by mystics but there's a difference between
the esoteric core of every religion and sort of the
mainstreamed versions of it that are known by just average
ordinary folks you know most people who are Muslims in
the Middle East do not have any true sense of
the mystical esoteric non-dual kernels of truth which are contained
in Islam and if some of them do of course
some of them do the Sufis and others do is
very advanced you know Muslim practitioners may have this insight
but it's very rare so again religion is different at
every stage business is different at every stage there's a
big difference between business at stage orange green yellow and
turquoise and it's a big mistake to think that all
well Leo once we get beyond yellow and turquoise into
those stages then how do I make my money because
I can't have a business of course you can have
a business it's just a different kind of business how
you view the family is different at every stage what
your notion of a family is health and nutrition looks
different at every stage relationships and marriage look different every
stage art is different at every stage the kind of
values and themes that art depicts if you've studied our
history you can actually trace the evolution of art and
the role that aren't played from the very early stages
you know tens of thousands of years ago the the
ancient cave paintings those came from stage purple tribes and
then art during the Rome time's art that was commissioned
by tyrants and dictators and emperors and kings and then
the art that came from various religious traditions a lot
of European art hmm from five hundred to a thousand
years ago was was all basically almost all religious art
all trying to put forth Christian themes in one for
mother nun or another trying to mmm glorify Christianity and
then you know more modern versions of art and postmodern
art and all sorts of crazy forms of art that
happens today avant-garde art is more of a green version
of art and there's even arts from the yellow and
even turquoise perspectives like the art of Alex gray who
does these psychedelic trippy psychic types of paintings so art
looks different media looks different video games movies entertainment I
mean film is gonna eventually evolve and this will probably
take hundreds of years but eventually film will evolve beyond
the stupid mindless superhero movies that we're stuck in right
now which are very staged orange into more refined more
higher consciousness types of entertainment and so will video games
and all the other stuff and virtual reality and all
that politics of course is very different every stage motivation
what motivates you or what motivates your nation or your
culture or your team or your group of people that
very much changes state-to-state your fears and worries are different
for every stage criticism and analysis is different depending on
which stage it's coming from and reason and justifications are
different from each stage what you consider good bad destructive
healthy unhealthy dangerous or crazy is relative to your stage
these words do not have an absolute definition what's good
at stage blue looks bad at stage orange and vice
versa what's healthy - green is unhealthy - yellow what's
crazy - stage blue is the opposite for stage green
and so forth a lot of people don't understand this
and then they get confused because they look at a
thing and it looks so evil or bad or destructive
or unhealthy or dangerous or crazy but that's from their
perspective and actually the funny thing is is that some
of the healthiest and some of the the highest things
that you can achieve as a human being ironically look
very unhealthy and destructive and dangerous and crazy to people
who are at lower levels of development which is a
huge problem because if we want to help to elevate
and to evolve all of society that's difficult to do
when half the population or even more is at a
low level of development and therefore they see all the
good stuff and all the healthy stuff is actually being
unhealthy and crazy and that it's going to destroy the
world how do you convince them then - to make
these changes that we need you can't because they they
demonize those changes and they're afraid of them and then
a lot of people can't understand that every stage looks
dangerous crazy criminal insane or evil or deluded to some
other stage on the spiral that's not because things actually
are that way it's just because of the lens that
you're looking through and in fact I want to spend
some time going to some detail to elaborate on how
each stage looks at every other stage so let's start
with blue how does blue see red as selfish and
uncivilized beasts how does blue see blue as a lesser
civilization blue doesn't get along with blue so for example
when evangelicals look at stage blue Muslims in the Middle
East they view them as inferior because that's the blue
position the blue position is that I am a civilization
but I am the best civilization and yes there are
other blue civilizations out there I don't of course really
know that they're blue cuz I don't even know about
the spiral but they're all lesser than me because that's
what ethnocentrism is how does blue view orange as too
materialistic to secular and too liberal so for example how
do Middle Eastern Islamic clerics look at American stage Orange
capitalism they view it as hedonism they view as a
descent into depravity and materialism all this porn and and
women dressing and scantily clad dresses and all this makeup
and showing their legs and wearing skirts and all of
this and then you know what our Americans obsessed with
money and cars they're forgetting the thing that actually is
supposed to be grounding you in life which is God
which is Islam see that's how it looks to them
and of course many blue evangelicals in America or like
maybe Mormons when they look at stage orange Americans they
will also see them this way as to secular too
liberal too materialistic they've lost touch with their Christianity with
their Mormon roots or whatever with their face and with
the Family Values and with tradition and with with heritage
and family and with the you know with their children
they've lost connection with all of this and now they
just basically are just chasing material success and of course
that's why they're depressed and miserable and their hopped up
on drugs and all this and that's why civilization is
collapsing and all the rap music and all this writes
this classic classic example of how blue views orange how
does blue view green as relativists nihilists Libertines Bohemians communists
and hippies so if you want a really good example
of how blue views green a lot of jordan Peterson's
critiques of post-modernism and socialism and communism is coming from
this perspective that doesn't mean that he's purely blue but
a lot of his critiques are coming from this perspective
how does blue view yellow as space cadets elites and
intellectuals and lost than the in the clouds philosophers how
does blue view turquoise as arrogant heretics and nut cases
so for example how would a blue fundamentalist Muslim cleric
view a non dual mystic he would view him as
an arrogant heretic because the mystic says I am God
we are all God but the stage blue fundamentalist says
no we can't all be God God is beyond all
humans there's that fundamental duality and you can't be the
same as Jesus you can't be the same as Muhammad
you can't be at that same level as the Buddha
those were all prophets and nobody is at the same
level as one of these prophets that's just because they
haven't gotten there yet they're they're holding that as the
dogma all right so how to stage orange review all
the other stages orange views red as dangerous criminals blue
as deluded religious fanatics who won't listen to reason how
does you view orange itself as competition as competition how
does view orange view green as naive idealist s-- hippies
snowflakes social justice warriors bleeding-heart liberals soy boys and as
being too feminine too soft how does orange view yellow
as impractical philosophers theoreticians and a source of ideas to
exploit and how does orange view turquoise as New Agers
as frauds and religious nut cases orange confuses turquoise mystics
and sages with stage blue deluded religious fundamentalists puts them
in the same category or maybe lumps them in with
with hippies but generally when an orange person sees the
stage turquoise guru talking about some spiritual topic he's gonna
tend to think of that turquoise person as a as
a fraud or as a huckster trying to like pretend
to be a guru just to earn money really that's
just a projection of orange because orange is all about
earning money and materialism so he thinks that these sages
and mystics that that's all they care about - how
to stage green view the other stages green views red
as very interestingly victims of social abuse so Green has
to have a certain kind of overextended compassion for red
which is why red can often abuse and exploit green
because green is that sort of very compassionate overly compassionate
sometimes bleeding-heart liberal I remember there was a story that
I read in the news maybe a year or so
ago where there were some sort of like people from
California some liberal types who wanted to go to the
Middle East to Afghanistan - like Isis and confront Isis
and like present them with flowers and with gifts and
all of this thinking that they would be able to
convinced a stage read you know Islamic fundamentalist uh who
is gonna chop their head off that they could convince
them with compassion with love no that's not gonna work
they're gonna chop your head off you gotta understand that
it's green got to be careful how does green view
blue as heartless medieval fundamentalists who lack compassion fundamentally they
lack compassion how does green view orange as used-car salesmen
and greedy capitalists who are exploiting people how does green
view other green as comrades fellow comrades to build a
network for social justice with how does green view yellow
as aloof elitists and intellectuals from the green perspective yellow
is is way too much stuck in their head and
not enough compassion and also not enough community in relationship
because yellow is more individualistic and green is is a
little bit more conformist how does green view turquoise very
interestingly Green tends to look at turquoise as already what
green is doing so when a green sees some turquoise
guru they will say well that's green I am I
mean what I am is turquoise that's how green tricks
itself is Green thinks it's turquoise which is too high
of an evaluation and also green tends to worship these
turquoise gurus and that's sort of what happened with the
osho phenomenon is you had a lot of Westerners and
Californians and Americans who were really inspired by Osho and
became his followers but they weren't nearly as advanced as
Osho they were green the hippies and Osho is turquoise
and so that can create a sort of an interesting
and dysfunctional dynamic as it did there what about yellow
how does yellow view red as dangerous narcissists how does
it you blue as closed-minded bigots and moralists yellow views
orange as myopic rationalists and sleazy businessmen and people who
are trapped in the rat race and can't see beyond
it yellow sees green as naive emotional do-gooders how does
yellow see yellow as competent experts yellow values the expertise
and the intelligence of yellow and how does yellow view
turquoise as wise masters as sort of the the example
of what mankind can aspire to so another point I
want to make here is that confirmation bias works on
every stage and what this means is that whatever stage
you're at you will pick out the facts that support
and validate the correctness of your stage while ignore while
ignoring every other set of facts so for example if
you're at stage blue in America then you will think
that Muslims are taking over the world and they are
the greatest threat and using confirmation bias your mind will
cherry-pick all the facts in order to support that narrative
you will read the newspapers you need to read look
at the news that you need to look at and
talk to the people you need to talk to you
in order to only see the facts of how Muslims
are gonna take over the world and destroy everything if
they do and you're not gonna see all the contrary
evidence you're not gonna see how Muslims are helping the
world you're not gonna see the value in Islam you're
not gonna bother to study that you're not gonna bother
to learn to what the Sufis have in common with
the Christian mystics you're not gonna to consider the possibility
that there's no difference between Allah and your Christian God
and that they're actually one in the same God right
so none of these things are gonna be important to
you even though they're factually true but all this year
mine's gonna discount using confirmation bias just to reinforce that
narrative because from a stage Bleu perspective you have certain
fears and worries that need to be validated and they
will look very real to you and you will buy
into them and you will really believe that Muslims are
the problem and that if if we don't put a
lid on that that it's gonna lead to the destruction
of the whole world and if you're at stage Orange
you're gonna believe that Socialists are gonna ruin everything socialism
is gonna destroy the world and you're gonna look for
all the facts and supporting evidence to confirm that and
it's really gonna look like to you from your orange
perspective that look yeah leo but it's true look at
all this this way of socialism is sweeping across America
and look at all these socialists and communists and all
of this and look at all the stuff that's happening
in the universities and all this post-modernism and all this
so this holds Ernst Peterson steel so you're gonna really
believe in that narrative and it's gonna really look like
to you that if you let these socialists do what
they want to do they're gonna destroy the whole world
because those are your fears and you don't bother actually
reading about socialism you don't bother about actually considering what
are these socialists trying to do how are they trying
to change society for the better you don't bother considering
for example that FDR and many of the things that
came with the New Deal like Social Security and Medicare
and all of this that these are actually socialist policies
you don't bother thinking about all the elements within current
American society which are examples of socialism various forms of
socialized medicine and and various ways in which our military
is socialistic various government programs that we have which are
effective and work well how we build our roads our
firefighters our police how this is really just a form
of socialism how basically all of society is a form
of socialism so all of these things are lost on
you because you just want to reinforce that stage Orange
narrative and of course you're not gonna bother looking at
other socialist countries around the world that are positive examples
for socialism you're gonna only cherry-pick the bad examples so
you're gonna talk about Venezuela and Maoist China and so
via the you know the collapse of the Soviet Union
and Cuba and Fidel Castro you gonna talk about this
you're not gonna talk about the successes that have been
happening for example in the Nordic Scandinavian countries and elsewhere
other experiments with socialism then it's worked out well in
various countries you don't think about that you're going to
think about the fact that most first world countries in
the world have various forms of universal health care you're
not gonna really think about that because that doesn't reinforce
your narrative and if you're at stage green you're gonna
think that global warming and capitalism is killing us all
it's all of the pollution that's a that's gonna destroy
the environment it's the polar bears and the dying of
the corals and the the felling of the forests and
the burning of the jungle and the rainforest and in
Brazil and in the Amazon and all this destruction all
these species are dying so you're gonna you're gonna gather
all of these facts which of course they're true all
of this stuff is happening but from the green perspective
you're gonna over focus on that and you're gonna ignore
a lot of the good stuff that's happening for example
you're gonna ignore the you know the rise of green
energy and solar technologies which are being adopted quite rapidly
how solar panels have been lowering and cost significantly over
the last 10 20 years and are continuing to do
so and the rise of electric cars and other technologies
are being developed which or will help us to deal
with global warming and various other kinds of environmental challenges
in the future so that's your confirmation bias and if
you're at stage yellow you basically will believe that no
no it's not that stuff that's gonna kill us all
it's all of tier one it's the tier one of
the spiral that's gonna kill us all it's because stage
blue orange and green all all hate each other and
don't understand each other and can't get along and nobody
understands spiral dynamics because it's so complicated no one knows
about it that's why we're all gonna kill each other
so we gotta find solutions for that now of course
there's some truth to that perspective but you're gonna take
a little bit overboard and then I staged turquoise you
just are going to look at the world and either
say it's perfect everything is perfect everything is going according
to plan it's inevitable that's exactly how it's going to
be all problems that we have will basically solve themselves
and then you will find that the facts to confirm
that perspective so that's confirmation bias for you confirmation bias
is not limited to any one stage and that is
by the way one of the self deception mechanisms that
I was talking about earlier so as I've said already
all tier 1 stages basically hate each other which means
that stage blue hates green green hates orange and blue
orange hates blue and green so there's a lot of
hatred to go around people love to hate why is
this well because at low levels of development the lower
you are on the spiral the more hatred will be
in you the more fear the more bigotry the more
arrogance the more selfishness the more closed mindedness the more
demonization the more manipulation the more projection and the more
emotional reactivity which is why it's a very good idea
to get as much of the global population to evolve
and develop up the spiral as quickly as possible because
these forces that I just listed especially fear hatred bigotry
and closed mindedness and various kinds of emotional reactivity this
is the source of much suffering and violence that's going
on around the world and that could lead to you
know massive destruction and death so so the benefits of
having a high level of development is that you transcend
fear and hatred and bigotry and closed mindedness and that
produces for an objectively better society society functions smoother that
way there's less violence there's less political turmoil less revolutions
and bloody cooze less economic turmoil less market crashes less
inequality less poverty less people going hungry better medical care
and so forth and overall that's good for everybody so
that's where society is going to evolve too but it's
not going to be a straight linear path there's gonna
be ups and downs because there are vested interests and
so those people who already are doing good under the
current system they're gonna have a vested interest in maintaining
their current stage because otherwise you might wonder well Leo
why isn't everybody on board for evolving as quickly as
possible to the highest levels of our potential well that's
a very naive view you see because every stage believes
it's the best and so people get stuck at that
stage thinking that we've got it all figured out at
this stage and if only we can get more blue
or more orange or more green we would solve all
the world's problems and that ends up being a delusion
and so because of this delusion and ignorance and ignorance
of this entire model a lack of nuance in seeing
that every stage has is a healthy aspects and unhealthy
aspects and has serious limitations that need to be ultimately
transcended it's because that's not recognized that we get stuck
and we're not moving ahead as fast and pace as
we could remember if you're still judging any of the
stages below you you have not fully integrated that stage
you're still missing something that you need to go back
and relearn here's a couple of really good insights that
you can get from the spiral dynamics model about humanity
and people I mean and there's many of these but
I'll just give you three right now which which will
help you understand mankind firstly is that stages below green
basically just don't care about the environment so if you
wonder why don't more people care about global warming how
do we solve the problem of global warming well the
reason we can't solve this problem right now it's it's
because most people in the world are at stage blue
or orange and blue and orange just doesn't really care
about the environment it doesn't have global concerns it cares
about maintaining a status quo it cares about continuing to
earn profits it just cares about carrying out its religious
dictates and mandates stage blue doesn't care about the environment
so of course they deny global warming it's not a
concern for them global warming is an issue really only
for green and above ecological concerns the ability to think
ecologically only emerges that green people below green do not
think ecologically so they don't take ecological problems seriously they
dismiss them until it becomes too late another interesting insight
is that stages blue and orange will not appreciate and
understand psychedelics so you might have this naive idea that
well leo if we just give the whole world psychedelics
in this sort of hippie ideal of like let's just
like lace all the drinking water with LSD and then
we'll wake the whole world up well if you understand
Sproul dynamics you'll understand that this won't work because psychedelics
only start to become valuable to you at around stage
green if you give psychedelics to a stage blue or
orange person I mean there's a small chance that you
could open their mind but more likely what'll happen is
actually they will freak out and they will retreat because
the psychedelic will blow their mind so much it will
destroy and just utterly shatter their blue and orange paradigms
it'll destroy their fundamentalist religious dogmas and it'll contradict the
materials paradigm so much that the person will actually think
that they're having a psychotic episode and that they're going
crazy and so they're not going to be able to
receive that wisdom that the psychedelic offers only stage green
people and above see so if you want people to
to be able to benefit from psychedelics first you got
to raise them to stage green then you got to
distribute the psychedelics and the third insight is that stages
below Green will not appreciate non dual or mystical teachings
so if you're a teacher of non-duality or very advanced
truths you got to understand that your audience is gonna
be staged green and above which limits your audience significantly
and also you know if you're trying to teach your
friends if you have some orange or blue friends or
family members and you're trying to teach them about enlightenment
or something like that and they're not understanding you and
they're not interested in it and in fact they're demonizing
you for it well now you understand why first you
got to get them up to stage green and then
maybe they'll be able to be able to appreciate that
so this model is very useful and very practical I
want you to see a common question I get asked
about this model is Leo is it possible to move
backwards or downwards down the spiral is it possible to
go from stage orange to blue and the answer is
that generally speaking not but understanding that you're solidly at
orange so if you're solidly in a stage you're not
likely to regress downwards unless there's a temporary regression due
to some kind of threat that you receive from your
environment so it certainly is possible to drop a stage
temporarily like if your average stage is around orange and
then something happens to you where you're threatened your life
is threatened you get angry you get very fearful your
negative or your lower your lower base emotions get activated
you certainly can drop down to a blue for a
while maybe for a few days maybe for a week
for a month for a year but then once that's
resolved the threat goes away then you'll generally kind of
go back to where you were before and and I
think that under under conditions of extreme threat there there
might be a possibility for regression so for example if
we had a nuclear apocalypse and resources were very scarce
I can see in that situation that a large chunk
of the population could regress by one or two stages
or for example if you're sent to prison and you're
forced to survive in a prison which is sort of
a you know maximum-security prison would be a stage red
environment if you're at stage green and you have to
survive in a stage red environment well you're probably gonna
drop a stage or two just in order to survive
or maybe you have some sort of physical deterioration a
deterioration of your mind your brain some physical ailment or
disability that might drop you down a stage or two
maybe if you join a cult that might drop you
down a stage or two as they brainwash you and
fill your mind with all sorts of low consciousness nonsense
maybe if you lose your job temporarily you know you're
really struggling to make ends meet and struggling to feed
your children and that's really stressful for you you know
during that time you might drop down a stage and
do things that you normally wouldn't do maybe you would
even engage as criminal activity just to survive that you
normally wouldn't do another point is that you cannot see
more than one or two stages ahead which means that
if you're at stage Orange right now you can preview
stage green and even a little bit of yellow but
turquoise you won't be able to understand that's a very
valuable insight that means that for most people in the
world because they are at stage orange or even below
they cannot even glimpse or see the deepest and highest
teachings that the best human beings have offered can't see
it completely blind to it you could you could show
them a video you could give them a book that's
a turquoise book and they will not be able to
understand it unless they're roughly at stage green or above
and what this also means is that the best teacher
to help you to grow as a human being is
roughly one to two stages higher than you because if
the teacher is three stages above you you probably won't
be able to resonate with the teacher or even to
believe what the teacher is telling you you'll think the
teacher is a fraud or charlatan or you just you
you won't be able to apply what they teach you
but if it's one or two stages above you then
it kind of stretches your your imagination but not so
much that it kind of shatters your entire reality it's
still basically at that kind of level where you know
you can stretch to it and get it which is
which is a trick it's a problem because for example
is actualize that or grows as I grow my teachings
become more advanced but then the problem is that many
of you who follow me who aren't doing the practices
who are still at stage orange or below I'm gonna
lose you you're gonna think I've completely gone batshit crazy
talking about all sorts of stuff like oneness and and
God and all the spiritual stuff that I talk about
you'll think I've gone crazy you'll think I'm a charlatan
you'll think I'm just trying to like use you for
the money and I'm just making this up that's how
it'll seem to you and that's sort of inevitable that's
why you should start doing the practices so that you're
growing along with me also support understand that you cannot
get to higher stages through logic so it's not a
matter of sitting down and logic in your way out
of orange into green because every stage is like a
new paradigm shift it's unforeseen so if you want to
get from orange to green that's not gonna happen through
logic that's gonna happen through opening your heart and then
if you want to get from green to yellow that's
gonna happen through some other new unforeseen paradigm shift not
necessarily more opening of the heart and not necessarily more
logic but something else something new that's why it's difficult
to grow because it requires some new thing that you
haven't seen before it's like a discovery it's like discovering
a new mathematical truth or a new scientific theory that's
tricky requires a new sort of insight something has to
click in you I like to break down every stage
into four phases so the way that it works is
that let's say you're at stage orange and you're solidly
in state orange there's gonna be four phases for how
you move into green first there's the pre entry phase
which is where you don't take green seriously you don't
believe that Green has any worth or value at all
and in fact you will judge and demonize and ridicule
green because you're still arrogant and you think orange is
the best then what happens is that finally you open
your mind to the value of green and you start
to enter it this is the entry phase this is
Phase two at this point it feels like you've discovered
a new world it feels fresh and new you're energized
it's like you've discovered this whole new domain of self-help
and green books and healthy eating and yoga and spirits
a little bit of spirituality maybe you've tried a psychedelic
or you smoked some weed and it's like that's you
know that's open a whole new world for you and
you're like wow this is amazing and at this point
you get really charged up and you're growing very quickly
at this entry point you're kind of going up the
curve and maybe you want to go to your friends
and tell your friends like hey guys look at all
this amazing stuff here read this green book come smoke
some weed with me come do this thing come come
to this yoga class with me but then they look
at you and they're like what are you what are
you talking about dude this is this is ridiculous this
is some new-age nonsense you've joined some kind of cult
and of course they think that way because they're at
the pre entry phase in orange your friends were orange
and so they're judging and demonizing and ridiculing and they
think that all this green stuff that you're talking about
it's all worthless it's all nonsense but you're already a
true believer so you've entered it then comes the third
the third phase which is now you're solidly in green
and it feels rather familiar to you because you've already
read a bunch of books you've already gone to yoga
classes you're starting to get some some solid experience with
having green friends you've upgraded your friends and now you're
developing expertise in this thing but there's still a lot
of growth for you here so you're sort of now
starting to get to the plateau and then comes the
final fourth phase which is the end this is the
point at which now you've been green for so long
maybe for five or ten years you have a bunch
of hippie friends and you've smoked a bunch of weed
and you've done a bunch of psychedelics and now it's
all starting to feel a little bit stale you're starting
to get frustrated with it you're starting to see the
limitations you look at your green friends and you see
like ah their spirituality is kind of flaky yeah they
pretend to be spiritual but they can't really embody it
and you start to see the limitations of green and
it's at this point and now you look forward to
something new and it's usually at this green or at
this final fourth phase where you are stagnating you might
get lazy you might feel like you're in a rut
you might feel stuck and then you're waiting for something
new to pop on your radar screen some new video
some new book some new teaching some new seminar somebody
some guru to come in and to to offer you
some new gateway that opens up to the next stage
which would be yellow and then of course you're gonna
have to surrender your judgments and demonization and ridicule of
yellow and you're gonna have to admit that green was
not the end-all be-all and so you have to bite
that bullet that's gonna be a little bit of pain
for your ego that's gonna Humble you because you were
so arrogant before when you were solidly in green you
thought Green was the the best that there is but
then you realize no there's more and so that's how
every stage basically works I just use the example here
of the orange to green transition but every stage has
these different phases so so use that idea and and
kind of see where you're at right now where are
you what stage are you at and what phase of
the stage are you at the beginning the middle the
end and that kind of tells you what you need
to do next it helps you orient yourself remember that
you don't want to take shortcuts with working through these
stages so even though I might speak as though the
best thing is for everybody to evolve quickly up the
spiral I mean that's generally the case but you also
don't want to rush yourself there's a lot of material
and lessons to be learned from each stage these stages
are deep there's a lot to learn even within red
blue orange and green so don't look down at a
stage and saying oh that's too that's too low I
don't want to be there I got to quickly move
out of it make sure you give yourself time keep
going back to stages and ask yourself what have I
failed to embody from this stage what if I failed
in body from blue or from red keep asking yourself
what healthy function does this stage serve that I haven't
integrated and bodied yet make sure you solidify yourself in
each color before you rush off to the next try
to exhaust the stage become so full of it that
you get sick of it for example if if right
now you're struggling to make a living you're struggling with
your business maybe spend the next five years just like
working really hard on your business fixing your finances making
a good living until you're just sick of it you're
sick of all the materialism you've bought your house you
bought your car you've gone to parties and you've done
all the materialistic stuff and now you're just sick of
it and now you're ready to move on to green
now you're ready to work on your relationships you're worried
to work on your spirituality now you're more interested in
meditation all this because if if you try to jump
to meditation into into spirituality too quickly without a solid
orange foundation well you're gonna feel it you're gonna feel
it and it's gonna be difficult for you because in
a certain sense you do have to kind of have
a sort of a level of priorities a hierarchy Maslow's
hierarchy of filling these these various needs you know it's
hard to it's hard to do the higher level stuff
when you don't have a basic shelter when you can't
pay your mortgage when your kids are hungry and they're
crying you how to fix that stuff and that's what
most of the world right now is still working on
most of the world is still at a point where
their stage blue and lower and they just have very
basic needs like they need they need Medicare medical care
they need food they need a decent economic system decent
legal system they need decent roads and infrastructure a decent
electrical grid water clean water various medicine from malaria and
other things like that I mean these are just super
basic issues that many third-world countries need to solve before
they can really help to introduce people to content like
that of actualized org now of course don't turn this
into a limiting belief if you're somewhere in a third-world
country I mean try to stretch yourself push yourself you're
watching these videos I mean you've got a great opportunity
to use this material to to sort of really rise
above the center of gravity of your culture but of
course it will be more challenging for you so keep
that mind you're gonna have to work a little bit
harder in a third-world country than in a first world
country just because you don't have the infrastructure and because
your culture is not conducive to self-actualization because self-actualization is
really a stage yellow and above activity how do you
fully integrate a stage here's a simple approach first you
find a healthy role model from that stage and I
do emphasize the word healthy a healthy role model because
it certainly is possible to find many unhealthy role models
so find a healthy role model and then study their
work study how they think study their system of values
and their principles that guide their life and then emulate
them emulate how they think model them satisfy those needs
that they're trying to satisfy and make sure you that
you don't get stuck and then move on to the
next stage what are the best techniques for moving up
stages quickly I would say that without the following techniques
it will take the average person 10 or 20 years
just to move up one stage moving up the spiral
is something that very few people really do especially when
we're talking about going beyond the center of gravity of
your culture whatever that happens to be so here are
the the techniques these are super powerful techniques firstly meditation
meditation is one of the most well documented and proven
scientifically proven method for moving people up the spiral in
fact they found they've done research on this and what
they found with meditation is that people who meditate regularly
will move up by two stages within several years of
meditation of regular meditation that's how powerful meditation is that's
why I say that meditation is one of the most
important personal development habits have you started that habit yet
what are you waiting for that's the fastest way to
move the spiral it's guaranteed to work if you meditate
earnestly and consistently also mindfulness practice which you could consider
is similar than men to meditation or even the same
as meditation but also there are some differences so mindfulness
practice also helps a lot psychedelics in my experience is
the most powerful tool for moving up sages if you
do psychedelics consistently regularly over the course of a couple
of years you will jump up by two stages I
can almost guarantee it you know I've been doing psychedelics
for about two years and that's I mean psychedelics have
have solidly put me into turquoise where before it was
inconceivable before I was at yellow the psychedelics have solidly
put me into turquoise and had really helped me to
overcome various orange fixations that I had I still had
a lot of materialistic orange fixations even though a lot
of my theoretical content my videos have been yellow for
a long time I've always thought from a yellow perspective
even when I was a teenager but a lot of
my basic needs were still quite orange quite materialistic and
success oriented I mean you can see that in my
older videos from five years ago when I first started
actualized at or you can see a lot of those
motivations within me coming through in my in my videos
but after doing psychedelics for a few years yeah I
kind of I'm like super solidly yellow and now I'm
starting to go into turquoise quite a lot meditative yoga
is also very powerful techniques for this contemplation another one
journaling another one reading that's why I emphasize reading so
much because what is reading do reading opens you up
to new perspectives especially when you're reading material from stages
that are higher than you so one of the mistakes
people make with reading is that they only read books
from their own stage for example a stage orange person
will read a lot of business and financial books nothing
wrong with that that's great that's important for for fully
integrating your own stage but but really to outgrow that
you need to start to read green books and yellow
books and turquoise books and that will grow you a
lot because by reading these books you're exposed to new
ideas and by the time you're exposed to all these
new ideas and new perspectives you can't deny them after
a certain number of years you know so much exposure
just makes it impossible to deny and then your mind
knows that you got to be heading for these higher
stages and not to get stuck in orange or whatever
stage you're stuck in another very powerful technique is having
higher consciousness friends or rather I guess higher stage friends
so a very sure way to grow into a new
stage is to surround yourself with friends from a higher
stage than you so if your orange right now surround
yourself with a bunch of hippies you will become a
hippie very quickly if you do that as long as
you can stomach it of course none of this is
gonna be easy all these techniques require lots of struggle
lots of opening your mind lots of there's gonna be
lots of resistance from your ego so it's not going
to be easy but it will work you know and
if you want to get to yellow surround yourself with
a bunch of yellow people and bunch of turquoise people
join a yellow community join a turquoise community now of
course the higher you go up the spiral the harder
it is to find these people because they're rarer and
rarer and rarer but still if you're really motivated you
can do it the other technique is solo retreats this
is a very powerful technique I've posted videos on my
blog about how I do my solo retreats basically ten
days alone in the woods in a cabin somewhere sitting
there and meditating and just being by yourself or contemplating
the entire ten days straight very powerful if you do
a few of those per year maybe one per quarter
ideally but even just like two per year for a
few years that will definitely boost you up by a
stage or two workshops and seminars are also available that
you can you can find workshops and seminars that are
staged orange green yellow and turquoise and all of those
will move you up as long as they're higher than
you and then I think also travel travel and exposing
yourself to new cultures new cuisines especially not the kind
of touristy travel where you kind of just go and
you go on a tour bus and you just see
the kind of standard stuff to people see but I
mean actually really exposing yourself to a different culture a
very foreign culture like maybe if you grew up in
the in America your whole life and then you go
and you spend a month or two living in the
Middle East or in Africa or somewhere in Thailand or
you know in Indonesia this kind of stuff like I
think that will grow you by a stage or two
because what that does that expands your perspective and that
shows you who just how limited your old perspective used
to be so in conclusion I want to make sure
I reiterate that there is only one thing in the
entire universe and that is being or consciousness there are
not actually stages to being or consciousness stages are a
conceptualization they are relative because all form all creation is
relative the absolute consciousness or being that the substance of
which everything is made that is just one thing but
then the structures that happen within it those are relative
structures and that's what spiral dynamics talks about right so
um there's really no contradiction between spiral dynamics and non
duality or enlightenment there's value to having relative truths and
so spiral dynamics is a relative truth it's not an
absolute truth so when you're when you're in a state
of Nirvana will there be Spile dynamics there no there
won't in a state of Nirvana there's your you're way
beyond spiral dynamics but you're not gonna be stuck in
a state of Nirvana forever you're gonna come back down
and then you have to interact in the relative world
and that's where spine AMEX becomes very useful and you're
still gonna be part of society you're gonna be part
of a culture you're gonna be part of a country
and so you probably want to improve your environment improve
your society and help raise the conscience of people and
in that sense Spa dynamics is very useful to be
able to do that and to analyze all of these
social problems that we have and finally remember that pathology
is possible at every stage it's possible to screw up
in the way that you are executing these stages such
that you don't grow through it and fully integrate it
but that there are some sort of hangups there are
certain things parts of the stage that you repress or
that you deny or that your ego reacts against and
therefore you become pathological at that stage so watch out
for that there are many many traps on this path
many ways that you can misinterpret a stage miss apply
this model not fully integrate the lessons of every stage
so you know the devil is in the details but
as far as an overall picture I think now you
have a much better sense of how spiral dynamics works
and how to apply it and get a lot more
use out of it than you did before all right
that's it I'm done here please remember to click that
like button for me and come check out actualize that
org that's my website you'll be able to find resources
there to help you with your journey my blog the
forum the life purpose course and the book list and
then I will be making more resources available in the
future and I'm always posting new insights on my blog
which are not available anywhere else and you won't get
those through videos here on YouTube so that's that the
last thing I'll say is is that we're still not
done with spiral dynamics you might think that we've beaten
this horse to death but no there's still going to
be one more episode that I intend to shoot about
spiral dynamics application all the ways in which file items
can be applied to all the problems within society there's
so much to be said about that and it's so
profound and it's gonna be so inspirational when you watch
that that make sure you stick around for that that's
gonna be coming in the future and also at some
point I will go back and I will create one
more episode for stage red which I haven't covered yet
and one more episode for stage purple which I haven't
covered yet those are sort of primitive stages but there's
still value in understanding those and there's still lessons that
you can you can glean from that so that will
be coming in the future although those two aren't nearly
as high priority for me as the applications episode I'm
really excited about the applications episode I actually wanted to
include it here but this one is gonna be so
long that well I didn't want this to be three
hours long so there you go stay tuned and that
will come in future you
