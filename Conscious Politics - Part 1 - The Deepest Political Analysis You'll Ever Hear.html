[Music] welcome to conscious politics part 1 the next level
of political analysis I'm really excited about this topic this
is gonna be a three maybe four part miniseries so
make sure you stick with me through the end because
each part is gonna build upon the next and they're
all gonna get better and better and better and it's
gonna be a very holistic and cohesive topic and the
reason we need so many episodes on this topic is
because we're we're working to address a very deep ignorance
within our populace and within our culture about how government
and politics works there are so many traps here and
so much ignorance from both sides of the aisle that
it it really requires a lot of correcting of preconceived
dogmas and ideas which is why we need to go
into so much detail now over the last couple of
years really since Donald Trump got elected I've spent I
spent a lot of time closely studying politics in a
way that I'd never have before and that's because I'm
concerned about what's going on but I'm not coming at
it from a partisan perspective I've been studying this issue
from a Spile dynamics stage yellow and turquoise perspective and
I've been having many awakenings over the last two years
so as I've been experiencing my own personal enlightenment and
awakening my spiritual awakening we might say I've also been
experiencing an awakening of sorts politically and I've discovered some
profound insights and principles about various problems that exist within
governments and politics which I think will be really practical
and useful to you guys so I really want to
lay the foundation here for conscious politics what I'm calling
conscious politics this is a new type of politics that
has really not existed before this is cutting-edge stuff we're
talking about a totally radically new way to think about
government and we're gonna start with very theoretical foundations but
it's not just gonna be empty philosophy and mental masturbation
we're going to talk about specific policy proposals and what
it's actually going to look like so don't don't get
scared off by this title of conscious politics it might
sound Larry fairy at first but uh it actually gets
very tangible and concrete as we get into it I'm
going to be telling you things that you've never heard
about before a new type of political analysis that you
don't see in mainstream media or anywhere on YouTube and
this is gonna completely change how you see politics for
the rest of your life for the better it's gonna
make you much more savvy politically and it's gonna also
give you tools intellectual tools for arguing with other ignorant
people who don't understand what politics is to bring them
around to proper understanding this is a very sprawling topic
which is gonna encompass a lot of stuff we've talked
about in the past so this is advanced stuff don't
think that as a newbie if you're just watching this
as your first actualized video don't think you're gonna understand
I'm gonna throw stuff in here that's going to be
very advanced and I expect that you've already watched some
of my other earlier episodes for example some prerequisites for
understanding what I'll be talking about here will include you
need at least a conceptual understanding of non-duality you need
an understanding of spiral dynamics go watch my six-part mini-series
on sprawl dynamics you need to watch my three-part miniseries
on self-deception because there's so much self-deception in this topic
you need to understand survival go watch my two-part series
understanding survival you need to understand collective ego you need
to understand devilry and evil go check out my episode
what is the devil and the mechanics of evil we
need to understand how ideology works check out my episode
how ideology works you need to understand relativity and relativism
go check out my episodes about relativism you need to
understand systems thinking go look at my episode intro to
systems thinking and you need to understand what love is
go see my episode what is love we're going to
be pulling all of these things together and really this
is sort of a payoff for those of you who've
been sticking around and watching this stuff and being diligent
and consistent if you watched all those episodes now we
get the desert this is the payoff from having that
very deep theoretical foundation so watch how all this stuff
comes together in a beautiful way politics and government is
extremely self deceptive it's not only that the politicians are
trying to deceive you it's that the politicians themselves are
thoroughly self deceived and you as the one who's voting
for them is also thoroughly self deceived so it goes
both ways it's bad in both ways it's not only
that we have bad politicians but the people who elect
the politicians themselves are extremely ignorant and so really you
can't blame the politicians in a simplistic way that people
do like you can't just say oh it's all Trump's
fault or it's all Congress's fault or it's all the
Democrats fault or it's all the Republicans fault no no
no no you're not appreciating how deep the problem of
politics and government goes but you will by the end
of this episode you're going to start - now I'll
be mostly talking about American politics I'll be using examples
for American politics because it's what most of my audience
is American but I know mostly a lot of you
are also watching me around the globe and you have
your own specific local politics but you have to understand
that the principles and ideas that I'll be explaining here
are globally applicable this is not just Democrats versus Republicans
conservativism and liberalism these are trends that exist all around
the world in all countries and actually there's a shocking
amount of similarity between the politics and various countries despite
individual local differences so the principles are gonna still apply
so it's gonna be useful to you now let's we're
gonna have to address so many objections here so you
know stick with me I know you have a lot
of objections and questions so I'll be trying to cover
many of them throughout this whole multi-part series so first
we have to address the elephant in the room which
is the objection of but Leo politics is such a
dirty and anti spiritual topic it's filled with ego isn't
it just a distraction I mean after all if you
just work on yourself you turn inwards you become awakened
you just do your spiritual practice and that will solve
all the world's problems Leo the world's problems aren't real
they're just imaginary you said it's just a dream so
why talk about politics well this is precisely false the
world's problems contrary to what many spiritual teachers will try
to teach you cannot be solved merely by turning inwards
if only it was that easy see there is an
individual layer to our problems and there's a collective layer
to our problems and generally traditional spiritual schools do a
pretty good job of helping us to fix our individual
problems but not our collective problems and in fact they
contribute deeply to our collective problems and one of the
ways you contribute to our collective problems is by denying
that we have collective problems or by trying to reduce
all collective problems to simply individual problems so this is
one of the first traps and of course there's also
a trap of conflating the absolute with the relative thinking
that just because you become conscious of some absolute truth
some awakening thing that that automatically means that now your
politics are gonna be in order not at all not
at all these are different domains now there's important lessons
that we need to bring in from the absolute domain
into the relative but we got to be careful about
how we do it we don't want to just do
a simplistic conflation here and in fact if you take
the position that spirituality and politics should be two totally
distinct fields unrelated to each other notice that itself is
a dualistic position because you're creating a boundary or a
duality between the two and of course as you should
understand what non duality teaches us is that everything is
interconnected when things are interconnected but then you artificially separate
them problems results see so actually if you think that
you're being non-dual by avoiding politics you're actually being dual
the non dual position would be to understand just how
important politics is towards the raising of the consciousness of
society and of individuals it's a lot easier to raise
the consciousness of an individual when he or she is
living in a higher consciousness society and when the society
and culture as a whole is not toxic overly materialistic
and dualistic and dogmatic and ideological and filled with cults
and filled with partisan politics and dysfunctions and pathologies of
various kinds see so there's a very important interplay between
the two and if the goal as the goal is
for example with Buddhists is to be a body sought
fund to help to enlighten the whole world if that's
your true goal as a Buddhist you got to take
politics and government very seriously because you're not going to
be able to do it one individual at a time
see there are social systemic problems at work here which
meditation and enlightenment alone will never fix as important as
meditation and laymen are so you got to be careful
not to just say that everything it's a societal problem
because of course that's not true you have to take
responsibility and develop yourself that's extremely important but we also
have to acknowledge these systemic problems when most when sorry
when the most conscious people refuse to engage in politics
and government because they think to themselves at oh well
I'm above all this ago--at dirty nonsense what ends up
happening is that the most unconscious people end up prevailing
and taking power and then they end up governing you
and you see how this is backwards we actually need
the most conscious people to be our leaders our politicians
our community organizers precisely because it's the consciousness that they
have and the levels of awakening that they've attained that
is what's gonna save the world you can't get some
egotistical neurotic pathological deluded person to be in control of
large groups of people placed in important positions otherwise what
you get is you get disaster sure you get disaster
so be careful you have a certain responsibility as being
a human and part of a society to not only
wake yourself up but then to help you use that
awakening to awaken the rest of the world by doing
nothing the status quo prevails you have to understand that
with politics you can't just sit this one out you
can just say oh well politics doesn't concern me doesn't
affect me it does no matter how much you deny
it it does you can't even live in a cabin
in the woods without politics affecting you because your ability
to live in those woods without getting harassed or oppressed
or murdered depends upon you being in a country which
protects you which has police which will have firefighters in
case you have a fire in your kitchen in your
cabin which will supply you with food and roads and
electricity and so forth so that you can live in
that cabin with some sort of sewage system you see
it's all very deeply interconnected but we'll be getting more
into that in a minute so the status quo if
you do nothing if you don't vote if you don't
take conscious politics seriously is not that you get to
ignore politics the default position then is unconscious politics which
is what we mostly have today and then you get
all sorts of results that are not ideal and what
you really have is you have devilry run amok it's
important you understand the way in which I use the
word devilry I'm not using that word to demonize people
even though I might sound like it I'm using that
word as a technical word to signify deep blind selfishness
and egotism go check out my episode what is the
devil it's a very important one especially when it comes
to politics so what happens if you just sit this
one out is that selfishness fear oppression and exploitation will
be the default and devilry will run rampant one of
the problems with traditional spiritual schools like Vedanta or Zen
Buddhism well and Christianity - and even Judaism really all
of them because they they emerged thousands of years ago
they're not good enough to solve today's problems because back
then ecology was not a serious concern the way that
it is today ecology is an extremely important topic which
I'll have a dedicated episode on in the future I
still have yet to talk about that but the problem
is that many of these traditional Orthodox spiritual schools do
not understand the importance of ecology and because people get
stuck in each traditional Orthodox teachings they think that well
these teachings are complete like Zen and Buddhism and Adviser
they're complete and they're perfect and there's nothing more to
add to them and this is precisely wrong there is
more to add that and one of the things to
add to them is ecology another thing to add to
them as systems thinking another thing to add to them
is modern psychology these are very important oversights that just
didn't exist back then because these are scientific developments that
have happened in the you know preceding ensuing centuries but
a lot of times these get ignored because people get
stuck on their favorite teacher teaching or tradition now what
we're doing here and talking about conscious politics is really
we're sort of going back to the roots of Western
civilization in ancient Greece Athens specifically where philosophy and politics
went hand in hand and to be a good citizen
you have to study rhetoric logic philosophy because you had
to understand human nature and in a sense you know
philosophy was how people did psychology back then and of
course morals and ethics that was part of philosophy as
well and it was understood back then that these two
go hand-in-hand and Athens had some important political innovations that
they developed and the reason that was is was because
they were such good thinkers and philosophers and so we
need to return to that that's what we're doing here
so even though it might sound kind of theoretical remember
that theory informs your practice when you don't have the
proper theory your practice is going to be all wrong
which is exactly what we're seeing today in our politics
in American politics especially and in Europe as well you're
seeing it in in South America and Brazil and really
you're seeing it in India as well you know you're
seeing the rise of nationalism and authoritarianism all around the
world these days it's it's problematic and I've been carefully
studying and observing like why is this happening and so
I want to share with you some of my insights
about that the first problem for understanding conscious politics is
selfishness bias and ideology immediately corrupts this discussion so even
as I'm starting to say some of the things that
I'm saying already people who are watching me who are
not conscious of their own selfishness egotism their own bias
and ideology who are stuck on some sort of ideology
whether it's a left-wing one or a right-wing one they're
immediately going to try to criticize me because the things
that I'm saying are gonna conflict with their ideology and
then we quickly get into some sort of partisan bickering
back and forth some argumentation some debate and we get
into culture wars these culture wars that we're seeing these
social justice warriors versus the anti social justice warriors this
sort of left and right bickering back and forth about
who can out own whom this creates a very big
problem because we're not able to have serious discussions about
serious issues this is all distraction go see my episode
about the egos favorite defense distraction that's what's happening collectively
right now within our culture with regards to politics and
government there are such important discussions that we're not having
we need to create enough elevation from the partisan food
fight that's going on right now to step outside of
all the ideology and the conventional group think that is
infecting both sides that we need to be able to
open our mind to something totally new and not just
be picking one side or the other that's a mistake
it's a false choice both sides are wrong in unique
ways and when I say that don't misunderstand me as
saying that they're both equally bad they're not equally bad
there's important asymmetries between the left and the right and
generally the right is more unconscious than the left but
see the problem is that even just for me to
say that already someone from the right hearing that is
gonna say oh well leo leo then is a leftist
that's what he is okay I understand him now but
see that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is
that there's a higher elevation that we need to reach
this higher of a late Evolet elevation is beyond left
and right but the problem is that sometimes from someone
who's at the lower elevation it can assume that someone
at a higher elevation is just some radical crazy leftist
and then in this way one's own bias and ideology
gets projected onto another who is actually trying to show
you the way trying to point out things to you
that you aren't missing in your worldview so be very
careful with projecting your own political biases on to me
what I'm presenting here is not a simple leftist position
but it might seem that way to some of you
so watch out rule number one of conscious politics is
at any position that you have is limited and highly
highly partial so the counterintuitive move then is to stop
defending your political positions understand that your own mind is
tricking you and using you when it is getting defensive
about your political positions see this allows us to get
a little bit of elevation conscious politics is about going
meta going beyond ideological positions and what I'm talking about
here this entire teaching of mine is a trans partisan
teaching now some people can construe a trans partisan teaching
as just the other side of some partisan debate be
careful about that I'm trying to show you new ways
of thinking about politics and government this is not merely
a left-wing position even though I will certainly be perceived
as a leftist because the truth is and this is
one of the truths that many right-wingers don't want to
hear but it has to be said because the left
and the right are not equal is that you cannot
be highly conscious and still maintain a right wing ideology
those two things are directly at odds with one another
and in fact the reason people adopt right-wing ideologies and
the further right the the worse it gets is because
they're not conscious of so much and that as you
become more conscious you'll realize that those far right-wing ideologies
become untenable but that's not to say that you just
go full-bore leftist and that there's no problems with that
either there are problems with both sides remember it's not
so much about picking left or right it's about which
elevation are you at that's the far more important metric
and this metric of what is one's elevation and by
elevation we're talking about is one's level of self-awareness and
consciousness that is the critical dimension that determines the quality
of one's politics not so much left versus right so
in the media the way that the stuff is talked
about this dimension of low consciousness versus high consciousness is
completely drowned and lost on all political analysis and all
political pundits and commentators as they get lost between the
left and the right and in this way they completely
miss analyze the situation so what you have to understand
is that because politics and governments are a matter of
life and death the first thing that the devil does
is try to demonize anyone who isn't acting blindly selfish
in the way that a devil wants see the way
our politics is done right now is that it's done
by Devils who are trying to be maximally selfish and
they think that just by being as selfish as they
can be that they will get as much as they
can out of the system for themselves and their tribe
and then hey once I win that then everything's fine
me and my tribe are happy this is the state
of our current politics this is not gonna work and
conscious politics is about going beyond that and recognizing how
the devil uses these systems and these ideologies to grab
a hold of our minds now remember I'm using the
word devil not literally but metaphorically here I'm not talking
about a guy with actual horns okay so the next
issue we have to address is how easily government today
is taken for granted in a sense we are victims
of our own success over the last 5,000 years human
civilization has evolved so much that people born today cannot
appreciate how much evolution has happened and they take government
totally for granted precisely because it is in such an
evolved State and it works so well most of the
time if you live in a first world western-style democracy
either in northern Europe or in America or a few
other countries there are some countries in the East like
Japan and so forth which are also pretty recent first-world
developed countries in these places for the most part you
can go about your life and live freely doing a
lot of stuff without ever thinking about politics or the
government's because it just works electricity just works roads just
work telephone lines and communication just works the internet just
works subway systems they just work you're able to speak
you're able to go online you're able to socialize you're
able to do so much stuff and you've taken all
of that for granted as though that's like how mankind
has been living in millennia past this is not at
all the case so it's very easy to not see
what government is doing for you and in this way
we can start to get very complacent and we can
adopt ideologies like oh well government is stupid voting is
for fools the system is just all rigged it's all
corrupt government is just getting in my way government's just
taxing me exploiting me these sorts of ideologies would never
spend quite a bit of time combating these ideologies because
it prevents us from taking a deeper look into what
government actually does for us and we'll be doing that
throughout this series notice that government is like a technology
it's a soft technology it's an abstract technology which is
difficult for us to get our minds around because it's
so complex and so abstract people don't usually think of
government as a technology but it definitely is in fact
it's more important than the internet or electricity or some
space rocket all of those harde technology all that gadget
or II that I call gadgetry all of that is
only possible because of prior technological advancements within politics and
government things like democracy that was an innovation a radical
innovation in its time someone had to invent democracy and
it wasn't at all obvious that democracy was was right
or proper or good you see because before democracy was
invented which was umbrella relatively recently in human history it
was dictatorship tyranny and monarchy or mob rule or mafia
or some sort of oligarchy or plutocracy where the majority
of people didn't have a vote didn't have a say
at all it's not that the elections were raged there
were no elections and the idea of an election was
absurd to people how could you give ordinary folks the
right to decide what the nation should be or who
the leader should be this this was insane a thousand
years ago or 2,000 years ago if you if you
tried to if you try to advance this idea people
would say you're a lunatic you're you're an idealist you're
a utopian this would never work notions like free speech
this is like a technology the idea that you should
have free speech minority rights is a relatively recent development
and very radical a fair judicial system a competent bureaucracy
religious freedom separation of church and state the right to
protest having a social safety net so that if you
lose your job you're not gonna starve on the streets
diplomacy environmental protections uncorrupted police who you can actually turn
to for help in case you're getting chased by a
murderer or a burglar or something currency free trade accountable
representatives who you could actually call and [ __ ]
to when something isn't going right who might lose an
election if they don't satisfy you and your friends term
limits and he trusts laws and I could go on
and on and on all of these things were inventions
someone had to think of them and then someone had
to convince the the people that these were good ideas
and often times there were bloody battles to put these
into place to confirm that they're good ideas and it
wasn't obvious that they were good ideas so be very
very careful about just taking these things for granted these
were all very massive innovations and also I want you
to notice that these were radical in their time see
one of the common problems that happens is that we
get stuck in the status quo you know sort of
groupthink where we just think that well we don't want
to be too radical in our politics we want to
be moderate we just want to be average but you
see the politics we have today the government we have
today is not moderate go back a hundred years 200
years 500 years a thousand years everything we have today
would have been considered extremely radical by the people of
of those ancient times see and so likewise we need
to be open mind to the possibility that there might
be radical new advances that need to be made within
society and within government especially as it grows it's also
very important to consider the problem of scale a lot
of people think about government without understanding the scale problem
they think of government assault like well government is just
like a big tribe it's really no different than having
a group of my friends or a hundred people together
no it's extremely different and then some people go further
and say they say well government is like it's really
no different than a giant corporation which has a couple
thousand people or maybe a hundred thousand employees no no
you don't understand government is a totally different order of
magnitude of thing even compared to our largest and most
complex corporations government is something different very different than any
other kind of organization and I'll be talking about why
in a moment right we're talking about hundreds of millions
of people that many governments in the world control hundreds
of millions but how do you organize and build a
consensus amongst hundreds of millions of people with diverse diverse
perspectives religions genetics different abilities different strengths and weaknesses different
ideologies mm different ethnicities how do you unify that many
people this is not an easy problem to solve it's
actually amazing that government is able to do it at
all and that it works as well as it does
most of the time sure of course we have problems
we have corruption we have war but generally you have
to admit living the 21st century is amazing if you're
living in a first world democracy compared to what it
was like to live 500 years ago I mean it's
amazing you need to wake up every single morning and
and pray to God that you live in the 21st
century and not a few centuries earlier otherwise your life
would be so much more miserable so just keep that
in mind but even as I say that some people
in the audience are still saying well Leo but what
is government really done for me some people get stuck
on this notion that government is just a like a
monkey on our back and it doesn't do anything for
us and that it just sucks us of our resources
and doesn't offer us anything in return so let me
just clarify what government has done for you first and
foremost and this is the biggest thing that people overlook
is that government protects you from enslavement oppression and genocide
this is very important what people don't understand is that
if there is no government some other group will come
and enslave you and you will have no say and
no vote about it this is a point we'll return
to in greater depth in a moment let me keep
going with this list though government also prevents external and
internal oppression realize that oppression doesn't just come from outside
some other country some neighbor of yours conquering you but
also from the inside internal oppression exploitation scammers Ponzi schemes
religious cults factions gangs mafia these are all internal forms
of oppression corporate oppression economic oppression that's very important government
prevents theft and ensures property rights some people especially the
libertarians one very critical of they they have this silly
notion that property rights is some Analia bull inalienable god-ordained
right that everyone has naturally this is completely false there
is no such thing as property rights unless they are
invented first by the government and then protected through physical
force of violence by the government otherwise people can just
steal from each other with no repercussions they have to
provide their own security and then that escalates very quickly
government also provides you with court systems and this is
super important people do not appreciate the significance of court
systems a court system is a peaceful means of resolving
a dispute without a court system what happens is that
people grab their knives and their guns and they go
for each other's throats and children so to live in
a country where there is an uncorrupted and relatively decent
and fair and honest court system that's something so many
people take for granted but it's it's something you really
appreciate when someone does you wrong and then you're able
to go to court and actually get redress sure it
could take years it cost a lot of money there's
problems with it the court systems are not perfect but
uh still far superior to having no court system at
all or to having a totally corrupt court system which
is paid off by by the people who have done
you wrong what else government is done for you it
prevents torture and cruel and unusual punishment now people say
Oh leo but government does do torture and cruel and
unusual punishment to some degree but generally a first world
democracy is going to protect you against those things and
of course the court system as well it prevents child
labor as well provides you with police and firefighters who
you can rely on and Trust who are not corrupted
or paid off provides riot control what happens when a
riot breaks out and there's no one to control it
that riot could kill you and your family could rape
you and your family provides you with criminal investigation prosecution
of various kinds of criminals not only hard criminals but
also con artists and other kinds of white-collar crime which
is equally as damaging provides prisons for serious criminals who
otherwise would be running around loose provide search and rescue
the coast guard if you're off on a boat somewhere
and you get lost in a storm the government will
come and save your ass in many cases natural disaster
relief for earthquakes fires hurricanes and floods and we're seeing
this more and more with our climate change problems emergency
health care if you cut off your hand you can
run to the emergency room and they'll sew it back
on infrastructure roads bridges the electric grid sewage systems most
people don't appreciate what it's like to live without a
sewage system see all of these things we take for
granted farming subsidies which prevent famines you know famines used
to be a common thing in first world democracies there's
no such thing as famine anymore even if you're poor
for the most part you still have access to food
government provides you with poverty relief in case you go
broke it's not perfect by any means but still there's
some kind of safety net there provides you with public
education universities what people don't realize is that without governments
the way it was a couple hundred years ago the
majority of people in society are illiterate and completely ignorant
and uneducated this lowers the whole standard of living of
the entire society so public education in universities is he's
a huge service that government offers government offers grants loans
and subsidies government creates national parks which are protected from
lodging and from trash and other sorts of private privatization
interests the post office minority rights most people don't appreciate
that minority rights are not going to be enforced without
a government without a government it's majority rule whoever is
the most powerful will dominate and destroy all minorities out
of racist hatred or ethnocentric eccentric preferences or cultural and
religious preferences minorities get wiped out government provides vaccines and
disease prevention from pandemics and so forth and it provides
the research and development to to create new vaccines and
cures building codes so your buildings don't collapse build to
high quality standards government provides insurance unemployment insurance flood insurance
retirement insurance like Social Security disability insurance many of these
things are non-existent without government government provides food regulations and
meat inspections most people don't realize how dirty meat is
unless it's inspected by the government the entire books have
been written centuries ago about how terrible the meat industry
was in America for example just a hundred years ago
before there was a massive movement to get their own
government to crack down and to do meat inspections because
like there was feces in the meat a business you
know just cutting costs try to maximize profits so of
course they don't need to keep a clean butchering table
oh when they're butchering animals because that cuts down on
their profits you know they have to clean stuff you
know restaurants kitchens they don't need to be clean unless
the government demands that they're clean and then people get
sick and died from that government provides pollution regulation begging
regulation currency enforcement market protection when markets take a downturn
when there's a depression governments allows satellites allocation of radio
bandwidth R&D funding for science technology and new drugs space
exploration historical preservation of fossils and artifacts that otherwise would
be gobbled up by private collectors and kept in their
mansions and then historical sites would be desecrated can you
imagine for example if some corporation bought the Great Pyramids
of Egypt if that wasn't controlled by the Egyptian government
but it was run by some some shady corporation well
what that would what that would turn into they would
just sell off the whole pyramid brick by brick to
the highest bidder government provides accountability for business antitrust regulations
government collects and shares statistical data in an objective way
government offers peace treaties arms treaties and diplomacy that otherwise
would not be possible government looks after foster homes and
adoption services can you imagine if foster homes and adoption
services were for private business businesses that were run for-profit
how terrible that would be as terrible as they are
already just try to imagine how terrible they would be
if they were run for profit by some giant corporation
literally children be sold off for money it offers prevention
of the proliferation of nuclear weapons can you imagine if
private corporations were able to build and develop their own
nuclear weapons what would happen there would be no life
on this planet and it offers certification accreditation for various
doctors lawyers psychologists psychiatrists and pharmacists and various kinds of
legal professions which ensures high quality standards so all of
that government does for you so don't don't tell me
that government doesn't do anything for you now of course
the libertarian comes in here says oh alia but all
of these things the private sector can do just as
well we don't need the government for the post office
because we can have FedEx and UPS and you know
we don't need we don't need government to to to
provide vaccines the business community will just do it and
space exploration you know we have SpaceX they're doing a
better job than NASA this is fantasy the private sector
cannot fulfill all these functions of course yes some functions
the private sector can fulfill and it can supplement government
but many of these things the private sector cannot do
specifically what this private sector cannot do is it cannot
insure you against enslavement it cannot provide a fair court
system for adjudicating disputes because if the private sector was
controlling these things it would be for profit you pay
the right person the right amount of money and they
will rule in your favor or they will enslave whoever
you want or allow you to enslave who are whoever
you want while they look the other way this is
how it word works in many underdeveloped third-world countries their
police and their courts are so corrupt that the way
to do business is just to bribe and the person
with the most money gets to bribe whoever they want
and get away with anything that's how it works this
is the reality of human nature you have to understand
that human nature is utterly vicious it doesn't follow any
more moral norms it has to be enforced by somebody
these moral norms can't even be taught because there's not
schools to teach in government you understand and what libertarians
don't understand is that if given the chance to do
so the private sector would enslave you the largest corporation
will arise and amassed so much power that it will
be in its financial best interest to enslave all of
its employees and all the other smaller corporations which it
can buy up and make part of itself until this
one corporation ends up taking over the entire region and
becomes a sort of pseudo government except the problem will
be that you're not gonna have a vote in this
corporation this corporation is not gonna have any kind of
Bill of Rights or a Constitution it's not gonna be
held accountable by any kind of court system there's not
gonna be any representation it's just gonna be that one
guy who owns all the stock of the corporation he's
going to become the pseudo corporate dictator and if you
think that a corporation would not enslave you if given
the chance you really underestimate the motivations of corporations they
will certainly enslave you if given the chance they will
develop nuclear weapons they will develop their own armies they
will buy off whoever they want they will overpower whoever
they want they will buy up as many smaller corporations
as they can until they have monopolized everything so watch
out how much had credit you give to corporations you
really need to appreciate how vicious human nature is there
is no such thing as the non-aggression principle the non-aggression
principle has to be enforced with aggression that's what government
is about tada that's what we're talking about here that's
why it's so important that's why people take it so
seriously and get so ideological about it because it is
a matter of life and death there are many problems
with the Spile dynamic stage Orange worldview and it's politics
go check out my episodes spa dynamic stage Orange that's
perhaps the most important one for you to watch and
to understand for our purposes here because most people who
follow me are at a spa dynamic stage orange level
of psychological and cognitive and moral and spiritual development which
is not a very high level and this level is
characterized by some specific political misunderstanding which I want to
just list off for you here first of all people
who are stuck in stage orange these are tent these
tend to be the libertarian types the individual lists or
for freedom and no government the problem is that they
turn freedom into an ideology into an absolute good without
really understanding the limitations of freedom and what freedom really
means we'll go into that in a minute another problem
is that they have a fantasy of free markets they
think that if we just let the free markets do
whatever they need to do that everything will just work
out fine this is not going to work I've already
explained various various examples why doesn't work if you truly
allow a free market what happens is enslavement not a
healthy well-functioning economy and really we don't have free markets
anyways we never had and we never will there's no
such thing as free markets there's always somebody manipulating the
market controlling it from one side or another it ain't
ever free and these so-called free markets are always propped
up by physical violence and aggression see so it's a
power play it ain't free at all it's a libertarian
fantasy the notion that you can privatize everything to make
it good is absurd privatizing the national parks is not
going to make them better it's gonna make them worse
and it's going to lead to various kinds of corporate
exploitation because the problem with corporations is that they're only
function and their only motivation at least right now at
the level of development at these corporations are at is
exploit everything monopolize everything to maximize profit and all costs
damn the environment damn the people damn the impact on
anybody else this is a problem so that needs to
be kept in check and the problem is these corporations
are not accountable to anyone except their stockholders which are
usually a select few number of people not the majority
so in a sense a corporation if a corporation becomes
too powerful it ends up being anti-democratic because this corporation
has so much power that actually becomes more powerful than
the government and yet most citizens who are under the
influence of its power don't have any say in what
the corporation does or decides or as with a good
government first world democracy you do have some say that
is an important distinction that is lost on many libertarians
these stay George libertarians also subscribe to a fantasy of
individualism this idea that you are just you are individual
everyone's an individual they're just responsible for themselves there is
no collectivism we're not part of a community and you
know leave me alone leo I'm just gonna do my
thing and you can do your thing and this is
how we're gonna live this is a fantasy of pure
fantasy it has never worked this way human beings even
when we were pre humans when we were Neanderthals or
humm and earlier hominids and chimp like creatures we lived
in troops we were communal you were never individualistic it's
impossible to survive in life as a chimp or as
an ape of some kind as an individual you just
don't find it this is a fantasy and in fact
the only reason you can sit here and extol the
virtues of individualism and talk about how we're all individuals
and you can just go off and live by yourself
and nobody bother you this is a modern luxury that
is only possible thanks to government thanks to millennia of
evolution of government and all these infrastructures that have been
built and for which was paid a lot of blood
and tears and suffering to allow you to sit here
and to talk about how we're all individuals you're kidding
yourself you're not really an individual you're part of a
collective you're both I'm not saying you're only a collective
you are part of a collective but you're also an
individual that needs to be that paradox needs to be
held at the same time they're important some people get
too much hung up on one or the other without
seeing that there's a balance that's happening there they're very
complicated and nuanced balance humans are like ants or termites
in a termite colony no individual ant can survive by
himself it's impossible so get rid of this fantasy that
you were some individual ant you're not an individual ant
you're part of the entire colony get used to it
you'll learn that as you evolve up the spiral my
bag is issued another problem with the stage oranged level
of politics is that it doesn't see any collective problems
it thinks all problems are just a problem of personal
responsibility and that if if that person just took more
responsibility for his life or her life then that would
solve the problem there's also this sort of sense of
entitlement that winners and losers both deserve what they get
so those of us who do well in the economy
we deserve it and those of us who do terribly
well we deserve it too because we're not working hard
enough this ignores the systemic problems that are really at
work and the various kinds of manipulations that humans do
in order to ensure that they win and that others
lose this is ignored by libertarians and the extent to
which people will rig the system in their own favor
the staged orange people also generally are just about maximizing
profits and growing the economy as much as possible never-ending
growth assuming this will solve all of our problems when
in fact our problems are way deeper than that and
they will never get solved no matter how much economic
growth we experience in fact the more the economy grows
while ignoring the the real problems the worse those problems
become because we're ignoring a deeper cancer these stage orange
people tend to be unlimited materialists life for them as
a material exercise and they have a philosophy of materialism
scientism and generally they're anti spiritual anything spiritual sounds new
agey Andrew to them or it sounds theocratic and religious
and and all of this is to be done away
with and their ideal society is just like a hyper
rational hyper materialist hyper scientific society this of course tends
to pair with a sort of toxic masculinity this idea
that men and masculinity is the way the society should
be run and that femininity this is kind of a
weak way to structure society and that society is weakened
when women come into positions of power or when feminine
values are offered to men that this somehow weakens the
man these feminine values when nothing could be further from
the truth it's a sort of a philosophy of me
me me my own survival at all costs is survival
of the fittest that's the stage orange philosophy many of
our businesses Wall Street fortune 500 companies CEOs they subscribe
to this sort of philosophy they think that is survival
the fittest and I'm just gonna get as much as
I can for myself damn the environment dan what happens
to other people who cares about my employees I don't
care about their suffering it's just as long as I
get what I want I get my millions and billions
then everything will be fine Leah what's the problem once
I have my millions and billions I can hire private
security I can buy my own property my own houses
I can defend it all everything's fine I don't need
to worry about the environment because I'll just I'll just
get myself clean water and I'll just live in a
non polluted area it's this sort of mentality it's very
myopic selfish mentality and it takes for granted courts and
bureaucracy these are thought to be bad bureaucracy léo bureaucracy
that's bad we don't want a bureaucracy ha actually what
you want is more bureaucracy you want high quality bureaucracy
that's one of the key things that differentiates first world
country from a third world country is the quality of
their bureaucracy and the quality of their courts but get
to that a little bit later so now let's go
to the very fundamental question I've sort of I've tried
to address a lot of objections here because we can't
even had this discussion without having spent an hour talking
about all these traps and problems and incorrect ways of
thinking so now finally after an hour of introduction we
can talk about what is government why does it really
exist so for this we need to really go back
into the history books and take a look at how
human society evolved and developed here's a simplistic little version
of why government exists so government is a human invention
it doesn't exist unless humans invent it agreed is this
obvious enough to you I hope so because there's no
government for example within a chip society so a million
years ago there was no government and even a hundred
thousand years ago government was very very limited government really
started to arise only when mankind was able to settle
down thanks to developments in agriculture and to accumulate resources
in one area because before that if you look at
the animal kingdom animals take a look at giraffes lions
polar bears dragonflies mice whatever they're not able to accumulate
large stashes of resources see mostly what they do is
that every day they have to go out and find
food for themselves and they can only find as much
food as they can carry and that food could last
them maybe a few days maybe a week maybe a
month at most and then they got to go out
and find more they can't just like you know a
lion can't just build up a hoard of a hundred
thousand antelopes that he just has for himself you know
in his den he has to go out every day
and hunt for them otherwise he starves and he dies
so you might say well so what what's the big
deal it's a very big deal when a species comes
to the point where they're actually able to accumulate resources
so when mankind stops just running around and hunting buffaloes
and being nomadic but when mankind acquires cultivated animals who
can be stationary who he can milk and farm and
so forth and get food from and when he can
plant wheat and other crops and and grow his own
food now he can acquire stashes of grain tons of
grain which become valuable and so here's the real problem
of government in the animal kingdom there are no rules
notice that it's extremely brutal and selfish anything that you
can do in the animal kingdom to assure your own
survival is fair play and that's how animals play and
if you notice animals tend to be very deceptive they're
very sneaky nature is very sneaky because when it comes
to survival it's a matter of life and death and
there are no moral qualms about what it takes to
survive if you got to eat somebody you eat them
if you got to fool somebody you fool them if
you have to camouflage yourself and then like a rattlesnake
bite someone in the neck from a camouflage position you
know bite a rabbit or whatever as he's passing you
by you do it you do it if you got
a cannibalize your own children to survive you do it
that's how nature works it's extremely brutal we as humans
today we find ourselves in a very cushy position where
we are protected from this brutality and that's thanks to
government and that's why government Rose is because what happened
was that as these resources got accumulated there were many
small tribes remember humans were never individualistic we always lived
in tribes fifty people a hundred people 200 people whatever
it was doesn't matter but it was a tribe and
within that tribe there was a form of pseudo government
there was a sort of structure there was no individualism
when you're living in a tribe you're at Spile dynamic
staged purple you don't even have a sense of self
or personal autonomy or individuality you are living for that
tribe you are like an ant in an ant colony
so keep this in mind you libertarians make sure you
get your human development right so we have these different
tribes and these tribes start to accumulate resources grain various
metals objects that they work plates pots houses they develop
families children wives all of this farm lands herd animals
you know sheep and cows and all this sort of
stuff skins and pelts and furs and and all this
various kinds of tools weapons and now there's an interesting
development one tribe gets the crazy idea that hey you
know instead of growing my own crops and hurting my
own animals and going collecting food every day now that's
a lot of work why don't I just go to
the neighboring tribe which is completely defenseless has no perimeter
has no border has no weapons because all they do
is they're just peacefully farming and let me just conquer
them and steal all their stuff and while I'm at
it I'll rape their women too and I'll enslave their
children and then they can work for me and not
only do I get to conquer them but I get
to enslave them such that they work for me and
do all the work for the rest of my life
brilliant perfect this is the perfect survival strategy so of
course I make some weapons and I go do it
but what's the problem with this survival strategy it works
the short term but it doesn't work in the long
term because there's a lot of tribes around the entire
earth there's hundreds there's thousands there's hundreds of thousands of
different tribes and there's always under this situation a stronger
tribe so while you or I might go and conquer
those defenseless weak people over there we might do that
but then ten years later some stronger tribe comes and
conquers and enslaves us and rapes all our wives do
we like that no we don't like that and then
see that stronger tribe even when it conquers us some
even stronger tribe will come and conquer them and enslave
them so what happens is that we see the rise
of the classical Greek and Roman sort of city-state all
throughout the Mediterranean and other parts around the world we
see societies as city-states not countries but city-states which means
it's a city with a walled perimeter a very thick
high wall and that wall is the only thing that
protects that city and those citizens from being butchered people
don't appreciate this you know what the standard was in
the Mediterranean area with these city-states around - two and
a half thousand years ago here was the standard operating
procedure if your city got attacked and your wall was
penetrated and your city was conquered the standard rule was
that all of the men in your city would be
slaughtered all of the women would be raped and the
women and the children would be enslaved that was the
rule that was the whole point of conquering other cities
which is why you see they build these massive walls
because that wall is the only thing that's keeping you
from getting raped and enslaved or your throat slit that's
human nature that right there I want you to understand
that that is freedom that is freedom that is how
freedom works it's gang warfare the most powerful ends up
conquering everybody else and it's a situation which is quite
nasty and brutal and humans don't like it so what
we looked for is we looked for systems that were
less brutal how do we mollify these extremes of violence
and conquering and slaving and thieving and stealing and raping
and and all of this how do we prevent that
by creating a government first and foremost the government was
created simply as a means of defense against enslavement that's
literally what it was and our early governments were quite
brutal themselves because they what they were protecting us from
was a greater brutality of enslavement murder and rape and
genocide so we could tolerate a little bit of cruelty
towards our own citizens as long as it protects us
against the greater cruelty of what our enemies and other
tribes and foreigners will do to us if we don't
unify together you see we were forced to unify it
was an arms race if you didn't unify you were
murdered enslaved and raped that was your reality there was
no option to say oh well wait a minute guys
wait a minute guys but what about the non-aggression principle
what about morals what about being nice and kind isn't
slavery and rape wrong don't you realize that it doesn't
matter they'll enslave and rape you anyways there is no
non-aggression principle at this point there is no moral standards
at this point they weren't evolved or developed yet this
is the animal kingdom the animal kingdom is freedom this
is what freedom means and this this notion of freedom
is extremely important for us to explain in a bit
more detail so many people misunderstand freedom and it leads
to a lot of confusion within our politics freedom is
not an absolute good you have to understand from the
human perspective freedom has deep complexity to it and it
tends to be very counter intuitive and fold in on
itself so here's what true freedom means true freedom means
that I'm allowed to do whatever I want and you
are allowed to do whatever you want and there are
no rules that's true freedom that means if I like
your wife I can rape her if I like your
daughter I can I can slit your throat in the
middle of the night and I can take her for
myself and I can make make her my slave and
she'll be feeding me grapes at gunpoint for the rest
of her life that's freedom you libertarians out there understand
that what freedom means people get this idea that all
freedom is all good and it's all rainbows and butterflies
if only we had more freedom no freedom is something
you need protection against you're way too weak and you
care about your own petty little comforts in life too
much to tolerate true freedom so we collectively as a
species what we did the freedom was so brutal that
we have to find systems to mollify it and therefore
we accept the limitation in a sense government is about
reducing absolute freedom for the purpose of fairness and peace
so we accept certain limitations so that we can avoid
getting enslaved and raped and thieved and murdered and scammed
and all those other things we need somebody to adjudicate
these for us we need to lay down some common
rules that we can all agree upon that we can
act on so that we can just live a peaceful
life and just go about our daily business and just
walk down the street without getting raped that's the reality
but how do you get millions of people with different
backgrounds ethnicities religions languages and worldviews and values and levels
of development and conscious how do you unify all of
those people to agree on a common set of rules
about what is right and what is wrong you might
think oh well let's see it's obvious it's easy you
know people know that it's wrong to kill don't they
don't know they don't people go and it's wrong to
rape no they don't people know that it's wrong to
scam people no they don't that's the whole problem if
they knew all those things if people were just well-behaved
then you're right we can live in libertarian fantasy and
we wouldn't need any strong government or military or any
of these things but that's not real life that's fantasy
I'm talking about real life in real life when you
give people freedom total freedom they enslave murder and rape
you and they steal from you that's what they do
because that's survival survival is [ __ ] brutal it
doesn't care about being good it doesn't care about being
moral it doesn't care about being fair he doesn't care
about equality it only cares about life its own life
it doesn't care about other life it only cares about
its own life it only cares about its own people
his family its friends maybe it's tribe maybe it's religion
but nobody else outside of that all foreigners are disposable
all minorities are disposable anyone who's not like me is
disposable anyone with a different skin color is disposable anyone
with a different gender is disposable this is how low
consciousness people live this is how they think how do
you solve this problem this is a very serious problem
I want you to understand the depth of the problem
that government solves it's amazing that it even worked at
all this is as humans this is our most remarkable
technology and we don't even think of it as a
technology so freedom is counterintuitive you think maximum freedom would
be great but actually it ends up being very harmful
so we have to limit it but of course if
you limited freedom too much then it also becomes a
sort of oppression and it kind of goes full circle
and it turns into its own form of enslavement as
well so there has to be very careful dynamic balance
between between the two also I want you to notice
freedom is counterintuitive in the following way at first it
seems like we have to give up our freedoms in
order to prevent ourselves from being attacked and enslaved by
neighboring tribes and it might seem like that's a like
that's a downer it's like oh man I have to
give up my freedoms my individualism in order just to
not be raped and and killed and all that and
it might seem like that's that's a downside but actually
it goes deeper than this yes you give up certain
freedoms but then as government allows us to unify together
were able to be more than the sum of our
parts were able to coordinate in collective ways we're able
to build things that we couldn't build by ourselves what
a million unified people could do and build is very
different than what a hundred unified people can do and
build a million people can build something much greater than
what a hundred people can build and so in a
certain sense what happens is that we build stuff we
build up infrastructure and that infrastructure then ends up increasing
our freedom so for example 2,000 years ago you didn't
have the freedom to fly around the world because there
were no airplanes there were no airports there was no
electricity there was no government that enabled these things and
if you think that you can have airports and electricity
and airplanes and global travel for one country to the
next effortlessly the way that we can today where you
can just kind of go on priceline.com and you can
just buy a ticket for 500 dollars for $1,000 and
fly halfway around the world in the next 24 hours
if you think that that would be possible without modern
governments you're completely deluding yourself all of that is enabled
by modern governments modern infrastructure you see so yes you
had to give up some freedoms your ancestor had to
give up some freedoms 2,000 years ago but that was
the cost that was paid to ensure that now we
have all sorts of amazing freedoms like the internet YouTube
social media amazing food from all around the world available
in any supermarket you didn't have this couple thousand years
ago airplane travel cars and just like I could spend
an hour listing all these different freedoms that now we
have we can go into outer space even which would
totally not be possible without government without infrastructure don't think
it is simplicity like all well but space set Leo
SpaceX is a private company and it can build a
rocket better than government this is so superficial you have
to understand that SpaceX is standing on the shoulders of
giants you can't have a SpaceX without first having a
stable government and without having NASA and other government programs
that paved the way for what SpaceX was able to
do so yes of course now SpaceX and other private
industry will colonize space and that's great but you have
to understand why that's possible the freedom that SpaceX has
comes only on the shoulders of giants that came before
it see is very important to understand and appreciate it's
also important understand that there are trade-offs between individualism and
collectivism it's not that individualism is best or collectivism is
best this is a false dichotomy the reality is that
these need to be dynamically balanced all the time within
society we need to at the same time allow people
to have individual rights and freedoms and autonomy but also
realize that these individuals are not really individuals but they're
part of a larger collective and that there are certain
benefits that we get from being a collective in fact
mankind's greatest strengthens of species were the most powerful species
on this planet because we're able to form cohesive ordered
collectives on a massive scale like no other species is
able to do you could have a small herd of
antelope you could have a school of fish but what
it's like a couple hundred a couple thousand fish in
a school at most maybe you have a flock of
birds that has a couple thousand birds in it but
but there's no serious organization there so they're not able
to do anything really interesting so really these animals are
just restricted to very basic things like shelter food and
a couple of other basic things they're not able to
do anything interesting and therefore they are very limited you
might say a bird is very free yes a bird
is free in the sense that it doesn't have a
government controlling it but notice also how limited the bird
is it's not free in the sense that all it
does is shits and eats and has sex and that's
all it can do and it can't cure its own
diseases it can't build nice shelters for itself it can't
educate itself there so they're so limited see so we
as a species because we're more intelligent were more capable
we need that collectivism we need to form a community
not only are we forming a community because it serves
us individually but also it's something that feel good being
part of a community gives you a sense of larger
purpose which a lot of people on stage Orange overlook
the importance of community community is not an evil you
know there are problems with taking collectivism too far certainly
there are problems it needs to be delicately balanced but
there's an even deeper point here which many people don't
understand at all which is that society is a whole
lawn and human beings are whole ants what is this
a hold on mmm hold on it's a whole topic
that I'll have an episode on in the future but
a whole lawn means that it's a part and a
whole simultaneously so for example my hand is a whole
lawn what that means is that it's a whole and
that it can do whatever hand does and we can
call it a hand and we can understand that it's
a whole you know hand is like an individual unit
but also it's made up of little cells and molecules
and muscles and bones and tendons in each of those
or parts of the whole so in this way the
hand is made up of smaller things but also the
hand itself is a smaller part of my entire body
and the hand itself doesn't have any power or ability
unless it's part of my heart and my brain it's
all interconnected my whole nervous system and all this you
know the hand needs the teeth because without the teeth
I can't eat food and I can't generate the calories
that are necessary to power this hand so you see
how it's deeply interconnected this way likewise the hand can't
be a handless it has all the parts that it
needs it needs the bones it needs the veins it
needs the blood it needs the molecules that are making
up this hand so here is the problem that people
fall into they don't recognize that human beings are also
whole ons we are not the highest unit there is
a society above us so the way that nature works
is that there are whole lawns within whole lawns within
whole lawns within whole lawns all the way up and
all the way down but we humans tend to be
so arrogant that we think that all of this is
just for us and is just all for my personal
individual ego and then we forget that we're part of
this larger collective we're part of a communion we're part
of society which is its own whole on and so
the trick with these whole ons is that there's always
a delicate balance that needs to be struck between the
autonomy of an individual part versus the communion that that
part takes part in of some larger hold on so
for example for my hand to function my hand cannot
have a will of its own it needs to be
subject to the communion of the larger unit that is
a part of you know because if my hand had
it's its own desires and ideas it would start doing
whatever it wants right this would be a problem because
the hand then is not serving me the higher unit
that it's designed to serve so the hand needs to
know its place within the whole scheme otherwise it becomes
pathological and dysfunctional so this is what happens with a
lot of libertarians and staged orange people is that they
are like the hand which forgets that it's part of
something larger and so they act like individuals swing their
pendulum all the way to the side towards 100% freedom
and autonomy without recognizing that it's not just about autonomy
it's about communion as well you don't just want 100
percent individualism and autonomy you want some measure of communion
but also you don't want too much communion to the
point where you just become like the Borg collective and
your own individuality is completely wiped out so what you
have to understand is that when we're talking about government
in society there's more going on than just a bunch
of individuals at each level of reality when you get
a bunch of little parts together combine them together it's
more than the sum of its parts so reductionism doesn't
work we can't just reduce the hand to a bunch
of atoms even though it is a bunch of atoms
but we can't just reduce it to that because the
hand has its own unique functions that atoms do not
have it has emergent qualities likewise societies and governments and
groups of people and communities have their own emergent properties
so government is not only responsible for regulating individuals and
creating a great life for individuals government is also responsible
for regulating groups of individuals because within a society you
have subgroups you have religious denominations you have political parties
in factions you have cults you have corporations and businesses
you have clubs you have sports teams you have all
of this stuff that I talked about in my episode
about collective ego and so society needs to not only
deal with individual egos but also collective egos which adds
an additional layer of complexity to this entire thing of
course on top of all that society as a whole
is one giant collective ego which is more than the
sum of its parts so this is very tricky as
you can see this is very complicated now you can
see that the way that we discuss politics none of
this has taken into account usually usually all that it
is is it's just one individual or one lobbying group
lobbyists group special interest group trying to look out for
its own individual interests without caring about the interests of
anybody else in society and this creates a sort of
myopia the sort of stage orange myopia which creates for
a very dysfunctional society and in a nutshell we can
boil all this down to simply blind selfishness or what
I call devilry when you're acting out of blind selfishness
without any concern for your impact on your environment or
others around you or what it means for society as
a whole you're being a devil and you can expect
the kind of results that a devil gets you can
just expect a lot of evil corruption and all sorts
of other problems including of course suffering which is why
we're you know this whole topic is to reduce suffering
that's our whole goal here fundamentally what reality is doing
on a metaphysical level is that it's dividing itself and
that it's figuring out ways to reunite with itself and
it's doing this over and over and over and over
again at all levels of reality from molecules to cells
to individual humans to societies to countries this is what's
happening division is problematic because every boundary that's created needs
to be enforced and maintained and these boundaries are always
temporary and they can die which leads to suffering if
you get too attached to one of these boundaries so
what mankind has been doing since the beginning of its
existence is that it started off as like a unified
group of people let's say in sub-saharan Africa then they
all migrated around the world and by doing that they
divided themselves into various tribes and races and ethnicities over
thousands of years and then eventually these tribes all grew
into cities and city-states and countries and all this and
then they started to clash with each other and because
you know the populations just got too big and they
started to to overwhelm the environment to the point where
they started some bleed literally bleed into each other every
tribe grew so much that it's like a fungus you
know - fungus is just like growing into each other
and clashing with each other to the point where we
are in a world now where it's no longer sustainable
to stick to one tribe because we're recognizing that were
a global species see you can either deny that and
resist that or you can accept it if you deny
it then that creates all sorts of serious political problems
violence war genocide and so forth this happens because people
deny that we have divided ourselves and that now the
proper thing is to start to unify ourselves and that
this is totally proper and natural this is just how
reality works at a metaphysical level this is what happens
and then once we unify we'll divide again there will
be further divisions for example when humans start to colonize
the Moon and Mars and the rest of the solar
system we're going to divide ourselves again you see and
then after a certain point once all the planets get
populated 100,000 years from now you know once Mars is
full and the moon is full then they starts a
war with each other now we have to unify them
again see what's happening human political history has a definite
arc to it I want you to notice this arc
what this arc is ultimately doing is its leading towards
greater equality and consciousness less brutality less oppression less enslavement
greater complexity greater freedom because remember by building up infrastructure
and complexity we're actually able to do new things that
could not be done before like space travel there cannot
be space travel without governments and it's leading to greater
unity and the long run the very long run of
course it's not perfectly linear there's always ups and downs
so you know you could be living through an era
or a century where there's a lot of disunity there's
a lot of war there's a lot of violence but
then after that passes there will be a higher level
of complexity more fairness more equality and less suffering and
then more unity and then and then that will also
you know oscillate and go up and down and back
and forth so what is politics and government really about
first and foremost it's about survival individual and collective survival
there's no such thing as survival in the abstract or
survival as a universal for everybody survival is relative to
your identity whatever you identify as is the thing that
needs to be survived so what do you identify as
being a Christian a Muslim a Jew an atheist a
man a woman French German Japanese American Native American African
American rich poor upper class middle class lower class gay
straight transsexual bisexual identity plays a huge part in politics
its central its central it's not just that the Left
plays identity politics everybody is playing identity politics all the
time that's what politics is about and not only is
it individual in any it's collective identity you know do
you identify as a hippie as a punk as a
socialist a communist a capitalist as an American these are
all collective identities you see people get attached their collective
identity just as much as they do to their individual
identity these things are fused together and so this is
why politics gets so heated and gets so emotional and
it gets so irrational and it gets so unconscious is
because people are generally not conscious of the fact that
identity is the thing that's being survived because they haven't
done this work that we've been doing with actual eyes
that aren't they don't understand what an ego is or
what a collective ego is they're just blindly acting out
on selfishness that's what low consciousness means you're not conscious
of your selfishness you're not conscious of the selfishness of
your tribe or of your collective so many Americans are
not conscious of how America as a whole is extremely
selfish as a nation neither are african-americans or Jews or
Muslims see so I'm not picking on any one particular
group here this is a rampant problem for 99% of
people nobody is immune to this stuff and it's extremely
tricky so what is politics and government really about it's
about moderating between different competing survival agendas regulating this selfishness
so that people are selfish but not in extreme ways
because if it's too extreme it's it's not pleasant for
anybody and in fact selfishness itself becomes its own worst
enemy it's Karma you might think that we'll believe but
being super selfish what's wrong with that well what's wrong
with that is it comes back around what's wrong with
going in and raping your neighbor's wife what's wrong is
that then he comes back and does it to your
wife see if you could just go do that again
get away with it without any repercussions then there wouldn't
be anything wrong with it per se you could have
moral objections but I mean just like pragmatically there'd be
nothing wrong with it but in practice there's a big
problem because it's tit for tat you do something nasty
to somebody else they do it back to you have
you noticed how this works in relationships a relationship needs
to be rather even where one side is not so
selfish that it's taking everything and dominating the other side
because because that ends up being unsustainable because this side
the one that's getting dominated and pressed builds a resentment
and what is up happening is it gets so resentful
that it takes a knife in the middle of the
night and cuts the other guy's dick off that's what
happens that's reality right so we need to come to
a sort of truce we say okay look okay look
I won't cut your dick off you won't cut my
dick off and we'll live peacefully ok can we agree
to that and of course you know some people agree
to it and some people still don't agree to it
because they think that I can get away with it
I'll cut off his dick but he won't cut off
mine because I'll have an army bhai see it sort
of but then that doesn't last because there's always a
bigger army and then also you're always living in fear
that someone's gonna cut your dick off even if you
have a giant army still when that tyrant or dictator
is sleeping at night he's still having dreams and nightmares
about getting his dick cut off so what is politics
about it's about distribution of power and resources this very
silly idea that's thrown around in the media that all
these Socialists are for redistribution of wealth and that this
is a bad thing all government and politics is about
redistribution of power and resources that's the whole game it's
a giant negotiation we're sitting in a negotiation table and
we're trying to decide who has too much power and
too many resources and the way that most people play
the game because they're so selfish is that their strategy
is simply to maximize their own power and resources they
don't care about fairness or equality so even if I
already have more power than everybody else more money than
everybody else if I'm a stage Orange typical CEO or
corporate person I don't care I need more I need
more power I need even more resources cuz it's not
enough that I have billions I need trillions cuz I
have enemies out there Leo if I don't do it
some other company will do it so I got to
do it that's their thinking it's all about redistribution of
power and resources what do you think lobbying is about
every single major corporation in America and really all around
the world lobbies their government why so that the rules
of the game can be rigged in such a way
that resources are redistributed to them rather than their competitors
that's business that's life that's survival a company can't not
do this if it's not doing this it doesn't survive
but also this produces a lot of collateral damage there
are worse and better ways to go about it there
are pathological ways and there are healthy ways to go
about it there are on ecological ways and there are
environmentally-friendly and ecological ways to go about it there are
unconscious ways and conscious ways to go about it politics
is about reduction of brutality and oppression at least that's
what it should be about that's what it is in
the long term it's about creating a fair playing field
for people it's about building infrastructure and systems that increase
freedom and allow for greater complexity and more interesting things
to be done by all the citizens of the society
it's about community it's not just about utility and pragmatism
it's also about a sense of community you can participate
with others you know in a festival carnival or a
football game or singing the national anthem or pledging allegiance
to the flag or participating in some sort of large-scale
religion religious gathering you know these are all communities and
we get satisfaction from being part of a community politics
and government is about evolution and about emergence of higher
whole ons so don't you dare think that evolution ends
with man we are just a tiny speck a little
part little particle of something much larger at is emerging
inhabiting and really everything the society is doing as its
evolving is really beyond our individual control evolution is guiding
all of it and evolution is guiding it towards higher
levels of organization and higher levels of consciousness and you
need to understand and be humbled by that so that
you don't think that you're at the top of the
food chain because you're not and if you think you
are you're going to behave like a devil and there's
going to be pathology as a result and lots of
suffering find your proper place in the universe is my
point government is also about creating a consensus amongst millions
of people with diverse survival agendas of course with so
many people to please not everyone can be satisfied but
there are some decisions which benefit the majority and which
are generally beneficial to most people which are the ones
that we should be cared about carrying the most about
government is about building a consensus between millions of people
which becomes a battle of agendas which is why we
have culture wars we have policy debates we have economic
manipulation we have legal battles in the courts and then
we have actual war what is all this about it's
about enforcing one's own survival agenda and changing the culture
in such a way that it benefits you and your
tribe see so you might be wondering at this point
Leo what kind of government or society is the best
that should it be capitalist or socialist or what well
that's the whole point who's to say what the best
is the best for whom you have to understand that
this notion of the best is a very simplistic and
fallacious notion there's no such thing everything is relative what's
best for your survival is not best for somebody else's
survival and there are no rules that say what we
should do we're making it up as we go along
so how should we make it up what kind of
things will we say are right and what kind of
things will we say are wrong because there is no
such thing objectively as a absolute we are defining what
is right and what is wrong and of course every
government on the planet has their own definitions of what
is right and what is wrong if you haven't noticed
yet it's important to understand this it might seem very
basic but but you know a lot of people get
stuck in all these policy debates because they have firm
convictions ideological positions about what they know is right and
what they know is wrong it would be much wiser
if we all admitted that we're making it up and
that there's no such thing as right and wrong and
that when we say something is right or something is
wrong really what we're doing is we are unconsciously blindly
executing our own survival agenda so usually when people insist
that something is right or wrong really what they're doing
is they're just acting out what's right for them what's
good for their survival without realizing that what's good for
them is not necessarily what's good for their neighbor and
that therefore we have these disagreements and Wars and so
forth see so we want to start to get along
together and we really want to unify at higher levels
of hold on organization we need to start to understand
that our notions of right and wrong are relative otherwise
we can't do it and this is why a lot
of right-wingers get stuck because right wingers tend to have
very firm ideological convictions about right and wrong now of
course the left wingers also do but generally they're a
little bit more open to the relativism to conservatives and
right-wingers relativism is a dirty word and of course just
by me saying what I just said already I'm going
to be labeled as a leftist and all the stuff
that I said here is going to be dismissed and
discounted but on the other hand I can't not say
what I need to say here this is conscious politics
the problem is that to a devil conscious politics is
not gonna look like conscious politics to a devil conscious
politics is gonna look like evil because the devil projects
his own devilry out onto everybody else so that he
can appear to himself to be an angel because he's
blind to his own selfishness so actually when I advance
conscious politics as a sort of a selfless way of
going about politics trying to transcend the self those who
are the most selfish will view what we're talking about
here as the most selfish this is their defense mechanism
you see this is how it works there's another very
deep problem that people don't understand about government which is
that government must be inclusive in a way that other
organizations don't have to be which makes government much more
difficult to manage and organize see government is the highest
structure that humans have developed unlike say a corporation or
a religious order or a commune or a club or
a gang these are all smaller subunits of the larger
overarching unit of government or country see and what this
means is that for example if I have a spiritual
community let's say I build a hippie commune and I
have people who I invite to you know come join
my community some criminal some violet insane you know psychopaths
criminal somehow makes his way into my commune and you
know after a little while all of us together maybe
it's 50 of us in this commune we all recognize
that you know that guy's a troublemaker he's violent he's
dangerous he's crazy we gotta kick him out so we
just kick him out and then everything goes fine we
can do that a club can do that because there's
a larger unit of society which is able to to
take that person you see and and that larger unit
has mechanisms for dealing with that person there's a legal
system there's mental health professionals there's a police there's insane
asylums if he needs to go there there's prisons if
he needs to go there's a court system that can
try him there's all these various remedies that exist in
large society which enables us as a little spiritual community
to kick someone like that out but society as a
whole doesn't have that option what does society or government
as a whole do with poor people disabled people sick
people insane people crazy people deluded people psychopaths sociopaths schizophrenic
religious fanatics fundamentalists criminals terrorists insurgents you can't exclude them
where are you gonna put them are you gonna what
kick them out of your country to some other country
well that other country won't take them I mean maybe
they will if they were immigrants and they gained marry
legally maybe you could deport them but for most you
know in most cases they're not immigrants the problem is
not immigrants the problem is your own internal people what
do you do with them because every country has their
own hordes of poor sick mentally ill and saying crazy
people and I'm not judging these people I'm just saying
this is a reality there are some really fringe cases
out there which can destabilize your whole society if you
don't somehow control them so what do you do with
them you can't kick them out and even if you
could kick them out let's say you sent them off
to some island in the Caribbean well then you would
have an island full of criminals and terrorists and other
people and these people would rally around together and they
would form their own government and then they would come
and attack you with their crazy ideas see so it's
not gonna work so what needs to happen is that
you need to integrate them and you need to create
systems and infrastructure for deal with these common situations every
country has sick people mentally ill people like addicts people
who are disabled and non-functional in various ways people who
are just in crippling poverty or they have mental conditions
where they can't maintain a job what do you do
with these people you can't just say well [ __
] em who cares Leo it's all just every man
for himself you can't say that because while you are
sleeping in your comfy little house with your beautiful wife
and your children one of these sick mentally deranged poor
people who doesn't have a home who you just said
aw [ __ ] him he's gonna crawl into your
house and rape your family you see so it don't
work your plan don't work it's not sustainable wouldn't it
be better if we found ways to actually solve these
problems in a more humane way where these people got
some treatment they got some help so that they weren't
harm to themselves and to the rest of society you
see because when you have someone who's dissatisfied with it
with his own life and has nothing to lose and
he feels like he's completely lost and hopeless and he
has no chance for success or improvement and that nobody
cares about him this is the type of person that
goes into a school and shoots up your children see
so maybe it's in your own best long-term self-interest to
take these fringe cases seriously and not just to say
ah [ __ ] them every man for himself because
you're part of a community see likewise this applies to
other governments we could ask the same question like what
do we do with the poorest countries the most dysfunctional
countries in the world like maybe Afghanistan certain very underdeveloped
countries in Africa and certain countries and in the Middle
East you know these countries are our less developed and
they have some serious pathologies and you could say well
who gives a [ __ ] about them you know
I'm just here in America and I'm comfortable everything's good
I don't care about what happens in Afghanistan or Saudi
Arabia or Pakistan or anywhere else yeah unless you happen
to be working in New York at the World Trade
Center on 9/11 and then a plane crashes into your
building and you or your family dies as a result
of that now all the sudden see now it's no
longer oh just [ __ ] it no now it
matters it matters that there are people in the world
who are suffering through enormous hardships and who feel that
their life is so miserable they feel so oppressed that
they feel they need to get on an airplane and
crash it into a building see it matters so rather
than a leaning those people the smarter wiser thing to
do would be to integrate them to help them because
happy people don't crash airplanes into buildings happy people don't
start Wars happy people don't rape others happy people don't
feve and steal and create scams so these sort of
isolationist policies where you separate yourself off with a wall
from other people or where you lock others in a
jail cell or you you confine them to some bad
country that you forget about this doesn't work it's like
sweeping dirt under the rug eventually you got to clean
it out at some point otherwise it becomes a cancer
what happens if some terrorist cell in Pakistan acquires a
nuclear weapon can you ignore that no because the world
is interconnected and it's not just a bunch of individuals
we're dealing with complex collectives here multi-layered collectives collectives within
collectives within collectives within collectives so government is uniquely difficult
because it has to account for all people it has
to be inclusive you can't just take the best of
the best and sort of start your own personal Country
Club of the richest most elite most intelligent high IQ
individuals because the majority of the people are not high
IQ individuals by definition nor are they elites nor are
they geniuses nor are they super wealthy billionaires so if
you do start your little billionaire Country Club guess what
the rest the people will gang up and take you
over that's what they'll do because there's more of them
than of you and if you get too much power
and you you try to oppress them too much or
you try to be too exclusive you leave them out
of the club they'll get resentful and they'll hurt you
for it and they'll take away all your money and
your freedom and they will cut your head off in
some revolution so government is so difficult precisely because people
have so many different world views and perspectives because there
are so many diverse survival agendas that people have like
I talked about in my episode why people seem crazy
people literally inhabit different realities because reality is not an
objective static thing but it is mind dependent your mind
is constructing your reality and so millions and billions of
people are constructing their own realities and now we have
to somehow unify them all together otherwise we all slid
each other's throats and destroy ourselves through nuclear holocaust this
is why government is so difficult it's like herding cats
and you're trying to get everybody to understand what's really
going on but everybody is so goddamn selfish and desperate
just to survive to make ends meet and to feed
their family and to protect themselves that they have no
interest thinking about philosophy or different perspectives or about systems
thinking or about awakening about spirituality they don't give a
[ __ ] about any of that all they care
about is how to pay the bills how to put
food in their children's bellies how to defend themselves and
their home see this is the condition we're in so
it's very very difficult there are no easy answers here
government cannot be merely an intellectual exercise government is a
highly pragmatic endeavor these issues were talking about our life
and death issues for people many of you listening to
me you live in a first world democracy you have
enough money you have a shelter you have food and
you're relatively comfortable still you suffer a lot but you're
relatively comfortable you're not desperate so for you you can
just sit around and theorize about politics but there are
billions literally billions of people on this planet right now
who are dealing with famine poverty oppression slavery sex trafficking
addiction drugs abusive relationships exploitation by their bosses and their
companies and co-workers underpay corporations stealing from them toxic pollution
that's happening in their neighborhoods oppression racism genocide ethnic cleansing
gang warfare violence in their neighborhoods these are life-and-death issues
for these people and government needs to address serious survival
threats so put away your culture wars and your petty
ideologies because there's real problems that need solving you'll really
appreciate that when your own survival is threatened that's what
all of your ideals will fly out the window you're
only a libertarian as long as your survival hasn't been
threatened as soon as it has you ain't going to
be a libertarian for very long you're gonna [ __
] and whine and moan and your survival your ego
is gonna kick in and it's gonna get you to
do what needs to be done for you to live
otherwise you're gonna die and that's how it's been for
thousands of years I also want you to appreciate that
no human knows what the best design is for government
because government is not just something that one person sits
down designs and controls for rather government evolves through natural
selection and trial and error the difference is that even
though our bodies evolved through natural selection this was done
for us we didn't have an active conscious participation in
how our bodies evolved but with government we do we
get to say how we want to create it and
what we think is best and in this way we
are consciously participating in the evolutionary natural selection process which
is rather cool but it's also a pretty big responsibility
so how do we create the best government here's a
thought experiment which will help you to understand how to
do this I want you to imagine that before you're
born you can look down upon the planet look upon
the governments that exist different countries the different people and
you can you can decide who you're gonna incarnate as
you can be born into any country into any part
of the country as any race as any profession as
any anyone with any kind of talent you can be
a man or a woman or a Muslim a Christian
family or whatever you want you can you can be
born into that and while you're doing that you also
get to determine what kind of government you want but
there's an additional wrinkle you're also fully conscious that you
will incarnate as everybody else as well so even though
this one time you're gonna come down let's say as
a rich white man living in New York City who's
a stockbroker who's a billionaire let's say you pick that
one first cuz that one sounds like the most appealing
to you but there's one very important difference is that
you know that after that one you're gonna incarnate as
a poor person in the south you're gonna incarnate as
some kid in Africa with AIDS you're gonna incarnate as
a heroin drug addict who's homeless on the streets you're
gonna incarnate as a gay person as a trans person
as a black person as a Muslim as a Christian
as a fundamentalist as a Jew as a Palestinian as
a as a man as a woman has everything that
can possibly ever exist and now you ask yourself what
kind of government would you want the F that's the
kicker right there now all the sudden you realize how
important it is to have a fair and equal government
because the thing that keeps people from having an objective
sense of fairness is their own selfishness and individual bias
and so what happens is that somebody happens to be
born into a rich family white male in New York
City and becomes a stockbroker because his dad was a
stockbroker and he's a billionaire because his dad was a
millionaire and gave him millions of dollars to start his
stock brokering business with you know that person his attitude
and worldview is such that he never thinks he will
be poor he never thinks that he's gonna be a
drug addict he never thinks he's gonna be gay or
trans or black or a Muslim he never thinks he's
gonna grow up in Africa never he never thinks he's
gonna get cancer or AIDS or he never thinks he's
gonna be exploited by some corporation like McDonald's that pays
you a slave wage or he's gonna be born and
work in some sweatshop in in in Bangladesh for you
know 18 hours a day as slave labor he never
thinks he's gonna be born as a young girl who
gets sold into the sex trafficking trade he never thinks
that because he's so locked into his own persona and
identity of being this rich white guy that like that's
all he knows and in fact he actively denies and
doesn't want to look at all of the other people
in the world who are suffering and living through incredible
unfairness and brutality he blocks all that out of his
mind because it's very painful to think about these things
because if he thought about these things his wealthy New
York stockbroker lifestyle could not be maintained he would have
a moral crisis he would have a existential crisis of
consciousness a spiritual crisis for all the suffering and qualms
what is going on around the world but if you
know that you're gonna incarnate as all of these people
then what do you want you want a fair government
that treats everybody well it doesn't exploit anybody that doesn't
enslave anybody that doesn't treat one group over another group
that doesn't favor one religion over another religion see this
is what Christians for example fundamentalist Christians don't understand they
don't understand that they're gonna reincarnate as a as a
Muslim how would you like to live in America as
a Muslim if right now you're a Christian you think
you'd like that you think it's fair how would you
like it if you were born as up as a
black person in the South 300 years ago if you're
a white Southern Christian today you think you would like
that you think it's fair see very quickly you see
how unfair it is because the ego your identity doesn't
care about fairness it cares about blind selfishness and gaining
survival advantage that's all you care about so the whole
trick with conscious politics is finding a way to step
outside of our egoic survival agenda only then can we
construct a proper government it's rather like balancing in game
design I used to be a game designer and if
you've played video games especially certain online games which are
very competitive you know that bad balancing can destroy a
game if you're playing some world of warcraft the paladin
and the sorcerer and the elf Archer they need to
all be balanced now that doesn't mean they're all equal
they have unique skillsets and strengths and weaknesses and pros
and cons but it needs to be balanced so that
they can all play together in a in a good
way and see as a game designer you come to
appreciate that you can't just have one favor you can't
just say oh well the palette is the one that
I came oh stand screw all the rest I'm just
gonna make the power the pallet and the most powerful
one you can't do that that makes you a terrible
game designer you need to be able to step outside
of your personal preferences and you guys say okay if
I was being objective how do i equalize all of
these so that they can play well together and then
it's a it's a fun game and nobody is is
overpowered because if if one of the classes is the
best objectively the best and everyone's gonna play that class
and that's gonna be worse for everybody to see it's
better it's healthier for your online game when people are
playing the different classes rather than where 90% of your
entire playerbase is only playing the paladin cuz then it's
boring everybody's just a paladin it's it's lame it's much
better when you've got your Sorcerer's and your elves and
all that nicely balanced out it also means that the
the other person can have some incentive to play through
the different roles they don't just play paladin your game
will actually get more longevity out of it if the
guy can then reroll his character into an elf Archer
and then a wizard and an orc and so on
it's very much like that with society mankind generally speaking
has not yet discovered the true aim of government here
it is the ultimate aim of government should be to
elevate consciousness and love that's the key the true aim
of government is to elevate consciousness and love this is
what everybody ultimately wants this is the one common thread
through all human lives no matter whether you're living as
a rich person poor person sick person disabled person African
person white person or whatever because this is what life
is about consciousness and love government should be about creating
a healthy ecosystem for raising the consciousness of all beings
as much as possible that's the ideal now of course
doing that it's going to be quite challenging but still
to know what we're aiming for is very important most
people and most politicians and most political analysts don't even
understand this they don't even use the words consciousness and
love when they're talking about government or politics it's ridiculous
we're living in the dark ages we are living in
barbarous times because the word consciousness is not even used
within politics and it's dismissed as some all airy-fairy thing
consciousness of love yeah Leo right that's gonna that's gonna
help somebody you have to understand we need to know
theoretically what the aim is first before we can reach
it see because if government is not being designed for
the maximization of consciousness and love what is it being
designed for by default remember it's being designed for devilry
it's being designed for materialism profit greed power fear hatred
isolationism ethnic identity division theocracy every man for himself anarchy
something like that these are the default things when you're
not designing society for high consciousness and love you're by
default designing it for low consciousness and hatred it's really
that simple see and right now most of our politicians
and people think that society needs to be designed towards
life designed towards towards materialistic greed that's what our society
is being designed towards right now and that's why we
have so many problems now when I talk about by
the way spirituality and politics intersecting don't make the mistake
of thinking that what I'm talking about is removing the
separation of church and state and creating a theocracy that's
not what I'm talking about some of you Christians might
might get that wrong idea or some Muslims no no
remember that there's pre rational rational and post rational there
is like religious scientific than post scientific spiritual all right
so human consciousness in society evolves through these various stages
so I'm not talking about building a theocracy I'm talking
about an on ideological form of spirituality which is the
underpinning of all of government and society now you can
see already have the enormous problem here is that many
stage orange people balk at this idea that all Leo
you're gonna introduce spirituality into government this is this is
terrible this is this is taking a step backwards we
need less spirituality we need less religion not more but
then what do you have you have rampant scientism and
materialism and reductionism that's all you have then you have
a society built on greed that's not gonna work we're
already doing that he's producing terrible results you might wonder
though but Leah why consciousness in love what's so special
about these two isn't this some sort of just hippy
Airy fairy ideal can you really build a real government
on consciousness and love of course of course you can
that's what we've been doing all along it's just that
there's there's many gradations and degrees to consciousness and love
right now our consciousness and love is so low that
we don't even recognize that what we're doing is elevating
consciousness and love it's happening anyways because here's the secret
all that evolution is doing is maximizing consciousness and love
that's what evolution is doing as a universal force this
goes way beyond humans the squeeze scope this goes way
beyond my own personal hippy new agey ideas I'm talking
about the entire origin of life and physical existence now
for this you have to really reach some high levels
of consciousness but eventually you awaken so deeply that you
realize that all of reality is an infinitely expanding love
fractal of which mankind is one tiny branch and so
when you become conscious of that that recontextualizes all of
politics and government for you it recontextualizes all of human
life now you start to see what we need to
be doing here on earth what this whole life is
about individually and collectively we can be aligned with the
force of evolution or we can be aligned against it
if we're aligned against it we're going to go extinct
if we align with it we're going to create a
beautiful society and amazing things will happen and we will
reduce suffering the choice is ours we have this freedom
you might wonder well Leo how is evolution about love
and consciousness this makes no sense because there was no
love or consciousness before humans existed you're wrong love and
consciousness was there before the Big Bang happened that's what
you discover with deep awakening but of course I don't
expect many staged orange people to understand this so I
just want you to see for now that there is
an arc a trajectory to the universe something much bigger
is going on then what materialists and scientists think it
is not a brute mechanical process of trial and error
that is not what evolution is there's a lot to
say about evolution which I'll have a separate episode on
in the future so what I'm talking about here is
aligning ourselves with the force of the entire universe and
this is what makes what I'm talking about your conscious
politics very different from traditional politics because traditional politics is
just about selfishness it's not about consciousness or love it's
not about helping everybody to raise your consciousness it's just
about helping yourself helping your tribe helping your family getting
rich that's what it's about getting favors for yourself I'm
talking about expanding or shrivel of concern to include the
entire universe all living beings and then acting from that
in an unbiased objective way to help all beings raise
their consciousness and love not just humans all all beings
this is what happens when you become very conscious this
is a sort of stage turquoise spy dynamic stage turquoise
way of looking at government and politics politics and government
must be grounded in consciousness because in the end consciousness
is the only thing there is and consciousness is the
ultimate key to solving all problems because all human problems
are the result of either too low of a consciousness
or some twisted pathological form of consciousness which needs to
be transcended and awoken out of individual consciousness and collective
consciousness are deeply interconnected the structure of society directly impacts
how easy it is to raise one's own consciousness which
is why we need to structure society in a way
where we have infrastructure that helps people to meet their
basic needs so that then they can spend the rest
of their life pursuing the raising of consciousness by doing
this we're not just helping them we're helping ourselves because
the more conscious all of your neighbors are the better
neighbors they will be to you to your family the
better co-workers they will be the better more informed citizens
they will be the better politicians they will elect into
office the better work they will do the better inventions
they will create the more responsible they will be see
the less likely they will be to shoot up a
school there is a sort of a vicious cycle here
where low consciousness government creates low consciousness citizens and then
low consciousness citizens recreate low consciousness government and it gets
locked into this cycle on the other hand we can
flip this around and if we have a high consciousness
government ill rate high consciousness citizens and high conscious citizens
will create an even higher consciousness government the choice is
ours what we do the fundamental problem with government is
that most people use it to self deal you see
because government taxes people a large pool of money is
accumulated over which there is quite little oversight literally billions
and trillions of dollars every year is collected but then
it's very easy for people to leech off of this
money because it's much easier to leech off of taxpayer
money than it is to start a legitimate business from
scratch for example or to do something creative like create
some beautiful music or some beautiful art that people like
will pay you for it's much easier to leach off
the system and so there are entire professions that exists
solely to leech off the system but the mistake that
many libertarians make is they they say well leo but
this is just proof that government is bad you know
big government is worse than small government and so the
solution is to reduce government and to eliminate government because
let Leo like you said yeah it's easy to corrupt
and people just leech off this money this taxation and
this taxation is just theft this is wrong the solution
is not to reduce government the solution is to eliminate
self-dealing and corruption from government what you want is not
small government what you want is good effective responsible government
which gives you a lot of bang for your buck
because the reality is that we can't eliminate government government
is a necessity taxation is a necessity you're not going
to eliminate these things that's a fantasy so as long
as a taxation is happening what we can do though
is we can as citizens that are voting power and
our political activism we can try to get that money
used in productive ways so that rather than wasting trillions
of dollars on Foreign Wars that ends up killing people
and just deepening their misery and frustration well not not
getting us much in return we can invest that money
into infrastructure better schools and mental health and training programs
re-education programs that will help to lift people up so
that they can then pursue the raising of their consciousness
so the solution is to end the self dealing and
the way you do that is by becoming more engaged
more aware of what's going on in government so you
could hold it accountable what's missing is the accountability from
you see the mistake people make is that they love
to blame the politicians without taking their own responsibility for
what's going on in government those politicians are a direct
reflection of our own individual consciousnesses of your own voting
choices of your own political activism or lack thereof of
your own laziness of your own ignorance about politics and
government works the proper way to end government corruption is
by being educated and engaged as a voter not by
undermining the government not by privatizing everything but by strengthening
the government making it more transparent and accountable to the
people because if you privatize everything there's not going to
be accountability private corporations are not accountable to the people
see this is the fundamental problem with the libertarian agenda
is that it tries to undermine government with just a
privatization of everything without realizing it if you do that
you're actually going to end up in a more enslaved
situation than you have with the government because with the
government at least you get to vote every couple of
years you won't with a corporation and the corporation ain't
gonna be looking out for you it's gonna be looking
out for its own profit government needs to be about
something other than profit which is why having businessmen and
CEOs as presidents or as government leaders is very problematic
people sometimes think all ya --let let's get somebody in
there who's a businessman and he'll he'll run the government
as a business and this will this will create an
efficient government no it won't because that person will just
try to privatize everything and undermine government government's purpose has
to be the well-being of human beings not profits that's
what makes governments so unique and whenever governments purpose becomes
profits that's when government is corrupted and undermined and that's
when it's not being effective and that's what needs to
be reformed understand that the biggest self dealing in government
is not welfare the way that some conservatives like to
say rather it's corporations it's lobbying is the military-industrial complex
its subsidies which are given out frivolously to companies that
don't need it for example like oil and gas companies
its political favors its corruption its power Fame status and
sex which comes from having positions of authority and celebrity
that come with being a politician it's the revolving door
of entering government to be a public servant but then
only doing that for a few years so that you
can exit and then go become a lobbyist and work
for some corporation to then help that corporation to to
corrupt the government and using your government experience as just
a way to undermine the government this is the revolving
door this is very toxic and pathological it's really traitorous
although it's not commonly thought of that way influence peddling
Ponzi schemes and scams these are truly the biggest problems
with government not welfare certain welfare is a drop in
the bucket compared to the kinds of white-collar crime and
corruption that playing most governments so it's that that needs
to be cleaned up and of course it can be
cleaned up but it takes active political participation and consciousness
and education and an engaged citizenry to do that that's
our best bet see starting some new organization is not
going to work we already have a massive organization called
the government rather than scrapping that and trying to do
something new reform what we've got because it's an evolutionary
process right it's sort of like you're designing a human
body you don't just start with a human body from
scratch you start with some Neanderthal body and then you
you you make little adjustments to it to create the
human body you refine it likewise you don't just start
with a Neanderthal body you start with a chimp and
then before a chimp you start with like a monkey
and before a monkey you start with like a some
some mammal mouse and then you go back to reptiles
and birds and fish and all this you know you
go down the evolutionary chain this is how it works
evolution doesn't just create stuff from scratch so we've got
to keep evolving it but we have to stay vigilant
and we have to be responsible for this process because
this process doesn't just happen automatically as we sit at
home and watch TV all day the difference is that
we are active participants here all right that's it for
part one I know it's long but there's so much
material here and I'm so passionate about it stay tuned
for part two next time we'll talk more about fundamental
insights about the nature of how government works we're going
to talk about what conscious politics actually looks like and
the core principles of it so it's it's gonna be
less theory and more practice and as we keep going
through these parts into part three as well it's going
to get more and more practical and tangible and there's
going to be serious policy repercussions of the things that
I'm saying so don't just think that this is all
philosophy make sure you stay tuned for those I'll see
you then you
