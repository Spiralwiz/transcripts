deconstructing the myth of science part three. Yes, there's more.
Oh, yes, so much more. Do not underestimate how deep
this topic of science says, I'm telling you, you could
spend easily 500 hours, 1000 hours, just contemplating the nature
of what science is. And this would be time well
spent. Most people don't understand that such a such a
thing is possible. Now, a couple of warnings before we
really get into it. Warning number one is that I
just want to make it very clear that you have
to be careful here with deconstructing science, because it is
possible for some devils to come in and to use
these points that I'm making, I'm making very powerful points
about the nature of science. And in a sense, it
does weaken science. It takes science off its pedestal that
it's been placed upon in our culture and society. Now.
This is a double edged sword. Because anybody who's at
the level of below science, the pre rational level can
use these points. This is like ammunition for the enemies
of science. And this can be taken as a license
by the ego mind to start to believe any kind
of nonsense, science denial and conspiracy theories. That is obviously
not what I'm suggesting you do. This set of episodes,
this whole series, this whole endeavor of deconstruction is not
to be used by the ego as licensed to believe
whatever is convenient to its survival, or to prop up
and bolster its own personal biases, and pet theories and
ideologies. So be careful about that. I'm sensing that many
people can fall into this trap. And that's why I
understand why scientifically minded people and rationally minded people can
be worried about what I'm doing here, this project of
deconstruction, because in their mind, they can see it as
Oh, no, he's giving ammo to our enemies. And this
is dangerous. And of course, that's right. It is in
a sense, dangerous. But also, how else can we make
progress by being critical of our own worldviews? You see,
so we're sort of damned if we do, and we're
damned if we don't, yes, to make intellectual progress requires
intellectual integrity. A person who comes in here without any
intellectual integrity and wants to just use these points, like
if a creationist gets a hold of these points, or
if some religious fundamentalist, or if some conspiracy theorist or
some flat earther, or some, you know, anti Vaxxer, or
whatever gets a hold of these points that I'm making,
they will, their ego mind will try to use this
to justify their silly worldview. But that's not what we're
doing here. Because, of course, deconstruction, you have to be
careful with deconstruction. When you're deconstructing worldviews, you have to
be very even handed about it. You can't just deconstruct
the worldviews you don't like. You have to deconstruct precisely
your own worldview. So if you're a Christian, you have
to not deconstruct science, you have to first deconstruct Christianity,
then you can move on to deconstructing science. If you're
a Muslim, first, deconstruct Islam, then move on to deconstructing
science. But if you're rationally minded, if he is the
minded person, then you don't need to deconstruct religion too
much, you already understand the limits of religion. Great, but
now you get to the work of deconstructing science, you
see, and in the end, in this way, you're going
to deconstruct everything. Now, of course, critics of what I'm
doing will say, well, Leo, but what about deconstructing the
actualized.org philosophy? What about that? See, you're deconstructing everything but
then you're not deconstructing the actualized. Org philosophy. Which of
course is to misunderstand what actualize that org is about
actualize that org is not a philosophy. It is not
an ideology. It's something different. It is the deconstruction of
the entire mind of every world you have Everything, you're
not leaving any special privilege for your own pet theories
and ideas, you deconstruct those two, you see, and then
what remains is nothing. You even get to the point
where you deconstruct deconstruction. And you're left with nothing, you're
left with freedom, the liberation of your own mind. You
see how this works? Again, that's not an ideology, you
have to actually do it, there's a difference between creating
an ideology of deconstruction versus actually deconstructing everything, including your
own deconstruction, and not being beholden to any kind of
ideology, even the ideology of deconstruction. So you have to
be careful not to turn deconstruction itself into some sort
of new method or dogma. You see, in a sense,
any epistemic method you use is going to be finite,
partial relative bias and incomplete. So the trick here is
how do we free our mind of all possible methods,
of which science is just one? See? Now another point
I need to make here is that it might sound
like I'm being overly negative here about scientists and academics,
I might be portraying them all as idiots, or fools.
This is not the case. Of course, there are very
good scientists in the world. Not all scientists are materialist
hacks. Not all scientist, deny truth, not all scientists deny
the importance of philosophy and metaphysics and epistemology. There are
some really high quality visionary scientists out there that are
post rational, that understand the things that I'm saying. And
if you're one of those a great I want to
encourage you even more, see, I'm with you, I'm not
trying to undermine you, I'm trying to take what you've
been doing, even to a deeper level, there are deeper
levels that you have not yet understood, that I can
show you. And then, of course, our goal here is
to move all the scientists who are the materialist tax,
and who are just strictly stuck in rationalism and realism
and materialism is to move them up to this sort
of post rational stage of science that you are at
if you're a high quality scientist. So of course, good
scientists do exist, but you have to understand that they're,
they're quite rare. They are the exception, not the rule.
And they tend not to be very vocal, they tend
not to be the popular ones you don't really know
about them. The scientists that you do know about are
usually the ones who are fitting into the materialist mainstream
paradigm, the realist paradigm, there are scientists who are idealists,
and even there are awakened scientists. And there are scientists
who are mystics, like they do exist, but you're not
going to hear about them. So just understand how this
works. In a sense, this is sort of a marketing
problem here. Right? Because for a scientist to become really
well known and to receive awards, and to have a
lot of status and reputation within the cultural zeitgeist, that
scientist, how does the scientists gain that kind of notoriety
through the institutions of science and academia. But of course,
if those institutions of science and academia are all locked
into the materialist paradigm, then they're not going to allow
any kind of scientists beyond that, to gain notoriety through
them, they're not going to grant status. To such people,
the only people they'll grant status to are those who
are loyal to their paradigm. The best materialists, the best
realist, the best rationalist. And so that is the case.
Right? So don't expect to see some visionary mystic scientists
coming out of MIT or Caltech, you're not going to
see that. That's not possible. They won't allow that. There
could be independent scientists, but how does an independent scientist
become really popular and successful that that's difficult to do?
Again, this is sort of a marketing and a business
problem, more than it is really a problem of science.
But of course, it does become a problem of science
because this holds science back a great deal. Because most
people in the mainstream what they consider to be science
is simply that which is coming out of Caltech and
MIT, which is rubber stamped by Caltech and by MIT.
But of course, there's no reason why science should be
limited to that. Those are just a few institutions. You
see, and you can do great science outside of institutions.
In fact, today, it's almost necessary that if you want
to do cutting edge science, you have to be outside
of these institutions. Also, of course, I am not disk
urging you from studying science. Like I said, at the
very beginning, I love science. I study a lot of
science in my life. And I will continue to study
science. I read websites about new scientific news. I'm interested
in new scientific discoveries, whether it's within particle physics, or
within cosmology, or a straw Astronomy, or within, you know,
space exploration, there's a lot of amazing stuff that we
can discover using conventional materials science, right? So just because
materialism is false, that doesn't mean that all of the
science done by materialist scientists, is automatically to be dismissed,
and to like to not be interested in it, you
should still be interested in it, there's a lot that
you can learn. Right? It's just that there's something beyond
that as well. So don't, don't become too ideological about
this. Don't develop this sort of chip on your shoulder
about science, just recognize its limits. That's all we're talking
about. All right. Now, let's get into some of the
main points. So the first main point here of this
episode, is that science is very intimately tied in with
language, much more so than most people realize, including scientists
and academics themselves. So really, consider this profound point, that
it's actually impossible to do science without language. It's impossible
to do current modern science without language. The to go
hand in hand. Science is a linguistic scheme. And any
kind of limitations that are inherent to language itself, will
creep their way into science and become limitations of science.
This is something that many people don't take seriously enough.
And the study of the trickeries and nuances of language.
This is a deep field, there's an entire field of
philosophy called philosophy of language. And it became very prominent
and popular in the last 100 years. And even in
the last seven years, basically, what philosophers throughout most of
human history before the last century, most philosophies took language,
most philosophers sorry, took language for granted. They just sort
of assumed that language just is a given. It's just
a subjective system that we have. There's nothing particularly tricky
about language. And we can just use language, because, you
know, philosophical questions, questions about the nature of reality, of
course, they're, they're framed in language, right? Like, when you
ask the question, like, where did humans come from? That's
a linguistic activity that you're doing? Or like, what is
matter made out of? That's a linguistic question. Or like,
what existed before the Big Bang? You see, that's a
linguistic sort of question. And you might even ask a
question like, What is the nature of a unicorn? What
is a unicorn? You would say, well, a unicorn is
an imaginary creature, it doesn't really exist. Okay. But what
is that? Is there a reality to imaginary objects, like
unicorns, and flying spaghetti, monsters, and so forth? See, and
so what philosophers sort of to discover around the turn
of the last century is that language is much more
tricky than we ever thought, and that we can use
language to trap ourselves. Sometimes we can ask questions with
our language that might be meaningless. Or the problem might
be a linguistic problem more than it is a physical
or material problem. And sure enough, of course, these problems
do exist within language. Sometimes you can frame questions in
ways which the questions make no sense, or they don't
actually have an answer. And in fact, one of the
mistakes many scientists make is they think that well, Leo,
all of the philosophical profound questions that you're you know,
you're interested in, like questions like, What is existence? Or
what happened before the big bang or stuff like that
of this nature? That that these sorts of questions they
don't even have answers because they're just it's just a
linguistic game. It's just a language game. You know, when
you say that reality is an illusion. Oh, that's just
a language game. Is it or maybe when you say
that it's just a language game that itself is the
game. And that itself is the illusion. So you have
to be very careful here with how you're using language.
All of science hinges upon labels and categories, which come
with language. And of course, language is not a fixed
static thing that was given to us eons ago, language
is always evolving. As science evolves, language evolves. As technology
evolves, language evolves, we develop new labels, new categories. But
these labels and categories we create, they're not just simply
labels and categories, you have to understand how powerful language
is. language plays a constructive role. It's not merely descriptive.
It's not merely that we find, you know, a rabbit
out in the wilderness and we say, Oh, well, we'll
call that thing a rabbit. And we find a kangaroo
and say, Oh, well, we'll just call that a kangaroo,
and doesn't really matter. We could switch the labels, you
know, we could call a rabbit, a kangaroo. And we
could call a kangaroo a rabbit, and it wouldn't make
any difference. And, and that's all there is to it.
No, no, language is much, much, much more tricky than
that. Language is an entire vast, complex network of meanings.
And these meanings, many of them are subconscious. When you
say A, even a simple word, like a rabbit, or
a kangaroo, or time or space, or a table or
a person. Usually, in ordinary parlance, you know, as laymen,
we we say these words, and we don't think very
much about them. We just assume that these objects exist,
that they're Givens that they're not constructed by our minds.
And that language doesn't play a constructive role, but it
does see, behind every even simple word, even a word
such as rabbit, what does rabbit really mean? You might
think you know what rabbit means. But no two people
on this planet have exactly the same understanding of what
a rabbit is. And every word comes with implicit latent
hidden metaphysical baggage. The words and categories we use, to
talk about reality, come with metaphysical baggage with assumptions, and
baked in projections and expectations of what we think reality
is, and many of these are not deeply questioned or
exact examined by science, they're just taken for granted. We
just assume that there is such a thing as a
rabbit, or the sun, or energy, or matter or time
or the body or death. We take these words as
though they're just physical objects out there. And we're just
labeling them. But what if that's not the case? What
if our minds are entangled with language such that they
can never be disentangled? And what if our understanding of
reality and our doing of science is entangled with language
and with our mind, such that the entire mechanism is
functioning in a very complicated manner? Where it's very difficult
to make sense of really what comes first reality, language
mind? And what creates what is language creating the mind
and the mind creating reality? Or is reality creating language
and reality is creating the mind. It's a bit of
a chicken and egg problem here. And of course, the
ultimate problem with language is that language is just one,
one mode of understanding reality and interfacing with reality. Notice
that it's possible to experience reality without any language whatsoever.
Now, it's difficult for most people, because most people don't
meditate so their minds are always in monkey mind mode,
as the Buddhists call it. Your mind is always thinking
thoughts and so it's very difficult for you to experience
a period of no language at all. To experience reality
without any language, without any linguistic projections or augmentations. See,
language works like an augmented reality system. Everything is being
overlaid and projected upon raw phenomenon, with our mind and
with language and The problem is that today's scientists, none
of them have been taught meditation, none of them know
how to shut off their mind for the most part.
And so they just assumed that the only way to
approach reality is through language. But that's not true at
all. That's just how your culture has been approaching reality.
There might be non linguistic ways of approaching reality. And
those need to be taken seriously. If you're going to
be insisting that language is the one true right way
to understand reality. First of all, remember that needs to
be scientifically validated, you don't know that that's true. That's
just an assumption. For you to know that that's true,
you'd have to experiment with language. And then you'd have
to also experiment with non linguistic modalities to determine whether
language is actually the best one. You can't just start
off by assuming Well, language is the best one, because
language is just all that I've been using my whole
life. But see, how can you even test the non
linguistic modalities? When you don't even know how to shut
off your mind? For five seconds? You're always having thoughts
and thoughts are always language. You see, you see how
tricky this is? If you're a scientist, I have a
very simple, very simple experiment for you. If you're a
serious scientist, my challenge to you is to reach a
point in your own cognitive development, where you're able to
experience reality for one minute, one whole minute, without any
linguistic stuff going on inside your head. No words. No
Labels, no categories. What would that be? Like? You say,
Oh, well, yeah, Leo, I can do that. First of
all, notice that you can't do that. You're incapable of
doing that. You can't shut off your mind for longer
than five seconds, let alone a minute. It'll take you
years of work to get to a point where you
can shut off your mind for longer than a minute.
And then you say, Oh, well, yeah. But if I
even if I did, that won't be the point. Leo.
Yeah, I could, I could do that. But then what's
the point of that? I mean, nothing will change. Ah,
that's an assumption. That's an assumption, you don't know that
nothing will change, maybe something very significant will change. And
the only way you can know is by doing the
experiment. That's the spirit of science, as we talked about,
in part one, remember. So you see, we can already
clearly see how much your own mind is entangled with
science and your understanding of reality. Because if your mind
is always stuck in thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking languaging
languaging languaging languaging. And you are you can't even shut
that off for one minute. How can you say that
you are truly objectively understanding reality. Clearly, you're stuck in
a linguistic mode. And there are other modes. You see,
the problem with language is that it's inherently dualistic. It
separates reality into categories and into dualities. So you say
that there's existence and non existence, there's energy and there's
matter. There's hot and there's cold, there's big and they're
small. There's a cat and there's a non cat. There's
a planet and there's a non planet. There's full space,
and there's empty space. There's numbers, and there's non numbers.
There's humans, there's nonhumans, there's intelligent beings, and there's non
intelligent beings, and so forth. And so this is what
science is basically, modern science is this dualistic activity of,
of carving up reality into these dualities. That's a methodological
bias of science. And science is not aware that it's
really doing this and doesn't see that this is a
problem, that it could be a problem. If thinks that
this is just how reality is and we're just observing
reality. But what if the mind is projecting these dualities
onto nature, that, in fact, is non dual to begin
with? You see, that's going to bias your understanding of
reality, because you're projecting stuff upon reality without recognizing that
you're doing so. Reality will appear ill will appear dualistic
to you because that's what you're projecting upon it. When
in fact, reality is non dualistic, without your projections. See,
to know more about these dualistic categories, go check out
my three part series. It's a very important series that
I shot called Understanding duality part one, part two, part
three, I specifically talk about all of these tricky issues
that relate to duality in these categories I. In part
two, I specifically address all of the scientific dualities, which
holds scientists back from really understanding the stuff that they're
studying. Virtually every scientist in every university around the world
today is stuck in a dualistic mode. And their entire
field is carved up into these various dualities, and they
take these dualities for granted as objective without recognizing that
they are mind created. This is a big problem. You
have to every single word or label that you use
when investigating reality has to be deeply questioned and contemplated.
For example, here's a list of some of these terms
and labels. And this is just the tip of the
iceberg. There's 1000s of them. But here's a few experience.
Scientists and rationally minded people will use the word experience
as though they understand what experience is. They've never seriously
contemplated what experience means. How about the term reality, we
use the word reality without any understanding of what reality
is, without contemplating it deeply. Related closely to that one
is existence. Existence. We use that word as though we
know what that means. A life we use that word,
as if we know what that means, without any deep
contemplation of what life is. Human, what is human? See,
Science uses this word, but science never deeply questions what
a human is. How about the word male or female?
We use these words as though we know what these
are. Most scientists believe that male and female are just
objective facts that we get from DNA. But there's nothing
in the DNA that says male or female in it.
You say all yellow, yellow, there is a male is
is someone with an X Y chromosome and a female
has an XX chromosome. That's just an objective scientific fact.
No, it isn't. It's not a fact at all. It's
your mind who says that x x is female and
X, Y is male. That's your mind saying that the
DNA doesn't say that. In fact, the notion of a
chromosome is something your mind also made up. There's no
such thing as a chromosome. See, you have to be
very careful. These things are so taken for granted by
science as just being objectively real. They aren't. They're constructions
and projections of the mind. How about the term fact?
People use the word fact so cavalierly, as if fact
is just a fact. But of course, it's not a
fact. How do you know what is? It isn't a
fact? What does it mean for something to be a
fact? And what does it mean for something to not
be a fact? This, this requires deep, profound philosophical questioning.
You can't just say, Oh, well, Leo, those are philosophical
concerns that they it doesn't matter to science. Science doesn't
care what a fact is, there isn't we just, it's
just it's just obvious. No, nothing, nothing is obvious. None
of these words or terms is obvious. Another one is
rational. People throw this word around, rational or logical they
throw around this word as if they have ever contemplated
what that even means. What does rational mean? Rational according
to whom? Physical is another one. People talk about physical
or material as though they know what that word means.
What does it mean to say that my body is
physical or material and that a unicorn is non physical?
What does that mean? You have no idea I want
you to recognize that you have never seriously questioned any
of these words, and you do not know what any
of them mean. Even if you're an academic, even if
you're a scientist, I don't care if you have a
Nobel Prize. If you're a Nobel Prize winning scientist, physicist
from MIT, I guarantee you, you have no idea what
the word physical means. That's the depth of our problem
here. Not to mention, if you're just some ordinary Joe
Schmo on YouTube watching a video, right? This problem persists
all throughout society doesn't matter how how smart you are,
how high your IQ is, how many books you've read,
you still don't know what physical means. You don't know
what experience means. You don't know what rational means. How
about the word cause? We use this word cause cause
and effect. That's another duality that science just takes for
granted. But what is a cause? Really? What does it
mean to cause something? That's a classic philosophical problem very
challenging. All these questions are deep questions, you can spend
hundreds of hours contemplating every single one of these terms.
And it's also very easy to get lost in your
mind. You might say, well, Leo, but But it gets
us nowhere to contemplate these. It could get you nowhere,
or it could get you somewhere, don't assume it'll get
you nowhere. If it was guaranteed to get you nowhere,
I wouldn't be talking about it. I only talk about
practical things. How about of course, the word science. People
use the word science so casually as if they have
any idea what that word means. Even scientists, scientists call
themselves scientists, but they don't know what a scientist is.
What is a scientist? What does it mean to do
science? I mean, this last three episodes where I've been
talking for, you know, probably close to 10 hours now
about the nature of science. I mean, all we're doing
here is we're really questioning and contemplating a single thing,
what is science? And look how difficult it is look
at all the problems that have come out metaphysical, epistemic
methodological, about science, look at all the assumptions, the hidden
assumptions that we've had about science, look at all the
ways we could misconceived science and do science wrong. Look
at all the ways in which we can have different
versions of science. How do we adjudicate between different ones,
you see how challenging it is to define what science
is. And this is very practical. This is not merely
a word game that we're playing here. Because when we're
communicating with each other, we're using all these words. So
it's very easy to dismiss these things that I'm talking
about. It's all legal, it's just all a word game,
it doesn't really matter. You're just talking about some sort
of semantic definitions. It's nothing of consequence. But your entire
life is made up of semantics. Whether you're a scientist
or a layman, if you're a scientist, you're using technical
terms all the time, in your research papers, these technical
terms infect your mind and determine how you think about
reality. You literally think of reality in terms of energy,
matter, numbers, quantities, vectors, forces, all of these complicated terms
that you don't fully understand, and that you just take
for granted as given. But even if you're an ordinary
person, you're playing language games all the time, your entire
life is a language game. See, when you're an argument,
and you're saying someone is, is wrong or correct, something
is true or false, or you're saying that person is
bad, or this person is good, or that person is
evil, or whatever. These are all language games, even when
you think about your own death. That itself is a
language game. Because death, what is the word death even
mean? You don't know what death means? You think you
do, but you have no idea what death is or
what it means. This affects your emotional system. This is
not a purely intellectual exercise, your entire emotional system, your
motivational system, what your whole value system is in life,
what you do in your life, all of that is
connected to how you use language, you're completely embedded in
language, whether you're a scientist, an academic or just a
layman, ordinary person, and are completely non philosophical. You can't
escape the problems of philosophy just by saying that you
don't care about philosophy or that philosophy is just a
language game. The next point is that the map is
not the territory. So this is related to this idea
of language that we've been talking about. But one of
the biggest mistakes that scientists make today is that they
are so wrapped up in symbolic understanding of nature or
reality, that they confuse their maps, and symbolic representations of
reality with reality itself. This is the trap called mistaking
the map for the territory. This is a huge trap,
I will have a whole separate episode just about this
one idea that the map is not the territory. There
is a really powerful quote from why it would small
on this topic. And he says, the better the model,
the bigger the problem. The better the model, the bigger
the problem. Remember this quote, for the rest of your
life, this will be crucial for you to to unravel
the nature of reality. Because you see, science really is
in the business of creating models of nature of representing
nature, which means you've got nature, and then you've got
to read presentation or copy of it. So science is
sort of making copies of nature, these copies, it's making
our oversimplifications within a symbolic realm, and scientists assume that
this is the only way in which we can understand
reality is by making copies of it, simplifying it using
symbols, whether it's mathematics or English language, or what are
the other kinds of models, you know, it could be
sort of a ball and stick a model of a
molecule in chemistry. But basically, all of modern science is
just models. And these models, of course, are upgraded every
year, every decade, every century, we develop new and better
models, and they become more and more accurate in a
sense. And you might say, well, that's great, that means
we're getting closer to the truth. But we're not. We're
not, no matter how good your model is, your model
is never the truth. The truth is the territory itself,
not the model. And you might say, well, it doesn't
matter, because as long as I can use the model
to manipulate reality, that's it. The truth doesn't matter anymore.
But it does. It does in ways that you can't
even imagine yet. Because you're stuck in this paradigm of
modeling everything. And you think that modeling, everything can be
modeled. But that's an assumption that's an unscientific assumption. Are
you thinking that? What if everything can't be modeled? What
if there are things that are true about reality, important
things? That you cannot access through modeling? What then? What
do you do then? See, the reason that science is
such a powerful illusion. And that it's so difficult to
deconstruct is that once your models become very, very good,
and accurate enough, such that you consider them reality, you
forget about reality, you throw reality away, and then you
just live within your world of models. And you forget
that reality exists independent of models at all. And this
becomes extremely dangerous. So this is what the quote means.
The better the model, the bigger the problem. As science
becomes more accurate, it becomes a greater illusion. People stop
caring about anything beyond the pragmatics of the models. Whether
it's the scientists or just the layman, they stopped caring.
They stopped caring about truth. They stopped caring about any
deeper metaphysical issues, any epistemic issues. It just becomes a
purely utilitarian activity. And this becomes very, very dangerous. And
that's the state of modern materials. 21st century science, it's
virtually impossible to even communicate to a modern scientist, the
problems of the map is not the territory because they
are so lost in their models. And they have to
be in order to succeed in their careers and with
their work. Because all they're doing every day is working
with models. That to them. The territory has been completely
lost, and they can't even conceive in their mind why
anybody would care about the territory because all they care
about is models. Because when you have a hammer, and
all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a
nail Oh, everything looks like it can be hammered down.
But of course, a hammer is just one tool, one
modality, there are other tools. Science is stuck with this
hammer. Presently, it doesn't have to be, it just is
right now, it won't be forever. It just is right
now that 21st century. So science, one of the biases
of scientists and methodology currently, is that science is very
biased towards exploring nature and reality through thinking and through
symbolism and representation via modeling. So much so that that
is the only way it knows how to explore reality.
And therefore it doesn't even know that there are other
methods. Science does not know of direct methods of investigating
reality, separate from thinking, symbolism, and modeling. And when someone
like me comes and tries to suggest a direct method,
a method which is more direct than experience, or thinking
or symbolism. This doesn't compute for people doesn't compute for
science, a scientist doesn't understand that a direct method is
possible. What do I mean by direct method? I mean
that, imagine that there is the territory. What most scientists
assume is that, well, Galileo sure there is a territory,
but we can't really know the territory because we're, we're
just limited humans, we have limited minds, there's no reason
why evolution should give us the tools necessary to penetrate
to the very substance of reality. So all we can
do is we can just study our experiences of reality.
That's it. But that's an assumption, you're assuming that you
don't know that that's actually true. In fact, what's possible
is for you to have direct consciousness of the territory,
without bottles without symbols, without thinking, direct access to the
absolute truth of reality. That's possible. But you weren't taught
methods for how to do this in school, or in
university. And none of your academic friends know how to
do this. So to them, it says though, it doesn't
exist. It does exist. But you have to go outside
of the current limited confines of science outside of it.
Now, you might say, well, Leo, but but even if
these direct methods exist, they're not science. And so I'm
not interested in them. But again, remember, as we talked
about in part one, and part two, how you're defining
science is the whole problem. When you say science is
just this and direct experiences is outside of science, that
you're assuming that that's okay. You're assuming that's how it
should be. But again, that's an assumption. What if there's
a problem is that you've, you've drawn your frame your
little box too narrowly, if that you need to expand
your definition of science to include direct consciousness. You see.
But this would require you to break away from the
academic herd that you've been brainwashed with. Going beyond that
into something new, something that isn't yet considered science, but
we'll be in the next century to come. You see,
the reason it's so difficult to accept the things that
I'm saying here is because I'm saying things that will
only be accepted by mainstream culture and academia 100 or
200, or 500 years from now. Like I said, this
is advanced stuff. And you might think, well, Leo, you're
so arrogant thinking that you can see 200 years into
the future. But it's just, it's just obvious. Once you
do the work I've done, it's just obvious. It's not
a matter of arrogance. You can see precisely the limitations
of science 200 years forward, you can see it. But
that doesn't mean everyone around you can see it. You
see. So if you're looking to others around you to
validate what science will look like 200 years from now,
they won't, because they can't see it. Very, very few
people today can see it. Maybe one and 100 can
see it. Probably even less than that. So if you
want to, if you want to see what science will
look like 200 years from now, you need to break
away from the pack from the group think from the
institutions and you got to go beyond that. Outside of
that, because of course, by definition, something that's going to
be 200 years into the future, it's not going to
be inside of the current paradigms, it's going to be
something radically different and new. And it's going to be
unacceptable to many who are entrenched in the current paradigms.
Because people at MIT and Caltech who are, you know,
who are earning good money and who have a lot
of reputation status as world class scientists, they don't want
to admit that they're that there's something deeply wrong about
their worldview. This would be embarrassing to them as professionals,
this would be deeply embarrassing, this would discredit them, they
have to go to their graves, believing that their system
and way of of looking at reality was correct, and
was the best way and that there was nothing better
than it. Those people have to die of natural causes,
before we are able to advance to this new way
of looking at science and reality. So it's not that
science is wrong, per se. It's that science. It's that
the scientific models are always partial, and highly limited and
constrained. And they can never fully encapsulate reality. Remember, as
scientists, our mission is to understand reality. Our problem is
that we're trying to understand reality by making copies of
it models, these models are grossly oversimplified, and they're extremely
limited and partial. And so for us to explore and
understand more and more of reality, we have to fight
constantly argue against our own models that we create, we
create a great model, it allows us to manipulate reality
a little bit, but then it doesn't allow us to
fully manipulate reality or to fully understand reality. And then
that model itself becomes the obstacle that we have to
break break apart to create a new, better model. And
then that model replaces the old model. Now we have
to break this one apart, because it's also limited until
we reach a new model. But every model we create
is always partial, relative and limited, and we always have
to break it apart. And this is the whole game
of science. Now, here, the mistake that is made by
scientists is a well, Leo Yeah, that's the method of
science and there's nothing better. Wrong, you're assuming that you
don't know that you haven't investigated other methods. That position
itself is unscientific, that's a dogma of science. And in
the future, that dogma will be broken down. And you
can be one of the first people of this generation
to break it down. But only if you're willing to
go beyond what you've been brainwashed with. If you're really
willing to open your mind to question reality, and to
question how your mind works, and to question the methodology
that you're using, then you can be one of the
first but of course, nobody wants to deeply question their
methodology. Therefore, very few people are on the cutting edge
of science, and can see 200 years ahead. How many
models of reality can we invent? into that? It's unlimited.
You see the problem here. We could always make better
models. The problem though, is that when we create these
models, we don't just create the model, then we treat
the model as a model, we create the model, the
model becomes so effective for our survival. It suits all
of our basic utilitarian needs, that we just then say,
well, good enough, that's good enough for me, the model
is now the truth. And then we actually take this
model as the way that reality is, and we're not
aware of the limitations that this model places upon our
minds, because we don't just have a model, we take
the model as reality. And then any limitations within the
model become baked into reality. We confuse the limitations our
models for the limitations of reality, in fact, reality is
unlimited. It's infinite. And all models are limited partial relative
and finite. This is a very big problem for scientists.
The next problem is what I call the substance problem.
The substance problem, science never addresses the question of what
anything is. What is matter, what is energy? What is
mass, What is gravity? What is a force? What is
a particle, what is a wave, what is time? What
is space? What is Distance, what is mind? What is
a field, what is a number, what is a charge,
what is information? What is heat? What is perception? What
is it experience, what is consciousness? What is thought? What
is an object? What is color? What is life? Science
does not answer any of these questions. And there's a
reason because it can't. This is very deeply problematic. You
see, the way that science works is that it can't
actually answer any question of substance. It can't actually tell
you what anything is. All that it can do is
it can tell you how a thing behaves. So science
can't tell you what my hand is made out of
science can only tell you how my hand behaves. Under
certain conditions. You might say, well, Leo, science can say
that the hand is made of cells. Okay, but what
is the cell? You're just pushing the, the substance question
down one level, when you say the hand is made
of cells, okay, it's made of cells. But But what
is the cell? You push that push it down one
more level? And you say, well, it's made of molecules?
Or proteins, let's say, what is the protein? Well, proteins
matter molecules. But what is the molecule? Well, that's pushed
down one more level, it's made of atoms. Well, what
is an atom? Well push it down one more level?
It's matter of subatomic particles, protons, neutrons, electrons, so forth.
Well, what are those? Well, those made of quarks, push
it down lower level, what are those? Well, mana strings,
or water strings? Well, there, what is that? Well, it's
just some numbers. But what are numbers? Well, numbers are
just numbers. What is a number? What's the number? What's
the substance of a number? You see, science is constantly
playing this game of avoiding the substance question by always
offloading it on to somebody else. It's basically one of
these games of telephone tag, you know, like you call
some giant bureaucracy, and you tell them that oh, you
know, my electricity isn't, you know, you call your electric
company and you tell them like, hey, my electricity is
out. I need you to like to check what's going
on. But you know, and the guy on the other
end says, well, sorry, Sir, you called the wrong department.
I mean, yes, this is the electric company, but you
called the billing department, you got to call the actual
engineering department, because you're you don't have a billing problem,
you have an engineering problem. So then you say, Okay,
please transfer me to the engineering department. So they transfer
you to the engineering department. And then you talk to
them. And they tell you, Well, no, you don't have
an engineering problem. That is a that's a, that's a,
that's an administrative problem. So they transfer you to the
administration department. So you talk to them. And then they
say, Well, you don't really have an administration problem. It's
a billing problem. They transfer you to the billing department
again, and you're going around in circles. This is what
science is. Like, if you go into a physics classroom,
and I did this when I was when I was
young. You know, I had a great physics teacher in
high school, I actually really enjoyed physics, but I was
really interested in the substance of reality. And, and I
noticed that at one point, I noticed that all that
we're doing in physics is we're just manipulating variables, and
equations, but we're not addressing the root of what anything
is. So I would ask like, Well, okay, so what
is this thing called a force? In physics, a force
is mass times acceleration. But then I would ask, okay,
but what is what is acceleration? I don't understand what
acceleration is in the physical world. You know, the, my
physics teacher would say, well, acceleration is just velocity divided
by time. And then I would say, Okay, but what
is velocity? Well, velocity is just distance divided by time.
Okay, so now, you're defining velocity in terms of distance
and time. But what is distance? What? We can't say
what distances? Distance is that which is measured by a
ruler. But what is a ruler? And what about time?
Well, what is time? Well, time is the thing that's
measured by a moving head on a clock. But that's
motion, you're defining times in terms of the motion of
the of the clock. But the whole point of figuring
out what time was was to define what distance was,
and what velocity was. So it's all circular definitions. You
see. No physicist can tell you what maths is, or
what matter is, or what energy is or what gravity
is, or what a force is, or what a particle
is, or what time is or what space is, or
what a field is, or what a charge is or
what information is. All they can do is they can
define one of those terms in terms of other terms
that they themselves don't know. It's completely circular. It's a
complete game of avoiding the question By playing this game,
you create a sense that you understand more than you
actually do. See, if physicists were honest, and I came
to a physics and I said, What is? What is
a force? If the physicist was honest, he'd say, I
have no fucking idea what a force is. But see,
a physicist can't say that, because it makes them look
stupid and not credible. So the physicist has to say,
well, it's easy, a force is just mass times acceleration.
And acceleration is just velocity over just over over time.
And, and time is just whatever Einstein said it was.
And then that's the end of the story. And when
you push them further, they say, well, we can't say
any more. That's just the limits of the human mind,
the human mind can't know any better, this is the
best we can do. Wrong. Wrong, it's not the best
we can do. It's possible to directly know what things
are. Without playing this circular game of phone tag, it's
possible to actually understand the substance of anything and everything
within reality, but not through the methods of physics. And
of course, you can see how this is very problematic
for physics. Because if what I'm saying is true, this
makes physics look rather feeble and limited, which of course,
no physicist wants to admit. So the physicist has to
deny that what I'm saying is true. Which they will
do with all sorts of excuses, and justifications. It's gotten
so bad that most scientists today, if I bring up
this problem of substance to them, they will say, Oh,
Leo, but this is a philosophical matter. We are just
scientists, we're humble people. We're just interested in practical things.
We don't care about the the actual substance of things.
These are questions that are for philosophers to debate in
their arm chairs, it says though, you're debating, you know,
how many angels can fit a on the, on the
head of a pin? Classic Classica. Funny example from from
medieval philosophy, or philosophers would depend how many debate how
many? How many angels could fit on the head of
a pin. And this was supposed to say that, you
know, it's an absurd, it's an absurd debate. It's an
absurd question to even wonder how many angels can fit
on the head of a pin. But this is a
straw man. In fact, it is possible to know the
substance of a thing, what a thing is, but not
through symbolic representation, because symbolic representation is always copies of
copies of copies of copies, which never gets you to
the actual thing itself. See, to answer the substance, question,
you have to get to the territory. And the map
will never get you to the territory. But if all
you've got are maps and models, and you've completely dismissed
the importance of territory, then to you, yeah, it's impossible
to ever answer a substance question. And you will then
convince yourself that that's how it should be. And that
substance questions aren't even legitimate questions. They're meaningless. They're completely
pointless. They have no significance to science or to mankind.
That's what many physicists and scientists today have fooled themselves
into believing. But again, that's just a belief. That's just
an assumption. That's just a dogma. That is not actually
real science. I challenge you, if you're a scientist, I
challenge you to become directly conscious of the substance of
any one of these things that I've been talking about.
Anything, matter energy, humans life, consciousness, color, sound, heat, wave
timespace anything, at least once in your life before you
die, become directly conscious of at least the substance of
one of these things. You might be shocked at how
significant that discovery will be for you. You might be
shocked. People who say that science is not in the
business of answering substance questions. These people have no idea
what science can really be. They are stuck in the
current limited conceptions of science. But science doesn't have to
be that way. You can answer substance questions. It just
requires a new way of thinking about reality. Okay, I
want to read you a quote now from Arthur Eddington
who is a great physicist, and really understood this problem
deeply. The problem of phone tag that's being played here,
this sort of sleight of hand, there's a sleight of
hand that science is playing that I want you to
notice. Science is playing the sleight of hand avoiding the
substance question. And then denying that is playing the sleight
of hand. It's very similar to the way that when
you're talking to a religious person, you know, you can
ask them, Well, where did reality come from? And they
will say, well, obviously God created it. And you will
say, well, but that doesn't solve the problem. Because then
what created God? And the religious person has no answer.
He says, Well, God just always existed or something like
that. But then you, you, you, as a scientist say,
Well, why do you need God then? Why can't reality
just always exist without the God? And of course, you're
right. In that kind of reasoning. This is the sort
of turtles problem of turtles all the way down and
call it right, you're pushing the problem down further and
further and further. You know, what supports the earth? In
space? Well, it's the it's the it's the elephants, the
four elephants that the earth is standing upon. Well, but
But what supports the elephants? Well, it's the turtle. And
what supports the turtle? Well, It's turtles all the way
down. But why do you need turtles at all? Why
do you need elephants? Why can't the earth support itself?
See, science is playing the same game, but science is
in denial that it's playing this game. You keep asking
science what something is, and they'll always refer you to
something else. It's going to be a pointer. It's a
series of pointers. So it's like, what is a human?
Well, it's just cells. What are cells? So I was
just molecules? What are molecules? Just atoms? What are those?
Well, it's just a subatomic quarks. And what are those?
Well, those are strings. And what are strings? Well, it's
just equations. And what are equations? Well, those are thoughts
in the mind. And what are thoughts in the mind?
Well, those are just neurons and what are neurons all
it's just, it's just more cells and but but those
see circular and you never understand what anything is through
that process. And it's a great shame. So anyways, here's
a quote from Arthur Eddington about this. He says, quote,
our present conception of the physical world is hollow enough
to hold anything. What we are dragging to light as
the basis of all phenomena is a scheme of symbols
connected by mathematical equations. That is what physical reality boils
down to, when probed by the methods which a physicist
can apply. A skeleton scheme of symbols proclaims its own
hollowness. We have learned that the exploration of the external
world By the methods of the physical sciences leads not
to a concrete reality, but a shadow world of symbols,
beneath which our methods are undoubted for penetrating. What do
the symbols stand for? The mysterious reply is given that
physics is indifferent to that it has no means of
probing beneath the symbolism. The Victorian physicist felt that he
knew just what he was talking about when he used
such terms as matter and atoms. Atoms were tiny billiard
balls, a crisp statement that was supposed to tell you
all about their nature in a way which could never
be achieved for transcendental things like consciousness, beauty, or humor.
But now we realize that science has nothing to say,
as to the intrinsic nature of the atom. The physical
atom is like everything else in physics, a schedule of
pointer readings. In science, we study the linkage of pointer
readings, with pointer readings, the terms linked together in endless
cycles, with the same inscrutable nature running through the hole
and quote. Now the key mistake here is to think
that yes, this is how it is Leo, and that's
all that it could ever be. That's wrong. That's an
assumption. That's a dogma. That's a methodological error. And it
doesn't have to be that way. There's something deeper to
reality than merely a cyclical network of pointer readings. You
are acting so stupid as a scientist and as like
an academic that you have boiled reality down to your
own mental symbols, models and pointer readings. And you think
that that's all there is. That's not all there is,
there's something very profound beyond that, that you're missing. And
I'm trying to help to open your mind. And your
method to be able to access that which is beyond
your pointer readings, and your maps and your models and
your language and your symbols and your thoughts. That's all
we're doing here is we're trying to open your mind
up beyond the point your readings, but your mind is
so arrogant, and so dogmatic and so closed minded, that
it refuses to open up to anything beyond that, because
it considers it pseudoscience. That's the word you invented, to
protect yourself against accessing reality, beyond pointer readings. Please understand
this. You have actually managed to demonize the territory. Because
your methods can't access the territory directly. You've demonized the
territory as unscientific, which is perhaps the greatest travesty and
evil of science is the demonization of the territory, and
any methods which get grant access directly to the territory.
That's the state of modern science. The next problem of
science is the following. To validate any scientific claim requires
that you use my method, not your method to validate
the claim. What this means is, here's how science really,
truly works. If I say that God exists, and the
method for validating that God exists, that you must take
your finger and stick it in your ass, then that
is the method and you must use that method to
test my claim. You might think that's silly. And you
might think that that's not valid science. But that, in
fact, is valid science. Now, whether that will actually prove
the existence of God, you don't know. You don't know
until you actually stick your finger in your ass. It
might prove it, it might not prove it. That's science.
You see. Now, people misunderstand this point. So for example,
let me give you a more tangible example. That's not
as absurd. Let's say that. I claim I make a
scientific claim that ghosts exist. You say, Okay, Leo, but
show me the evidence. There's no evidence, I say, yes,
there is evidence, the evidence is you must put on
these glasses that I made and you will see a
ghost. You say no Alia that. That does not that's
not a legitimate method. You have no right to say
that. You are actually being unscientific when you say that,
to do true science. A person comes forward makes a
definitive, empirical claim, such as ghosts exist. And then he
says you can test my claim. And then he gives
you a method for how to test the claim. And
his claim is that if you use this method, you
will realize that ghosts exist. And then it's your it's
incumbent upon you, the scientist to actually do the test.
And to figure out whether what he's saying is true
or not. That's science. If you deny his claim, and
you refuse to use his method, and you insist that
your method must be used, that is not legitimate science.
See, a lot of people get this wrong. They think
that if somebody comes forward and makes a claim about
nature, that then they get to choose what method is
used to validate or invalidate that claim, this is false.
So for example, if I tell you that there are,
there are four moons orbiting around Jupiter, now there's more,
but let's say you can only see four of them
through a telescope. So I say there are four moons
orbiting around Jupiter. That's my scientific claim. And I'm using
this particular telescope to see those four moons. Now, you
can validate what I'm saying is true by taking this
telescope and looking up there in that location in the
sky and you will see these four moons. That's the
science. Now you say no, you know what? I don't
like your idea of a telescope. So instead of a
telescope, I'm gonna use a binocular I think a binocular
is good enough. And so you take a monocular, you
look up there, and you don't find the four moons.
And you say, well, Leo, I looked up there with
my binocular, I didn't find your four moons, so therefore
they aren't real. You're a liar. And what you're talking
about is pseudoscience. But you see, I didn't tell you
that you could use a binocular I told you that
you could use a telescope. And that's an important difference.
You don't get to choose the method, I get to
choose the method, you must use my method. Get that
this is crucial. This is a huge mistake that scientists
make. Because you see, within science, there's a collection of
methods and instruments that are considered legitimate and valid. And
then there's a collection which are not considered legitimate and
not considered valid. But every method and instrument must be
tested to see whether it truly is or isn't valid.
Now, I'm not claiming here that ghosts actually exist, I'm
using that just as an example. These are just examples.
These are just thought experiments for you. contemplate these things
for yourself. Test whether what I'm saying is actually true.
You don't have to believe me Test test test. Again,
I am making a scientific claim that all of the
points that I'm making throughout this whole series of episodes,
that all of these points are true, if you contemplate
them for yourself independently. Again, that's a scientific claim. And
I'm giving you a scientific method. The method is contemplation.
Now, you might say oh, Leo, but I don't believe
in the method of contemplation. Well, that's your fucking problem,
and you're not being scientific. You might say, What do
scientists empirical science doesn't depend upon contemplation? Again, that's your
methodological problem. I am making a very specific scientific claim.
I am making scientific points here. But these points you're
not going to find in a book. And you're not
going to find them out in nature, you must contemplate
them. You must also contemplate what contemplation is. Because you
don't know what contemplation even is. That's half your problem
right there. See? For example, I'll give you a radical
scientific claim. See, people accuse me of being so abstract
that the things I'm talking about have no real world
significance, but they do. Look, here's a very clear cut
empirical scientific claim, I claim that you're not a human.
Do you believe me? It doesn't matter whether you believe
me or not, because science doesn't depend upon belief, at
least it shouldn't. I claim that you're not a human.
And I claim Furthermore, that that is a scientific statement.
I claim that it's possible for you to become an
inanimate object, like for example, it's possible for you to
become a coffee table rather than a human. This is
possible. Actually possible, how here's the method. But of course,
you're not going to agree with my method. Smoke one
gram of Salvia 60x Extract, not only once, you don't
need to smoke one gram in one in one in
one hit. I mean, over the course of weeks and
months, you can spread it out, you don't smoke the
whole gram at once. But smoking in sufficient quantities, maybe,
you know, I don't know. 20 milligrams at a time.
50 milligrams at a time you have to find your
proper dose. But if you smoke, sufficient amount of of
salvia, you can become a coffee table. And you will
realize you're not a human. Now you say to me,
oh, that's just salvia. That's just some bullshit psychedelic thing
is just hallucination. It's not real. It's not real science.
Again, what did I tell you, you have to use
my method, not your method. Furthermore, you have to actually
do the experiment rather than pre judging it. You see,
that's another key mistake that scientifically minded people make is
they think that I can judge the method and its
results before I actually try it. Therefore, I don't even
need to try it. But that's not science. That's just
fucking ignorance and dogma. That's just begging the question. You
can do this experiment. Now you might say oh, yeah,
but that's dangerous. It might ruin my brain might ruin
my mind. Yes, yes. You could kill yourself. Salvia is
a very dangerous psychedelic. It's one of the most dangerous
psychedelics you could easily take salvia and kill yourself, because
it interferes with your motor control. You could take salvia
jump out of a fucking window. Um, you know, 10
story when don't kill yourself? Yes, you can. But when
has science not been dangerous? is building a nuclear reactor
safe? The early pioneers of radiation all died of radiation
poisoning. Yeah, that doesn't invalidate the science. Just because something
is dangerous, just because it's difficult to do, just because
you don't want to do it, just because it's inconvenient
for you, has nothing to do with the truth of
the matter, you see. That's the difficulty of science. The
reason science is so challenging is because it is dangerous.
To send a man to Mars, to explore Mars and
to do research on Mars is extremely dangerous. There's a
very high probability that the first 10 or 20, people
who live on Mars will die of a horrible death,
because their equipment will malfunction because a rocket will explode
because of some oxygen leak, or whatever. Yeah, that's science.
But that's precisely what makes science valuable is that you're
making these discoveries, which would be dangerous for most other
people to make. See, that's why we build up this
repository of knowledge, which gets turned into belief systems, because
the convenient things about beliefs is that well, they actually
own beliefs can be very dangerous. But you can believe
things you know about the nature of reality without having
to go and directly test them yourself. You know, you
believe that plutonium is radioactive and that you shouldn't come
near it, and then it might kill you. You know,
large quantity of plutonium would be very dangerous. You believe
that? Do you know have you tested it personally? No,
of course not. It's too dangerous to test personally, people
have died testing that our ancestors have died. And to
test that. But for you, that's now just become a
belief. So there you go, I made a very practical
claim for you feel free to test it. Now, if
you don't want to test it, or you're too afraid
to test it. At least be honest about that. Don't
blame me, don't create excuses about how I am being
unscientific. And I'm being irrational. admit to yourself that you're
too scared. And that you're not really a scientist, that
you're not really interested in truth or in science. You're
interested in defending your ideas, you're interested in survival, and
you're interested in being comfortable? You're interested in living your
comfortable little life? In which case, you're not a true
scientist? In which case, what are we talking about? We
shouldn't be having this conversation because you're not interested in
truth. You see, I'm talking to people who are actually
interested in truth, and actually interested in science. Those people
will be willing to take some risks, to understand and
to validate certain things that are said, like what I
said with salvia. The next problem is what I call
the black hole problem. This is a term that I
coined the black hole problem. Basically what it means it
means the following. So let's say that you do take
me up on this challenge, the salvia challenge. And you're
a scientist, let's say you're a scientist at MIT, a
physicist or something. And all of your colleagues, of course,
believe that they're human. And they believe that you're humans.
This is just a belief they held. And they they
will argue this as a scientific belief that you're human.
But let's say you do take the salary and you
realize that you're not human, you become a coffee table
for for a few minutes, then you come back, you
become human again. So you, you realize that you realize
that your human form is just imaginary, and it's just
temporary. Now, all of a sudden, now you you validated
something very radical that's outside of the mainstream scientific paradigm
of your colleagues. Now, you encounter the black hole problem.
You have now through direct experience, become fully convinced that
you're not human. But this is such a massive discovery.
You want to share with all your colleagues, but then
you discover that every Holly you share it with, they
don't believe you. They think you've lost your mind. You
tell them your We're not human. And they tell you
what, are you crazy? Of course, we're human. Why are
you being so unscientific? Saying that we're not human? Every
scientist knows that we're human. That's just a scientific fact.
And you tell them? No, no, you don't understand you.
That's just an assumption. That's just an assumption, you got
to actually do the experiment, do the experiment, I did,
do what Leo said, go do a gram of salvia
over a period of a month, and you'll become a
coffee table and you're real, you'll realize that you're not
human. And they, of course, laugh at you. And they
say, Oh, well, those are just hallucinations. That's not real
science. This is sort of hippie nonsense. No serious scientist
would would consider Sally it to be genuine science. See,
and then, and then you're stuck in the black hole
problem, the black hole problem, what it means it's sort
of like, the reason I call it that is because
I see it in my mind, I visualize it as
you enter a black hole. And the the amazing thing
about a black hole is that it sucks all light
and all objects into it, because it's so dense, such
that you can't communicate any information outside the black hole,
if you get sucked into a black hole, assuming you
could survive, which you probably couldn't. But let's say you
could magically survive, and you could explore the interior a
black hole. And you might discover some amazing stuff inside
that black hole, who knows what's in there, right? But
then you'd want to communicate that information to the outside
world to us humans, so that we could know what
is inside of a black hole? We don't know. How
would you do that? Well, of course you couldn't, because
any signal that you send out of a black hole
will get sucked back into the black hole. Because the
definition of black hole is that light can't escape its
gravitational pole. And any signal you send is going to
be traveling at the speed of light at best. So
if you try to send out some radio waves, that's
light, electromagnetic radiation, any radio waves you send out will
get sucked back into the black hole. And you won't
be able to communicate what you see inside. So a
similar phenomena happens. Within epistemology, with the human mind, once
your worldview is radically expanded through some sort of experience,
like with salvia, you realize, for example, that you're not
human. And that the idea that you're human is just
an idea. It's not actually true. And it's not scientific
at all. You can't communicate it to anybody else, unless
they have that experience themselves. In the same way that
you can't communicate to another human being, that there are
moons orbiting around Jupiter, if that human being is unwilling
to look through a telescope, because the only way you
can know that there are moons around Jupiter is by
looking through a telescope. So unless they're willing to open
their mind to your method, you're stuck in a black
hole, the only way a human can know what's inside
of a black hole is to enter that black hole
for themselves. And every human has to enter the black
hole for themselves. You see, just because one human did
it, he can't pass that information back out. The second
human has to come in. And of course, he also
can't pass it back. And so this keeps happening and
happening and happening and happening. So what might happen is
that you're trying to convince your MIT colleagues that they're
not humans, maybe you find one colleague got a ball,
you know, 100 colleagues, you find one colleague who is
a little bit open mind. And finally you convince him
through much argumentation and much convincing and maybe use using
some of the methodological points that I made about, you
know, epistemology and metaphysics from these episodes, maybe you finally
convinced them like, okay, fine, fine, I'll try this salvia,
it sounds stupid, but I'll try it. And so he
tries it and he realizes, holy shit, I'm not human.
And now there's two of you, who understand that you're
not human. But that doesn't change anything. Because there's still
98 of your colleagues who think that they are human.
So you to now go and try to convince a
third person to try salvia. And that's gonna be you
have to do the whole process all over again, to
convince a third person, he has to try it, he
has to get it now there's three of you. Now
there's still 97 of the other ones who think that
they're human, you see, and so now it turns into
the culture war. This is what scientific consensus, the whole
problem of scientific consensus is that it's not enough to
know the truth. Knowing the truth, as I said, in
part two is the easy part. The hard part is
convincing all of your colleagues of the truth. The hard
part is getting your colleagues to realize the truth for
themselves. That's the really hard part. That requires in many
cases, direct experience, which they are unwilling to have. That
requires them opening their mind to new methods of investigating
reality to which they're not open to methods that they
consider pseudoscience or hogwash or crack pottery. This black hole
problem is a very serious problem. Contemplate this problem. for
yourself to understand why science is so retarded. And yeah,
I use that word. Deliberately. Science is retarded, literally retarded
by its own closed mindedness and unwillingness to deeply contemplate
metaphysical and epistemic issues that I've been discussing here. The
next problem is that there is no distinction between hard
and soft sciences. There's this idea that all of science
can be boiled down to something as hard and tangible
as physics. First of all, like we already said, even
physics isn't really so hard because this doesn't actually answer
any substantive questions about the nature of reality. All it
does is just play with symbols and, and pointer readings
of various models. So even physics is not as hard
as you think it is. It's it's a game of
avoiding the real issues. But, but see, physics is a
very artificial example. Because physics, contrary to popular belief, physics
is actually like the easiest science to do. The hard
sciences are actually the easiest scientists. It's the softer sciences,
which are the harder ones. When you're studying human psychology,
that's hard. When you're studying atoms, that's easy. You think,
you know, building a particle collider is hard. Yeah, I
mean, it's hard, of course, cost billions of dollars. But
in the end, that's easy, easy cake, compared to studying
human psychology and understanding what drives human behavior, that's way
more complex. And it's equally valid as a science. There
is a sort of mistake that many scientists and rational
people have these sort of overly rational people, they get
stuck in this idea that everything can be boiled down
to just physics. Again, it's the reductionism problem we talked
about in part one and part two. But there's this
sort of idea that the hard sciences are more real
and more objective than the soft sciences. And therefore sciences
like psychology, sociology, anthropology, even political science, these things, oftentimes,
they're ridiculed in universities as not even being real sciences.
It's like the real scientists are considered to be mathematics,
physics, chemistry, even biology. Some people will say, it's kind
of like, bullshit. You know, there's more room for bullshit
there, it's more fuzzy. But again, this is a methodological
bias. You see, there's nothing in the universe that says
that atoms are more real or more primary than human
psychology, or than sociology, or than political science. The idea
that all well, billy-o human psychology can just be boiled
down to atoms, or that Oh, political science, all of
it is just atoms in physics. This is a myth.
This is a myth. This is a convenient myth that
was invented by physicists in order to justify Of course,
that physics is superior to all the other sciences, which
of course, is complete self bias. The only reason you
think that is because, again, all you have is a
hammer, and everything looks like a nail. Likewise, mathematicians also
fall into this trap, they tend to want to reduce
all of reality down to math. And they think, well,
political science could just be boiled down to statistics. And,
and then human psychology can just be boiled down to
some sort of equations or something. And that really, it's
math. That is the true, the true science. No, it's
not. If you think that math is some sort of
ultimate explainer of reality, that's only because that's the method
you're good at. That's the method you were taught, and
you know, no other method. Again, when all you have
is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. So this
distinction between hard and soft sciences, this is pure myth,
pure fantasy, there is no such distinction. And in fact,
some of the most important sciences are the soft sciences,
they're some of the most difficult sciences to do. They
require a very, very intuitive, holistic mind. Whereas in physics,
you can be kind of very artistic when you're doing
physics. You can be very, you know, analytical with how
you do physics, but even there, of course, not not
fully. But when you're dealing with the soft sciences, you
have to really expand your definitions of what science is
in order to approach these softer aspects of reality. And
just because the aspect of reality is soft, or emotional,
or fuzzy, doesn't make it any less real. The fuzzy
soft stuff is as real as the hardest physical stuff.
It's just a different kind of real. And you have
to be careful with your method being too biased towards
the hard stuff, as opposed to the soft stuff. Because
if you were truly being neutral, as you should as
a scientist, then you should not put anything on a
pedestal above anything else. You shouldn't put atoms on a
pedestal above human psychology, or human emotions, or political science,
or anthropology or whatever. Because all of these soft things
are just as real as atoms. And in fact, I
can make a case that they're more real than atoms.
Atoms are, are a fiction, atoms are completely imaginary, according
to quantum mechanics, as our strings, as are quarks and
all anything else that you want to ground reality in,
it's all imaginary. There's nothing hard about it. This is
a myth. Of course, there's also no distinction possible between
the natural, the supernatural, the normal, and the paranormal. This
is a huge delusion within modern science, the term supernatural,
and paranormal, these are completely relative terms. And these terms
change with the times. And science is constantly moving the
goalposts with these terms. What's considered normal today and natural
today. And what's considered supernatural and paranormal today, this will
all change 100 years from now. So for example, you
might consider that a ghost to supernatural and paranormal and
therefore it can't exist. Because everything according to science has
to be natural and material and normal. But then let's
say, using some new technology, science is actually able to
see ghosts and study ghosts. And so they do 100
years from now, let's say they're going to study these
ghosts until they reach a point of scientific consensus where
people agree, okay, ghosts exist and we can study them,
we can capture them, put them in a cage, you
know, using a vacuum cleaner, or whatever. And then, and
then, at some point, people will get so used to
ghosts being real, that nobody will question the legitimacy of
ghosts. And at that point, ghosts will not be considered
supernatural, paranormal, they will just be considered normal and natural.
And then some other thing like unicorns will be considered
supernatural and paranormal until you discover a unicorn, and then
again, the unicorn will be labeled as natural and normal.
This has been happening throughout all of human history. So
when scientifically minded people deny certain phenomena, because they seem
supernatural or paranormal, this is this is a pure mind
game. These are labels of demonization that the mind invents
in order to deny certain categories of reality. There is
no definition of what is normal and what is paranormal.
Basically, what a scientist means when they say that something
is supernatural or paranormal, is they what they mean by
that is that it's so outside of the current conceptions
and paradigms of science, that it can't be real. Because
our current paradigm forbids such a thing from existing. That's
essentially what supernatural and paranormal mean. But of course, as
the paradigm of science expands the notions of what a
supernatural paranormal will completely change. And that which used to
be considered supernatural and paranormal will cease being so and
will become scientific. There is no distinction possible between science
and pseudoscience pseudoscience for the same reason, because to know
the difference between science and pseudoscience, you have to do
science. That's what science is about. You can't assume ahead
of time, what is pseudoscience? For example, at at one
point in human history, not that long ago, X rays
were considered pseudoscience. X rays were considered hocus pocus. Today,
they're considered totally normal, totally natural. Today you go to
the dentist and when he scans your teeth with the
X ray. You hardly even bat an eye but if
that happened to you 100 years ago, 200 years ago,
you might have considered this dentist a quack and a
charlatan and some sort of witch doctor. There is, in
fact, no distinction between technology and magic. Technology is just
magic that you've become so used to, and that you
understand how it works. Therefore, you just call it technology
and you take it for granted. Whereas magic is simply
any aspect of reality which you don't understand the mechanics
of how it works. And therefore, to you, it seems
magical. That's it. That's all it is. If you took
a modern day cell phone back to ancient Greek times,
they would have thought that you're a witch, that you're
a sorcerer. And that you have some sort of magical
device. And they wouldn't have considered a technology, they would
have considered it magic. Likewise, if somebody came from the
future, to today's time, and you know, had a teleporter
machine, or time travel technology, or faster than light technology,
or whatever, even, you know, a computer that's going to
exist 100 years from now, if that computer was brought
into today's time, we would, we would consider it pure
magic, and our scientists would not know how it works.
For example, if we discovered an alien spacecraft on Mars,
and we brought it back to Earth, we would basically
consider it magic. Because the technology would be so advanced,
we wouldn't understand how it works, it would be equivalent
to magic. And it would seem very mysterious, and maybe
even supernatural and paranormal, because it would be so weird.
It's so different from what we're used to. You see,
you have to understand that very much what science considers
natural, physical and normal is simply anything that we're very
used to. This is completely relative. These terms are virtually
meaningless. They change every century. Another problem for science is
that science misunderstands objectivity and subjectivity. Science pretends as though
it knows what these words mean. It doesn't. Science pretends
as though it is objective. And it tries to avoid
the subjective, because by definition, science is supposed to be
objective. Therefore, it's supposed to not be subjective. But of
course, the absurd contradiction here is that all of science
is subjective. All of science is happening within your subjective
consciousness, the only place that science exists is inside of
your mind. Science does not exist anywhere else. And by
definition, your mind is subjective. You are the subject that
is doing the science. Odd. So science has this whole
paradigm completely backwards. Science believes that we have an objective
reality within which we have local bubbles of subjectivity. And
that what science is interested in is not studying the
bubbles of subjectivity, but it's studying the larger bubble of
the objective reality. That's how science frames it. Actually, the
truth is that it's completely the opposite. What what is
actually going on is that all there is is one
bubble of subjectivity. There is only subjectivity, reality is only
subjectivity. There's nothing objective about it, within the bubble of
subjectivity, your personal subjectivity as a scientist or as a
thinking, being, within that bubble of subjectivity. You carve out
a smaller bubble, which you call objectivity into which you
place all of your scientific beliefs and ideas. And then
you call that objective. And you believe that this bubble
is larger than the subjective bubble. And you play this
game, that you are actually objective when in fact, you're
completely subjective. And what you call objectivity is just a
partition within the larger bubble of pure subjectivity, which you
cannot escape. There is no escaping subjectivity. Because reality is
nothing but subjectivity. That's not a belief. It's not an
ideology. That's the nature of consciousness. Speaking of which, science
has a very serious problem with consciousness. Science doesn't understand
what consciousness is. Not Not only does it not understand
using its For a paradigm and methods that will never
understand what consciousness is. Science, in its current form is
incapable of accounting for consciousness. This is a huge, huge,
huge problem for science that almost no scientist understands the
scope and significance of they treat this problem as though
it's like, well, yeah, of course, Lea, we don't understand
what consciousness is. But that's because consciousness is just this
fluffy, fuzzy thing. It's very subjective, it's difficult to understand,
it's probably just an illusion. It's not very important. It's
just neurons and stuff. So it's not part of physics,
and therefore, we don't really need to worry about it.
We'll figure it out, you know, future scientists in 100
years, they'll figure it out. No, they won't. Not within
the current paradigm of science, a totally new paradigm is
necessary. Science thinks that consciousness is a is sort of
like a secondary or even a tertiary feature of reality.
It's not prime, it's not foundational, it's not central to
reality. This is completely wrong. Consciousness is exactly the opposite.
Consciousness is the most fundamental layer of reality, consciousness is
more fundamental than atoms, quarks, strings, mathematics, science, or anything
else. All of those things are happening within consciousness. And
there is nothing outside of consciousness, because consciousness is infinite.
You are consciousness, you are conscious right now of science,
of the things that I'm saying. The only reason we
can have discussion about science is because you're conscious. If
you weren't conscious, there would be no science. There is
no science, there is no reality outside of consciousness, and
you can become directly conscious of this. But scientists are
in denial about that. Another huge problem for science is
that science hinges upon Excuse me, let me get a
drink here. Science hinges upon human neurology. Science is in
denial, that all of science is relative to human neurology.
What I'm saying is that if you would change the
neurology of the human brain, all of your science would
change, none of your science would stay the same. In
a sense, what science is studying is not the laws
of the material universe, what science is really studying is
the specific neurology of human consciousness. So all of the
physical laws, all of the work that Newton and Einstein
has done all of mathematics, all of logic, all of
chemistry, all of cosmology, you think that this is all
a study of the external material world, it's not all
it is, is it's a mapping, and a study of
human neurology. That's it. Which of course, makes science completely
subjective and relative to human neurology, you change the neurology,
the whole, the whole universe changes. Sciences, is in deep
denial about this. See, no physicist wants to admit that
he spent his whole life studying human neurology without realizing
it. He wants to believe that he's actually been studying
something outside of human neurology. Which leads us to the
ultimate problem of science. I call this the self reference
problem for science. This is The Strange Loop of science.
Go see my episode called Reality is a strange loop
to understand that concept from Douglas Hofstadter. I'm borrowing that
concept from him. Very powerful concept of a strange loop.
Alright, so look how it works. Here's the self reference
problem science. Science is being done within consciousness. It can
only be done within consciousness. Science is trying to explain
itself, but it can't explain itself, because the very method
is trying to use is like trying to get an
eyeball to look at itself. Or it's like trying to
get a knife to cut itself. You can't use a
knife to cut a knife, at least not the same
knife. Because, you know, you can't turn the blade in
on itself. But because reality is one as we talked
about in part two, because reality is a singular thing.
And science is part of reality. Science is trying to
sort of reach around and grab itself, but it can't
in the same In way in a in a snake
can't eat itself by its own tail. So, specifically, here's
how it works. According to science, according to modern science,
this is again, this is not according to my logic,
it's according to modern science. Perception is a byproduct of
the human brain. And of course, the brain itself is
a perception. So according to modern science the entire material
world is just perception, which is happening inside of a
brain, but the brain is also perception. So you've got
perceptions wrapped up inside of perceptions. And of course, science
itself is happening within perceptions. Therefore, science is nothing but
a perception. And therefore the brain. There is no brain
because brain is just perception. So you've got perceptions within
perceptions, which literally means that according to modern science, all
of science is just a hallucination. Because isn't that what
all this is here? Everything you've ever experienced in your
life has just been a hallucination, according to modern science,
because if we changed the neuro transmitters in your mind,
all of this will change. All of it with all
the colors, all the sounds, all the feelings, all the
emotions, and that's all there is to reality. All of
reality is made up for of colors, sounds, feelings, and
emotions. And that's all that science made up of. Science
is not made up of atoms. See, here's the question
that science cannot answer. What is the substance of science
itself? I dare you to ask a serious scientist, what
is the substance of science? What is science actually made
up of? What's he going to say? He's going to
say sighs man of atoms. But what are atoms made
up of? quarks? But what are those made up of
strings? But what are those made up of numbers? But
what are numbers? Are you really going to seriously sit
there and say that science might have been numbers out
of equations? But what are equations? The numbers, their thoughts?
So are you gonna say that science medical thoughts? But
what are the thoughts made up of? Are you gonna
say thoughts are made up of neurons? No, because neurons
are also thoughts. You're gonna say they're made up of
molecules, but molecules are also thoughts. But no, they're made
of atoms. Atoms are also thoughts. But no, they're made
up of strings. Strings are also thoughts. What are thoughts
made up of? So, science contradicts itself. Of course, if
you think about it deeply. Science has already demonstrated modern
science has already demonstrated that all of science is a
hallucination. All of science has undermined itself. It's just a
hallucination. But of course, are scientists conscious of this? Are
they willing to admit this? Is a physicist willing to
admit that all of his life's work of physics is
pure hallucination? Of course not. Is the physicist willing to
admit that atoms are just thoughts? Of course not? Is
a mathematician willing to admit that all numbers and equations
are a hallucination? Of course not. This is career suicide
for them. Their ego is incapable of admitting this. But
it doesn't take a genius to see that what I'm
saying here is true. Sit down and contemplate it for
even 10 minutes, you'll realize what I'm saying is correct.
This is not a belief. It's not an ideology, you
just look at what's going on. Look at the explanations
that you're using to explain reality. Notice the circularity and
the contradiction within your own explanations of your experience in
reality, you're claiming that there's a some material universe out
there somewhere made up of numbers and equations. And what
is this? This is just your own hallucination in your
mind. It's just bots. It's just, I mean, you might
as well believe in Santa Claus. Santa Claus is as
real, as numbers are. As equations are, as any of
your scientific models are. It's just hallucination. But of course,
all of this is going to be denied. My deepest
teaching from this series of episodes if you fancy yourself
as one of my most advanced students, and you want
to get like, Leah, what are you really tried to
say here? What if I really want to understand science
at its deepest levels? What do you want me to
understand about it? It's this all of science is simply
your imagination. That's it. There's absolutely nothing more to science
than imagination. Science is as imaginary as a unicorn, or
a Santa Claus. That's not a belief. That's not an
ideology. That is an empirical claim that you can validate
for yourself. And I hope that one day you get
that I don't mean that you're going to think it,
I mean, you're actually going to become directly conscious of
it. These are two different things. One day, you can
become directly conscious, if you keep doing this work. And
you jailbreak your mind, you can become directly conscious that
all of science, including atoms, stars, planets, the Earth, gravity,
forces, matter, energy, time, space, all of that is as
imaginary as a unicorn. I hope you're appreciating the significance
of what I'm saying, I'm saying something very radical. I'm
saying something extremely radical. And, in order for me to
say this, and for it not to just completely glance
off your mind, but to actually get stuck in your
mind and really have some traction. For you to get
it, we had to spend eight hours of deconstructing the
myth of science just to get you to this point,
just so that you can even entertain the just entertain
the idea that all of science might be as imaginary
as a unicorn. It might take you 10 more years
of hard work of contemplation and deconstruction, and meditation and
so forth, to actually actualize the understanding that science is
imaginary. But it took just eight hours of this advanced
deconstruction, all this theory, all this build up, just to
get you to the point of perhaps entertaining this idea.
And even even here, I'm probably going to lose over
95% of my audience at this point. 95% of you
listening will not open your will not have sufficient open
mindedness or intelligence, just to just to hold the idea
that all of science could be imaginary. You see, that's
the depth of the problem. With teaching, the things that
I teach is that it takes a long time to
build up to the punch line. Because the punch line
is so radical, that if you were given the punch
line from the very beginning, you would just shut off
the video, and you would call me an idiot. And
your mind would make up all sorts of excuses and
names for me. And the information would not penetrate your
mind. That's because like I said at the very beginning,
we're jailbreaking your mind here. And your mind is using
every possible mechanism in its bag of tricks in order
to prevent the jailbreak from occurring. But for those 5%
of you who are still with me, well, that's what
this whole series was about, is to get you to
this point. But recognize that this is just the tip
of the iceberg. You haven't really understood anything yet, that
I've been talking about. It's all just at the level
of theory for you. This is just pure theory and
ideas right now. Recognize that what I'm actually talking about
is not theory or ideas, I'm talking about something. Beneath
that I'm talking about the territory. So far, I've just
been giving you a map, we need to give you
a map because you don't understand anything else yet. But
one day, you will reach the territory. And for now,
I just want you to recognize that I gave you
a map, the map is pointing to some territory, you're
gonna have to find a way to get from the
map to the territory, and that your job is not
done until you reach the territory. Do not get lost
in the map. Do not make the mistake of thinking
that just by understanding the map, you've got it because
you don't got it. It'll take you 10 more years
to get it another problem of science is that all
of science hinges upon your state of consciousness. As absolutely
every aspect of science that we know today is only
true given a certain state of consciousness that a person
is in. If we change your state of consciousness, every
truth of science will become false and will become irrelevant.
You can test this by actually changing your state of
consciousness. For example, if you get so drunk that you
can barely walk down the street straight. Is there science
for you in that state of consciousness? So you've changed
your state of consciousness? No, there's no science, science does
not exist, literally, science does not exist within that drunken
state of consciousness. Now you say, Well, you know, that's
just because the guy is drunk. And? And yeah, of
course, he can't think straight. And, but that doesn't prove
anything. But see? What about when you're in deep sleep?
Or when you're dreaming? Is there science? When you're dreaming?
Is there gravity? Are there atoms? Are there molecules? Is
there physical barriers when you're dreaming? There could be but
they're also couldn't, they don't have to be? You experienced
dreams where you're flying around, there's no gravity, you're walking
through walls, this sorts of stuff. Time is warped in
all different. Even logic is different in dreams. Conventional linear
logic doesn't even apply in dreams, weird stuff happens. That
doesn't even make logical sense. You see, that's because you're
in different state of consciousness. Let's see. Why do you
assume that this particular state of consciousness that you're in
right now that this is somehow an objective state of
consciousness, that there's something special about this state, as opposed
to when you're drunk, or as opposed to when you're
sleeping, or whatever? Of course, there's not. It's completely relative.
There are 1000s of different states of consciousness, you and
your life have maybe only experienced three or four of
them when you're sleeping when you're drunk, when you're having
sex, whatever. And the only reason you assume that science
is real is because for 99% of your life, you're
stuck in this one. We might call it the materialistic
state of consciousness. But that state of consciousness can change
just like that. Tomorrow, you can die and your state
of consciousness can really change. You can take a psychedelic
your state of conscious will completely change all of science
will fly out the window. See, scientists don't get this.
Another problem within science is that science in general has
a methodological bias towards demystifying reality. Science uses mysticism and
mystery as a pejorative. And, in fact, you can find
many videos and even articles written by scientists where the
title of the video will be something like blank demystified.
We are demystifying physics demystifying whatever, you know, nature demystifying
whether demystifying. UFOs, demystifying animals demystifying religion demystifying everything again,
this is a methodological bias. You see, what I want
you to notice here is that you've never actually seriously
open your mind to the possibility that maybe the fundamental
nature of reality is mystical or mysterious. And that mystery
is not a bug, but a feature of reality. Mystery
is not a delusion of the human mind. Mystery is
not something that we need to do away with, because
it's bad. Mystery is fundamental to what reality and consciousness
are. And that the only reason you've gotten stuck on
this relentless drive to demystify everything is because that's what
you've been brainwashed into. You've never actually scientifically validated the
need for demystification. You see, that's a methodological bias and
assumption. And that in fact, when you are trying to
demystify everything, you are being highly unscientific. There is no
reason why science cannot be mystical. There is no reason
why reality cannot be mystical. You assume that through analysis
and reduction, you can demystify all of nature. But notice,
you don't know that. You've never known that and you've
never tested that. That's just an assumption. It's just a
dogma. It's just a bias. And it happens to be
false. Tada here's another problem of science is that science
makes more mistakes than religion. See, when scientists debate with
religious people, they pretend as though you know, science is,
is the standard bearer of truth. And religion is full
of nonsense and delusion. But there's a gross double standard
here. Because religion is often criticized for being wrong. And
for denying its errors. Yet science historically has been more
wrong than religion. And yet, science always gets a pass
on its errors and mistakes. When scientists make mistakes, those
mistakes are whitewashed and excused away as just being part
of science. But when religion makes mistakes, that's held against
religion forever. See, like, people will criticize religions, like, like
in the Bible, it is written that you know, eat
a stone homosexuals, and other you know, barbaric things like
this. And this shows you just how you know how
deluded and, and cruel religion is and how wrong it
is. Okay, but if you take a science text from
2000 years ago, it's gonna have a lot of crazy
stuff in it. That was way, way, way wrong. Go
find a 2000 year old, you know, scientific text, you're
gonna find so much wrong worse than in the Bible.
Now, I'm not using this to defend the Bible. Of
course, there's a lot of bullshit in the Bible, of
course, of course. But I'm just trying to show you
the double standard that atheists and real and scientific people
and rational people hold this gross double standard when it
comes to science, science makes more mistakes than religion. That's
actually good. Through mistakes is how it improves. What you
see when science makes an improvement, nobody says all all
of science is bad because it made a bunch of
mistakes in the past. No, we say, we give science
an excuse. We say, Well, yeah, it was it was
wrong in the past, but we're kind of doing the
best we can. And today it's better. It's not perfect,
but it's better. But with religion, an atheist doesn't give
this kind of leeway to religion. As soon as an
atheist finds one thing in any religious text or any
religious teaching that is wrong, or, or bad in some
way, then that has held against religion forever. And I
mean, religion evolves just like science, the pope today, the
current pope, that of the Catholic Church that we have
today. He's actually very progressive. He's, he's coming out, he's
come out recently for like, supporting environmental movements. He's come
out against, you know, climate change deniers. He's come out
for, you know, homosexuals and same sex marriage. And so
I mean, the Catholic Church is evolving just the same
way that sciences, the Catholic church of today is not
the Catholic Church of 1000 years ago. Not at all.
It's completely evolved, it's become a lot more progressive, it's
become a lot more compassionate. It's become a lot more
accepting of various kinds of scientific facts. But doesn't atheist
give this kind of leeway to the Catholic Church? No,
of course not. The atheist considers the Catholic Church complete
bullshit, because of all the hypocrisy and all of the
denial and all the gross epistemic errors that have been
made by by the Catholic Church. But yet, when it
comes to science, all of it is excused. None of
it matters. It doesn't matter that scientists used to believe,
for example, that X rays were hoax. It doesn't matter.
For example, that as as little as 150 years ago,
scientists believe that heavier than air flying vehicles were impossible
doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, for example, that scientists used
to believe that going faster than 60 miles per hour.
You know, before there were high speed trains and cars
would would make people's heads explode. Scientists used to believe
all this shit. It doesn't matter. The scientists used to
believe that washing hands was hocus pocus. Doesn't matter. All
of this stuff has been excused away, completely forgotten completely
whitewashed, and now everyone just expects science to be this
pristine, standard bearer of truth. No. Modern science is just
as stupid as, as it always was. Just as modern
religion is just as stupid as it always was. It's
evolved over 2000 years, but the stupidity is still there.
All because nobody, whether it's in religion, or in science,
is deeply contemplating any of these issues that I'm talking
about. It's all taken for granted. the doing of science
changes science. But notice that the change doesn't come from
within In science, the change comes from outside of science.
And therefore, the boundaries of science are ever expanding. Now,
I want to give you a list of over 20
contradictions within science. Because a lot of times scientifically minded
and rationally minded atheists do the amount of people pretend
as though only religion has gross contradictions within it, but
not science. Of course, this is horseshit. So here's a
list of contradictions. Number one, science says that the brain
generates all perceptions, but the brain and science itself and
realism itself and objectivity are themselves just perceptions. So according
to science, science itself is just a perception and therefore
a hallucination. And that actually, science is a psychedelic state
and nothing more. Because of course, right now, you're in
a psychedelic state, because psychedelics are just neurotransmitters. You've got
neurotransmitters, you've got a soup of neurotransmitters going on right
now, inside your brain, according to science, so therefore, according
to science, all of science is just a hallucination. Contradiction
number two, is that science criticizes belief. And yet, science
is factually 99% belief. That's what science is. Over 99%
of everything you know about science is belief. The planet
Mars is a belief. Dinosaurs are a belief. The age
of the Earth is a belief. The idea that the
Earth orbits around the Sun is the belief all these
things for you are just beliefs. All the science you
learn in school are just beliefs. Contradiction number three, science
criticizes religion for indoctrination and appeals to authority. And yet,
modern science is taught by indoctrination and appeals to authority.
We talked about this in part two, in a lot
of detail, credentials, Nobel Prizes, status, expertise, the the authority
that comes from working in an institution like MIT or
Caltech, or Stanford, or Oxford, or Harvard. This is all
pure appeals to authority. Anytime you're trying to prove science,
you're going to appeal to some scientist as an appeal
to authority. And, of course, everything that children are taught
in schools, and all the stuff that's taught in universities
to undergrads. All of that is pure indoctrination. Of course,
it's denied as being indoctrinated, but it's an explanation. The
next contradiction is that science claims to be independent of
human culture, and yet science can only exist as a
culture. Without culture, there is no modern science. Please recognize
this. The next contradiction is that science demands proof. Yet
science cannot prove the existence of an external objective world,
of others of identity, of death, or of object permanence.
None of the things have been proven, none of them
will ever be proven, and yet science demands proof of
everything. I mean, there is no more obvious contradiction. The
next contradiction is that science demands proof. And yet science
cannot prove its own foundations, its own methodology cannot be
proven using science. The next contradiction is that science claims
to be the best epistemology the best epistemic method. And
yet, of course, this cannot be proven. The next contradiction
is that science is supposed to be objective. And yet,
it's obviously being done by subjective, biased, selfish creatures who
are engaged in an activity of survival, which has nothing
to do with objectivity or truth. The next contradiction is
that science denies first person subjective phenomena, and yet all
of science is itself a first person subjective phenomena. So
science is denying itself without realizing that it's doing so.
The next contradiction is that science tries to dismiss consciousness
as an illusion, even though all of science is occurring
within consciousness, so again, a gross self denial. The next
contradiction is that scientists, science claims that mathematics is objective.
And yet mathematics is obviously completely relative and subjective. Because
what counts as a number. How you assign numbers to
things is completely relative, for example. What number is this
hand? You could say it's one hand or you could
say it's a A dozen different bones and muscles and
organs. Or you could say it's a, it's millions of
cells. Or you could say it's billions of molecules. Or
you could say it's trillions of atoms. Or you could
say it's trillions upon trillions upon trillions of quarks. Or
you could say, it's trillions upon trillions and trillions and
trillions of strings. So which is it can be anything
from one to trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions,
completely relative completely subjective, which number you assigned to this
hand, and this is true for all assignments of numbers
throughout the entire universe. The assignment of number is completely
subjective, feature phenomenon of the human mind projecting number upon
reality. The next contradiction is that science demands form a
logical proof for things and yet the most groundbreaking science
is done not through any kind of proof process, but
actually through leaps of intuition. The proof comes retroactively as
we talked about in part two, the next contradiction is
that science issues faith. Yes, science has blind faith in
its own foundations, in quantification in logic, in scientific method,
in the objective external world in others, self and mind.
The next contradiction is that science criticizes religion for relying
on authority, yet it dismisses unorthodox claims within science. Because
it doesn't come from reputable enough scientists. Anytime some idea
is rejected, or one's mind is close to the idea
because it doesn't come from a reputable enough scientist or
source that is an appeal to authority. Another contradiction is
that the truth of science supposedly hinges on reason, and
yet reason it is used all the time to justify
all sorts of false claims. So how can you use
reason to ground the truth of science? When reason is
always used for false claims? Every false claim has reasons
behind it. It's the gross contradiction. Another contradiction is that
everything must be proven. And yet, Google and Tarski formally
proved that truth exceeds proof, and that you can never
prove everything. That's true. Peyton contradiction. The next contradiction is
that science claims to be objective and yet the bureaucracy
of building consensus is a deeply political and institutional and
bureaucratic process. How can science be objective, when the universities
in which science is done are deeply deeply political? And
their first priority is the survival of that institution rather
than truth or science itself? Another contradiction is that science
claims to be fallible and open to change. And yet,
when deep errors are pointed out within science, they are
denied. And the people who point out these errors are
demonized. Gross contradiction. Other contradiction is that science claims to
be free of metaphysics, yet it makes many unproven materialist
and realist metaphysical claims. Gross contradiction. Another contradiction is that
science claims to be purely pragmatic, and yet at the
same time, science also wants to claim to be the
pinnacle of truth within society and culture. So on the
one hand, science, when it's backed into a corner that
says, oh, no, we're just being purely pragmatic. We don't
care about the truth at all. Science can't discover the
truth. And yet, in culture, it wants to be treated
as truth, not as simply something that's purely utilitarian. Another
contradiction is that science claims to be open minded, and
yet science rejects any methods and epistemologies outside of itself
as pseudoscience. That's not open minded. Another contradiction is that
science claims that God and spirituality are unscientific, and yet
in fact, materialism and realism are unscientific. Another contradiction is
that science claims that it is objectively true, because it
works, because it's practical. And yet science denies the same
justifications for other worldviews and epistemologies, which also work and
which are also practical. So when science is practical and
it works, then it's true. But when some other worlds
you is practical and it works, then it's not true.
This is gross hypocrisy. Gross double standard. Another contradiction is
that science criticize religion on the grounds of how historically
wrong religion has been. But science, as I just said,
has been more historically wrong than religion. Science allows itself
the privilege of evolving over centuries, but science does not
allow religion or other worldviews the same luxury. Any error
in some other worldview is considered a dead end, and
a complete rejection of that worldview. But any error within
science is not considered a complete rejection of science, it
actually is considered as strengthening science. This is gross hypocrisy.
Another contradiction with the science is that science criticize religion
on the grounds that it kills millions of people. But
actually, science kills more people than religion. The only way
you can kill millions and millions of people is with
science and technology, advanced technology, you can't do it with
sticks and stones. And by the way, sticks and stones,
you can consider that part of science. But see, when
people are killed in the name of religion, all that
is blamed on religion. But when people die in the
name of science. That's just taken as normal. And there's
nothing we can do about it. For example, when hundreds
of 1000s die in Japan from the dropping of a
nuclear weapon that's not blamed on science that's blamed on
the politicians. When 50,000 people a year die of opioid
overdose overdoses, due to science, opioids were developed by science
by modern science. When this happens, you know, big pharma
in America, you know, kills hundreds of 1000s of people
with, with their, you know, various kinds of bad drugs.
This is not blamed on science. This is blamed on
business or it's billing on politics or blame it on
something else. But when similar things happen within religion, for
example, it's all blamed on religion. A gross double standard.
Another contradiction is that science assumes that the universe cannot
be intelligent. And yet, humans are supposed to be intelligent.
But humans are part of the universe. How can humans
be intelligent but the universe has to be dumb. This
is so stupid. It's so arrogant to think that humans
can be intelligent but the universe cannot. It comes from
a duality, and a sort of a separation of the
human from the universe, thinking that the human is outside
of the universe. But of course, the human is obviously
part of the universe. Anything that the human can do,
the universe can do, by definition, because the human is
just a subset of the larger superset which is the
universe. It's sort of like saying that the stripes on
a zebra can be white. The stripe can be white,
but the zebra cannot be white. But the stripe is
on the zebra. To say that the stripe is white
is to say that the zebra also has white pigment
on it. The stripe is not separate from the zebra,
the Zebra is made up of the stripes. Likewise, with
human intelligence, human intelligence is just a stripe of Universal
Intelligence. And the last contradiction is that science justifies itself
with logic. Yet logic itself admits that it only works
assuming true premises. The problem with logic is not the
logic is the premises that you use for your logic.
The only way logic works is that if you have
true premises to begin with, and you also select the
correct axioms for your logic, so it's the premises which
are really in question. It's not a question of, are
you being logical? It's a question of, are your premises
valid or not? And logic can never adjudicate between which
premises are valid and which are not. So he can't
use logic to ground science. There's a great quote from
John Stuart Mill. about religion that I really love. If
you're an atheist, you might like this quote as well.
I'll read it for you here. Jon Stewart said in
the comedian, he said, religion, it's given hope in a
world torn apart by religion. I love that quote, because
it's a bit strange, loopy, I love everything strange, loopy
and self reflective like that. But I was thinking about
this quote, it was one of my favorite quotes of
all time that I kind of jotted down in my
notes about the nature of religion, but I was thinking
about and then I and then it hit me one
day, like lightning flash, it hit me that I can
just replace the word religion with the word science, and
this quote, would be even more true. Which shows you
the gross double standard that atheists and rationalist and scientists
use. So I've adjusted John Stewart's quote, to make it
now my quote, this is Leo's quote, and the quote
goes like this, feel free to use it if you'd
like. It goes like this. Science is given hope in
a world torn apart by science. Even more true. Think
about it. Think about all of the strife and struggle
that we have today in society? Is it because of
religion? Or is it because of science? Think of all
the drugs. Think of all the car crashes. Think of
all the social media propaganda and shenanigans that are going
on. Think of all the suicides that are happening, using
what? Guns knives, which are products, science, think of all
the warfare that has ever happened. People say religious warfare
killed millions of people but all warfare is not. First
and foremost religious. It's first and foremost scientific. For example,
Leonardo da Vinci. You know, he was a great early
pioneer scientist. What was his day job. His day job
was working for the rulers of Florence. Probably like the
Medici family or something in Italy in Florence. He was
working for these kings and princes building war weaponry. His
job was to devise weapons of war. How to Break
through castle walls, lay siege and kill as many people
as possible. Think of how many scientists are working on
new weapons in the military industrial complex. New torpedoes, new
missiles, new drones, new weapons, new guns, new bullets, new
munitions, new fighter jets, new tanks, new flame throwers, nerve
agents, new chemicals, new gas, biological warfare, atomic new atomic
weapons, weapons for space, the space force that now we
have, thanks to Donald Trump. Now, I'm not saying of
course, that we become Neanderthals and stopped developing technology, I'm
just saying, Be honest. Stop being a hypocrite. When you
criticize some other worldview, apply those same criticisms to your
own worldview. Get a little taste of your own medicine.
See, otherwise you become very smug and you think that
all science is so much better than religion? Is it
really think about it? Think about how the Internet has
been tearing nations apart. These Facebook and YouTube rabbit holes
with conspiracy theories, thanks to the internet. See? People say
Oh, Leo, you should be so thankful because you're using
YouTube in order to publish your content and you're being
a hypocrite for criticizing science because you're using YouTube. Oh,
yeah. Well, you're being a hypocrite by not acknowledging all
of the bad shit that happens thanks to fiber optic
technology. The spread of Alex Jones and his conspiracy theories
and how this has been tearing apart the country and
the world. The manipulation and information warfare that has been
happening through computer technology, all the money that's being stolen
hackers. But see, you're not going to accept responsibility for
this as a scientist, you're gonna say, oh, Leo, that's
just humans being humans. That's just all political stuff. You
know, we scientists, we just invent the technology. We just,
we just study nature and we don't care about how
you use the technology. If you use the technology in
evil ways, well, that's not. That doesn't fall on our
hands. We're not responsible for that. But you see how
irresponsible you are? You see how in denial you are.
Because he, I can use the same logic for religion,
I could create a religion, I could say, I've created
this beautiful religion. It's so beautiful. It's so truthful, and
all this. But then when people get their hands on
it, then they become religious fanatics, and they develop cults,
and they start slaughtering each other over this, over this
ideology that I invented. And then you're gonna blame me
for it. See? And then when I say, Oh, well,
I'm not responsible for that. Yeah, I wrote this religious
text, but then people become fanatics. That's their problem, not
my problem. So you would never let me get away
with that. And yet, as a scientist, you just compartmentalize
and you just want to do your science. And you
just want to kind of take this approach where like,
well, the science doesn't matter. Like I mean, the science
has nothing to do with, with what the politicians want,
and with power and with, you know, human lives and
human well being, you know, that's not a question for
science, that those are questions beyond science. But see, when
you take this sort of compartmentalized, reductionistic approach, then you
create a fragmented reality. And then you yourself, have to
leave it at your own children. See, you might take
this sort of approach, but then reality will come back
and bite you in the ass. For example, your own
son, or daughter might get hooked on opioids and then
shoot themselves in the head. And then maybe you will
reconsider the work that you do in Big Pharma, as
a researcher, and as a scientist, maybe, then you'll understand
that actually, everything in nature and reality is connected. You
can't just separate things. You can't just say, Well, yeah,
I'm a little scientist who's working on a nuclear weapon.
And I don't care about who uses a nuclear weapon
for what? No, you have to care about what you
create, the technology you create, it all is interconnected. When
you give powerful technology to idiots, they might blow up
the whole world, including your precious science will get blown
up with it. Science doesn't exist without society, without culture.
Without funding from governments, there is no science. Without universities,
and all of these things depend upon having a healthy
population. Science can't exist when people are brainwashed with conspiracy
theories, and all sorts of crazy, ridiculous ideologies, through Facebook,
and through YouTube, and other channels and sources of disinformation.
It's all connected. And you have yet to realize the
significance of that. This is the entanglement problem. So let's
now directly answer the question of what is science? And
this is a question I want you to contemplate independently
for yourself for the next 10 or 20 years of
your life. What is science? I want you to derive
these answers for yourself. But in the interest of helping
you along, I'm going to give you some of my
own conclusions from having contemplated this question for some 15
or 20 years. The way I'm gonna give this answer
is not as a single statement, but as multiple perspectives.
Because, you know, what we're doing here is we're taking
a very multi perspectival approach to the understanding of reality.
So usually, when I tell you about something, it's never
one thing, it's it's a, it's a mishmash of different
perspectives that are interpenetrating and connected. So here are different
lenses at which you can explain what science is. So
first of all, science is an imaginary scheme for explaining,
predicting, manipulating and making sense of the world. That's one
definition of science. Another definition of science is that it's
a projection of the mind. Another thing we could say
about science and our perspective is that science the human
invention. Another is that science is a collection of beliefs,
ideas, concepts and models. That science is symbolic representation, the
map and not the territory. Another perspective is that science
is a shared cultural web of belief as clients About
so eloquently in part one. Another perspective is that science
is an epistemology, and a metaphysics, one, epistemology, and one
metaphysics out of many other possible ones. And not the
best. But just one out of many, in the same
way that English is one language out of many, in
the same way that Christianity is one religion out of
many, it's not the best, it's not the only it's
one out of dozens, and perhaps hundreds and perhaps 1000s
of other alternatives that you have not explored. Another perspective
is that science is just trial and error. If you
really want to boil the method of science down to
something very general and universal, you could say where it
really is, is just trial and error. We try stuff,
it fails, it fails, it fails, it fails, it fails,
something succeeds. And we say, okay, that thing works. So
we're adding it to our catalogue of what we call
science. And then we try another thing, it fails, it
fails, it fails, it fails, then it succeeds. And then
we say, Okay, this thing seems to work, we'll add
it to our compendium of knowledge. And we'll call that
science. And then we'll defend that Compendium against any kind
of falsehoods. But the method itself is just trial and
error. Because the truth is, you don't know ahead of
time, you can't possibly know ahead of time, what will
and won't work because you start from a position you
start life from a position of total ignorance. So really,
the only way you acquire knowledge is just through trial
and error. And that's what all of human history was,
is we're just a collection of trial and error, building
upon itself, growing and growing and growing like a mountain,
like a pyramid. And we're still using that same method
of trial and error, to advance the edge of science.
And we always will be. Because we don't know everything,
and we don't know everything, then you make a lot
of error. And you didn't do a lot of trials.
And you can't predict which of your trials will work
and which ones won't. Another perspective on science is that
it's a collection of values, principles, norms, standards and methods.
And of course, all these values, principles, norms, standards and
methods, they evolve over time. Another perspective is that it's
a worldview. It's a mental attachment, and it's an identity.
Another perspective, is that science is a perspective. And everything
is a perspective. And all perspectives are partial, and finite
and incomplete. And that reality is perspectival. But science is
just one perspective. It's not the best, it's not the
truest, it's not the only it's one out of millions
of perspectives. Another perspective on science is that it's an
ideology that denies that it's an ideology. Another perspective on
science is that is groupthink. Another is that it's an
institution of bureaucracy and a collective ego. Check out my
episode, called collective ego, understanding collective ego. For more on
that. Another perspective is that science is a state of
consciousness. That's a very powerful perspective that many scientists aren't
aware of. Another perspective is that science is empirical investigation
of how experience works. Human Experience science is the investigation
of human experience. That's a powerful perspective. Another perspective is
that science is holistic, intuitive pattern recognition, finding useful relationships
and patterns within human experience. Another very powerful perspective is
that science is survival. Oh, that's a good one. Science
is survival. spent a few years just contemplating that one
right there. To get you started, go check out my
two part series understanding survival part one, part two. Another
perspective is that science is a linguistic structure, a symbolic
system as we talked about earlier in this episode. Another
perspective is that science is a sense making narrative activity
that anchors In reality see, you have a sense of
reality. And science is what grounds that without science, you
wouldn't have a sense of reality, or you would need
some other sense making system like religion, to give you
that sense of reality. See, most scientists don't see this
perspective. They don't see science this way. Another perspective is
that science is a collection of conceptual distinctions. To really
appreciate that, you'd have to contemplate what a conceptual distinction
is. Another perspective is that science is finite, limited partial
relative Subjective Truth. And the last perspective I'll give you
is that science is a hallucination within Universal Mind. A
dream? The universe is dreaming, science. See, you see how
much material there is here? Do you see it in
how many different ways you can look at science? Do
you see how much more of a robust picture of
science you have now compared to what most people, most
layman, and even many scientists have of science. And you
can come up with more perspectives, this is just getting
you started. See, I want you understand the following point.
Science is not merely something that academics do in a
laboratory. Science, we might say there's a proto science that
comes before science and proto science is something that you
yourself do in your life. For example, when you lose
your car keys, and you need them to get to
work. So you're scrambling in the morning to find your
car keys, you don't know where they are, you actually
go through a scientific process, I want you to realize
this, to find your car keys, you start to use
some reasoning, you start to use a sort of a
process of elimination, you use a process of deduction, we
say like, well, maybe they're in the kitchen. No, they're
not. There you go. And you check, you know, look
in the kitchen drawers, no, it's not there, then oh,
maybe they're in the garage, you go check the garage,
maybe they're in my pockets, you check your pockets, right?
This is you're doing, you're doing a form of science.
Now, of course, this is very simple. It's very crude.
But this is how science began. Just by individuals, learning
to manipulate their reality, even a little child, when a
little child is playing with toys. That little child, his
mind is doing a sort of proto science. By learning
how the toys work, it's like, oh, I can push
this button and the cow goes, moo, I push that
button, and the frog goes Ribbit or whatever. In a
sense, the mind is learning how human experience works. You're
recognizing various patterns. This is the foundations of science. But
of course, the problem is that you can have all
sorts of false beliefs. And your mind can be closed
to all sorts of possibilities. You see, like when you're
looking for your car keys. One of the features, you'll
notice that you need to find your car keys is
you need to open your mind to where your car
keys could be. Because sometimes the reason you lose your
car keys is because really, the car keys are located
in some location that you probably have completely forgotten about.
And you don't even consider, it's like, wow, the car
keys couldn't possibly be there. And so you don't even
you don't even think about that, that location, but they
turn out to be there. And that's why it takes
you so long to find them. Because your mind is
like too closed. Your mind is only thinking in this
like small little box. It's like, well, the car keys
must only be in the usual locations. But then it's
like, you remember like, Oh, of course. Last night, there
was a party, and therefore the party was crazy. We
were drunk and I left my car keys in some
weird location that I normally don't leave them out. And
that's why they will last for so long. Yeah. But
that requires you to open your mind. See? And you
have to be genuinely curious and willing to experiment to
test stuff. The essence of science is really the exploration
of your own first person phenomena. And one of the
things I really want you to take away from this
whole series is that stop thinking of science as just
some sort of thing that other people do. I want
you to take responsibility, that you are a scientist in
your own life. If you are one, whether you're doing
it consciously or unconsciously, and I want you to start
to do it consciously, I want you to consciously explore
your own experience, your own emotions. You see, most scientists
would consider the exploration and the study of one's own
emotions as not legitimate science. But why wouldn't it be?
To understand what anger is, what sadness is, what depression
is, what suffering is, what pain is, what happiness is,
what excitement is what, what sexual craving is, this is
all science, it's inner science. And nobody can do this
science for you know, Einstein is going to come along
and tell you what anger is, you have to feel
the anger within you and what sources it and how
it works, and how it motivates you and how it
drives you, and how it corrupts your thinking, and what
impact it has on your life. actualised.org What we're doing
here together with all of my work, is we're doing
an inner science. We're thinking deeply about all the practical
aspects of human life, whether it's relationships, or your career,
or how to motivate yourself. Or your health, your nutrition,
or how your mind works, how your thoughts work, how
your emotions work, how your psyche works, why you get
angry, why you get triggered, why you get closed minded,
why you get defensive, why you get offended, why you
have the political beliefs you have, why you have the
religious beliefs you have, why you have the scientific beliefs
you have, how your worldview works, how you acquire knowledge,
how you interface with reality, this, this is the most
important thing that a human can study. And this is
not something you can read about in a book, this
is something you got to do yourself, you got to
take responsibility for this science, this inner science. And I
want you to start to think of it as a
science. Many of the methods of science applied to this
work, you have to test, you can't just believe some
guru, you can't just believe me, you got to test.
You got to do experiments. There is cost and risks
associated with the experiment. Sometimes an experiment is dangerous. Sometimes
it's costly. Sometimes it's time consuming. Sometimes it's confusing. Sometimes
you're an experiment, and you're not sure what the conclusion
is you got to run the experiment 1020 100 times.
This is your life's work right here. You see. Now,
I also promised to give you a list of practical
applications of the things we've talked about here. Specifically, people
have been asking me likely Okay, so what are you
saying? Aside from all the theoretical stuff, what are you
saying is actually wrong with modern science? Can you give
us a list. So here's this list, I'm going to
quickly just go through and I can't explain all of
it in depth. But this is a practical list of
things that modern science is wrong about. So first of
all, a modern science is wrong about materialism, realism and
objectivity. We've sort of already talked about that. Reality is
not material. And it's not real. Science is wrong about
science is also deeply wrong about Western medicine. There are
many, many gross mistakes within Western medicine. Western medicine is
very bad at understanding human health, how to make humans
healthy, how to diagnose and solve many of their illnesses.
Western medicine is enormously ignorant in the dark ages and
corrupt the pharmaceutical industry, but also regular doctors, the entire
medical industry is deeply, deeply unscientific and corrupt. It's not
just corrupted by money, many of the things they believe
are just flat out false and wrong and unscientific in
the same way that doctors you know, a couple 100
years ago, would use leeches for bloodletting and so forth.
And then today, we consider that to be absurd and
unscientific. Well, the same thing is happening today with many
Western doctors. Science is also deeply wrong about perception, the
nature of what perception is, the whole field of neurosciences
is deeply delusional about the nature of consciousness. And in
general, the problem of consciousness is probably the single biggest
problem of modern science, what they call the hard problem
of consciousness. Science is deeply wrong about psychedelics deeply misunderstand.
As the nature of psychedelics science is wrong about rationalism
and the principle of non contradiction. Generally scientists believe that
contradiction is shows you that there's some sort of misunderstanding
about reality when in fact, contradiction is a is not
a bug. It's a feature. Any symbolic map or model
or representation of reality will by definition have contradiction within
it. This is not a mistake. This is the nature
of entanglement and oneness. Science is still deeply ignorant about
relativity, the relativity of all facts, all science, all truths,
all worldviews, all perspectives and all of reality, there is
no such thing as an objective reality. Everything is absolutely
relative, including all physical and material things. Science is deeply
in denial about the existence of paranormal phenomena, ESP, stuff
like remote viewing, astral projection, telepathic abilities, and so forth.
Classic yogic cities, these things are real, they do exist,
they can be developed. They can be studied scientifically, but
not using materialistic methods. Science is deeply in denial about
this. And this will change in the next 100 years.
Science is deeply denial and misunderstands the nature of mystical
experiences. Science is wrong about the nature of birth and
death. And immortality. Science believes that birth and death are
real objective facts, and that immortality is impossible. This is
wrong. This is just simply empirically factually wrong. Birth and
death are both conceptual ideas. They're not real objective things
and immortality is your natural awakened state. And it is
achievable by humans without any kind of technology. Science is
deeply wrong about God, infinity and nothingness. Science denies that
God exists because it's supposed to be Hocus Pocus, supernatural
stuff, but of course, God is real, you can realize
that you are God, dreaming up science. God is not
a belief. God is not an ideology. God is not
something that Christians came up with. It's not something that
Muslims came up with. It's It's the ultimate nature of
yourself when you awaken it's consciousness. God is infinite consciousness.
Science doesn't understand this. Science is wrong about the Planck
length, there's this idea within science that we have discovered
the smallest like element of, of space, and it is
the Planck length, and anything below the Planck length basically
can't exist or can be anything smaller than the Planck
length. This is nonsense. There is no such thing as
the smallest particle or the smallest segment or quanta of,
of spacetime. It's infinite space is infinitely continuous, it goes
down forever, these particles go down forever, there is no
end to the bottom to the mat to the micro
scale of nature, there's no end and there's no end
to the macro scale. Beyond the universe, it goes infinite
in all directions. And you can become directly conscious of
this as an empirical fact. Not a speculation or a
theory. The Planck length just reveals the limitations of modern
scientific modeling and thinking about consciousness. Science is wrong about
the existence of spirits, beings, aliens, and so forth. These
things within infinite consciousness can exist in infinite variety. There's
nothing special about them. There's nothing paranormal about them, per
se. It's just all consciousness. Scientists are wrong about the
nature of intelligence and artificial intelligence. Science doesn't understand what
intelligence is. Science does not understand that the universe is
infinitely intelligent, and that all human intelligence and all AI
intelligence as of computers, and so forth, that these are
all deriving from slivers of infinite Universal Intelligence. Science is
wrong about the nature of love. Science doesn't understand what
love is. And that love is actually not just to
human emotion, but fundamental to to the very structure of
reality and existence and consciousness itself. This will be recognized
in future centuries. Science makes many mistakes within psychology, the
field of psychology, it's still in the dark ages. People
like Freud, and even modern psychologists have such a poor
understanding of human psychology. That's one of the things that
I seek to correct with my work with actualize that
org. Hopefully, you can see the depth of the psychology
we talked about here is much deeper than anything that
any modern academic psychologist understands. So, the field of human
psychology, the thing that it really lacks it lacks is
an existential component and the spiritual component. So when you
strip away philosophy, and metaphysics and epistemology and spirituality away
from psychology, then you get a very materialistic psychology which
can't possibly explain human health, human mental health or human
behavior properly. Also, psychologists don't understand, for example, mental illness,
madness, Insanity, psychosis, these sorts of things. These can't be
understood unless you have a deep understanding of the existential
dynamics of consciousness itself. So, there's a lot of development
that will happen in the next few centuries with psychology.
Science misunderstands the nature of evolution, science thinks evolution occurs
and is caused by random accidental mutations. This is not
the case at all. Evolution is happening through a deeply
deeply intelligent process, evolution occurs, but it occurs through infinite
intelligence. And evolution is not just something that happens with
genes through DNA. Evolution is the entire movement of the
universe. So every molecule that's moving in the universe is
actually part of the flow of evolution and all of
it is an intelligent process, and infinitely intelligent process. Which
science hasn't has no clue about yet. Science is wrong
in assuming that reality can be a simulation. It can't
reality is not a simulation. This is obvious and demonstrable.
Once you understand what consciousness is, all simulations are occurring
within consciousness. Nutrition Science is still very much in the
dark ages, there's a lot of mistakes within nutrition science.
Science doesn't understand what truth is. Science is in denial
about the existence of absolute truth. That's a huge mistake.
Science doesn't have a good understanding of what knowledge is.
And science doesn't understand that all knowledge is actually impossible.
Knowledge is impossible. Only through self deception is knowledge truly
possible. And that's something that science has yet to understand.
Science deeply misunderstands the origins of the universe, this whole
Big Bang model is deeply problematic and flawed. That's not
really the origin of the universe. I can't explain that
further here don't have time for it. Science misunderstands the
nature of duality versus oneness. Science doesn't understand that reality
is one and infinite. Science doesn't understand deeply enough the
entanglement problems that I've been talking about and how deep
they go, science doesn't understand the nature of paradox. And
what paradox actually is, which is a self reference problem
that occurs due to a dualistic mind trying to analyze
oneness or infinity. Science has a poor grasp of language
and how language plays into science and that science itself
is only possible as a language. Science is deeply wrong
about all of its theories of everything, every theory of
everything that every scientist has ever made is not a
true Theory of Everything. It's highly finite, and it doesn't
really account for everything at all, and it never could.
And yet, scientists don't understand this. They fool themselves into
thinking that their theories of everything are real theories of
everything, when of course, they are not. Science has a
lot of mistakes and errors within its methodology. Its methodology
is far too conservative and far too limited. To account
for all of the phenomena of nature. Science misunderstands religion,
mysticism, witchcraft, Voodoo, astral projection, meditation, channeling and other sorts
of what we would call spiritual technologies and methods. So
that's the list. There's more, but that's the list of
very practical areas in which science is wrong. Now, I
want to give you a list of core questions that
I'd like you to contemplate about science. So even though
I've given you a lot of answers here, there are
deep, deep, deep questions that you should be contemplating. So
here they are. Number one, what is science? Number two,
what makes science work? Number three, how can we be
sure science is true? Number four, where did science come
from and who invented it? Number five, what are sciences
assumptions? Number six, what is science is function. What function
does it serve? Number seven, what are sciences limitations and
biases? Number eight? Why has science committed so many deep
epistemic blunders? Historically? Number nine, in what ways is science
corrupted? And number 10? What alternatives exist to science? Spend
the next 10 years contemplating all these questions and generating
your own conclusions. Now to start summing this up. One
time during one of my awakenings, I became deeply, deeply
directly conscious of just how much science understands of reality,
or rather, how little and this image came to me,
which is a really good metaphor for understanding the limits
of science. So imagine the carpet in your house, if
you have a house with carpeting, imagine that. Imagine how
much carpet there is in your house. Imagine that every
square foot of carpet you know, it has little hairs,
little fibers that stick out, you know, hundreds of there's
hundreds, maybe 1000s of hairs per square foot, and you
probably got 1000s of square feet, in your whole house
if you have a decent sized house. Now, this carpet,
let's imagine represents the entire houses carpet represents all of
the knowledge that the universe has about itself or can
have about itself. Everything that could be known. Now, here's
the here's the key, all of human science, as it
is done. And as it will be done for the
next million years, will amount to nothing more than one
single hair or fiber of this carpet. That's how limited
and insignificant and meek and partial and short sighted, modern
science is not just today science for the next million
years. If we keep doing science, we will only know
one fiber of the billions of fibers that comprise the
carpet of your whole house. And actually, even this metaphor,
is truly an understatement. Because while your house has a
finite number of square feet of carpet, the reality is,
is that the universe universal capital, you infinite consciousness, because
it's infinite. Now I want you to imagine the carpet
of your house extending out in both directions, forever. And
all of human science that humans will ever do, will
amount to nothing more than one fiber, one strand on
this infinite sea of carpet. Now you start to appreciate
a little bit of the problems and the limits of
the methodology of science. You see, when we started talking
about the limits of science in the series, you might
have thought that oh, yeah, there's some limits to science.
Of course, any reasonable person has to admit that. But
I mean, how bad could it really be. And now
with this example, you start to really appreciate how bad
it could be. It's very bad. It's much worse than
you could possibly imagine. In fact, the situation is so
bad that if humans spend the next billion years doing
science, we will be no closer to understanding the nature
of reality than when we were as cavemen. That's just
the nature of infinity. The nature of infinity is that
any finite method you use to understand infinity, will always
leave you infinitely far away from understanding infinity. Pretty amazing,
huh? That's the that's the real scope of the universe.
Scientists have no idea of what they're dealing with. It's
sort of like a fisherman. I like this analogy. It's
like a fisherman that goes out to sea. And, and
he hooks a really big fish and he's reeling it
in, you know, he's sitting a little rowboat, and he's
reeling it in. He really, he really believes he's landed
this like, killer whale of a fish. And he you
know, he's, he's really in for hours and hours and
hours, but he doesn't realize that he's hooked the bottom
of the ocean, and that actually what he's reeling in
is the entire Earth. That's what the modern scientists don't
understand. They think they're reeling in a fish. But actually,
they've hooked the entire fucking universe. They've hooked themselves. So,
given the nature of this Given the scope of the
universe, shocking revolutions are coming to science soon over the
next 102 100 years, science will grow by leaps and
bounds. Today science will look medieval to your grandchildren and
their children. your children's children will laugh at how stupid
21st century scientists were. In the same way that we
laugh today at the doctors of the medieval era who
used leeches and alchemy to try to cure people and
actually kill them instead. Of course, science is deeply in
denial about all these things. And it will be a
very difficult task to convince scientists of this and really,
you're not going to be able to we're gonna have
to wait for many of them to die out. And
for new people to be born with more open minds.
And slowly we will inch our way forward the very
foundations of the scientific method will expand and change. Today
what is considered pseudoscience will become accepted as mainstream science
science will acknowledge the validity of the paranormal, the spiritual,
the mystical and the psychedelic science will finally surrender materialism
and realism. Science will finally understand the true origins of
religion and mysticism. Science will acknowledge that reality is infinite
science will acknowledge the reality of consciousness non duality God
immortality and absolute truth. Science will acknowledge the limits of
analysis, measurement, quantification, logic, rationality and proof. science and spirituality
will unify science and mysticism will unify and science will
ultimately finally acknowledge and realize the true nature of reality
as infinite love. How long it takes for science to
do that depends on you depends on whether you are
willing to help change science. Don't expect others to do
it for you. If you don't do it, others won't
do it. If your mind is closed, their mind will
be closed, we have to do it together. We're in
this boat together, science is done together. Science can only
be as conscious and as smart and as evolved and
as developed. And as open as we are, as your
mind is, as our culture is as our society is.
The more selfish you are, the more fearful you are,
the more closed minded you are, the more egotistical you
are, all of this will be reflected in your science.
All of it will be reflected in your society, in
your politics, in your government, in your leadership, in your
companies, in your financial systems, in your econ, in your
economies, in your medicine system, in your nutrition system. Because
every human system is a byproduct of the human minds
who invent and control and manage the systems. So in
conclusion, science is not the end all be all. If
you want to understand reality, you must go beyond current
science. Do not expect current science to deliver the truth
to you, it won't. You're gonna have to work for
it. Modern science has gotten us here. But modern science
is not enough to get us to the next level.
That takes something new, that takes something more. Of course,
science is not bad or evil. It's just extremely limited.
And it's very misleading. Stop believing in science and start
doing your own science. Make your life a science experiment.
The greatest science is the study of yourself. And with
that, I want to leave you with a few closing
quotes. To sum this all up. The first of which
is from Michel de Montaigne, who says, quote, I study
myself more than any other subject that is my metaphysics.
That is my physics and quote and then one from
Werner Heisenberg, a physicist of quantum mechanics, who says, quote,
the first Gulf from the glass of Natural Sciences will
turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of
the glass, God is waiting for you. And quote and
the last quote is from Albert Einstein who says, quote,
there are only two ways is to live your life.
One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other
is as though everything is a miracle. And quote. Alright,
that's it for part three. Congratulations for making it this
far. If you've made it this far, you're, you're in
the top 5% of of my listeners and students, everybody
else has dropped off by this point, and has lost
interest. That means you're serious, good for you. If you're
serious, then start to contemplate the things that I said,
take it to the next level. This is only just
the beginning. Don't believe what I said. Become conscious of
it for yourself. If it's true, and if you can't
become conscious of it, then it isn't true. If it
isn't true for you, it isn't true. It doesn't matter
what I say. Unless it's true for you. All right,
stay tuned for part four, where we will be doing
some question and answers and objections. If you have questions.
Still, if you have objections and criticisms of what I've
said here throughout these last three episodes, please post them
down below in the comment section. I will read all
those compiled the best ones, and try to address those
in part four. All right, thanks so much. Please click
that like button for me and come check out actualize
that org That's my website, you will find my blog,
you will find the book list with lots of books
to go to take you deeper into contemplating the scientific
questions. I have great books about epistemology, metaphysics, science and
philosophy and spirituality and so forth. Really, really solid stuff.
Check that out. You should be reading that stuff to
understand the things that I say. Check out my life
purpose course. COMM asked questions on the forum. I'm on
the forum a lot. I answer. All reasonable, high quality
questions, utilize that opportunity, while I'm still doing it. And
if you'd like you can support me at patreon.com/actualized with
a few donations. The last thing I want to say
here is this. Why are you not more serious about
exploring reality. Reality is the most incredible thing that you
could explore. It's vast, it's profound. It's deep. It's miraculous.
It's mysterious. It's it's incredible. Every facet, every corner of
nature and reality is so interesting. And yet, people take
it all for granted. Nobody's seriously exploring any of their
explorations, even when they do happen are paper thin. And
this is ultimately the problem with your life, your life,
flax depth and profundity. And that's because you don't take
it seriously. When you treat life, like like a joke.
When you take it for granted, then, yeah, your life
is boring and lame. And it's depressing. And it's unexciting.
And it's hard to motivate yourself to wake up in
the morning and to get to work and to have
great relationships that have passion in your life, of course.
Because you're taking life for granted, life is waiting for
you to discover the miracle that it holds the mystery
that it holds the infinity that it is. This is
what inspires all the greatest scientists. Why does it inspire
you? Why aren't you more curious? Don't underestimate the power
of curiosity, the power of questioning the power of experimenting
and investigating? Yes, it takes time. Yes, it takes energy.
Yes. It's confusing when you first start. Yes, you have
failures. It's a method of trial and error mostly with
a lot of error. But do you have some better
idea of what you're going to do here? What are
you going to do? You're just going to you're just
going to buy all the bullshit that society spoon feeds
you all the ready made beliefs and ideologies and you
think your life is going to go well, by doing
that. You're just gonna blindly believe your professors not question
anything. And you think your life is gonna go well?
Well keep dreaming. Or the alternative is you could get
serious you can get seriously curious, you can set your
life on a trajectory of exploring reality, making groundbreaking new
discoveries and helping others There's around you to do the
same. Okay, it's up to you. You make the choice,
I can't make the choice for you, I can only
present you with some of the possibilities. And that's ultimately
all that I'm doing with actualize that org is my
function here is not to enlighten you. I'm not going
to enlighten you. My function is just to make you
aware of the possibilities that nobody else in society is
making you aware of just the possibilities, you're gonna have
to work your ass off to actualize those possibilities. If
you find them juicy and interesting enough. My job is
to present the possibilities in a way that makes you
say, oh, that that sounds like a pretty cool alternative.
Why am I not doing that? Why am I doing
all the dumb stuff that everybody else around me is
doing? Why am I not doing what Leo is doing?
That's all. I'm just an example of showing you what
it looks like to live a life where you're, you're
really serious about pursuing some of these unconventional possibilities. And
then it's your choice whether you are going to actualize
that or not.
