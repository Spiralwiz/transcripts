hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment in about ten minutes I am going
to cover how to stay motivated to lose weight so
if you're struggling to lose weight and you've gotten on
track and then you fallen off track like so many
of us do then this is going to be the
thing for you and I'm going to give you some
practical tips and why am i qualified to talk about
this well one of the reasons besides the fact that
I study a lot of personal development material is that
I used to be overweight my whole life since I
was a kid growing up through high school and through
college I was 65 pounds overweight you can't tell that
on me right now because after college I lost it
all because I got that part of my life handled
and I use some of these techniques to keep myself
motivated to lose weight so that's what I'm going to
talk about and I think I have some valuable insights
for you here so first let's talk about why you're
doing this in the first place I think the initial
motivation for why you're losing weight is critical critical critical
critical to getting you to stay motivated because so many
of us lose weight for the wrong reasons and it's
not really for the wrong reasons but it's just that
the way that we justify to ourselves is not inspiring
enough you need to be inspired by what you're doing
because losing weight is challenging and of course it's going
to depend on how much your weight you're trying to
lose if you're trying to lose 5 pounds of weight
that's not a very inspiring motivational goal and in fact
you might struggle to lose 5 pounds of weight more
than you'll struggle to lose something like 2030 or 70
pounds of weight because when you set a goal for
yourself to lose let's say 70 pounds of fat that's
that's a big undertaking but on the other hand it
even though there's a lot of work involved there and
a lot of willpower has to go into a lot
of dedication and diligence and discipline the reason that you're
doing all that is big because you can see the
difference that's going to make in your life 70 pounds
off shed off of your body that's going to make
such a big difference in so many different areas of
your life right in your relationships maybe at work maybe
your self-confidence how you feel how you look how you
look in photographs so many different things your health a
million different things will be affected if you lose 70
pounds so you're going to be very motivated to do
that if you're only trying to lose 5 pounds that's
going to be a little tricky because 5 pounds not
going to make a big difference 5 pounds is something
that most people probably won't even notice if you take
5 pounds off you you won't really register it and
it'll be really easy to just gain those 5 pounds
back so the point I'm trying to make here is
not that you shouldn't be trying to lose 5 pounds
you should try to make that goal for yourself as
well if that's what you're looking to do but make
sure that it's inspiring the goal did you have to
set for yourself has to be inspiring and more than
just a goal it has to be a vision what
is the vision that you have for yourself the vision
here is something that like you can see you can
picture very clearly how you're going to look in the
mirror 5 months from now a year from now make
sure that you're making a sustainable change and that you
see yourself making a lifestyle change not just a quick
little change for example bad reasons to lose weight because
you have a wedding coming up or a high school
graduation or reunion or some other kind of event where
you need to go and try to impress others that's
not never going to work that's a horrible reason to
try to lose weight because even though in the short
run it kind of gets you motivated in the long
run it does nothing for you nothing inside changes you
need to work on the psychology of why you're overweight
and why you keep falling off track so that's really
really important I want you to sit down and to
say what are some maybe the top three things that
are really going to change in my life if I
lose this way sit down and write them down what's
really going to change and paint a picture in detail
vividly I remember when I was getting motivated to lose
65 pounds I needed to summit everything in myself to
do it because I've tried many times before in my
life to do that and I always fell off track
very very quickly within like the first week and so
what I had to do is I create a creative
vision for myself and for me that revolved around relationships
and I wanted to get into the dating scene and
I hadn't had much success there and I said you
know what if I can lose 65 pounds and get
to the fit shape that I'm at right now then
I'm gonna have the confidence to go out there and
get really involved heavily in the dating scene and I
like I pictured in detail all the benefits that would
come from that including the amazing sex and the relationships
and when I had that picture I got very very
motivated I was so motivated that I was double motive
I would go to the gym double time I would
clean up my diet and and abstain from from eating
too much double time and that was really really important
of course even though you have that initial rush of
motivation which is nice you also need to be able
to sustain it because losing weight takes time takes really
months if you're talking about losing any serious amount of
weight you're not going to be losing any more weight
than about 1 pound maybe 2 pounds per week that's
about all you're going to be losing anything else that
you lose beyond that is water loss it's not actual
weight loss and it takes a couple of weeks of
just getting on the diet for that to kick in
so how do you keep yourself motivated well your vision
is the core thing I want you to actually write
down this vision and I want you to spend some
time spend 5 10 minutes every morning or every evening
whenever you have some quiet time to really close your
eyes and visualize what you're going to look like how
you're going to look in the mirror how are you
going to look in photographs how are people going to
react to you how are you going to feel about
yourself how is your health going to change how are
you going to be taking fewer medications how are you
going to be setting a better example for your kids
whatever your motivations are picture that in vivid detail you
have to picture it because what's going to happen is
it's going to start to get your subconscious mind geared
and on track because right now you have a conscious
intention to lose weight and that's well and good but
then you've got your unconscious mind which is very comfortable
with the point that it's at right now which is
your kind of weight setpoint and for that to budge
something has to change in here it's not so much
about the actions you're doing although you're gonna have to
go take actions it's about changing the psychology because when
you get the psychology right then the actions will correspond
to it in in a certain number of you know
in a certain number of weeks the actions will then
align with what your subconscious is ultimately trying to achieve
so you need to program that subconscious and the best
way to do that is with about five or ten
minutes of visualization on your goal every morning and then
also some affirmations also help so when you app when
you do affirmations it's basically a short phrase or a
statement about what you want and you say it as
though we already have it today it sounds a little
bit silly but I'm telling you this really works as
long as you do it consistently so a little bit
of affirmations and visualizations every morning will keep you motivated
and keep you coming back to that vision and by
affirmation I mean something like you know whatever your ideal
weight is let's say you want to weigh for me
it was 170 pounds and I used to weigh 200
like 35 I think so 170 pounds so I would
you would say to yourself and I didn't know about
affirmations at the time but now I do so now
I would use the technique I would say to myself
I'm at 170 I'm at 170 I look great at
170 I look great at 170 and picture that -
while you're saying it and you're going to have that
image and that is going to inspire you because you
are gonna have some hard work ahead of you you
have to go to the gym bust your ass there
you have to be consistent with that you're gonna have
to watch your diet maybe count your calories cut your
calories change what you eat eat something healthier more Whole
Foods rather than processed foods maybe cut out certain foods
that you like maybe you're going to cut out dessert
so you're going to cut out soft drinks if you're
going to cut out grains all those are great ways
to start losing weight fast and I talked about that
in other videos but here I'm talking about just the
motivation aspect so get yourself get yourself in gear get
yourself gear with the vision and it's not enough to
do it once having a vision initially is great but
to really solve that problem of staying motivated you have
to reconnect with that vision on a daily basis because
you're just going to forget you're going to fall back
into old habits of course the other point here is
that you need to build a habit and you got
to recognize that to build a habit takes about a
month to two months thirty to sixty days to build
a habit and what that means is that that first
30 days are going to be tough they are you're
going to be very disciplined if you want the results
but what you have to look forward to and what
you should be reminding yourself in those first 30 days
is that whenever you feel like you're Gipp about to
give up you have to remind yourself that this is
the first 30 days and this is as hard as
it's going to be it's only getting easier after each
day so let's say you're two weeks in and you're
about to give up and you think about breaking that
diet or not going to the gym and you're going
to have a some sort of mental and there's gonna
be a conversation in your head one part of you
is going to be like I really you know I
really feel so tired I can't keep up with this
routine it's too difficult it's never going to work and
so that's the part of you that's going to get
you to drop off right and to go back to
your old ways to keep your weight or to put
your weight back on then there's going to be that
other part of you that says well but you know
what if it could work what if what if I
actually made it work how would that make you feel
and so that's like the higher part of you and
there's going to be this this this dialogue going on
and you want that higher part of you to be
armed with some good logic some good reasoning that it
can use against the lower the lower half and that
higher that higher part one of the things you can
say is that I remember vividly doing this when I
was really feeling down is I would say to myself
this is as hard as it's going to get I've
already gone through the worst of it and it's long
getting it easier because I'm building a habit and what's
happening as each day of the habit building process is
going forward and and I'm doing it successfully I can
be confident in the fact that the next day is
going to be a little bit easier because what's happening
is that my subconscious mind is rewiring itself to get
out more with the new habit so if I've been
going to the gym for two weeks straight I've been
doing that really consistently and now on the third week
I'm having some difficulty I'm going to start reasoning with
myself I'm going to say it like something like along
the lines of well we've done two weeks we need
to do one more week this is gonna be the
hardest week if I can do this week the next
week is going to be easier and then the week
after that it's going to be a little bit easier
because I'm going to get on board my subconscious getting
on board it's becoming a habit and what happens is
after you pass that 30 to 60-day mark is that
it becomes much easier you become a lot less tense
and anxious and you don't have to be so disciplined
to stay on track you're not going to really have
to motivate yourself as much you're going to find that
you just kind of fall on a groove and that's
exactly what happened to me is I spent about a
month or two getting myself really disciplined and hitting it
really hard at the gym and cleaning up my diet
and then what I found is for the remaining four
months I did this for about five months for the
remaining four months it was it was pretty much just
just kind of going through the motions and it wasn't
that difficult I mean it was difficult in the moment
but when I think about it those four months just
like flew flew by they flew by and losing those
65 pounds on some level was one of the hardest
things I've ever done I'm not alone it's kind of
easy after that initial hump so keep reminding yourself that
that initial hump the other thing I'm going to tell
you is a technique that I used if you're at
the gym only think about one day at a time
so baby step it don't think about the fact that
oh I have to go to the gym today and
then have to go to the gym tomorrow and then
have to go to the gym the next day and
then go to the gym for a month don't think
about it like that focus just on completing today because
the fact is that to lose the amount of weight
that you want to lose all you have to do
is take the right actions every single day and only
have to do is focus on that one day because
here is going to happen is that your willpower throughout
the day it's going to diminish right and at the
beginning that you're gonna feel good and then middle of
the day you're going to feel a little bit tired
and at the end of the day you're going to
be you're gonna have an urge to not go to
the gym or to to pig out or to break
your diet eat unhealthy grab some fast food whatever when
your willpower has waned at the end of the day
and it's dropping off which you got to do is
kind of just remind yourself that this is the hardest
part of the day and that if I could just
make it through and just focus on today I don't
want to add any more pressure on myself by thinking
about how I'm going to do it tomorrow or the
next day or the next week just think about how
I'm going to get through a day and if you
can get through today then the next day you're going
to have a renewal of energy and it's going to
be again it's can be able easier the next day
you're gonna have more energy and it's gonna be a
little easier so just focus on today this applies both
to the gym if you're if you're cranking it out
at the gym and you're feeling like givin up and
then also with your diet you know sometimes you're going
to have to abstain from food and just tell yourself
all you have to worry about is this this day
doing it right this day and then the rest of
it will take care of itself and then trust that
if you do today right and just worry about doing
today right that is all you need to guarantee that
you're going to lose your weight kind of cool huh
you don't need to worry about tomorrow just worry about
today that's what's nice about diets is that once you
know what you should be doing every day then you
don't need to worry about the next day all you
got to do is worry about the current day same
thing with the gym then of course the the last
point that I'm gonna end on is I've been talking
about it as though this is something you're going to
do for like three months or four months or five
months kind of the way I did I didn't really
just do it for five months in the beginning when
I decided to lose my weight I didn't say I'm
just losing weight or I'm going on a diet what
I said is that I'm making a complete life change
I'm changing my relationship to food and in fact I
accepted the cost and I remember I was rationalizing with
myself and I told myself that I'm going to be
going to the gym for the rest of my life
if I want to keep this weight off so this
was not a I'm just going to do this for
five months what I said is I'm going to commit
to going to the gym for the rest of my
life but for the next five months because I'm going
to be losing that weight I'm gonna work hard and
I'm gonna be extra diligent because I'm just setting it
up and I want to actually drop the weight and
then after that I was honest with myself I was
going to be going to the gym all the time
and I was honest with myself that I would have
to change my eating habits and those would be permanent
changes so the other thing that you got to do
is you got to start thinking about what which changes
can you make that you're going to be reasonably satisfied
with so that means don't make changes that are so
radical that you could not live with them every change
has to be indefinitely sustainable that means that if you're
going to the gym you have to be able to
do that along with everything else that you're doing in
your life for the rest of your life that means
just because you crank it hard for two hours every
day for a week at the gym and you're able
to manage that somehow by by not doing any of
your other obligations in life and then the next week
comes and all of a sudden you got to go
back to work and you got to take care of
the kids and you got all these other things that
you got to be doing and then you don't have
time for the gym anymore that's an unsustainable strategy what
you want is a sustainable strategy so that means how
do you carve out 20 minutes for the gym how
do you carve out 30 minutes 40 minutes whatever you
can manage how do you make a change in your
diet so that you're now from now on through the
rest of your life never going to eat some of
those things that are causing you problems how are you
going to not overeat so you got to think about
that ahead of time and plan a little bit that
planning just some of the practicalities of losing weight are
getting important because a lot of times people would just
say oh I'm losing weight and they don't plan it
through and then they get caught up in that and
then of course I'm going to say to stay motivated
properly you need to have proper expectations and proper expectations
here I'm going to really tell you you cannot lose
more than two pounds a week any other diet that
promises you that is full of [ __ ] and
even losing one pound a week is is pretty challenging
so I was losing about two pounds a week but
I was hitting it really really hard I was literally
starving myself because I had a large calorie deficit of
probably close to 800 calories maybe even a thousand calorie
calorie deficit so I was always feeling hungry I did
that for five months you want to do that maybe
you don't if you really want to lose two pounds
a week then you're gonna have to do that you're
going to need a calorie deficit you might also need
to change radically change the composition of the food that
you're eating so much less carbohydrates more protein what may
be more healthy fats and then of course may be
cutting out sugars things like that right so set the
right expectations you can probably aim for one pound a
week and be happy with that and give yourself for
those initial three weeks don't expect any changes if you
get them that's great but don't go in there expecting
them because a lot of times I feel like the
reason that people lose or motivation is because they set
an expectation and then when they get on the scale
they don't see it they get so despondent about that
that they quit because they feel like it's not working
I can tell you this if you change your diet
clean it up and you start going to the gym
it can't not work the only reason it's not going
to work is if you don't go consistently and consistency
is key so you don't have to worry about it
not working it will work but you have to do
consistently to have a little bit of belief you have
to give yourself those first three weeks to put the
habit into place and to get your body to start
getting on board and to start making the physical changes
and then you're going to see it you're going to
see losing half a pound a week maybe a pound
a week if you're really working it hard you might
get to two pounds a week and it's really really
exciting when you get that but don't expect too much
too fast when I was getting to this I said
that I would really be working at it for a
whole year and to me I was happy because I
said that you know what if a year from now
I've lost 65 pounds to me that's totally worth it
because my dating life is improved my sex life improves
my self-confidence improved and that's how I did it and
I think that's how you can go - so these
are some practical tips I'm going to sign off now
