hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about how to stop judging
yourself and I'm going to show you a powerful exercise
to help you do exactly this I feel a bit
of a cold coming on so bear with me as
I try to push through it anyways on to the
main topic judgments judgments judgments judgments the problem with judgments
is that judgments are poisoning your life and as usual
which should now be becoming an apparent theme through all
the actualized auteur content is that you're usually not aware
of how this mechanism works you're not aware of how
judgments backfire on you how when you judge others in
a sense you're also judging yourself at the same time
and in fact that's the profound insight that I want
to hammer home at you today is just this one
simple idea that judgments that you make about others always
apply to you and it doesn't seem this way at
first so what I want to do is I want
to illustrate this point with assortment of examples common examples
that I think that a lot of us have run
into but the idea is very simple every time you
make a judgment about somebody else their physical appearance or
their behavior or their belief systems or anything else you're
basically also judging yourself at the same time and you're
making life for you very difficult in the future so
how does this work well let's take example number one
which is judging fat people maybe you're one of these
people that actually values his or her health and so
you go to the gym and you work out and
eat healthy okay but then you judge fat people as
they're walking down the street maybe you see a really
obese person you're like oh man that's just a fat
slob right there and made even sometimes you and your
friends kind of laugh at this fat person because you
are all into fitness stuff and you're all into eating
healthy and go to the gym and working out real
hard okay fair enough but here's the problem with this
you might wonder well Leo how does this backfire on
me I mean I'm fit I have a good well
toned body and I take care of my health so
it's not backfiring on me right I mean I'm vigilant
about my health except it does backfire on you let's
just take one example let's say you go to your
parents over the holidays and you go to visit them
for Thanksgiving and Christmas and it's a big feast and
everyone's eating over there and stuff like that right turkey
mashed potatoes everything the whole works so what happens well
you start to indulge that a little bit you fall
off your healthy diet for a while and you start
to put on maybe an inch or two around your
waist all of a sudden your belts get a little
tight you have to loosen up the notch by one
okay but what happens it's not just that that happens
the problem with that is that you now start to
feel guilty to feel bad why do you feel bad
you feel a little bit of shameful why because you've
been judging fat people for years and now of course
you're not fat but even as you begin to even
just creep towards fatness you just put on an extra
inch or two of fat all the sudden you get
neurotic about it you shouldn't going crazy about it it
drives you nuts right now all the sudden it's like
okay I gotta get back into the gym hit it
really hard got a brow beat myself got a flagellate
myself to stay healthy and fit and so your whole
fitness routine then becomes this kind of like avoidance and
escape of coming under the under the effect of your
own past judgments around fat people which is the terrible
source of motivation for going to the gym so that's
one example right one example and that's just one facet
of how this could manifest some time in the future
let's say you get a girlfriend and now your girlfriend
she starts to put on a few pounds this is
years later but see you can't help the fact that
you've been judging fat people so now she's putting on
weight you start to see her as fat now all
the sudden starts to bother you such to worry you
you want to tell her but you don't want to
offend her what do you do creates a whole problem
for you right maybe you break up with her because
of that maybe creates a huge argument for you guys
and it's just like a a simple little thing I'm
not saying that she just you know turned into a
way and all of a sudden I'm saying she just
put on a few pounds but it still bothers you
and you don't know how to deal with it effectively
so that's example number one here's another example that I
want to cite in this one's for the ladies ladies
love to do this what ladies love to do is
they love to judge other hot ladies so if your
lady no I'm talking about you have a friend or
a friend of a friend or some girl that you've
seen that's really hot and what you do or you
know if you see your guy looking at a hot
girl in your mind what you do is you call
that hot girl you call her a hot [ __
] she's not just a girl she's not a lady
she's a [ __ ] she's a [ __ ]
she's a little skank right because she's that model looking
type she's probably a skank your thing in yourself so
this is how you judge these types of women and
maybe you've been judging these types of women ever since
your mother was judging these types of women when you
were just a teenager still back in middle school or
in high school and she told you don't be a
[ __ ] like those girls on the magazines or
those girls in the movies and so of course now
you judge the way your mother judged and so the
problem with this though you might say well leo I'm
not a [ __ ] so what's the problem here's
the problem is that let's say now you find yourself
a new boyfriend and you're you're in love with him
and everything is going great and now you're in the
bedroom with them right and you're gonna have sex but
now you're feeling guilty and conflicted and repressed in the
bedroom you can't orgasm properly you can't have multiple orgasms
why not well because and then it's just one factor
but one factor could be that the reason you can't
is because you've been so judgmental about other people having
sex that when it comes to you having sex now
you feel in congruence if you fully let yourself go
so of course you do still have sex but the
kind of sex you have is is kind of like
lame mechanical sex not the really good kind of sex
and maybe you don't orgasm or if you orgasm you
have a weak single orgasm you don't multiple orgasm you
don't have wild crazy orgasms like you could and you're
in conflict with yourself you feel guilty you're not able
to kind of like let yourself go the way you
should the way you want to why because you've been
judging other people your whole life for doing that and
now your self-image because your self-image needs to maintain integrity
it needs to apply the same rules that you used
on others to yourself and now is when it comes
back to bite you in the ass another example have
you ever rushed have you ever judged rich people like
you see somebody driving a Mercedes or a Ferrari or
something down the street or sitting there in a restaurant
fancy restaurant with the Rolex as you're walking by on
the street corner and you think yourself ah man that's
such a rich douchebag look at that rich douchebag sitting
there eating his rich lunch with his rich girlfriend and
his rich car and his rich Rolex watch and all
this stupid stuff he I bet you he's a some
Wall Street broker type of guy who swindled some old
grand lady out of her retirement savings and now he's
sitting there and he's wining and dining his girlfriend on
that money so you come up with that kind of
story right and you do that over and over over
again maybe you grew up in kind of a middle-class
family where your parents made these kind of judgments about
rich people and they told you the hey rich people
don't care about middle-class people they don't care about poor
people they step on people they use us and of
course that that kind of judgmental attitude was also reinforced
by your friends who are also probably lower middle class
and so now you're an adult and here's where it
backfires on you now maybe you're thinking about starting your
own business or maybe you already have a business and
now your business starts doing goods or to earn a
lot of money but of course now there's this in
congruence within you because you're starting to become rich just
like those people but your mind didn't make the space
for a nice rich person it automatically classified all rich
people as douchebags and so now you're falling under your
own judgment and it might go to the point where
now you you actually sabotage your own business or maybe
if you consider going to business then you let go
of that dream you say yeah you know what if
I went into business I would just be one of
those rich douchebags so even if I succeeded I would
basically be a failure and my parents wouldn't really respect
me because I'd just be like one of those rich
douchebags here's the thing you gotta understand about this is
that this happens all very subconsciously you're not aware this
is happening it's not clear to you in your mind
that when you sabotage your own business or you sabotage
your own relationship or your sabotage your own gym routine
or something like this that this is coming from a
judgment that you made five ten twenty years earlier that
connection isn't made clear so you know you got to
do the dot connect and got to connect all the
dots that start to see this stuff it's very subtle
it can be let me give you another example how
about the judging newbies I love this example maybe you're
at the gym with your friends and you guys have
been going to the gym for the last ten years
and you're all experts you've studied all the fitness routines
you know exactly which exercises to do and all the
right fitness moves and stuff right but then after the
new year's crowd comes in every January these are all
you know fresh greenhorns who've never been to the gym
before and of course what do you do if you're
a regular gym goer you're laughing and snickering and you're
ridiculing with your buddies all the newbies that come through
the door and get on the treadmill or they start
doing some stupid exercise routine that you think is ridiculous
that is completely against all the you know all the
rules and all the norms and they don't know which
weights to use or how to use them properly so
as they're doing that you and your guys your buddies
are watching you're watching this newbie doing this thing is
newbie thing and you're watching him kind of like fail
and self-destruct but you're laughing and ridicule but actually what
you're doing as you're laughing in ridiculing is you're judging
him now how does this come back to bite you
in the ass well let's say you want to go
learn some new hobby like you want to take up
golf and you you're totally new to golf so now
you're going to go golfing and swing at the driving
range so you go there you think I'm going to
be all cool you pull out your club and you
swing and guess what you make a fool of yourself
because you miss you can't even hit the ball on
your first swing and you suddenly feel very very stupid
and you feel very very self-conscious because you're standing there
and you're feeling like all the expert golfers all the
pros are standing around you and they're watching you and
they're laughing at you now maybe they aren't or maybe
they are but the fact is that you're very self
conscious about it and in fact what might happen is
that you go for a week to the driving range
and each time you're so frustrated with how poor you're
doing and you feel like you're a total noob and
that you look ridiculous that a week later you just
quit the whole thing you say you know what that
golf thing is just so stupid it's for rich people
anyways screw that golf stuff I'm just going to go
back to the gym and stick to what I know
how to do best and so in this way you
deny yourself some new opportunity in life and you know
golf business relationship does matter what it is right this
new be judging is a it's a really good example
you see it all over the internet too you see
people doing this because you know it's really easy to
judge newbies really easy to to criticize them laugh at
them at their expense but then inevitably comes back to
bite you now those are some examples of like negative
judgments I want to give you an example of positive
judgment because not all judgments are seemingly negative you might
wonder well leo is it okay to make positive judgments
it's still a problem here's why let's say you have
a guy at the office who you perceive as being
really charismatic and charming and just flirtatious and he's funny
and he's got a great sense of humor really outgoing
and extroverted and so you you see this guy you're
really you know attracted by his personality like oh man
this guy's amazing you're amazing and now you start to
feel like you're inadequate because you judged him is being
up here and you judge yourself as being down here
maybe you're a little bit more shy reserved more introverted
and you want to feel like you're more extroverted and
more charming and you don't know like you you don't
know how to develop that sense of humor that he
has it seems so effortless for him and so now
what happens is that you're five years later after you've
made this judgment of him being such a charming great
person is you're still interacting with other people in your
office or in a different company now or wherever and
you're still feeling inadequate because you're comparing yourself to him
the judgment you created back to them is still being
applied to you now in a sense judging is like
creating a law or a rule which then your mind
stores and then that law or rule of course gets
applied to all future situations because your mind tries to
stay consistent tries to maintain integrity with itself so if
you judge a fat person here then if you ever
become fat you're going to be judging yourself if you
judge a [ __ ] person over there if you
ever do anything [ __ ] you're gonna be judging
yourself if you judge rich people anytime you make a
little extra money you're gonna be judging yourself you're going
to feel guilt you're going to feel shame you're going
to feel inadequacy or some other kind of like low
consciousness nasty type of emotion um another good example that
I like is those panhandlers on the street you ever
see some of those bums those dirty bums on the
street it's really easy to judge those guys right so
they're standing on the street begging you for a quarter
and of course you know sometimes you give them a
quarter but sometimes you don't and in fact you say
something like man look at this guy why doesn't he
just like clean himself up and go get a job
at McDonald's at least he could earn more money than
just standing here like a pathetic slob I bet this
guy's lazy he's such a lazy bum and then every
time you see a bum you call him lazy now
five years later it backfires you how does it backfire
you because let's say you're working on some project in
your business and maybe your partner tells you hey man
you've been slacking you're lazy and all of a sudden
now you start to get kind of frantic and neurotic
and even though you're working 50 or 60 hours a
week just because your business partner called you lazy you
didn't take it as a joke you actually took it
seriously and now you're like well [ __ ] I
should work even harder he's right I should work 80
hours a week and so what you do is you
kill yourself for the next three years working 80 hours
a week burn yourself out make yourself sick deny yourself
the other pleasures of life estranged yourself from your family
and maybe your relationship goes bad maybe your marriage gets
a divorce and and all of that simply because you
were reacting against your judgment of not wanting to be
lazy because you call those people lazy and of course
that's a rule that you created in your mind which
said lazy is bad which of course means at any
time I get even close to lazy or I even
inch my way towards lazy I'm all the sudden bad
creates a lot of problems and the last example I
want to give you is the the unloving mother example
which is a really great one that I love let's
say that in this example you're the woman and you
were a girl and you grew up with a mother
that didn't give you a lot of affection criticize you
all the time wasn't loving enough and this really hurt
you and had a really kind of like troublesome teenage
years and because you feel like you weren't getting enough
love so you judge that is bad and then you
told yourself you know what when I have kids I'm
going to be the most loving mother ever because my
mother was a selfish [ __ ] and I'm not
going to be that way with my kids and that
seems like a very positive rule to make in your
mind right be be more loving be more selfless how
great is that what could possibly go wrong well except
twenty years later when you do have your own kids
what happens well now you need to play that role
of the selfless mother and so now you sacrifice yourself
for your kids your kids walk all over you you
do everything for your kids you don't take any time
for yourself you don't take care of your health you
don't take care of your psychological needs so you grow
fat and you go psychologically neurotic slowly over the years
as you're sacrificing yourself to your kids and your kids
become more and more ungrateful little brats and then the
same thing now happens with your husband as well and
your whole family situation just goes to hell and maybe
eventually you get a divorce and you grow sick with
cancer why does all this happen well I'm not saying
this is the only cause but one possible cause for
why something like this would happen is because you set
down this law very early in your childhood that told
you I will never be selfish like my mother I
will never be unloving like her even though you know
what sometimes it's okay to be selfish sometimes you need
that sometimes you need to take a vacation sometimes you
need to do something for yourself at the expense of
your kids and that can be normal and healthy but
you don't allow yourself to do that because you've just
been so harsh and judgmental on your mother about that
and for you now to go back on your old
promises and your old laws and rules well that means
you have to change how your whole mind works and
notice that in this example you would not be aware
of how all this stuff is happening you'd be having
problems in your family and with your kids but you
wouldn't know why it's happening you would never connect the
dots all the way back to some innocent seeming little
judgment that you made 20 years ago so just notice
how subtle it can be those are just some examples
it's just the tip of the iceberg I just wanted
to use these examples to kind of get your mind
jogging and to start to connect the dots in your
own life for you these examples might be totally different
than what I talked about here yet kind of creative
sort of thinking how is this working in my life
fundamentally the problem here in all these examples is that
your disowning a part of reality you're creating rigid rules
by which now you have to live and whenever you
break one of these rules and these rules by the
way they're very arbitrary totally arbitrary that now you feel
like well [ __ ] I can't break these we'll
have to live by all these have to jump through
all these hoops I have to be the perfect person
I just a consistent with all my past judgments I
can't admit that I was wrong and so because of
this you block off a lot of avenues within reality
now you can't take a vacation now you can't be
a little bit lazy now you can't be rich now
you can't be a newbie at something now you can't
be sexual now you can't gain a little bit of
weight and so on and so on and so on
and what this does is it makes you inflexible in
life you're not able to flow with the circumstances of
life you're not able to be spontaneous in life and
this creates problems for you creates guilt creates shame and
largely you don't know this is going on it's just
going on to you it feels like man my life
feels miserable why do I feel guilty all the time
why do I feel shameful all the time why do
I feel unsatisfied all the time why do I feel
like I can't do anything right all the time why
do I keep self sabotaging every relationship every new business
every new hobby that I start just doesn't seem to
work for me well maybe it's because you made some
judgments that are holding you back and that just backfired
on you again and again and again here's one of
my personal biggest insights that I've had this year from
doing a lot of enlightenment work and consciousness work in
workshops one of the biggest insights I had was this
was that the reason that I've been a people pleaser
for most of my life until recently is because and
I trace this back into my past is I recognize
that oh I used to judge my dad for being
inconsiderate towards other people what I perceive it and consider
it and I kind of thought of him as a
jerk and I said to myself you know what when
I grow up I don't want to be that kind
of man I don't want to be the church I
don't want to be the inconsiderate I want to be
the kind the nice one and so that sealed my
fate now whenever I interacted with people for decades after
making that judgment I would always try to be the
nice one because I would subconsciously be running away from
that negative ideal that my dad said and I didn't
just judge my dad as being inconsiderate so judge other
people's being inconsiderate so it was a combination of various
judgments but basically that created this kind of a people-pleasing
personality profile for me and it just kind of fired
and fired and fired I didn't know why it was
happening only years later after lots and lots and lots
of consciousness work that I finally stumble upon by accident
this discovery that all of course I made that judgment
when I was really young and it's hung around with
me and stuck around for four decades and I've been
paying the price and I didn't know what was going
on there because you know what sometimes in life you
got to be inconsiderate you might wonder like well Lee
oh yeah of course you don't want to be inconsiderate
what's wrong with that law what's wrong with that judgment
but the fact is that sometimes you are inconsiderate in
life sometimes you do have to be a dick sometimes
you can't help it especially like in business or in
some kind of negotiation situation or in a relationship where
you have to break off the relationship when you know
it's good for both of you to break it off
but you don't because you're just so used to being
a people pleaser and you don't want to disappoint somebody
or be perceived as a jerk right you need that
flexibility and I deny that to myself so that created
some problems for me all right so how do we
get you to recognize this kind of stuff for yourself
these kind of deep insights well I got a great
exercise for you which is actually the exercise that I
use to discover this insight for myself so here it
is you're going to take out a couple sheets of
paper and a pen do that right now you're going
to do two things with this paper and pen firstly
you're going to write out every single judgment that you've
ever made about other people you're going to make a
giant long list it might be a hundred or 300
items on this list second thing you're going to do
is you're going to write out every judgment you ever
made about yourself and again this will be another list
separate list with another hundred to three hundred different items
there could be a lot and the key as you're
doing this is that you want to do a kind
of a stream of consciousness where you get in the
flow and you just let pour out of you might
take you 30 minutes to sit there and just let
this list pour out without any filtering so the most
evil vile harshest judgments you've ever made write all those
down it's very important also make sure that you include
the positive judgments - not just the negative ones so
if you judge somebody a dick you put that one
on there and if you judge someone a princess you
put that one on there and then after you're done
with both these lists then what you can do is
going to put a star or a checkmark next to
those judgments on the list that you feel have a
strong potential to backfire on you or to create neurotic
patterns in your life how do you know which ones
to select well they'll kind of just jump out at
you for example when I came up with the judgment
he's an inconsiderate dick it's like oh yeah I know
that I always behave in a way where I try
to minimize my own inconsiderateness and if I ever think
of myself as inconsiderate and I really feel bad and
shameful oh that's an important one all right so that's
how you can find out now what I want to
do is I want to actually demonstrate for you how
this exercise works because it's a little shocking when you
hear it and you see a done in person so
what I'm going to do is I've got my timer
here and I have it set for five minutes I'm
going to set this timer and I'm going to give
you the first list which is all the judgments that
I've ever made about other people and you're going to
hear me go into a stream of consciousness and I'm
just going to not filter myself at all and just
talk for five minutes straight and say whatever comes up
to my mind for these judgments alright let's begin I
got five minutes on the clock go alright so every
judgment that I've ever made about other people [ __
] prick inconsiderate ungrateful thief cheat ugly smelly disgusting foolish
beautiful attractive hot sexy handsome cute adorable fat pig [
__ ] hippie hipster douche bag scumbag bastard [ __
] deceitful criminal neglectful cold violent uncaring ignorant stupid low
consciousness neurotic dysfunctional crazy insane weird odd not normal normal

greedy corrupt shameful evil bad human being disgusting human being
I would never [ __ ] that humorous charming confident
insecure needy codependent nerd geek dweeb pale pasty scrawny masculine
feminine girly manly hairy okay so that was my first
list now I'm going to do the second list which
is all the judgments that I've ever made about myself
again completely unfiltered whatever comes to mind five minutes on
the clock go right every judgment I've ever made about
myself mmm arrogant egotistical humble reserved introverted extroverted tall skinny
lanky effeminate masculine assertive lacking assertiveness indecisive smart intelligent wise
wise beyond my years creative artistic brilliant inadequate less than
others shy lacking confidence lacking assertiveness people pleaser pushover ball

wannabe humorous bad sense of humor awkward weird above-average superior
better than other people right good bad just workaholic non-drinker
smug condescending intellectual nerdy different exceptional hard-working neurotic hypocritical complex
deep racist womanizer alright that was my second list so
hopefully that opened your eyes to the possibilities here I
want you to create the same exact kind of list
except your list is not going to be limited to
five minutes but it's going to be much longer get
everything out of your system all right get it all
out of your system no filters this is not the
time to be nice or polite or politically correct so
that's your exercise that's your assignment now to just recap
this topic we started off asking the question how do
you stop judging yourself well one way that you stop
judging yourself is basically this is the answer in a
nutshell is that you stop judging other people you cannot
stop judging yourself if you continue to judge other people
hopefully you can now see the dynamic where this is
a double-edged sword it cuts both ways it cuts forward
and it cuts backwards so be very careful and you
might wonder well how do I stop judging other people
leo and here's my answer to that first of all
be mindful of how you judge other people judgments are
usually much more subtle than we think it's usually not
as black and white as oh she's fat or oh
he's an [ __ ] I mean those are very
obvious also be very mindful of the jokes you make
with your friends with your circle of friends how you
like to make jokes about others at the expense of
others and in that case you're judging them be very
careful about that just be more mindful of how often
you do judge people you do it a lot more
often than you think and this takes a period of
increased aware and start to see this also be more
mindful of how you're done your judgments are damaging you
so you can see how they're damaging other people but
then see the second side of the blade pointing back
at you right when you slice with it so this
is what we mean by double edged sword so notice
for example that when you judge fat people that makes
you insecure about your own weight notice that when you
judge rich people that creates a problem for you with
money notice that when you judge money people that creates
a problem for you in the bedroom with sexuality notice
these things right notice the actual limits kind of the
cage that you construct around yourself notice that again that
takes a period of mindfulness takes a while to see
that and you know to jumpstart you and to help
you to do that right now do the exercise create
both of these lists sit down really think about it
after you do the exercise which you'll notice for the
next week or so you'll be walking around town with
your friends and all this kind of stuff you're going
to be more mindful automatically to the different judgments you
make and then you can go deeper with it and
you can take a look at those judgments that you
put a star next to the ones that already you
know are backfiring on you and you can work on
those even deeper and I don't really have time to
go into that I'll probably cover that in some other
episode but that's it for now so practice the mindfulness
see what's really going on how you're using these judgments
against yourself and do this exercise alright that's it I'm
