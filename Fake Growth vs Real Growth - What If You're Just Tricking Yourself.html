hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about fake growth versus
real growth it's very easy to deceive yourself when you're
doing personal development into thinking that you're actually growing when
really you're not fixing the root issues that are causing
the deepest problems in your life you tell yourself in
a sense that you're growing but actually you're not and
in general what I find is that when we enter
personal development those first few years that we're doing it
we're just kind of trying to orient ourselves we're not
really sure how this whole field works yet how it's
going to fit into my life how it's really going
to affect my life and what you have is you
have these car cut cartoon caricatures of what growth will
look like so let's say you come into personal value
have a problem like you feel shy and secure or
you're not able to attract women or you're not able
to find that dream relationship that you want or that
marriage as you want or you have trouble losing weight
or you're struggling with business and with your finances whatever
the issue is you tend to think that okay so
I need a solution right so people come into this
stuff because they want a solution to a burning problem
in their life so they come in there and it's
okay what's the solution going to look like and in
their mind they're just kind of imagining almost in a
childlike way how this issue is going to be resolved
for them and so it's funny because some of these
childlike cartoon caricatures are just so unrealistic that it points
us in the wrong direction as to where to look
for solutions what are some examples well let's say you
had a shy guy right someone who's not cool with
women and he's not very confident with man so he
comes in d2o haven't I become real confident my solution
to this problem is I'm gonna be the super alpha
confident guy and then he goes looking for that he
thinks that's really going to be how the issue is
resolved is be cut by becoming the super Alpha confident
guy and of course that's not really how it's going
to get resolved or maybe a woman comes into this
thing and you know she's looking for Prince Charming she
thinks that well right now I'm needy that's my problem
is I'm needy and I really feel lonely I feel
like my life is empty if I could just find
Prince Charming that's it that's gonna be my solution right
that's going to give me happiness and of course that's
not how it's going to work that's not how that
issues really resolved or let's say a man comes into
the situation into personal development and he's coming from a
place where he's really struggling in business he's got a
lot of competitors his business is struggling so his dream
solution is that oh you know I'm gonna I'm gonna
really good in business I'm gonna stomp all my competitors
into the ground that's kind of his fantasy solution but
of course that's not how any of these really deep
issues get resolved they don't get resolved by the surface
level stuff they don't get resolved by external solutions in
reality what happens when you experience real growth is that
the issue simply becomes a non-issue so if you're shy
crippling crippling lis shy then the solution to that is
not to become alpha confident it's just to stop caring
about shyness like it just becomes a complete non-issue to
you there's an emotional release that happens C and if
you're needy and you want a marriage or a relationship
the solution that has not to get your marriage or
your relationship but it's actually to let go of the
need for a marriage or relationship very counterintuitive it just
becomes a non-issue like you stopped caring about it you
stopped needing it there's an emotional release and if you're
really hung up on trouncing all your competitors the solution
that has is not to come out number one it's
not to prevail over the marketplace that's not the solution
the solution is to stop caring about competition at all
to stop even thinking about competitors to remove that entire
way of looking at the world from your mind to
erase it so to speak so that is just a
complete non-issue you just don't even think about it anymore
again there's been that emotional release there's a change in
perspective that's what real growth looks like relative to fake
growth and I want to fill in the blanks here
and some of the gaps by giving you lots of
examples of what I mean by real and fake growth
as we go on but how do you tell the
difference how do you really know that you've experienced real
growth in some area of your life here's how you
get a permanent release of the issue you don't over
compensate for the issue you stop obsessing about the issue
it completely leaves your mind and it almost seems like
oh my god I can't believe like this has ever
been an issue for me it's so unimportant so tribulus
is so insignificant that's what it'll look like when you
really get an emotional release also what will happen is
that you won't need defensiveness anymore what a lot of
people do is they think that to resolve their issue
they need to build like this fortress like they have
a castle that's under attack they need to build a
moat around it and a giant fence with electrical barbed
wire ring and you know make it all secure but
that actually tells you that you're not resolving the issue
you can put all the security systems in there and
you can build a you know a giant moat around
your castle but that is just you being defensive and
neurotic really what needs to happen you need to let
go of the need dismantle all your defenses and this
is very counterintuitive and scary to the ego because the
ego only understands defensiveness and protectiveness that's kind of its
modus operandi and another hallmark of true growth is there's
no longer a need to exert willpower over the situation
there's no longer a need to whip yourself into a
frenzy to do the things you need to do to
do the things that are healthy for you you don't
need to whip yourself into a frenzy to be loving
towards people you don't need to whip yourself into a
frenzy to go work on your business you don't need
to whip yourself into a frenzy in order to get
the kind of sex you want or the kind of
relationships you want or the kind of health you want
all these are neurotic solutions when you're whipping yourself and
you think oh yeah I got a really you know
put the screws in and really work really hard this
kind of stuff when you notice there's a lot of
tension in your body and internal friction that tells you
that you're not really experiencing true growth here's a litmus
test for true growth you look at your emotional responses
to challenging situations in that specific area of your life
that you're trying to develop it and you ask yourself
have my emotional response is improved am i less reactive
do people no longer push my buttons do I have
less emotional need in this area of my life am
i calmer in this area of my life do I
not think obsessively about this area of my life anymore
if so then real growth has occurred and if not
that it hasn't and this is where fake growth comes
in to see fake growth masquerades as real growth and
what fake growth is is basically success or a Qi
and our society right now is very focused on success
and achievement it's focused on finding an external fix for
whatever problem we have either a technological fix or a
money fix or a relationship fix or whatever but it
always looks like an external circumstance or situation so basically
the way it works is you come in and you're
dissatisfied with your life because you think that some external
situation in your life is not properly set up maybe
you don't live in the right place you don't live
in the right house you don't have the right car
you don't have the right a number of digits in
your bank account you don't have the right girlfriend you
don't have the right boyfriend you don't have the right
children you don't have the right courier or whatever and
you tell yourself well of course that's where the problem
lies right it lies in those things if I can
just fix those circumstances and I get myself the right
career the right girlfriend the right boyfriend the right number
of digits in my bank account then that's going to
be real growth but all of that is just success
and achievement see those are all external fixes and they
actually in a very clever way take the attention off
the real issue the real issue is inside of you
that's where the real work has to happen inside fake
growth is stuff on the outside real growth is stuff
changing on the inside let me give you some examples
some really classic examples which will get you a good
idea of what I'm talking about here this distinction between
fake and real growth so let's say we have a
needy woman who feels lonely and then what she does
is she finds her dream relationship and she marries this
guy and it seems like it's going great now was
that real growth or is that fake growth just because
you find a guy that is like a mask over
the deeper issue that wasn't really resolved in situation see
finding a great guy does not solve the core issue
of neediness for this woman it doesn't solve her loneliness
fear that fear is still in her it's just not
acute anymore because there's this nice external circumstance which is
kind of supporting you it's like a support structure but
as soon as that support structure is taken away you're
back to square one see nothing really here was solved
this was just a success and achievement your marriage is
an achievement that's what it was in this case how
about the case of a jealous man let's say a
man has this problem with being jealous about the girlfriend
that he dates he's always jealous because they're talking to
other guys they're very friendly with other guys and you
know this this really makes him feeling insecure so what
does he do eventually he finds himself an introverted woman
and he makes her his girlfriend this woman is different
from the other women and that she's introverted in that
she doesn't have a lot of friends you just have
a lot of guy friends and so now it seems
like oh this man has solved this problem because this
woman doesn't talk to guys anymore so there's no more
reason to be jealous this seems like the perfect fits
except really we know it's not the perfect fix nothing
has really changed about the man's problems the guy is
still fundamentally jealous he just put a kind of like
a mask over that problem by finding this woman who
doesn't really put him into a challenging emotional situation as
soon as she goes and meets a guy friend and
starts chatting with him like some you know some old
guy friends from college this guy's going to get super
jealous again so nothing was really fixed no real growth
has happened here it was just an achievement let's take
the example of a man who worries about money all
the time he's insecure about money and this has been
haunting him for years as he's working on his business
let's say but then all of a sudden he's working
on his business for a few years and the business
starts doing great he's starting to lead in his marketplace
the economy's doing well everything's going well no more money
problems he has more money than he could ever imagine
did that fix the root issue that he had with
money no of course not not at all it's just
masked it it's made the fears about money irrelevant of
course they're irrelevant because he's got lots of money but
as soon as the economy starts going down a little
bit or as soon as some of his clients stop
paying him all those fears are gonna come back in
full force because they weren't really addressed and he might
feel for a while maybe for a few years he's
gonna feel like he's on top of life and everything's
going great he's really happy and satisfied with life because
the money's coming in and he doesn't have to worry
about it right but in the back of his mind
he's going to be afraid that whole time as well
afraid because he knows that the money could dry up
at any time and then he'll be back in his
old neurotic patterns and so what happens that even when
he's doing well he can't really be fulfilled and satisfied
because that fear is still there it hasn't really been
addressed and you can't fix the fear of losing money
and the fear of going broke you can't fix that
by just pouring money on the problem just because you
have a hundred million dollars in your bank account does
not mere mean that your mind will say oh we
don't need to worry about losing money anymore the mind
doesn't work that way that stuff is wired into your
mind it needs to be unwired that's where the inner
growth comes in okay let's take the example for example
of an angry person who has trouble collaborating at work
he just can't collaborate with people he can't work cooperatively
so what does he do he goes and he creates
a stay-at-home job for himself so he's not working in
the office anymore he's kind of isolated himself and now
he isn't feeling any anger anymore or frustration because he's
just working by himself kind of like a lone wolf
now and now he feels calm he feels happy and
he thinks that this has solved his problem but did
it really he's isolated himself he's no longer around people
so of course he has no reason to be angry
anymore but that didn't really fix his issue something inside
of him was making him angry when he was working
with collaborating with others that's the thing that needed to
be fixed and that's not fixed by simply sticking your
head in the sand and working from home so no
real growth happened here this was fake growth it was
an achievement and in fact you could imagine this guy's
real proud he'll tell his friends and he'll tell other
people he meets he'll tell his family that a you
know I work from home that's an accomplishment that I
made I know I'm grown in my life by making
this accomplishment and other people will look at him and
say oh yeah it's real cool that you work from
home you know I wish I could work from home
that sounds like a really sweet gig how can I
do that tell me more I'm real jealous of you
now or I'm real happy for you and to the
guys he's like oh yeah look all these people they
admire the fact that I work from home and so
he tricks himself into thinking that all I've really grown
but actually he hasn't grown and in the future if
he ever needs to collaborate with somebody and of course
he will then that anger is gonna come right back
up and he's always gonna be afraid he's gonna be
afraid to collaborate with people that's gonna limit him in
his business and it's gonna limit him in his work
for the rest of his life unless he faces that
core inner issue with some real growth or how about
you take an uncool guy a shy guy who learns
how to pick up girls let's say this guy was
really bad with with women and with dating in high
school and in college very typical scenario and now you
know he he goes and starts doing pickup and he
learns how to date and he gets really good he
gets real funny and he does sense of humor and
and confidence and all this kind of stuff and now
he feels very alpha because he can go and he
can pick up a girl and have sex with her
on the surface that seems like hey look I solve
my problem look it's cool look how cool I am
but see deep down that guy still feels uncool because
just from picking up a girl having sex with her
does not change the fact that in your mind you
fundamentally believe that you're an uncool guy that you're a
socially awkward guy that somehow you're you're broken or you're
deficient in some way that's the real thing that needs
to be fixed and this success with women this is
just successes fake growth let's take the example of a
rich guy who uses money to attract a wife he
can't attract a woman through charisma and personality naturally so
he just says well I mean I'm gonna I'm gonna
kill it in business and then I'm just gonna you
know flaunt my money and then women will flock to
me and I'll pick one of them and she'll become
my wife problem solved right problem solve of course though
that's we know how this turns out this is fake
growth yes you can attract a wife that way but
then the kind of relationship you'll have with her is
going to be a very dysfunctional and in the end
the core issue hasn't been addressed and that wife she'll
cheat on him or she'll leave this guy eventually after
a few years because the thing you need to attract
a woman's need to have some personality or some charisma
that that woman loves that keeps her attracted money does
not keep a woman to attract it forever so that's
the thing the guy is avoiding fixing by focusing externally
on the money and on the marriage and then of
course you know he'll tell his friends hey look I
found this beautiful wife and she loves me and we're
getting married we're going to throw this big party come
and celebrate with us and of course everybody's celebrating they're
saying hey look they're a great couple they're so perfect
for each other they seem to love each other they
get along so well look at them and so they
reinforce this self-deception in his own mind that what he
did is that he solved the problem when in fact
he didn't solve the problem he ran away from the
problem or take a depressed person who's been depressed for
months or maybe for years and then all of a
sudden they find a new hobby or they get involved
a new career or some you know some big activity
in life comes their way and now they're just busy
with that new hobby or that new career and they
they like oh thank god finally I got out of
my depression I resolve my depression but of course they
didn't resolve their depression they just found themselves a distraction
their mind was sitting there depressed and now all the
sudden is just busy thinking about other stuff and now
of course that masked the depression this person didn't really
deal with their depression they didn't go inside and really
look why my depressed what's got me depressed what's going
on in my mind they didn't do that process of
inner work and so of course we know what will
happen what will happen is that eventually this new hobby
or this new career it'll run its course this person
will get tired of it and then they're going to
fall back into depression even harder because they thought they
cured it and now they realize that they were just
tricking themselves this whole time scene and of course when
you have a great new hobby or a great new
career what do you do you tell your friends and
your family and look at my new career I'm so
busy and I'm so happy doing this stuff and all
of them they applaud you and say oh yeah you
do have a great that's so wonderful for you we're
so happy for you maybe we're even jealous of you
and this reinforces in your mind this idea that all
I'm doing good I'm really growing I've really grown myself
this year by getting this new career and so this
lie is reinforced in you how about we take a
a woman who fights with her mom she can't get
along with her mom so what does she do she
stops calling her she moves far away to other city
another state and they don't really talk much and she
feels like okay finally you know finally these arguments with
mom have resolved themselves finally have some peace of mind
I don't need to think about that stuff anymore we
don't yell at each other anymore but of course what
happened she just ran away from the problem in the
future it'll probably come back and bite her in the
ass or take a person who's overweight who tells himself
that he needs to get fit and so what he
does is he uses this this technique of guilting himself
into not eating junk food so he tells himself I'm
not gonna eat donuts anymore at the office and he
guilts himself every single time that he eats a doughnut
or a piece of pizza or something like this and
and he thinks that by guilting himself for eating junk
food that this is a real solution to his problem
he feels like if he just guilt himself enough that
he'll stop eating the bad food and maybe he even
does he gives himself so much that he stops eating
the donuts and he stops eating the pizza and he
even dropped some weight but that's fake growth because he
didn't really deal with the core issue the core issue
is why does he want those donuts in the first
place why is he addicted to them and the pizza
and all this other junk stuff why does he need
to guilt himself to stop from putting poison into his
body that shouldn't require guilt if you've really resolved that
problem internally but of course he just cares about the
external he just wants to drop five or ten pounds
to look good during the summer or whatever and okay
that's fine and then and people even complement him and
say hey you look thinner you dropped twenty pounds oh
my god you look so good I can see more
muscles on you and all this kind of stuff and
of course he's very happy about it because he thinks
like yeah I succeeded you know my new year's resolution
was to drop 20 pounds and unlike most people I
actually succeeded at this so I'm a success I've really
grown but in truth this is fake growth it's not
real growth and of course those twenty pounds are going
to come back they'll be back in a few months
or in a few years they're all going to be
back plus more and this person's going to be more
frustrated than ever because he thought that he solved the
problem when in fact he didn't so as you can
see there's a lot of examples of this kind of
stuff I can keep going and going and going with
this hopefully you start to get an idea I want
you to now put your mind on your life take
a look where in your life are you masking the
deep inner work that you need to do with fake
growth and success and achievement are you confusing success and
achievement with growth these are two very different things growth
happens in here success happens out there and let me
tell you real growth is much harder than success much
harder which is of course why most people fall into
this trap and they go for the faith growth because
it's easier they know how to work in the external
world they don't really know how to work on the
internal world how do you change the internal world how
do you sculpt it to be what you want it's
good question real growth is not about getting what you
want externally but about releasing your need for it internally
and this is really difficult to explain to people who
are just getting into personal development because when you get
into personal development you really honestly believe that if you
just fix the externals that's gonna solve all your problems
in life and when people tell you no it won't
more advanced people tell you no it won't that's been
tried and it won't work we know that doesn't work
because of how human psychology is it will not possibly
work this is like a law of human psychology but
you're so unfamiliar yet with human psychology that you can't
really believe it you're gonna have to have a period
of going out there and chasing this fake external success
and failing over and over and over again to get
satisfaction to finally realize like wait a minute it's it
just doesn't it's not working why is it not working
and then at one point you'll go back and you'll
start to actually reevaluate the core assumption that you have
which is that changing external circumstances is really growing you
it's hard to believe that when you first start really
hard because it sounds like hey Leo what you're telling
me is you're telling me some positive thinking [ __
] you just want me just to like sit on
my ass and not do anything right that's what you're
saying and then I just I just need to feel
happy I need to feel good about myself and not
do anything and then I'm gonna I'm gonna manifest millions
of dollars and all my relationship problems will get solved
and I'm gonna attract the right girl and I'm gonna
attract the right guy and all this stuff will happen
sounds like that's what I'm saying that's not what I'm
saying I'm not saying you sit on your ass and
do nothing I'm saying you do the real work the
inner work that you don't really know how to do
you commit finding a way to do it and you
don't get distracted by the shiny objects all around you
on the outside that's what I'm saying so there is
real work to do but you got to make sure
you're doing it in the right place one day you're
going to have the following epiphany after years of thinking
you've been growing in some area of your life like
in your dating life or in your business life or
in your fitness life in that part of your life
you've been thinking you've really been growing for the last
five years and then it'll just hate you out of
the blue like oh [ __ ] I've really just
been rearranging my external circumstances haven't I there hasn't been
any real growth here it's just been rearranging externals freaking
say thats all I was doing this whole time [
__ ] son of a [ __ ] I can't
believe I tricked myself like that you're gonna eventually come
to this point where you admit that you haven't really
changed the you you haven't changed anything inside and you're
gonna come to this point where you admit to yourself
that man maybe I don't even want to change the
me it's rare that people actually want to change the
you a commitment to changing the self is rare because
it's scary because it requires deep inner work that's difficult
to do it's abstract in its nature it's not as
concrete as the external work and you're breaking loyalty with
yourself and that's a very counterintuitive move is to actually
decide to break loyalty with yourself as a means of
getting higher in your development but if you think about
it this is what's necessary I mean if we're talking
about real change substantive change that makes a real difference
in your life how can you get that without changing
yourself do you think that's really possible you're going to
get significant change without changing yourself at some point you
have to buy into this idea that man I have
to give up myself in this process I came in
with this cartoon idea that I'm just gonna you know
tweak myself a little bit and something's really going to
change in my life and I'm gonna get real successful
and real happy but then you realize and know what
needs to happen is I need to just completely obliterate
myself completely transform myself to the point where there's almost
nothing left of my old self it's like you can't
even recognize yourself anymore imagine that imagine 10 years from
now you wake up and you look in the mirror
and you can't even imagine what it was like to
be you as you are right now that's what's actually
necessary to get the kind of satisfaction and true success
issue presently want out of your life you think you
can get this by not changing yourself but you're going
to realize that that won't work and one or the
other you're gonna have to give up you have to
give up on the idea that you're gonna be satisfied
and successful in life in the really deep and fulfilling
way or you have to give up on this idea
that you can preserve yourself because you can't have both
you can't have both because the way you presently are
is reinforcing all the stuff that you don't like about
yourself see so you can't stay loyal to that and
at the same time remove all the crap in your
life the two are one all the crap in your
life comes from the way that you are not from
your external surroundings and it's going to be very tempting
for you on this journey to take shortcuts to [
__ ] yourself into thinking that you've grown going for
the easy stuff the stuff you can buy the stuff
you can feel the stuff you can see in the
external world the stuff people can praise you for because
when you do internal work no one praises you for
this no one really sees it in fact when you
really do inner work what happens that people actually start
to criticize you for it they start calling you a
hypocrite they start calling you like all you've changed why
are you such a different person now I can't relate
to you anymore come back and be the old you
so the the real inner growth you know that's like
you doing it all on your own no one's going
to do it for you you can't buy a magic
pill for it no one's gonna praise you for it
in fact they're probably gonna put you down for it
but that's the cost of true growth I hope you
have a higher vision in your mind of why this
might be worthwhile doing what would it take for you
to give up yourself what kind of vision would you
need to have of your future that you would say
okay fine I'm willing to give up myself entirely I
don't care I'll change everything about myself until I'm not
even recognizing myself anymore in the mirror but that's a
worthwhile trade because what I really care about is this
thing here this vision that I've got what is that
for you could be tied to your life purpose could
be tie - how you want to help people in
the world something like that so keep all this in
mind as you're growing and keep an eye out for
what kind of material you're learning and studying and purchasing
because there's a lot of people out there selling you
fake growth and I'm not saying that they're evil people
and that they're trying to manipulate and steal from you
I'm just saying that those people themselves are caught in
this trap of fake growth so you know people get
caught in this trap to such an extent they're so
unconscious about it then they create products and books and
seminars and stuff to sell you fake growth and of
course it's much easier to sell fake growth than real
growth because real growth happens on the inside it's kind
of painful it's not very glamorous whereas fake growth is
very glamorous it's flashy it's shiny you can buy a
new car with it you can buy a new house
with it you can get a trophy girlfriend with it
this kind of stuff so that's much easier to sell
into market to you so watch out keep an eye
on that when you're listening to somebody giving you advice
or you buy a self-help book or product or something

root causes and solutions or are they teaching you fake
