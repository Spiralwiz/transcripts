[Music] how do we discover what's true that's what I
want to spend this episode looking into and unlike previous
episodes where I just gave you the truth told you
the truth or just delivered a bunch of statements to
you about how reality is in this episode we want
to do an exploration an investigation we're less interested in
the final answers and we're more interested in the process
the actual reasoning so this episode we're doing something a
little bit different I'm just shooting this totally off-the-cuff and
I want to guide you through a bit of how
I do existential inquiry or investigation I'm not talking about
self inquiry and if you just want to know what
the truth is go watch my episode what is truth
or I explained all that in detail here this is
actually more valuable I want to take you through the
thought process the logic that goes into questioning reality and
life and really this is the heart of the work
that I do this is the kind of work that
I've been doing since I was 16 years old like
deep philosophical investigation not by reading books or by grabbing
information from other sources but deriving it simply through your
own inquiry through your own contemplative process thinking for yourself
I think this will be valuable for many of you
because most people don't know that this can be done
and they don't know how to do it because there's
no examples of this that are taught to you in
school or in university like this is rare stuff so
what we're interested in here is truth what is truth
how do we find out the truth about reality about
life the ultimate truth that's what we're interested in why
would we be interested in truth well and like you
might even start the investigation like what is truth what
does that even mean to go looking for truth and
why would anybody want to do it now I'm gonna
be talking a lot here almost as I'm talking to
myself and that's exactly how it should look you're gonna
be talking to yourself throughout this process so kind of
try to do this vicariously through watching me talking to
myself and talking to you we're gonna be kind of
combining those two together but this is kind of like
how it should go in your own mind so here
I'm going to be posing a lot of questions to
myself and also to you and then sometimes answering them
or sometimes not or sometimes you know waffling on them
so there's a difference between me delivering just nuggets of
truth to you as a lecturer versus me actually going
through the process myself as I sit down and do
it for myself these are very different things because when
I deliver nuggets of truth to you as like a
student teacher to student sort of situation then that means
I already went through the process myself years ago and
now I'm just regurgitating my conclusions to you but when
I'm going through it myself this is a dirty process
that that means that sometimes I come up with wrong
answers I say silly things so forth I make mistakes
I come up with various kinds of examples maybe they
make sense maybe they don't right it's a rough it's
a much rougher process through this process though is how
you ultimately get to the those golden nuggets of insight
then I often share with you guys so I'm trying
to put myself back in that state that I was
in when I was like 16 years old and I
was really interested in truth probably the most that I
ever was in my life and I guess what really
began my inquiry is that I had an intuitive sense
that there must be a truth there is some way
supposedly that reality is right there there must be some
ultimate way that reality is and if the conclusion is
that there isn't such a way then that would be
how reality is you see so you can't sort of
escape there being a truth there has to be a
truth at least that's sort of how we start this
inquiry there has to be some way that reality is
but we're not sure which way exactly reality is like
what is reality is reality just a mechanical process is
it just the Big Bang was there something before the
Big Bang will there be something after the Big Bang
is there a point to reality why does it exist
where did it come from where is it going how
is it is there an objective reality or as reality
subjective what role does the mind play in reality is
reality independent of the mind or is it wholly dependent
on the pop up on the mind so these sorts
of questions you know ultimately I just wanted to understand
what reality is and why it is and for that
we need truth of course because because look if you're
gonna be searching or trying to understand reality and what
you have is not the truth but falsehood then is
that gonna satisfy you are you gonna be satisfied by
having a false model of the world of course not
you want an accurate model of the world you want
to know reality the way it really is not your
fantasy about it and of course if we've studied even
a little bit of history we know that people have
had all sorts of crazy models of the world all
sorts of crazy views of how reality is only later
a hundred years later or a thousand years later for
that to be revealed to be total nonsense and fantasy
so we don't want to end up like those people
for example maybe the ancient Greeks or Romans or the
early Christians had this view that the that the earth
was the center of the universe and that stars and
planets they rotated around the earth in perfect circular orbits
and these there was like seven or eight of these
specific circles each circle was larger like one nested inside
the other so there's this sort of Ptolemaic model of
the universe and thousands perhaps millions of people believed in
this model and thought that that's exactly how reality is
and then of course all of that was shattered and
it was shattered not just once it was shattered over
and over and over and over again by various kinds
of scientific discoveries first the earth was dethroned from the
center of the universe then we discovered that the earth
actually moves as well not only is it not in
the center but it also moves around orbits around then
we discovered that even the our Sun is not the
center of the universe the way we might have assumed
and that is just one out of billions of other
Suns and then now there's there's new discoveries that the
universe is expanding and then there's stuff like dark energy
and dark matter that we don't even know really what
it is we've only really come to grips and understand
about 5% of of all the the mass of the
universe the other 95% scientists don't even know what it
is and then what if there are universes beyond our
universe you know so it just kind of like every
every century there's new stuff that gets discovered that dethrones
old models of of the world and sometimes reveals them
to be totally wrong but then we can have even
more outlandish questions like well what if we're living in
a simulation what if we're living in some kind of
matrix or what if mankind was created by aliens or
what if religion is true what if Christianity is true
what if Islam is true what if Buddhism is true
how do we know after all there are so many
different views of what reality is and what we should
do about it of course what you think reality is
informs how you act what motivates you and what you
think is right and wrong and what we should do
so there's all these different philosophical systems religious systems scientific
systems which one do you choose how do you know
which one is true different teachers teach different things it's
not like you can just say well science is true
obviously so let's just believe science but how do you
know science is true unless you've done a deep investigation
into the foundations of what science is and how science
works and then furthermore we have to wonder like well
even if we say okay Sciences is the truest of
all of these which of course is still highly suspect
because we haven't really done any investigation yet we have
to determine whether that's true or not see we don't
know from the outset when we do our inquiry we
have to be very careful not to assume anything here
that's the problem that people make is that they just
take for granted that well science is obviously correct or
Christianity is obviously true or whatever we can't take that
for granted if we really care about finding out how
the universe is we need to be willing to investigate
how it actually is you see and that means that
if the way that it really is contradicts the way
that I want it to be or how I think
it is I need to be willing to admit that
I've been that I've been wrong that I have wrong
assumptions or that the way that I want it to
be is not how it really is and that can
be a painful admission for me to make you see
so already what we're trying what we're discovering here in
this inquiry process is that we have to be very
careful about being objective and unbiased and we have we
see that it's very easy to fall into the trap
of believing or holding the universe to be a particular
way because we want it to be that way and
because that suits us but of course we're not really
interested in what suits us were interested in the way
it actually is if we're serious about truth see so
like I was saying though even if we accept science
as the ultimate method of arriving at truth which science
which scientists are you gonna believe and in what period
of time science is not just a simple monolithic thing
like oh yeah science no I mean science is comprised
of thousands tens of thousands of different individuals that hold
different views and different models of reality many of them
conflict and disagree many of these scientific theories are disproven
in fact probably the majority of scientific theories are disproven
or flaws are found within them and of course science
advances and changes so science is different every century every
millennia so who are you gonna believe it's not so
simple you see and that's assuming that science actually will
lead us to truth what if science doesn't lead to
truth we have to be also open to that possibility
to see so already we're starting to see here just
by beginning this little bit of common sense reasoning and
that's all that this inquiry really is we're just using
common sense here but we're we're being very objective about
it we're not playing favorites we're not trying to defend
any existing worldview you see this is so important because
if I come up here and I say well ok
I'm gonna do this inquiry but of course it has
to come out that Christianity is true it has to
come out that the Bible is correct and it's not
contradicted to see already that's a that's a gross conflict
of interest that distorts our inquiry to do this inquiry
properly we have to be totally neutral and agnostic and
indifferent really about the result whatever it turns out to
be maybe the truth will turn out to be a
beautiful amazing thing maybe it'll turn out to be exactly
the way the Christians talk about it maybe it won't
maybe the truth will turn out to be a hellish
terrible thing maybe I won't like the truth maybe the
truth will endanger my survival maybe the truth will endanger
my career and my children maybe the truth will reveal
that everything I've been taught in school in church in
university in the media is all which brings us to
the next important point in doing this inquiry we are
admitting to ourselves and really denying ourselves reliance on external
Authority for truth that is the whole point of this
inquiry and I want to explain a little bit of
the the logic behind this because look we're gonna start
from scratch we're gonna start to investigate reality from scratch
without assuming anything if we do that that means we
can't accept any external authority figures word or hearsay for
what the truth is so maybe there's some charismatic guru
who speaks to us in some video on YouTube and
tells us what the truth is but our problem is
how do we know that what he's saying is true
how do we know we can trust that guru how
do we know he's not deceived deluded dogmatic leading a
cult or whatever again because there's millions of gurus and
experts out there in the world professors academics scholars scientists
researchers mystics gurus cult leaders businesspeople artists philosophers and they've
existed since this dawn of civilization for ten thousand years
so which of them are we gonna believe they all
say very contradictory things at times see so if we
really care about the truth we have to acknowledge that
we can't just blindly go accept somebody's word for it
see we have to take full responsibility here we have
to be our own authority we have to somehow in
this process use common sense and reason or maybe some
other faculty maybe intuition maybe experience maybe consciousness whatever may
be a laboratory testing you know there are mint methods
we could potentially use to get to the truth and
right now where we start is we start from Ground
Zero which means that we don't know which methods are
valid or not valid maybe we'll discover that voodoo is
a valid method of arriving towards the truth see so
we can't be prejudiced when we begin this process we
can't be begging questions we can't be reasoning in circles
we can't be assuming the thing we're trying to discover
it might seem for example to you the way you
were raised maybe you were raised in a relatively atheistic
scientific rationalist household where your parents were rather scientific and
maybe the way you were raised you were raised with
the sort of idea that ooh voodoo voodoo and witchcraft
these are obviously nonsense you can't use voodoo and witchcraft
to arrive at the truth everybody knows that see but
you got to be careful if we're really beginning this
investigation from scratch from Ground Zero we have to be
so careful not to just dismiss something like voodoo or
witchcraft because again look there's a lot of very subtle
question banking that goes on here there's a lot of
subtle assumptions and things that are taken for granted for
example with witchcraft it might seem like oh well Lia
obviously everybody knows that you can't use witchcraft to get
to the truth everybody knows science is better but how
do you really know that have you done witchcraft to
test it you see your culture tells you that witchcraft
is some sort of hocus-pocus nonsense but remember we said
we can't just blindly trust our culture we can't trust
some authority figure so if some Harvard professor tells me
that witchcraft is [ __ ] okay I can I
mean I can listen to him I can take his
opinion into account but ultimately I have to decide for
myself whether that's true because when I'm beginning my investigation
from zero I don't know who to trust because you
know if I ask a witch whether witchcraft is worthwhile
and can maybe give me some deep in that into
reality the witch might tell me yes let me teach
you some witchcraft come learn with me now if I
ask a college you know Harvard professor about that he'll
say oh no witchcraft is all nonsense come to Harvard
learn with me so how do I know who's right
but you see this is very challenging to distinguish because
it requires direct experience of witchcraft and direct experience of
the Harvard way of discovering truth and whatever that might
lead to and then comparing those two carefully and then
seeing which one actually weighs out but see most people
they don't they're not able to take this neutral investigative
stance rather what they do is they just make a
knee-jerk assessment like oh well witchcraft is nonsense I'm gonna
go to Harvard or the opposite or whatever or maybe
you just think oh well I'm just gonna read the
Bible but you see why are you placing trust in
the Bible why are you placing trust in Harvard why
are you placing trust in witchcraft if you're honest and
you think about it you realize that well it's just
because that's what I've been taught it's the thing that
I prefer the method of an investigation that I prefer
is simply that which I grew up in so if
my household was Christian I'm probably gonna gravitate towards the
Christian way if my household was atheist rationalist scientific I'm
gonna probably end up going to Harvard or some University
and trying to get truth that way or if if
I grew up with a bunch of witches in my
family then I'll probably be open to its craft you
see but here's the problem just because you were born
into a particular household at a particular time in history
in a particular country into a particular culture into a
particular religion these are all accidents these are not guarant
ores of any kind of truth what if you were
born like if you think for example that Christianity is
the right way to discover the truth well just consider
what if you were born a Muslim into a Muslim
household that means that you would just gravitate towards Islam
and then you would believe in Islam and do Islam
and convince yourself that Islam is the right way to
arrive at truth and according to your own Christian worldview
the Muslims they're deluded so in this case you would
be deluded isn't it really suspicious that you just happen
to be born just into the perfect household as a
Christian how lucky for you that you were born a
Christian into a perfect Christian household and that Christianity of
all the different philosophies is the run true one see
this should already make you extremely suspicious that you got
this fortunate because if you are really honest and you
look around and you think that well there's there's probably
at least over a thousand different religions philosophies and epistemic
systems that exist or have existed throughout human history what
are the chances that I will be born into the
right one and there certainly are a lot more deluded
ones and false ones than there are true ones so
how do I know that I was born into the
right one chances are that I wasn't not that I
was I would have to be very naive and foolish
to think that all well I just got so lucky
I was born into an atheist scientific household that happened
to believe in evolution and therefore and it had just
happened that that's all true no no no if we're
serious about truth we have to be much more rigorous
we can't we can't play favorites here we have to
take seriously the possibility that we were born into a
background of culture and teachings that might have been false
and those might have been programmed into us from a
very early age to the point where now we have
a bias and a sort of a personal preference for
that worldview even though that worldview is very false see
and so already what we're starting to notice is that
there's a very important an inescapable psychological component to the
inquiry into truth because it's not merely like some some
might think it like oh well truth is just a
wrap purely rational purely scientific endeavor we're gonna go out
there we're gonna run our tests our lab results we're
gonna get objective evidence we're gonna get the facts we're
not we're not gonna have any any kind of emotional
distortions or anything like that and we're just gonna we're
gonna grab the facts we're gonna look at them and
we're saying okay here's the fact here's what it is
and then we're just gonna report it and then we're
gonna be done know already we can see that it
doesn't work this way because who's doing the inquiry here
I am you are we are if I'm doing the
inquiry already I can see that my own personal preferences
and biases and my own emotional weaknesses are going to
be a huge distorting factor you see there might be
a resistance and emotional resistance to letting go of old
programming and teachings and we know that human beings are
easily psychologically manipulated and brainwashed and indoctrinated we know this
from examples of cults examples of religion examples of mass
hysteria and delusion that have happened in the past from
Nazism to various kinds of sects and religions that went
corrupt we know this even from science there were many
intelligent scientists who believed in crackpot theories that were crazy
we know this from medicine there were many doctors throughout
history who had all sorts of quack cures that they
thought would work but actually they actually made the the
patient's conditions much worse resulting in death and and so
forth we know that businesses can have policies and worldviews
that are shaped by their economic agendas and interests such
that they might not speak the truth to us because
it's not in their financial interest to do so for
example you have some giant oil company is that giant
oil company gonna want to do research into climate change
if there is such a thing as climate change probably
not because why would it be in their interest to
do so if some giant oil company discovered that the
climate is being seriously negatively impacted by their business are
they gonna report that are they gonna be honest about
it you see you have to become much more savvy
about how how difficult this truth investigation really is it's
not as simple as going out there and just finding
the facts we have to contend with the fact that
our own emotional system our own psychological weaknesses and preferences
and biases all make this process much harder than it
first appears so already what we're discovering here that is
if I am serious about discovering the truth I have
to be very serious about being introspective and conscious of
my own biases preferences my own psyche my own fears
my own attachments and my own worldview because it's not
like I can start this investigation from ground zero as
though I was born yesterday no no we're starting this
investigation when were 16 years old 20 years old 25
years old 30 years old maybe you're 40 maybe you're
50 years old maybe even older when you'd be in
this investigation but even if you're very young like I
was I began this when I was probably 16 you
might say oh that's so young but that's 16 years
of programming that I got before I was starting to
reason it out for myself see by that point I'd
almost finished mice my entire schooling that's 12 years of
being indoctrinated with all sorts of belief systems from society
about what's true and what's false how do I know
that those were actually true and not false so now
I have to be very careful about my own expectations
what do I expect the truth to look like what
do I want it to be what am i attached
to already cuz it's not like I'm just a blank
slate and I'm indifferent to what the outcome of this
investigation is now I have ideas I have my best
guesses I have my own theories about what the truth
is and these theories now skew the investigation because I
only have so much time I only have so much
mental energy and the world and the universe is a
vast thing and there's me let's say thousands of different
philosophies and worldviews out there I can't possibly explore them
all and even if I could I would have to
have some sort of prioritization system I have to begin
somewhere for example if I have to test ten different
philosophies between Christianity is atheism science and witchcraft and something
else if I have to test all those where do
I begin I'm probably gonna begin with the one I
think is most likely to be true right because if
I just start testing them at random and I start
testing a bunch of false ones there's probably a lot
more false ones that are true ones I could spend
the next 50 years of my life investigating false philosophies
and and get nowhere and in fact I could get
indoctrinated into some of those and fool myself that I've
made progress what actually I didn't but you see already
the problem is how do you decide which one to
start investigating first you might think that well Sciences is
clearly the best option to start with first but is
it how do you know that where did that idea
come from did it come from you did it come
from your own line of inquiry and reasoning or did
it come from culture see if you're honest here and
again this requires self awareness and self honesty two very
important qualities in this work you have to admit that
well my preference for science probably is the result of
cultural conditioning that I got because I grew up in
the sort of scientific society or a scientific culture or
a scientific household where I went to a scientific school
where they programmed me with this idea that science is
the best way and we have to be suspicious of
that we can't take that for granted because here's the
bottom line if we really want a question from scratch
and that's what we're trying to that's art like our
ideal that we're shooting for we're trying to question as
much from scratch as possible without any external influences because
why these external influences can be corrupting and we want
to find the truth for ourselves why well because supposedly
if something is true it must be true independent of
somebody else telling it to me right other why's what
what use could the truth have if the truth is
true simply because some hardware professor told it to me
that it isn't worth very much the whole point of
the truth supposedly and this is still something we need
to verify but you know to get this investigation on
the ground we do have to make some assumptions we
can't just make no assumptions because assumptions are how we
get ourself bootstrapped but you know we have to be
careful about the assumptions we make but I think it's
safe to make at least this assumption for now that
truth has to be independent from human beings from what
human beings tell us which mean that which means that
if if the truth can be written down in a
book that's well and good perhaps that's possible to write
it down in a book but also maybe it's not
possible but let's say it's possible the truth can't depend
on the book itself rather the book itself has to
depend on the truth you see which means that if
other human beings could discover the truth because of course
a book is written by a human being so supposedly
how did that human being who wrote the book which
supposedly contains the truth how did that human being find
it out there's only one of two ways either from
another human being or from the truth itself directly somehow
whatever that means if he found it out from some
other human being well we were just pushing the problem
back one level and so again we can ask well
if he learned it from his master or from his
teacher okay fine but then how did that master or
teacher get it again one of two options either from
some other master or teacher or from the truth itself
so let's say we pushed this back a hundred steps
let's say there was a chain of a hundred people
who learn from a hundred other people what the truth
is but we want to go back to the very
first person who learned it how did he learn it
the first person he didn't have books he didn't have
other teachers there had to be at least one point
in human history we were somebody discovered the truth for
him or herself and then wrote it down or then
taught it you see otherwise what are you teaching and
writing down we're just making something up you see so
that's sort of one of the interesting characteristics of truth
is that and that's one of its values is that
it's it's external to human activity and perhaps we could
here's sort of the longer vision if we could discover
the truth perhaps we could ground ourselves and the truth
rether than always navigating by human constructions because you know
books are human constructions universities are human constructions even science
is a human construction religions are human constructions if there
is truth in any of those books experts masters religions
science universities it has to be grounded in something outside
of all that prior to all that see or maybe
not we have to be open to that possibility as
well see now we got to talk a little bit
about assumptions we're going to be making assumptions to bootstrap
our inquiry process we just have to otherwise we can't
move at all but we have to be very careful
about the assumptions we make because every assumption we make
recognize we don't really know if it's true or not
it might seem reasonable it might seem plausible it might
seem likely it might seem obvious but again how do
we know what's obvious how do we know it's reasonable
how do we know what's likely again notice that we're
judging that based on the cultural background that we're in
the century were living in the country were living in
the religion that we're a part of as a culture
by the technology that we have which limits our ability
to investigate and to explore more of the universe so
we have to be very careful if we do make
an assumption we have to make a mental note or
even better write it down on a piece of paper
that we made an assumption here we're gonna keep doing
our inquiry just to get ourselves going but we have
to remember to come back at some point Andrey questioned
that assumption because the assumptions we make very early on
they can have a significant effect on how how far
we diverge into some wrong direction because every wrong assumption
we make at the very beginning you see we build
on top of that it's almost like building a skyscraper
if you get the first floor of the skyscraper totally
wrong the hundredth floor is gonna be way way wrong
you probably aren't even gonna be able to get to
a hundredth floor if you don't make sure your first
50 floors are really straight and accurate so you see
you see how challenging this this is becoming we we
began here with such an innocent question and it seems
so simple and now look at all these complexities that
are arising our mind is is being pulled in a
hundred different directions we don't know which which way to
go that's right that's why this is so challenging this
is why so few people do this inquiry but we're
we're determined and we're eager and we're passionate about the
truth so we're gonna keep going and we're not gonna
take anything for granted we're not even to take reason
or logic for granted you might say well we're just
gonna be reasonable and I'm gonna use reasoning out of
the truth but we have to wonder how do we
know that reason leads to the truth you might say
oh well of course it's it's obvious it's obvious everybody
knows that recent leads to the truth how do you
know that where did you get that idea did you
derive that idea for yourself did you prove it to
be correct and true or are you just assuming it
and you just got it from your culture and you're
taking it for granted that that's the case are you
just agreeing with that because everybody around you agrees with
it you see there's enormous peer pressure here it's not
like we're just doing this inquiry by ourselves like we're
some low individual living on top of a mountaintop without
friends or social connections or contacts we don't listen to
the news we don't watch TV we don't read the
newspapers like we're completely isolated and all alone if that's
how humans lived then this process might be a lot
easier but we live in a herd we live in
giant herds of millions of people we live in giant
cities we go to clubs and schools and churches and
we listen to media all this feeds into our mind
and programs us with ideas many of these ideas have
been proven throughout history to be wrong so it's quite
likely that many of them are still wrong also consider
the possibility that of course the media and school and
society and business might not be interested in the truth
their agenda might have nothing to do with the truth
maybe they're more interested in money or sex or survival
or promoting their ideology maybe Christianity is more interested in
the survival of Christianity than it is in truth science
- maybe science is more interested in the perpetuation of
science rather than in discovering the truth these are all
possibilities we have to take seriously because we're admitting the
most fundamental thing we're admitting when we begin this inquiries
that we don't know this is where it all begins
you have to honestly admit that you don't know what
the truth is it's not enough to fake it and
just say well yeah okay leo I don't know what
it is but it's probably science like in the back
of your mind like probably sighs probably it's gonna be
in the direction of science no if you think that
way then you haven't really admitted that you don't know
you have to really like right now I want you
to get right now to try to get this in
your direct experience that if you're truly honest you don't
really know what reality is why it's here and what
it's doing isn't that isn't that true couldn't we start
with that little nugget of truth right there that we
just we don't know we just don't know when we
begin this inquiry we don't even know if reason will
deliver us the truth because look what would it take
to know for sure that reason will deliver us the
truth we would have to actually go and do a
lot of reasoning and verify that every bit of reasoning
that we do leads to truth and never leads to
falsehood and if even one bit of reasoning is discovered
that happens to lead to falsehood already that undermines the
entire premise that lis that reason can lead to truth
you see you see how tricky this is so if
I can find one case in human history where some
human used reason to lead to a false worldview that's
it reason is no longer reliable we have to be
skeptical about reason and of course you can find a
million such cases people just assume that reasonably it's the
truth no doesn't more often than not reason leads to
delusion Fawcett it's very easy for the mind to rationalize
whatever worldview it believes in already see this is called
begging the question there are so many outlandish examples of
this that an entire book can be written just about
example after example after example of foolish reasoning now you
see aha Lee oh yeah of course of course reason
can be misused of course there have been many examples
of foolish reasoning in the past but Leo what I'm
talking about is not foolish reasoning but correct reasoning ah
but you see this brings us right back to the
very beginning how do you distinguish correct reasoning from foolish
reasoning that's the very problem that we began with because
this is the question of truth what you're really saying
when you're saying well there's foolish reasoning and then there's
correct reasoning is you're saying well there's falsehood and there's
truth right that's sort of where we began there's supposedly
falsehood in the world and there's truth in the world
how do we discover the truth so what you're really
saying is that well Leo we'll all discover the truth
through some truthful method okay but how do you know
which method is truthful you're back to square one see
how do you know that the truthful method or the
true correct reason that you're using is actually true and
correct you can't just take that for granted because there
have been numerous examples of people throughout history who have
justified their crazy worldviews under the pretense that is true
and reasonable these days many atheists tically mine is scientifically
rationally minded people tend to sort of assume that reason
leads to truth and because is you know it's a
part of science they tend to lump together science and
reason and that religion and witchcraft and all that that's
all the unreasonable stuff no no this is you justices
this is just historically incorrect if you look at human
history and what humans have believed and you don't have
to be some brilliant historian to to know this just
a bit of of high-school history will suffice religious people
have always considered themselves to be reasonable people a religious
person doesn't believe that he's unreasonable from his point of
view his worldview is very reasonable and consistent he doesn't
think himself of a fool or an idiot or some
wishy-washy hocus-pocus type of person he thinks that his Christianity
or his Islam or whatever that is the truth and
he thinks he arrived at it through a truthful reasonable
process he believes in God for example and he thinks
that is highly unreasonable to disbelieve God he will create
logical arguments for why God must exist and it's not
like idiots only idiots and fools believe in God or
in religion because many of our most intelligent humans of
all time have believed in God and subscribed to various
kinds of religions so you can't just simplistically dismiss all
of that after all what if they're right how do
you know that they're wrong did you actually go and
deeply study and personally investigate what they believed to verify
to test whether it was right or wrong or are
you just assuming because you know your culture tells you
that all Christians you know they're deluded and yours you're
just accepting that see it's very very tricky you have
to really press your own feet to the fire here
and not take anything for granted you have to really
question all of these cultural assumptions that have been given
to you based on whatever culture you grew up in
you have to be very very suspicious of all those
so that's what we're doing or maybe maybe Sciences this
is the method I don't know how do you know
have you tested it how much science have you actually
done this will freak you out especially if you're a
big fan of science and you fancy yourself a rationalist
and you don't like the dogma of religion okay the
dogma of religion seems to have resulted in a lot
of problems in the past but what about science what
about the dogma of science how much science have you
actually done be honest I don't mean how much you've
read in high school I don't mean how many scantron
tests you filled out or how many lectures you've listened
to and taken notes on that isn't really science that
is all hearsay that is supposedly other scientists passing on
their discoveries to you and not even that because you
were taught science by real scientists you were taught scientists
by non scientists you see because your high school chemistry
teacher she didn't actually do any science when she taught
you chemistry she just taught from a book that was
given to her so she wasn't a scientist most likely
see so how do you know you are literally trusting
the authority of those textbooks and those teachers who passed
it on from others and others and others and others
and others science is a highly social hierarchical bureaucratic system
really not much different than religion because if you're a
Christian and you believe in God and Christ and all
this how do you know how do you even know
there was a Christ and see right here we reach
an interesting point because if you're a Christian and you
want to do a serious inquiry into truth and you're
not willing to open your mind to the possibility that
Christ didn't even exist you've already failed already failed why
because you've completely given away your authority and responsibility for
discovering the truth to some other human you see notice
the following point the only thing you know about Christ
you learned from other humans because of course you have
no direct experience of Christ the only reason you know
about Christ is because other humans existed who told you
about it and you blindly believed them and assumed that
they were telling you correctly but there are interesting possibilities
here like that those people could have been deluded could
have been lying to you could have been mistaken just
honestly mistaken because how did your parents learn about Christ
obviously they didn't meet Christ so they learn it from
their parents and how did their parents learn it well
from their parents and now how far do we have
to go back well if to go back like a
hundred generations or so that's a lot of generations that's
a lot of hearsay a chain of 100 here says
over 2,000 years and you're gonna trust that Wow you're
very gullible you must you must really you must really
have a high faith in in in humanity to believe
that see now I'm not particularly saying here that Christ
never existed all I'm saying is that I want you
to notice in yourself if you're a Christian and you
cannot open your mind to the serious possibility that Christ
never actually existed you're done you're [ __ ] you've
already failed this process your mind needs to be open
enough to be open to literally any possibility and this
brings us to the the key point of existential investigation
is open-mindedness radical open-mindedness I stress this point a lot
but people still don't understand the significance of this you
will only appreciate what radical the mind this is when
you begin this investigation into the truth and when you
reach a point where you realize that holy [ __
] I don't know anything and I can't rely whatsoever
on any external human source or any hearsay to help
me in this investigation which means I have to derive
it all for myself which means I have to be
completely objective and I have to be completely impartial and
if I'm completely honest and completely impartial I admit that
I don't know anything that means I have to be
open to absolutely every possibility being true because you see
if I tell you that the universe was created by
a space kangaroo and you say oh well Leah that's
that's horseshit that can't possibly be real you've already failed
in this work you've closed your mind see because when
you admit that I don't know what that really means
and there's so many layers of death to this I
don't know we've only scratched the surface of it what
it really means is that you don't [ __ ]
know it means you cannot assign probabilities to what the
truth might be you might say well leo the probability
yeah maybe maybe I'll allow a 1% chance that the
universe was created by a giant space kangaroo because it
seems kind of far-fetched you've already failed you've already felt
you can't do that you can't assign probabilities because to
be able to a probability to an outcome means that
you already are assuming that you know what's true because
what are your probabilities based on your begging the question
you don't know what's true you don't know what's far-fetched
or not you don't know what's possible or not you
see how deep this goes because your ideas of what's
possible or what's probable or what's likely or what's far-fetched
or not or what's weird or what's crazy or what's
impossible all of these ideas are completely derived from your
culture maybe also a little bit from your direct experience
because it you know in your direct experience to be
honest you know you've never seen a space kangaroo so
you might say that well the probability of there being
a space kangaroos is quite low because I've never seen
one okay well fine but that's that's very poor logic
because there's a lot of stuff you haven't seen you've
never seen a billion dollars doesn't mean that it ain't
out there you've probably never seen Jupiter doesn't mean it
ain't out there there's a lot of stuff you believe
very firmly that you've never seen and after all hello
your your your view on reality is so narrow obviously
it's so narrow you've seen so little of reality you've
seen so little I'm not even talking about other planets
you've seen so little of planet Earth you've seen so
few cities how many cities on this planet have you
been to a dozen a couple dozen probably at most
maybe a hundred there's there's hundreds of thousands of cities
on this planet most of them you've never been to
yet you assume they exist there and of course there's
most of reality 99.99999% of reality you have it seen
so what does that tell us that tells us that
you're clueless it tells us there's there's so much stuff
out there that could surprise you you have to be
open to surprise that's a very important aspect of this
open-mindedness deal that we're talking about to be open minded
is to admit that I don't really know and my
assignment of probabilities to outcomes are really ultimately groundless if
I want to be honest about it and so I
have to be even open to things that might seem
crazy or absurd like giant space kangaroos creating the universe
it's a little counterintuitive and tricky here because you might
think like well leo but if I open my mind
to all sorts of crazy possibilities like giant space kangaroos
and stuff like that what's to stop me from getting
totally deluded it seems like Leo you're actually opening Pandora's
Box here to all forms of delusion shouldn't it shouldn't
I be more s'more more grounded shouldn't I be more
rational and more scientific and more conservative in this process
like I shouldn't open my mind to all these crazy
possibilities but that's exactly wrong you would think that opening
your mind to a giant space kangaroo would lead you
away from truth but actually it's the opposite because to
be conservative and to be very strict with with what
you allow in your inquiry assumes that you already know
the truth because how are you disallowing something from your
inquiry think about that so for example I tell you
about the giant space kangaroo and you say no Leo
I'm not even gonna think about that I won't I
refuse to read books about giant space kangaroos because they
aren't real how do you know that have you searched
the entire universe for space kangaroos and come up short
if you have okay you're on solid ground but you
haven't you haven't you haven't even searched this planet for
space kangaroo maybe there's a space kangaroo living under your
bed you haven't even searched there you don't know it's
very important to recognize here that we cannot pre judge
our inquiry we cannot assume what the conclusion might be
we have to actually do the search we have to
go through a discovery process we can't just say oh
well there's probably no spanks can you under my bed
no we have to actually look under our bed for
the space kangaroo in fact if you want to take
this process seriously go pause this video right now and
go look under your bed for a space kangaroo that
will be the first bit of existential inquiry that you
probably done in your whole life go look under your
bed you probably won't find one there but hey you
know at least you're doing the work now and you're
understanding a little bit of what it takes now here
already were running into one of the chief problems and
objections that people have one of the chief obstacles to
this inquiry is that people say oh holy ah but
this is this is becoming so hard I thought this
was just gonna be some fun armchair philosophy where I
get to sit around I just get to think about
stuff like whether I'm in a matrix or not or
I get to cope with cool ideas and I get
to you know play around with my pet theories and
rationalize my own belief system and now you're telling me
I got to go check under my bed you know
I got to go and do this this is this
is hard work I gotta like bend my back I
got a peek under they're gonna grab the flashlight at
this real dark under there check to see you know
and after all you know how many beds do I
have to check I mean if I check this one
bed but there's a million beds on this plan you
have to check under every bed for these space kangaroos
this is gonna waste my whole life it's too much
work it's too much expense why am i doing all
this let me just go back to living my ordinary
life that's exactly the reasoning that people use to not
do this work and you can't really blame them because
when we begin this inquiry we have no idea whether
it'll be worthwhile or not maybe we're gonna the next
hundred years checking every bet on the planet for giant
space kangaroos and will find nothing and we will have
wasted all of that life and we could have used
those hundred years to have sex to buy houses to
do drugs to watch TV to travel around the world
and to drink champagne and drive fast cars and yachts
and build businesses and all this and make children and
raise families and all this and we will have sacrificed
all of that just to find nothing yeah that's right
that's the cost of finding truth so if you don't
care about the truth if you don't care about knowing
how reality actually is remember that's what we're really interested
in how reality actually is if you don't care to
know that then you're done you'll never discover the truth
now you might wonder well Leo but what if it's
not even possible in theory to discover the truth what
if there is no truth to discover what if all
this is just mental masturbation yeah that's possible but also
notice if that's true then that is the truth but
you don't know that that's true to know that that's
true you would actually have to go and exhaust every
possible avenue of inquiry look under every bed on every
planet in every solar system for space kangaroos and find
nothing and after all of that you would discover that
okay maybe you'd finally after you've exhausted searching the entire
universe maybe you'd come to the conclusion that okay it's
not ever possible to reach the truth and that would
be the truth that you reached but it would take
you a trillion years to search the entire universe or
maybe there's a faster way maybe you and stumble upon
some way to get to the truth that will deliver
it to you within a year or within a month
or within a week or within a day you don't
know how would you know if you already knew that
you wouldn't need to begin the inquiry you see our
undertaking the inquiry has to admit and acknowledge that we
don't know it could be a giant waste of time
or maybe maybe finding the truth will be the most
remarkable life-changing life transforming experience of all time maybe it
will result in an orgasm of ecstasy and $100 bills
will shower from the sky maybe maybe it'll make you
immortal maybe you will become a god who can control
the whole universe maybe I mean sounds kind of far-fetched
but who knows we don't know because we have it
we haven't finished our work we've barely begun our work
and yet we've already spent an hour talking about it
and that's of course with the benefit of me having
spent literally thousands of hours doing this on my own
so now I'm kind of guiding you through this process
and it actually kind of seems kind of reasonable and
pretty efficient to the way I'm explaining to you now
you know I only took an hour to get this
far this hour that we just spent together talking about
this this probably took me thousands of hours to get
this far on my own when I begin when I
was 16 years old so of course I'm I'm guiding
you now with the benefit of hindsight having discovered the
truth and I'll spoil it for you I did discover
it and it is possible to discover a spoiler so
of course the only reason we're talking about it cuz
it is worthwhile but but you have to understand that
that is only my point of view now that I've
done the work when I began work I had no
idea that it was possible which shows you how much
commitment you have to have this process because when you
begin this work if you're truly doing this work and
you start from a position of I don't know you
don't know if it's gonna be possible or worthwhile now
here's your problem is that what I know is not
what you know so even though I've discovered the truth
that doesn't help you at all because even if I
tell you the truth how do you know I'm not
lying to you how do you know I'm not deluded
how do you know that you should listen to me
you don't you see because from your point of view
I am just another authority figure which we already talked
about and said that we can't listen to see so
in this process you're all on your own I can
guide you I can help you but you're gonna have
to do this reasoning for yourself I can't do it
for you that's one of the tricks with truth is
that the truth must be discovered by every individual for
him or herself that's what makes truth difficult you can't
be lazy here and just expect somebody to deliver the
truth to you on a silver platter your teacher your
professor your rabbi or some book cannot deliver you the
truth it delivers you hearsay it delivers you opinions perspectives
and beliefs but that is not the truth or rather
the problem is is that you don't know how to
differentiate between one belief one opinion one perspective over another
to distinguish them you would need to know the truth
first see the mistake that people make is they start
to distinguish between different belief systems and perspectives and world
views and opinions yet they've never discovered the truth so
all their distinguishing is predicated upon assumption which are mostly
false but they are not conscious enough to realize this
they think what they're doing when they're when they're judging
different opinions and worldviews they think that they're being truthful
and they think that they are doing this inquiry they're
not doing this inquiry they are begging the question they
are using past assumptions to adjudicate future situations but their
past assumptions they never actually validated those they just picked
them up from the culture that's what distinguishes what most
people do from what we're doing here right now from
existential inquiry it's a huge difference what most people do
is conformity they conform to the belief system and worldview
and perspective of their culture that's what 99.9% of people
are doing including scientists intellectuals academics Nobel Prize winners and
all that and then a very very tiny percentage less
than 1% of people are doing what we're doing here
which is they're you're actually thinking for themselves through this
stuff so we sort of set this situation up that
was good now where we go from here well we
have to wonder what are the different methods that we
might use for discovering truth let's brainstorm some possibilities well
we could use reason we have the reasoning faculty in
fact we've been using it already just to get this
inquiry off the ground we've had to use some reason
and some very basic common sense not any kind of
formal logic book you know just basic common sense we
also have had to rely on history because notice I've
brought in examples of history that was important because we
do look to the history of the human race to
see where mistakes made that's very helpful but of course
remember history is very problematic because again how do you
know anything that you learned about history is actually true
because history is all hearsay secondhand accounts you have no
direct experience of of most of the history that you
know but you know we'll give that some benefit of
the doubt for now we'll allow some history for now
of course we'll have to question it in the future
so we have reason we have history we could read
books but again reading books how do you know which
book is correct there are so many contradictory books you
can read a book on science you can read the
Bible you can read the Koran which one is correct
how do you know you have intuition that's an interesting
faculty and vehicle towards truth throughout your life you've used
intuition you used gut feelings and sometimes your intuitionist has
panned out and delivered some truthfulness or some accuracy to
you helped you to make decisions in the right way
or help you to avoid danger maybe you're walking through
the forest and you have an intuition there's there's a
bear around the corner and and what do you know
you know you spot the bear before he spots you
and then you run away and you're safe whereas if
you didn't he would have eaten you that's that's valid
so we have intuition and you know humans have have
talked about intuition fur fur since the dawn of civilization
so we might assume that there's something to intuition we
might use science now of course science is a very
complicated thing we just say the word science that that
drags in with it the entire history of science and
all the different methodologies of science so there's so many
methods there you know what counts as legitimate science just
looking through a microscope count just looking through a telescope
count is using sort of particle collider count does my
direct experience count as science what is science really now
that's a extremely deep question which we can't go into
here I'll I'll have separate episodes about how science really
works and what it is in the future so that's
a long tangent but okay we got science that we
could potentially use maybe we can do some sort of
laboratory experiments maybe we can get some some rats throw
them in a maze and maybe we can discover some
truth by little by observing rats maybe or maybe we
can do sort of the sort of jane goodall approach
where we go to the jungle and we live with
the chimpanzees and we hide in the bushes and we
peek through the bushes using some binoculars and we watch
we observe the chimpanzees doing their chip stuff and then
maybe we learn some truth from them maybe or maybe
we send out satellites into space and we we photograph
things and we can learn the truth that way through
photography maybe maybe we we mix some chemicals in a
jar in a beaker and we stir it around and
then we do we find some truth through some sort
of chemical laboratory testing maybe maybe we we do sociological
sort of studies where we get a bunch of group
of people together we get like a hundred people on
a college campus together and we run some clever experiments
on them we give them some placebo drug or whatever
and then we test them we do a control group
we do another group that we give the real drug
to we test them then we find the truth through
that process maybe how about witchcraft how about voodoo how
about astral projection how about psychedelics how about meditation how
about contemplation all of these are potential avenues of truth
but we don't know how reliable they are and of
course the problem is is that if we ask somebody
well ok so which method should I use which method
is reliable you see the problem we're back to square
one we can't ask that question because if we're gonna
ask somebody who are you gonna ask depending on who
you ask you'll get a different answer so how do
you know who to ask and which answers are correct
and which people to trust and not trust you don't
the only way you could know that is for you
already knew the truth so if you go and ask
your college professor whether voodoo is legitimate he'll tell you
no but can you trust that isn't he biased after
all he works in a university he spent his whole
life in a university he's been indoctrinated in school since
he was a baby his parents were probably scientists and
professors and so forth so can you really trust him
maybe maybe not you don't know how about direct experience
can you trust your own direct experience can you trust
perceptions maybe perception and direct experience and our awareness of
the present moment can lead us to the truth now
that's a rather interesting and unique case direct experience and
by direct experience I'm just mean literally the perceptions you're
experiencing right now after all how do you know you're
alive and that's that's a good tack to take here
when we're investigating reality at the most fundamental level we
can try to ask the question of like okay of
all the things that I think I know about the
world what do I think I know which is the
most unquestionable is something that's so basic so fundamental so
unquestionable that if this thing was wrong nothing else would
matter and nothing more could be done and so if
you think about that for a moment you might conclude
that the one thing that you know for sure is
that you exist right now that you're alive right now
isn't that true is there anything more certain than that
you're alive right now how do you know that you're
alive right now how are you certain to that is
that something I told you is that something you read
in a book is that something your college professor told
you is that something your parents taught you is that
something you read in the Bible or learn to church
that you're alive or is there something more primordial and
fundamental that makes you aware of your aliveness something that
is non-human a nonhuman source for your aliveness what is
that source well we might call that direct experience because
after all notice that if you weren't alive right now
there could be no church there could be no Bible
there could be no professor there could be no university
there could be no humans there could be no planet
there could be no universe there could be no teaching
there could be no concept of truth there could be
no thoughts there could be no intuitions there could be
no voodoo no witchcraft no science no reason no rationality
nothing think this through just accept what I'm saying check
for yourself whether what I'm saying makes sense and is
true so it seems already we've made some pretty good
progress it seems like we've found something more fundamental than
witchcraft and science and universities and churches and Bibles we've
found that it seems like you know if you think
throughout all of your life what's the one thing that
you've always had with you throughout all that because you
know sometimes you were at church but other times you
weren't sometimes you were doing science but other times you
weren't sometimes you were using your reason and other times
you weren't but what's the one thing you always had
throughout your whole life the sense that you're alive we
might almost jump to the conclusion that reality is nothing
but your sense of being alive and then everything else
just details everything else is just what happens within that
frame but then that raises interesting questions like well so
does this mean that there's nothing outside of my own
life or other humans real cuz after all if I'm
dead they don't exist before I was born there were
no humans from my point of view so is my
point of view all of reality or is reality something
beyond merely my own point of view and my own
little life hmm interesting I don't know we don't know
not yet but there's interesting possibilities here some of these
possibilities might seem outlandish and far-fetched like that space kangaroo
but remember we don't know we don't really know could
it be that I'm the only thing alive in the
whole universe could it be that the entire universe is
just what's happening in my life right now after all
that has been literally how it's felt since my birth
after all it does feel from my point of view
that the entire universe revolves around me so it's not
an unreasonable possibility do we know that there's something external
to this life do we know there's a objects outside
of direct experience if what we're calling here is direct
experience do we know that maybe we assume it may
be our culture tells us that there is but how
do we know maybe there's nothing but this direct experience
right now and in fact how do I know that
the memories I have my childhood that those are actually
not just something that's happening right now in this present
moment did those memories of childhood actually happen or are
they just something I'm imagining right now is there even
a difference I don't know we'll have to investigate all
that now there's an doubt here that we have to
throw in which is well sure we have perceptions colors
sounds and so forth but after all perceptions what our
perceptions aren't perceptions just a byproduct of evolution and the
human physiology we know that rattlesnakes perceive differently they can
sense infrared when humans can't we know that other creatures
see different colors some creatures only see in black and
white some creatures have entirely new senses of smell or
or even senses that humans don't even have beyond our
five senses so we can kind of surmise it's a
pretty safe assumption at this point to notice that probably
other and organisms experience reality a very different way some
of them might not even see colors so how do
we know that if we're gonna say the direct experience
is the only we're not the only but is like
the the most fundamental Avenue towards truth which it seems
so far that's sort of been our conclusion but we
don't we don't know that it's still shaky right we're
not jumping to conclusions here but it seems like our
sense of aliveness comes before religion and before science and
before reason because we first have to be alive in
order to get those things and after all you know
for me to have science for me to do reason
for me to have religion I have to experience them
how do i interface with science at all how do
i interface with rationality it's through direct experience notice that
if if I eliminate all of my direct experiences science
flies out the window there can't be science without direct
experience there can't be religion I can't read the Bible
unless I'm experiencing a Bible I can't know about Christ
unless I have an image of Christ in my mind
and the word Christ which all of it is direct
experience so seems like direct experience is pretty fundamental but
there is an additional doubt this is a classical doubt
that philosophers have had since the ancient Greeks and Romans
are probably even before that which is that how do
we know we can trust our perceptions after all perceptions
seem quite ilusory you can like poke your eyeball and
you're gonna start to see weird colors that weren't there
before you can cross your eyes and then you're actually
gonna start to see double of certain objects you can
be in a desert you can see a mirage you
can be underwater or you can be looking through a
different colored lens and you're gonna see the world colored
or shaped in a different way you could have lenses
camera lense with different fields of view you could have
fisheye effects and you can have very tight tight focuses
which which result in very flat images so I like
which of those represents the correct way to look at
the world do we really want to say that colours
sounds feelings and emotions are the most truthful thing we
have is that what we really want to say cuz
after all the sense of being alive what is that
but a feeling it seems like so far we've reduced
it all down to a feeling we're saying that a
feeling is more fundamental and true than science is that
true and how would we check that you see it's
one thing to just sit around and speculate but we're
not interested here in speculation we're not interesting in probabilities
we're not interested in like well yeah I I think
that there's like a 65% chance that my perceptions are
accurate no no this is this does nothing for us
we want truth for certain it has to be certain
it can't be a probability it can't be a wild
guess or a feeling or a speculation that we have
like a it feels like this is right no if
there is a truth and we're gonna find it we
need to to be sure about it but how do
we know that the thing we're sure about is actually
the truth and not just something that's a falsehood that
we've convinced herself is the truth these are all very
thorny questions it almost seems hopeless how do we figure
this out we want to turn to somebody for help
but we can't we want to ask a professor we
can't we want to read a book we can't we
want to talk to some rabbi or priest or guru
nope can't can't do it can't help us because for
us to trust them we don't read you to have
the truth we want to ask ourselves and we can't
do that either see are you gonna ask yourself what
the truth is but that already assumes you know what
the truth is so why would you even ask if
you already knew the fact that you're asking already demonstrates
that you don't know so you can't even ask yourself
so it seems impossible how are you gonna figure this
out nope that's why so few people do the work
because it seems hopeless you don't even know how to
begin and yet I'm gonna spoil it for you here
it is possible how well you keep questioning you keep
investigating direct experience turns out to be a very good
lead follow up on that lead keep digging into it
try to find what's most fundamental in your life but
you know you can become very very skeptical with this
whole process you can even question something like your sense
of being alive you could say well leo but the
sense of being alive what is this is just a
feeling could it be that we're not really alive what
if it's an illusion what if we think we're alive
but really we're really not what if we're like in
a computer simulation after all how do we know what
it feels like to be alive maybe my mind is
tricking me maybe the way the brain is wired it
does some freaky stuff and it creates the illusion of
a human being alive but really it's nothing but atoms
and molecules maybe how would we sort that out you
see the very deep problem here what criterion are you
going to use to adjudicate different cases of truth versus
falsehood so any case I bring forth to you how
are you gonna adjudicate it based on what any criterion
you use will itself be in doubt and require a
further criterion so if if I come to you with
the question of what's what's more reliable your reason or
your perceptions how are you gonna decide that based on
what are you gonna use reason to adjudicate between reason
and perception that can't work because that's already biased you're
begging the question the point is that you don't know
whether reason or perception is more accurate so if you're
gonna use reason to adjudicate between the two you're already
assuming that reason is more accurate and therefore the point
is moot you've begged the question you might as well
save your time and not even answer it because your
your action already reveals your underlying bias but if you're
gonna use perception to adjudicate between perception reason then you're
biased in the other direction and you're begging the question
so how could this possibly work it seems like an
impossible puzzle what are you gonna use what can you
rely on there's no firm ground to stand on everything
is called into question but there's an even deeper wrinkle
to the skepticism so skepticism is a funny thing when
I started this whole process back when I was 16
years old I went down down down this very road
that I'm sharing with you now and of all the
different philosophies that I've read you know I just went
online this was in the early 2000s when the internet
was first born and there were still very little content
compared to today there was no YouTube there was barely
a Wikipedia and so forth but there was some semblance
of a Wikipedia and so I think I went on
Wikipedia or some website similar to that it was a
philosophy website which just had a bunch of different philosophies
they had materialism realism idealism and dualism and mysticism and
solipsistic at log of like every different philosophical school I
I've read through some of them not all of them
there's two and I sort of was thinking about okay
so which one of these how do I decide which
was true and which one do I choose for myself
at least temporarily if not permanently and and what I
resonated the most with was skepticism the ancient Greek sort
and I considered myself a skeptic at that point I
started to question science by that point so much and
I was into science you know I spent a good
chunk of my my high school education way into science
I took hard science classes chemistry and advanced physics and
advanced biology and and all this were stuff I was
fascinated in science I read Darwin's On the Origin of
Species just by myself not as part of the school
assignment cuz I was fascinated by evolution I toured around
with the idea of becoming a molecular biologist I entered
University studying aerospace engineering so I was very scientifically minded
most of my most of my college classes were hard
core calculus classes physics classes mechanics classes like pretty dry
boring stuff I kind of reread it in retrospect but
yeah it wasn't it wasn't very fun it's kind of
dry and boring but you know I was serious about
that stuff and I was interested in it but also
I started questioning so deeply that I realized that I
can't take science for granted is true so at that
point in my investigation I literally placed science at the
same level as religion because I had to admit to
myself that even though I love science and I'm curious
about it and it seems like science is much more
reasonable than religion if I'm really totally honest I have
to admit that I don't know I don't know if
what religion says is false I can't just dismiss it
even though it sounds kind of cuckoo I can't dismiss
it because I I just don't know and yet still
I leaned atheist at that point I was actually I
was pretty hardcore atheist at that point because it just
didn't make sense to me that God could be true
it it seemed like a bass kangaroo it seemed totally
outlandish but but deep down I knew that I had
to be very objective about this so I couldn't call
myself a scientist by that point and I couldn't call
myself a religious person I was very averse to religion
and so skepticism this very inquiry that we're doing here
is skepticism that's what it is so I became an
arch radical skeptic I questioned absolutely everything my mom would
make fun of me and she would she would call
me like the unbeliever the infidel the one who doesn't
believe anything because I would question everything I would even
question things like is is 0 times 2 equal to
0 I would question that I would question that like
I would question 1 plus 1 equals 2 everything I
wouldn't I wouldn't believe it in fact it almost became
pathological because what started happening is that I started questioning
even the most obvious and true things like just common
sense things I would start to question to the point
where it actually became kind of corrosive and toxic because
it actually became difficult to function because certain things that
you know other normal people who just take for granted
as obvious I would I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't
follow them into that and you know I at that
point I was very averse to faith and so skepticism
is sort of like the antithesis of faith and so
to me faith wasn't just believing in God to me
faith I saw faith everywhere I saw people in science
taking science on faith I saw mathematicians doing mathematics on
faith I saw people doing logic using logic on faith
faithfully assuming that logic would lead them to truth and
I couldn't do that so I was very very skeptical
and I actually created kind of a skeptic identity and
I enjoyed I enjoyed that it was fun to play
that but then I started to question even deeper and
that's when a really twisted thing happened which is that
my skepticism went full circle and it hit a sort
of inflection point and the way this happened is that
one day I was sitting around and thinking about I
guess how good it is to be a skeptic to
question everything but then the thought came to me wait
a minute what if all this skepticism is nonsense and
it's leading me away from the truth ah this is
what happens when you turn skepticism in on itself you
become so skeptical that of course you realize that to
be truly skeptical you must then apply your skepticism to
your skepticism and doubt your own skepticism because there is
a possibility and it's not an unreasonable possibility that this
attitude of approaching life by questioning everything to death and
doubting everything that this very attitude and worldview is itself
a delusion after all how do we know that skepticism
leads to truth we don't and when you realize that
you realize that skepticism eats its own tail because to
truly be a full skeptic you have to become so
skeptical that you realize skepticism is untenable and then where
does that leave you it leaves you in a sort
of no-man's land you can't really call yourself a skeptic
anymore because if you're fully skeptical then you have to
admit that skepticism is untenable so then are you a
skeptic are you a true skeptic or now have you
gone beyond skepticism how do you transcend a skepticism and
then where does that leave you does that put you
right back where you began or does that take you
to some even deeper or higher place answer that for
yourself do it do it become skeptical about your own
skepticism but before you do that first become skeptical first
spend a few years being be skeptical then spend a
few years questioning your own skepticism and see where that
leads you to see as you're doing all this what
should what you should start to notice is that there's
something lurking in the background of your inquiry something you
can't quite put your finger on you don't know how
to describe it or what it really is but there's
something there's something there and you're sort of circling around
it but you can't make it explicit and you sense
it in your reasoning process because you are using reasoning
and sort of a sort of common sense to think
through these questions to contemplate you are contemplating here you
know you're posing thought experiments and maybe you're you're cherry-picking
examples from life or from history or from religion or
from science your cherry pings so you're processing all this
mentally but as you're doing that you realize that in
this very process there's there's some sort of nugget or
kernel of truth that's there that's that's guiding this process
if you're doing it carefully it's not just pure fantasy
there's something there but you don't know what it is
so for example when you're skeptical about everything there's a
certain logic behind your skepticism there's a certain reason to
it it's makes a certain kind of sense and then
when you realize that wait a minute maybe my skepticism
is just more delusion and it won't leave me to
truth there's also a certain kind of sense and logic
to that and then where it ends you in a
sort of no-man's land where you can't quite say you're
a skeptic and also you can't quite say you're not
a skeptic because you know by realizing that skepticism is
untenable that doesn't just make you a blind believer in
every random thing so the opposite of skepticism is not
just faith in everything it makes no sense the Optus
is of the transcendence of skepticism is a sort of
no man's land but also when you reach the snowman's
land something interesting happens to you it affects your attitude
towards the world this no-man's land there's something about it
there's something truthful about it almost like there's something truthful
about saying you don't know when you really don't know
and there's something untruthful with claiming that you know something
that you feel deep down inside you don't really know
like when religious people claim that God exists but they
didn't but you ask them like well have you met
God and they say well no of course I haven't
met God but I know he exists but do you
really know he exists if you're very honest and you
introspect you have to be very honest now and you
know if you have to be able to transcend your
cultural programming and biases you have to admit that actually
you don't know if God exists unless you've actually met
him likewise if you're an atheist you say Wow God
God doesn't exist but do you really know that well
if you introspect deeply and you're very honest with yourself
you're gonna have to admit as an atheist no I
don't actually know that it just it seems likely that
he doesn't exist cuz I've never seen him but just
haven't seen something doesn't mean it doesn't exist so obviously
that's not good enough to rule out God and when
you make that admission to yourself you feel better you
feel pure you feel cleaner you feel more honest and
truthful so see in a sense what you're doing with
this inquiry is you're you're you're literally pulling yourself up
by the hair by the bootstraps in this process you're
sort of going around in circles with your mind but
as you do that there's always a little bit of
truth lingering in there somewhere it's almost like I've heard
this good description of you're looking down a corridor alarm
corridor and then as you turn your head to look
down the corridor you see the tale of some mysterious
wild animal quickly go around the corner and as you're
turning your head to look at it you catch just
the last couple of inches of the tail and it
goes by so fast with that sort of motion blur
effect that you you don't you don't know what that
was it almost has the feel of a mirage or
you can't put your finger on it it was too
quick and too blurry but you know you saw something
there but you have no idea what it was and
the more you do this process of inquiry the more
deeper you get into it the more you self reflect
the more honest you become the more of these glimpses
of the tale you catch at first you know you
catch that glimpse of a tale once a month or
once a year you know it's extremely rare you don't
even think it'll see it again but then the more
you keep at this process the more you see it
and then like every times like what is that thing
there's something over there and then as you walk to
it down the corridor you see this is an infinite
corridor it goes forever and so the closer you walk
to the tail the tail is always the same distance
far away from you this sort of weird spooky thing
ah I'm being poetic here there's there's no literal tail
that you see I'm being poetic but something like this
so what starts to happen is that in this process
of a logic Inge and thinking this stuff through you
notice that there is at the forefront there is your
logical mind thinking these questions through struggling with them may
be coming up with tentative conclusions then discarding them looking
for other ones so there's that happening at the forefront
of your logical conscious mind and then in the background
there is a what I call an intuitive Faculty there
is sort of an intuition a deep intuition which is
observing the foreground activity of your mental state it's that
deep intuition which is sort of connecting all the dots
and drawing a big picture of what's really going on
with you in this process and it's from that intuition
that you start to see certain connections and you start
to see that example of what I was calling the
tail rounding the corner catching a glimpse your intuition starts
to catch these glimpses but of course they're still the
lingering doubt in the back of your mind can you
trust your intuition what's more reliable the foreground logical rational
activity of your mind or that deep background of the
intuitive seeing the big picture connecting the dots sore deal
catching a glimpse of this tail rounding the corner what's
more true of course at this early stage of the
process you don't know you so you just work with
it you see where it takes you supposedly there is
some concrete definite way that the universe actually is that
reality actually is and if there is that way notice
we have to distinguish here between how it actually is
and how I think it is how I believe it
is how I want it to be how I imagined
it to be how I fear arises it how I
create mental imagery about it distinguish all those from the
thing itself from reality itself so if I'm sitting here
right now and I start to think like well maybe
reality is like a giant sphere that's the whole universe
is a giant sphere and it's made out of energy
and it's got quarks bouncing around you know trillions and
trillions of quarks that's from the Big Bang so it
exploded like a Big Bang and then this happened and
there was an inflation period and this is whole thing
is expanding and then eventually maybe will happen is it'll
it'll get so big the bubble will will start to
contract and then come back together and all of it
come back back into a little tiny kernel a little
seed little mustard seed of all the quarks in the
universe comes back and it all compresses and then it
blows up again and then this is what it is
that's the truth but notice that's not the truth that's
your ideas of the truth so if if these ideas
are actually pointing to something valid maybe they are maybe
they aren't we don't know we have tested right we
have to test it but let's say these ideas I
have and I just explained they are actually what's going
to happen and how it works that still isn't actually
it you see these are simplified ideas abstractions theories models
gross oversimplification which means that that isn't really it what
we're after is it itself what is it how do
you get to it is there even in it if
there isn't it it's the truth if there isn't in
it it's the truth that there is no it would
then be the truth but if there is no it
then what is all this what is this experience this
perception this could this be it could I be it
what is my relationship to it is there an itch
and a me which came first did it come first
or did I come first or did we come together
maybe there isn't an I maybe there's only in it
maybe there isn't an it maybe there's only an i
maybe the it and the I are one of the
same and maybe they're different if you're wondering will Leo
the word truth what does that even mean aren't we
just playing word games here maybe we are maybe that's
all we're doing maybe all this is just word games
and a waste of time but that again is what's
happening right now a word game you have to be
very careful in this process not to get lost in
your own intellectualization and your own mind when we're talking
about discovering the truth we're not talking about ideas or
theories or philosophies we're talking about the most true thing
that there possibly can be we're talking about reality itself
how reality actually is so if you think that's all
a word game be careful because when you say that
what you're saying is that this very moment your entire
life is nothing but a word game is that really
a road you want to go down is that really
what you believe see because a lot of people will
say awful Asif II and all this stuff leaves talking
us all just a word game but then they go
right back to their ordinary life doing ordinary things and
they don't consider their children a word game when your
child gets cancer is that just a word game but
you said it was but do you react to the
news of your child's cancer as though it were a
word game no you don't so that tells you there's
a rift between what you believe or your worldview and
how you actually interact with the world see so part
of our work here is not only to convince the
self are some sort of philosophical theory and then go
back to ordinary life and do all the stupid things
we've always done part of our work here is to
discover the truth and whatever that truth is then to
align ourselves with the truth so like for example if
you really believe that God exists as a Christian sort
of philosophy and you really believe that God is a
vengeful God and he he writes down notes about who's
been naughty and nice and he he will punish those
who don't pray to Him and do evil things and
who act like jerks and he will reward those who
who spread his word if that's what you really believe
and you think that's truth but then you don't act
in accordance with it then what you really believe at
an even deeper level is that it's not truth if
you don't go to church if you swear and break
the Ten Commandments and you have abortions and do all
the stuff that's supposedly God doesn't want you to do
then it's actually your actions which reveal what you really
believe and the rest is just some fluff on top
some ideology you've constructed see what we're interested in this
work is we're interested in being brutally honest with ourselves
and we're interested in getting past the fluff past the
ideals and all the stuff we tell our friends that
we believe and that we think is right into what
actually shapes our actions what what motivates our emotions and
our feelings so for example if you like to tell
your friends that all well reality is just a simulation
but then when your child gets cancer you get all
freaked out and you run to your friends for help
and you tell them how terrible it is and how
much you're suffering well what what that tells us is
that you don't really it's a simulation because if you
really believe it is a simulation you wouldn't be so
attached to this simulation because the cancer then is a
simulation your child is a simulation so why are you
so attached to it see so this person in this
case has an ideology that autolysis a simulation but then
in practice deep down what he really holds as truth
is that life is real and that his child is
precious and important and that cancer is evil that's his
true philosophy hiding under the fake one so be very
careful the human mind is very tricky it likes to
create all sorts of fake flowery philosophies but then the
way that we actually lead our lives that's what reveals
the real philosophy running the show and usually that one
is quite ugly and petty and nasty for many people
the true philosophy running their show is something like that
life is a dog-eat-dog world it's brutish its brutal it's
short it's indifferent God doesn't give a [ __ ]
about you there is no God evil Devils are running
amok the world sucks life is [ __ ] miserable
for many people that's their true philosophy everything is pointless
everything is depressing so you got to be real honest
with yourself here this is a painful degree of self
honesty it's a self honesty that burns throughout this whole
process you have to hold your own feet to the
fire and and burn off your old ideas and ideologies
all of your pet theories have to be burned off
this process is ruthless it's unpleasant it's emotionally disturbing it
can lead to depression it can lead to nihilism it
can make you act weird socially it can make you
reclusive it can make you feel like you're losing your
mind because you're truly doing the work later when you
finally complete all this work and you finally do reach
the truth you will appreciate why so few people reach
the truth it's because of the emotional labor and toil
emotional toil you had to go through - to burn
off all this fluff all this programming that you've been
conditioned with and to Rack your mind for four years
for thousands of hours trying to understand this stuff but
you'll also understand that there's no way it could be
otherwise you had to go through this process you can't
short-circuit this process by turning to some expert to tell
you the answer now in my own work here with
actualize that org I tell you all the answers so
in a certain sense of course I contradict myself but
that's because I want to make a catalog of all
the answers that's my own agenda here and the answers
in a sense are easier to deliver than to guide
you through this very subtle process of inquiry so really
what's happened here we've just begun our inquiry into the
foundations of human knowledge otherwise known as epistemology personally I
think that this is one of the most important and
underappreciated topics for mankind on this hinges everything this process
is not taught in school it's not taught in universities
is certainly not taught in religions it's not even taught
in spiritual teachings it's not taught in books it's not
taught in videos it's very challenging to teach this very
few people teach it because very few people have actually
done it Eenie even many people who have awoken or
who have had success on a spiritual path they still
have not really done this process deeply enough you can
have mystical experiences even even fairly significant awakenings without having
gone through this whole process and that's not a good
thing that's actually a bad thing because what it means
is that you're gonna have your awakening but it's going
to be muddled by a bunch of ideology and cultural
conditioning and stuff you and truly questioned and that will
corrupt your awakening so this is a little introduction into
epistemology hope you enjoyed it I hope you learned some
lessons here I hope you actually went with me here
on this journey and weren't just listening passively but we're
working actively pausing between different questions trying to work this
stuff out for yourself it this process is just like
working a mathematical proof you need to go through the
steps of the proof and have traction in your mind
with the logic of it to see the steps how
they interconnect to see the end result of course most
people are so lazy they don't want to do any
mathematical bruise but hopefully you're one of the ones who
isn't lazy and you you really have a passion for
truth and you want to you want to get to
the bottom of it and you have some and I
guess I guess this process requires some faith you need
to have an overarching faith that this process will be
worthwhile in some capacity you need to at least have
the faith that even if you go through this whole
process and you never discover the truth because maybe it
doesn't exist or maybe you'll just never find it because
it requires so much work but you still need to
have the sort of faith that even if you don't
complete this process it'll still be beneficial to you because
if you don't have faith in that then you're never
gonna invest the thousands of hours that are necessary to
do this work you just won't you need to have
some sort of vision now of course you might say
well Leo but why should I have this faith after
all I don't know if it's gonna be worthwhile that's
right that's why they call it a leap of faith
you don't know it's a risk but hey you know
what all of life is a risk and by not
doing this process that's also a risk don't forget that
by not questioning yourself by not questioning your culture by
not questioning your religion by not questioning science by not
questioning your authority figures and teachers and gurus that's an
enormous risk and this risk is not speculative this risk
has been borne out throughout all of human history think
of all the mass racism and war and genocide and
evil cults that have existed Spanish inquisitions witch burnings McCarthyism
Nazism and all sorts of ideologies and mass conformist culture
movements like this that have all what's the one common
element behind all of those people weren't thinking independently for
themselves they were just being sheep so don't think that
you're somehow safe by avoiding this process then you just
consign yourself to be a sheep how do you think
that's gonna work out for you probably not so good
so there's trade-offs there's pros and cons there's a cost
there's a benefit to either decision you'll do this inquiry
or you won't or you'll do it for a little
while then you'll quit then you'll come back when you're
more mature and when you're more developed see if you're
still at the point where you're like ollie oh but
I don't know what what's the point of the truth
I don't really care about it then you're not developed
enough you're not mature enough you're not wise enough to
see why someone would want to know what what existence
is after all think of it this way the only
thing you have is existence you know nothing but existence
name one thing you know which is not existence or
a part of existence even if you name something like
a unicorn a unicorn is a part of existence in
your mind at least doesn't mean that you'll find a
unicorn on Mars it just means that in your mind
a unicorn is still something even figments of one's imaginations
must exist so existence is all there is at least
from your perspective maybe there's something more but so far
you've only experienced existence so existence is all there is
don't you want to know what it is why is
here or are you just gonna live your life like
a like a chimp you're just gonna go on [
__ ] and eating and [ __ ] and working
a dead-end job and then retiring and then what and
dying that's what your life is gonna be you're gonna
you're gonna live for 80 or a hundred years and
you're never going to wonder what existence is so you're
gonna care about raising a family and you're gonna care
about making some money if you're gonna hear about getting
some sexual pleasure and you're gonna care about going on
a vacation you're gonna care about all those little my
new show all that this is peanuts within existence because
you see when you care about sex or when you
care about religion or when you care about money those
are instances of existence so you are caring about existence
but in an extremely narrow form now what if you
broadened your interest out away from those my new shippi
nut stuff - the entire nut what is the whole
thing in a nutshell the universe in a nutshell is
Stephen Hawking would write you're not gonna care about that
does it does it matter to you you're going to
exist but you're not gonna care or know what existence
is doesn't that strike you as a little bit negligent
especially if people tell you that it seems like it's
possible to figure it out people like myself who said
to you that they figured it out and seemed to
imply that there's some value to it you're just gonna
ignore all that and you're gonna go chasing sex and
pleasure food go [ __ ] what else do you
have to do in life but to figure out what
life is is there any better use of your time
see it might seem like all this is just so
abstract it's so far away from my everyday concerns Leo
how is this gonna help me I just want to
escape my depression I just want to stop feeling anxious
I just want to feel good but what if all
of that is in some roundabout way connected to your
ignorance about existence what if your inability to choose a
career or to choose a relationship or to be indecisive
as you are to be lost and lazy and depressed
and to feel a point let die at this point
listen to and to make all these mistakes that you
make in your life to waste your money on this
thing to have sex with the wrong guy or with
the wrong girl to marry the wrong person to have
fights with people all this [ __ ] that you're
dealing with on it on a daily basis what if
all of this had something to do with existence itself
after all those are instances of existence don't you think
it might help to know what existence is maybe maybe
not you don't know how can you know the only
way you'll know is if you do it so I've
planted some seeds in you here I've guided you on
the beginning of this journey just the tip just the
tip of the iceberg it's up to you now to
continue this work this episode illogical existential inquiry I recommend
you keep questioning what truth is keep going down the
same kind of lines of logic that I've been taking
you down in this episode and see where it takes
you be patient with it have a long time horizon
take it up as a hobby and maybe one day
you'll find it to be worthwhile alright that's it for
this one please click that like button for me and
come check out actualize that org that's where you'll find
some additional exclusive resources like my blog where I post
insights and videos that aren't found anywhere else and my
book list where I had a lot of books that
discuss this whole topic of truth and various spiritual topics
and so forth that will actually they will help you
in this quest towards the truth but I recommend you
don't overuse them make sure you do plenty of your
own investigation because remember books are just hearsay in the
end you'll find a life purpose course if you want
to help with finding a sense of direction in your
life and building a career around that the life purpose
course details principles that I use to develop my own
sense of purpose and to be a leader and to
develop my business and the work that I do and
to be an artist all of all of the principles
I learned and doing that for myself I spent about
10 years trying to figure that out I figured it
out for myself now I'm doing it and then I'm
put it into a course so you can you can
check that out people seem to like it and then
what else do I got I'm forgetting something oh yeah
the forum check out the actualized forum and lastly of
course check out patreon I recently launched on patreon if
you like my work if you want to support it
this work doesn't get that many views because these videos
are long they're esoteric they're kind of deep so that
money I will be using in the future towards marketing
and expanding actualized and trying to bring more content and
also bringing the existing content to more people so if
you chip in 5 bucks a month that's very helpful
I'm very grateful for those donations that you guys have
been givin me that's awesome it's uh inspiring helps me
to to to do this work because for this work
I have to I have to maintain my independence above
above anything else this this is real philosophy here see
the philosophy they teach you in university that's [ __
] philosophy this is real philosophy real philosophy when it's
done right is life transforming stuff it's not sitting around
navel gazing and speculating about things it's not coming up
with ideologies it's the opposite of all that it's really
questioning it's really introspecting it's learning various principles of how
the mind works as you do this work if you
do this inquiry work one of the main benefits you'll
get is you will learn the trickeries of your own
mind you know in it in a way that you
can't possibly by reading some book you have to actually
be tricked by your own mind and then unravel the
tricks of your own mind to learn how the mind
works this is something I've been studying for for probably
20 years now is how my own mind tricks me
and that still doesn't make me immune to the tricks
because the mind is extremely tricky but also what's what's
amazing about this work when you do it long enough
and deep enough is that you get to a point
where almost no other human can trick you because you're
so good at understanding your own tricks and of course
your own tricks are the same as the tricks that
other people play on you and play on themselves is
that you almost developed this super power to see through
people and to see through situations you can look at
a situation where there's a political one on the news
or you can read you can read a book or
you can look at a a teacher or a lecture
or a video on YouTube or somebody telling you something
about life or about reality about themselves and you can
just it's like you have x-ray vision you see through
the [ __ ] you immediately know they're full of
[ __ ] you know how they're tricking you or
trying to at least and you know how they're treating
themselves whether it's religious people scientific people or cult leaders
or whatever this gives you a sort of x-ray superpower
it's a it's quite useful actually in a very practical
sense like for example you're doing business you can tell
when someone's trying to screw you in a business deal
you can tell the tricks they use because you are
so good at spotting those tricks within yourself of course
this also clears up your own perception of reality such
that even if we're not talking about some sort of
lofty metaphysical topics we're just let's say talking about business
deals in a business deal you can you can tell
when you develop that introspective capacity you can tell when
you're bullshitting yourself in a business deal see cuz it's
not only that someone bullshit's you in a business deal
you also [ __ ] yourself you tell yourself things
like all well yeah this is a really good deal
that guy's giving me such a good break I would
be stupid enough to take this deal you know your
mind will tell you these things so this this helps
all around because guess what all of existence is being
filtered through your mind to get to you and whatever
kind of distortive lenses your mind has whatever operations doing
before it gets to you if you're not aware of
it that's that's something that's a corrupting influence in your
life here's another final thought I'll leave you with about
the value of truth if truth is reality if truth
is finding out how reality actually is that which is
the case the truth is that which is the case
what else is there that which is not the case
that which is false dad which is a fantasy but
by definition that which is not the case doesn't exist
so if you think about it the only thing there
is is the truth and there's nothing else but the
truth so think of it this way if you don't
find the truth what do you have you have that
which is not the case you have nothing how are
you gonna live your life when you're not clear about
the only thing that there is and all you have
is that which isn't do you think that would create
some dysfunctions and problems in your life if you lived
that way anyways that's some food for thought I only
started you on this journey here I didn't give you
any answers deliberately it's not about giving you answers you
got to find it for yourself and of course if
you want the answers I've got plenty of other videos
which do give those to you you
