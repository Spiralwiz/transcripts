hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about what you need to
do next now that you've learned about spiritual enlightenment this
video is intended to be watched after you first watched
my spiritual enlightenment video the one that introduces you to
spiritual enlightenment tells you exactly what it is it's a
long video it's an in-depth video it's a world view
shattering video so if you haven't seen it go watch
it but if you have seen it then you've probably
been left with a bit of a bitter taste in
your mouth and you're not quite sure what to do
now that you learn about this truth and you're not
sure where to go this has made you confused it
has major life more complicated you're not sure which direction
to go in because it seems like you're being pulled
in two directions you've got the light that you've been
currently living you're you know pretty much your normal existence
you've been living that your whole life and that's still
got momentum and it's pulling you but then also you've
got this new truth that you've learned and this is
now beckoning you to go on a journey and pull
yourself in a totally different direction and in some sense
these can be opposite seeming directions so I want to
clear some of this up and tell you what the
game plan is here most people when they hear about
the truth of spiritual I mean what happens is that
it's a blow to your system and the emotional reaction
you experience is sadness depression this feeling of emptiness this
feeling like life is pointless and you might have been
left thinking something like oh damn so my whole life
was this giant lie and now it's still alive I'm
still continuing to live this lie so what do I
do do I stop the lie do I continue going
with it I don't even know what your action to
go and if I want it to stop this lie
and there's a sense that everything is pointless there's no
purpose anymore to anything you're not excited about life anymore
and you don't know what to do what should you
do well the first thing to recognize is let's not
be rash here and remember that these emotions that you're
experiencing whatever they are sadness anger emptiness any of these
emotions that these are emotional reactions of the ego and
this is how the ego protects and defends itself so
when you first hear this truth you're going to have
a very big emotional reaction but just like with anything
in life you hear it the first time and it
might shock you but then you get desensitized to it
over time so right now if you just heard this
truth today or yesterday or last week it's still very
fresh in your in your palate you've still got that
aftertaste and it can seem a bit bitter a bit
sour a bit depressing well just let that carry itself
through those are natural emotions let them carry themselves through
they're not that painful they're not that damaging to your
life so don't play into them and pretend like oh
my god my life is going to hell I should
kill myself now everything's horrible don't do that just let
the let the natural emotions if they're negative come up
but then don't play into them and make them exaggerated
don't blow them over the top don't overreact and don't
do anything at this point yet to change your life
around because you're not sure which ways to change your
life yet and the thing is that your ego the
way it defends itself is that it jumps to assumptions
and conclusions about what you should do which make it
seem like your whole life is going to hell when
in fact it's not I'm going to talk a little
bit more about that later here but before we even
go there first of all from your point of view
if you just heard from spirit about spiritual alignment from
me then you got to watch out because you got
to consider two things first of all consider that I
could be lying to you secondly consider that I could
be wrong from your point of view both of these
things can be the case now it's not the case
but it doesn't help you when I tell you that
I'm not lying to you or that I'm not wrong
because from your point of view I could still be
lying too or I could still be wrong so what
does this mean well this leaves you in kind of
a unresolved state if you will and that's good that's
what you need to get more comfortable with see the
whole problem is that your whole life up to this
point has been designed about getting you stability and certainty
and resolution and spiritual alignment is all about the opposite
you have to kind of shake your mind loose of
all these certainties that you've had because it's these certainties
that have been creating a lot of problems for you
without you being aware of it so what you need
to do is not jump to some opposite conclusion don't
have faith in me don't just believe everything I say
you have it skeptical if it skeptical so kind of
like follow that middle path there and at this point
in your life you understand that you're still caught up
in the illusion if what I'm telling you is true
you're still caught up in it so don't go doing
something drastic and crazy with your life and then justify
that oh it's because Leo told me about this enlightenment
thing that now I need to go do this crazy
thing no I didn't tell you anything crazy that you
have to do I just shared some information with you
and that gives you perhaps a different perspective on life
but recognize that just having a perspective on life is
one thing going out there doing something crazy is a
different thing and I did not in any way advocate
doing anything crazy with your life so don't be rash
you're still caught in this illusion so any actions that
you take right now they're actually coming from a position
of being in the illusion so if you tell yourself
that oh I'm going to go do something and that
is me breaking the illusion well is that really you
breaking the illusion or is that you being a victim
of the illusion you're so caught in it that means
that you still operate on all the same principles that
you've operated before it's not like I share this truth
with you and now all the sudden you're enlightened see
if you actually became enlightened from me telling you the
truth which it would it wouldn't be possible but let's
say you did if you became enlightened after watching that
first video then I would be speaking to you in
a different very different way because you would now be
in a very different position life but you're not there
you're not enlightened all you have is you have some
information now this information needs to be used to go
on a journey it can be or if you don't
want to go on a journey then don't go on
the journey but regardless you're still in the place where
you're at so you might say well leo does this
mean that all the self-help videos that I've been watching
from you that they're all pointless does this mean that
I should stop reading books does this mean that I
should stop going to work does this mean that I
should divorce my wife and and leave my kids behind
does this mean that I should quit my job does
this mean that I should go live in a cave
somewhere in India what does all this mean and you
got understand that you're still in the same place where
you were at before you watch the video nothing really
has changed for you you just became a little bit
more depressed so that means that if you do go
live in a cave in India and you quit your
job and all this stuff you're going to have massive
suffering you understand this because you're not enlightened you go
there you live in a cave and you will get
exactly the experience that you would imagine you would get
if you went and dropped your whole life and lived
in a cave you would suffer a lot so I
don't recommend you doing that not now you haven't attained
anything yet so don't be so quick to throw everything
away in your life and be careful about using this
and now as an excuse to become a slob or
a slacker in your life so just because you understand
spiritual enlightenment intellectually doesn't mean that now you get to
be a jerk to your family that's not an excuse
to be a jerk to your family nor does it
mean that now you can tell your boss to go
[ __ ] himself nor does it mean that now
money's not important and you don't have to pay your
rent to your landlord all these things are still part
of reality those aren't illusions you start to pay your
bills you still have to feed your kids otherwise they're
gonna go hungry you still probably want to be nice
to your wife otherwise she's gonna be mad at you
so those are still things that you want to uphold
and maintain and if you're eating healthy maintain eating healthy
this doesn't mean that you should now go because of
enlightenment and start eating at McDonald's and start splurging on
sinkers bars don't do that maintain your health if you've
got a gym routine keep going to your gym routine
everything just keeps going keeps going keep going we're imprinting
you with a new perspective right so don't get the
perspective confused with the actions at least right now the
other thing you should know is that I don't know
where you are right now in your life but everyone's
in a very different place some of you are struggling
just to pay the rent some of you are jobless
some of you are homeless watching this this video some
of you are really well-off and you've got a great
flourishing career some of you are in your retirement age
some of you are owning your own business and you've
got a passive income some of you are working paycheck
to paycheck and maybe you're working 60 hour weeks or
whatever at your job so there's a lot of different
positions you can be in and there's a lot of
different ages that you can be and you could be
15 years old you could be 25 years old 40
years old 50 60 70 years old so depending on
where you are not just in life but also in
your personal development in your psychological development there's different stuff
that you'll need to do so first of all understand
that what we're talking about here with spiritual alignment this
is the most advanced stage of personal development work and
the most advanced stage you might say of self-actualization work
when you realize that there is no self to self
actualize now this might seem like oh my god that
means that everything that I've been doing up to this
point has been a hoax but you don't want to
look at it like that you want to look at
it as stages there's a stage kind of a stair
step ladder up from the very bottom to the very
top and this is a long ladder and there's a
lot of development that has to happen along the way
so just because you're going to be doing some work
at the very high level stage doesn't mean that everything
below that has been useless know everything you've been doing
up to this point has been building you up building
you up to this stage that you're going to be
at now now many of you might not even be
at this stage or be ready for this stage so
that's the decision you have to make for yourself is
kind of where you are on this on this ladder
so just to give you like a basic example let's
say that you have difficulty paying your mortgage right now
and your house might get repossessed in a couple of
months if you don't go find yourself a new job
and you've got a family got a wife and you
got a couple of kids and you've got some of
these money issues you don't know how to buy the
groceries oh okay so if you're in that situation spiritual
alignment is not something you should be worrying about right
now you've got some more basic fundamental issues to take
care of go ahead take care of your money issue
so that there's not this burning need for money fix
that then maybe you'll be ready for spiritual alignment work
later maybe you might require five or ten years of
more of personal development work before you get to the
point where you can do this spiritual diamond work now
it's not to say that anything is preventing you no
matter at what stage you are at life if you're
very young and you're very inexperienced with life you can
still pursue spiritual enlightenment but remember that the day is
long and there are many days in the year so
it's not like you've only got one option here it's
not like all you have to do is do spiritual
I'm in 24/7 you don't need to do this in
fact that would uh that would backfire on you so
it's about making small shifts in your life to accommodate
this work it's not about totally transforming your life you
know not unless you really want to not unless it
really makes sense for you so get your basics handled
if you've got relationship problems that are very fundamental they're
making you anxious and agitated get get those handled if
you've got health problems you know if you're overweight your
doctor telling you that you're had a heart attack next
year if you don't fix that let's go ahead and
have you fix that first simply because spiritual enlightenment this
is a long process this might take you a couple
of years in the best case scenario it might take
you five or ten ten years to do so in
the meantime you got to understand you still are living
your ordinary life nothing is really changed you still need
a job you still need to pay the bills and
and do all the kind of ordinary stuff that you
do and your internal state hasn't changed so if if
you go ahead and run amok of your life right
now you're going to feel that you're going to suffer
for it it's not like you're not going to suffer
that suffering will be there it's a self created suffering
it's an illusion but the suffering feels very real to
you so it's still going to be there because you
haven't escaped the illusion that's what I mean that you're
still stuck in the illusion so don't think that now
you're out of the illusion you're not you're still totally
in it so after you get the basics handled you
might even want more than just the basics you might
want to go back and look at my other videos
that are not enlightenment related and fix other parts of
your life maybe what you want is you want to
get a good girlfriend or maybe what you want is
you want to start your own business or you want
to quit this nasty job that you've got and find
a nicer job that you really are passionate about go
ahead and do that that's fine that's fine the reason
I tell you these things is because I know what's
going to happen here's what's going to happen if right
now you've got a crummy life and you commit yourself
to this journey a spiritual alignment going to happen that
you're going to get on it and you can feel
excited for a while that oh I'm doing something new
this is kind of cool and you're going to do
this for a few weeks a few months let's say
but that was going to happen is that the life
that you left behind it'll catch up with you because
the life you left behind even if you move right
now to India and meditate in a cave in the
Himalayas actually you haven't really left anything behind sure you
might have left your job behind and your family behind
but still all the problems that you had all the
suffering you had from those situations that's still going to
all be with you you can't escape that because it's
in your head your head goes with you everywhere the
ego goes with you everywhere this illusion that you're in
it goes with you everywhere so you can't escape it
by moving to another country or living under the ocean
or something you can't escape it it's in your mind
it comes with you so that means that you might
need to do some basic fundamental personal development work just
so that you're comfortable enough to even pursue this truth
to pursue this truth takes a lot of open-mindedness it
takes a certain emotional resiliency to do this for example
if I go and explain all this to a to
a homeless man the street who is sitting there he
hasn't eaten for a week he's he's dirty he's tired
he's got some health issues that he hasn't seen a
doctor for because he doesn't have any money like that
person do you think he's gonna be receptive to these
truths about spiritual enlightenment no self and on all this
stuff no he's not going to care even if he
kind of cares and wants it he's not actually going
to be able to fulfill on that commitment because he's
in such a dire position in life he's so emotionally
distressed his mind can't focus to do the spiritual diamond
work we need your mind to be clear we need
your mind to be able to focus we need you
to be free of of threats like serious threats in
life if your life is in threat right now let's
say you're living in the inner city and there's a
you know gangs around you that are going around shooting
people and you're involved with drugs and stuff like spiritual
alignment is not for you get yourself out of that
situation first find yourself a calm place in your life
where you can actually sit down and do the work
where your mind can focus well you don't have too
many distractions because there's a lot of focused work that
needs to be done here and if you can't do
it then you're not going to be able to do
it and what's going to happen you're going to suffer
even more because you're gonna be trying so hard to
get enlightened but you're not going to be in a
place where you can get enlightened right so it's kind
of like if if you were in first grade right
now and then I told you about calculus there's this
cool thing called calculus you can do all this amazing
stuff with calculus but you're in the first grade you're
not ready for calculus go ahead and learn arithmetic learn
your multiplication tables go ahead into middle school in high
school and start learning algebra and start learning geometry and
start learning trigonometry and start learning more advanced mathematics start
learning how to graph and plot and how how to
do functions and all this advanced pretty advanced math and
then when you're in freshman year in college then you
can start learning calculus so you have to peg yourself
where are you are you in first grade right now
are you in fifth grade are you in 10th grade
are you a college level now if you're a college
level then maybe this journey is for you so handle
the basics first there's really two extremes here that you
could undertake to extreme action paths one is basically to
quit everything in your life and go pursue spiritual enlightenment
100% some people have done it this way this is
how the Buddha supposedly did it but I don't recommend
this path this is an extreme path because you will
likely quit and then go back into an even worse
place than where you started from so this is not
recommended the other extreme path is that you say okay
[ __ ] all this this is all nonsense all
philosophy [ __ ] let me just go back to
my normal life and what you do is you go
back to your normal life and you completely forget about
everything we talked about here you forget about spiritual enlightenment
you throw it all away and you just go back
to sleep right now you're living a life of sleep
you're asleep but after you watch this spiritual alignment video
what happened is that you were woken up just for
a brief second for a brief second your eyes opened
and you saw a new possibility your eyes open now
it needs to happen is that a lot of work
needs to happen to keep your eyes open otherwise you're
going to fall back asleep and if you fall back
asleep you might never wake up again you might never
get this opportunity again because when you saw my spiritual
I'm in video chances are that it was just an
accident you weren't looking for it just one day you
clicked on a button somewhere you saw the video you
you watch through it all and then all of a
sudden something hit you and you woke up that might
be a once in a lifetime chance so don't go
back to sleep and don't do nothing at all instead
what you should do is what I recommend here and
here's my action plan for you it's called the middle
path the middle path looks like this one don't make
any really big changes in your life you don't need
to it's not necessary external action isn't what produces enlightenment
living on a deserted island by yourself doesn't produce enlightenment
nor does meditating in a cave or on a mountaintop
or in the desert or anywhere else so that's not
necessary right next I really encourage you to keep your
family together keep your obligations to your family keep loving
your family keep having fun with your family that's all
fine your career keep that in place you need a
job you need to pay the bills so keep your
career in place don't go quitting your job the gym
if you have a gym routine and you also have
a nutrition routine maybe on a certain diet you're trying
to eat healthy maintain that that's good that's going to
have it that's good that's good practice you'll need that
even after you're in line you'll want to eat healthy
and go to the gym so keep doing all that
stuff don't use this as an excuse to quit and
if you're in school or you're in college keep going
to school keep going to college because you need those
fundamentals you need the fundamentals of school in college that
will help you out later in life anyways you don't
want to be enlightened but then not understand arithmetic or
language so you know get those things under your belt
those are the very fundamental things that you need everyone
needs those also I recommend that you keep doing self-help
you might wonder well Leo self-help if there's no self
why the hell should I do self help it seems
like a hoax no it's not as much of a
hoax as you think in the end when you get
to the highest highest levels self help will change for
you your relationship to self help will change but you
know what right now I still do self help after
I came into contact with this truth of spiritual enlightenment
which was probably two years ago at this point it's
not like I quit everything I still kept doing self-help
it's fact I started actualised org during this interim period
and I didn't just do it so that I could
you know pay my bills I did it because I
believed in it and because it's helpful because it's helpful
to to move you from the bottom levels to the
upper levels right so if you got money issues relationship
issues if you're chronically depressed if you've got panic attacks
if you've got fits of anger if you're not able
to maintain decent relationships with people at work these are
all issues that are so fundamental you got to fix
these things they'll help you in your quest toward spiritual
enlightenment in fact if anything I would say take your
time energy away from some of the material external things
that you do and start to focus them on self-help
the more self-help you do the more you're gonna actually
get convinced of the benefits of spiritual enlightenment and the
fact that it's the right path for you because honestly
if I just take someone off the street who doesn't
know anything about self-help and I tell them how spiritual
enlightenment they're gonna think I'm crazy and they're not going
to even understand the benefits of doing this this journey
but someone who's been doing self-help for a long time
if you've been doing self-help for 10 years 20 years
and I tell you about spiritual I mean you're probably
going to have some things click in your mind it's
gonna be like oh now I get it now I
get all this stuff now I get why I struggled
here and why my relationships have this problem and why
I'm negative sometimes and what lack of consciousness means and
I understand what the spiritual books now mean and I
understand why I was meditating all this time so all
the stuff starts to come into play you know kind
of click into place for you and that's good you
want that foundation so keep doing that the other thing
I really recommend for you as part of this mental
path is to start doing daily meditation I've got a
great video called how to meditate that will teach you
how to set up a meditation practice it's very simple
but as part of your foundation for doing spiritual I'm
at work you need to start meditating that's going to
help you it's not going to be the only solution
but it's going to be a really nice foundation because
we need to build your ability to focus you need
to be able to focus you need to be able
to go into your mind objectively and see what's going
on in there which means you have to practice mindfulness
so if you're practicing mindfulness outside of meditation that's great
keep doing that and if you're practicing mindfulness right there
in meditation also that's very good so start that habit
also what you're going to do is once I start
releasing some videos that teach you how to actually start
taking the steps and the practical action steps for doing
this enlightenment work is you should dedicate up half an
hour a day or an hour a day how much
you can manage to doing this enlightenment work it doesn't
have to be a lot at first it can just
be 20 minutes it can just be 30 minutes or
60 minutes II don't really need more than 60 minutes
a day that's enough so just to put this into
perspective you know 60 minutes all of you have an
extra 60 minutes lying around you do this just means
watch little less TV spend a little less time partying
and drinking with your friends it's been a little less
time on the internet posting stupid comments or whatever it
is that you do that's a waste of time so
some people ask me sometimes well leo does this mean
that now I don't have enough time in my schedule
to do enlightenment because I've got a family and all
this stuff to do no you still got time most
people have time there is one thing that you do
need to stop and this is very important right here
what you need to stop is you need to stop
the following stop chasing success stop chasing Fame stop chasing
money stop chasing sex and stop chasing love and in
general stop chasing bodily pleasures stop chasing this stuff stop
distracting your stuff yourself with this stuff all of these
things success recognition fame money sex love pleasure these are
all distractions of the ego and they fill up your
time and they fill up your schedule with crap really
really quickly I noticed this in myself it's very easy
to make yourself busy when you have all this chasing
that you do in your life you're chasing your tail
so really the only thing you should be taking away
from this video about enlightenment is that if anything all
you need to do is you need to get rid
of a little bit of the distractions in your life
just get rid of those and everything will be fine
you'll create the room that you need you'll find that
this is healthy for you even if you don't do
enlightenment just get rid of the distractions just cut back
on the TV internet some of those addictions that you
have that kind of stuff stop chasing for women stop
chasing for men stop looking for love everywhere it's okay
you don't need those crutches and I'm not saying that
you should never pursue money or you should never go
after fame I'm just saying hold yourself back a bit
because what the ego does it's like oh I need
it I need I need I need you're like a
little kid who wants a toy in the in a
toy store and he keeps masking his mom for this
toy when he doesn't really need this toy he's got
a hundred other toys but he just wants this toy
because it's the new flashy toy so don't be that
don't be lured in by distractions of the ego and
basically and this is what I said in my time
management video if you watch that one you stop doing
stupid [ __ ] stop doing stupid [ __ ]
in your life but keep the healthy good stuff going
and you're going to be right where you need to
be and now as far as this thing about you
know being depressed they all Leone depressed now look you're
going to be depressed for about a week or two
when I first heard about this truth I was depressed
for about a week but then you know what happens
you come back you come back life becomes exciting again
everything's cool everything's fine in fact what the the biggest
danger is not that you're going to stay depressed you're
not going to say depressed what's going to happen that
your ego is going to kick back in in overdrive
and about a week or two after what's going to
happen is something like this you're going to be sitting
there kind of depressed and you're going to be like
oh man my life has been a lie all this
kind of nonsense and then something's gonna click in you
and your ego is gonna fight back and it's gonna
say you know what [ __ ] that leo [
__ ] that Leon his enlightenment [ __ ] I'm
gonna go out there I'm gonna live a happy life
for myself [ __ ] all this nonsense I'm gonna
go out there and do everything I plan to do
in fact I'm gonna do even bigger than I plan
to do I'll show him I'm gonna go make all
this money I'm going to get all the girls I'm
gonna get myself a beautiful house and a beautiful marriage
and I'm gonna beautiful kids and then I'm gonna be
so happy I'm gonna I'm gonna show them ten years
later I'm gonna show them how happy I am and
all this [ __ ] nonsense we'll see whose life
is better mine or his ten years from now see
your ego is going to kick in like that and
what's going to happen is you can have this over
reaction what's gonna happen you're going to turn your back
on enlightenment and you're going to go chasing your tail
you're going to be more motivated than ever you're gonna
be chasing your tail because it's gonna feel very good
why is it going to feel very good you're going
to feel very significant because right now you feel very
empty very significant and that that difference is going to
feel like a kid of stimulations gonna be a drug
for you because you're addicted to stimulation so you need
that fulfillment you need that sense of significance it's a
drug for you you're hooked on it so you know
go ahead and do that if you want and then
what's going to happen is that you're going to waste
a couple of years of your life chasing your tail
and you're going to maybe get that life or that
husband or that money or like that sexy girlfriend or
that beautiful house or whatever and you're going to find
that it doesn't make you as happy as you thought
it was gonna make you and after a while of
that and doing personal development work what you're going to
discover is like [ __ ] it's not working [
__ ] it's not what it's really not why is
it not working I can understand why it's not working
and then you're maybe you're going to waste five or
ten years of your life doing this and then maybe
maybe you'll scratch your head you'll say oh wait I
remember that thing about enlightenment huh I'm going to come
back to that I'm going to take a look at
that now I've kind of exhausted my thirst for all
these titillations of of the material material world why don't
I go take another look at enlightenment and maybe you'll
come back but see that's dangerous because you're not guarantee
they're going to come back most people that have this
overreaction what they do is they forget about enlightenment completely
and so they go back to sleep and they never
recover they never come back so just be careful about
that smile you think right now this is depressing that
this truth of no self that there is no self
that this is depressing this is not depressing this is
beautiful this is awesome your ego thinks it's depressing because
it means bad news for the ego but it means
good news for the true self that is you that
you've never been in contact before you're going to discover
your true self take in the full ramifications of what
you were told in that original alignment video what did
I tell you I basically promised you eternal happiness eternal
peace of mind and immortality that's what you were promised
and now you're depressed you're depressed by this no what's
depressing is the life that you live now your ego
Excel fush life that's what's depressing have you even thought
through the ramifications of how you're living your life you
do understand you're going to die right under your models
of reality you're going to die you understand this and
that's not going to take that long you've got another
20 30 40 50 years at most and then you
gonna be dead you understand this you're going to die
a miserable and painful death you understand this that's depressing
that's sad what I'm telling you is not sad what
I'm telling you is that you can be eternally happy
in your life you can be living in heaven in
paradise right here right now you don't need any mystical
nonsense to do it all you need to do is
undertake this investigation into enlightenment and you will become immortal
you understand this there is no self that means that
no self cannot die if there is no self who's
going to die no one's going to die so that's
a pretty cool thing what you've discovered here by watching
these videos inadvertently is you've discovered the Holy Grail literally
the Holy Grail you've discovered it except what you've actually
discovered is not the Grail itself but a map to
the Grail I've given you a map to the Grail
now the question is are you going to go and
discover the Grail or are you going to get buttered
and depressed and say oh man that Grails on top
of a mountain I have to go climb a mountain
to find the Grail [ __ ] that that's depressing
the Grail is here it's in your sight be happy
about that life is beautiful life is amazing life is
passionate life is peaceful life is happy all this stuff
is true and it's there for you to discover right
now you don't really understand any of that your current
life is none of those things if you think that
your life is beautiful and peaceful and happy right now
you're lying to yourself it's not stop lying to yourself
your life can become that if you do the work
