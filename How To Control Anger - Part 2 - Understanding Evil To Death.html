hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about how to control
anger part two controlling anger with holistic understanding it's been
a few years since I shot the how to control
anger part 1 episode you can go back and watch
it but I've grown a lot in these intervening two
years or so since I shot that and I have
deeper insights about anger that I want to share with
you that episode was very confrontational and provocative I wanted
to actually provoke you so some people like that some
people hated that about that episode here I'm going to
take a more compassionate approach and I'm going to share
a new facet of how to understand anger and what
it's really about so first let's acknowledge that there are
great degrees on the spectrum of anger everything from rage
full-blown rage to just mild annoyance and everything that comes
in between and the mild annoyance version of anger is
actually probably the most significant to you uh if you're
actually doing a lot of personal development work you probably
don't have full-blown rage that often although maybe you do
ah but what you have a lot more of is
just these mild annoyances which are still very significant and
you might not be aware of those because a lot
of those are so subtle that it just takes a
lot of mindfulness and awareness development already to start to
notice how they affect how you feel and how you
behave in your life there's also anger that is what
I would call hardwired this is the kind of anger
that comes from early childhood traumas like if you were
abused or beaten or sexually molested this sort of stuff
and you develop this deep bitterness inside of you now
that's a slightly different issue I'm not focused on fixing
that in you here that requires a deeper kind of
work and that I might talk about in the future
alright so here I'm talking about more normal Monday influences
of anger so here's the perspective that I want to
share with you about anger and now this is not
going to be a complete description of anger this is
not a comprehensive episode this is just one perspective on
one way to deal with anger and to see where
it comes from so the perspective is is that anger
comes from a lack of holistic understanding that's the gist
of it and my claim here believe it or not
is that if you understand a situation or reality holistically
and existentially that you can't get angry at it this
might be situations out in the world or might be
other people those are really the two things that you
get angry at right situations and people maybe also yourself
maybe you can angry at yourself so if you understand
yourself holistically the world holistically and other people holistically then
you won't get angry at them that's my claim now
that might seem a little far-fetched and idealistic so we
got to go in and actually talk about what I
mean by this thing called holistic understanding and why it
is the case that this is the solution to anger
but before we get into that I'll give you a
lot of examples of how this works exactly I just
want to highlight that this is one of the reasons
why I stress holism in my work a lot of
the stuff I talked about tries to push you towards
holism and also radical open-mindedness why is that because this
is necessary right to be at peace in the world
you have to understand how the world really works at
deep levels that most people don't understand it at and
then when I see people resistant to developing their understanding
for example when I tell people to go read books
or to go you know pursue some sort of hard
work to actually develop the understanding they come up with
all these excuses like oh well that's not important that's
not important that's just seeking that's more seeking know that
is true development that's true growth and that's important it's
important that you develop this holistic understanding and this holistic
understanding will not just come to you with enlightenment alone
because there's a lot of other facets of the world
you need to understand if you want to not be
angry at it so okay let's talk about why holism
is important so what's holism got to do with anger
here's the gist of the fundamentals of how this works
so first what you do is you create a partition
with in reality this partition is called you this is
a virtual partition you've created it now what you do
is you convince yourself that this partition is the thing
that must be defended it's the thing that's absolutely true
and now what happens is that you're attached to defending
this partition and as point of view that you have
of reality but then inevitably because everyone else is doing
the same thing they're also creating their own private partitions
within reality your partition at some point gets encroached upon
by another partition or by reality at large and what
this leads to is you feeling injustice and a sense
of violation because it feels like your little partition your
little territory has been encroached upon so of course you
feel violated and from that comes this sense of outrage
and anger that you have you see and what this
really is about is a failure to recognize the larger
meta mechanism which is these partitions that are being created
by yourself by other people and this insistence that your
partition in your territory is somehow sacred this then leads
to outrage because of course your partition is going to
get violated because reality if you take a look at
reality holistically right everyone's doing their own little thing but
all of it is just a little aspect a little
fragment of a larger um dance or recital right there's
something larger going on here in reality than just your
private little universe and a failure to understand these larger
mechanisms of how these larger systems work I mean you're
part of many large systems you're part of the social
system you're part of the cultural system you might be
part of a corporate corporate system you might be part
of the species system with the entire species up to
you might be part of the family system you know
what family up - and how does that system work
you might be part of your marriage system you might
be part of a certain gender or a certain race
and that's a system in a sense and so failure
to understand these systems at holistic levels then leads to
you getting angry because it feels like you're being violated
see so bring to mind right now some of the
stuff you typically get angry at maybe politics religion corporations
terrorists other kinds of evil whatever that might be corruption
abuse your family situation maybe you feel like something's not
fair their relationships maybe you got some unfairness in your
relationship that you're angry at other genders maybe you're you're
angry at men or you're angry at women or other
races maybe you're angry at some race because you feel
like they're treating you unfairly they're treating your race unfairly
or maybe you're angry at war you know why why
do why do humans have war and and kill each
other and all this violence and now you're angry at
that well what I would suggest to you is the
reason you're angry at any one of these things is
because you're trying to look at the situation from your
limited point of view from your small little partition and
it feels like you're getting violated of course because reality
is a much larger thing than just you and so
you have to learn how to accommodate reality rather than
reality accommodating itself - you see that would be a
rather arrogant position to think that my little partition my
little turf has to be sacred and never encroached upon
by the larger hole see and failure to accept that
is what leads to a lot of anger and what
I see people doing is that they get stuck in
their little point of view and they refuse to go
outside their point of view to look at other perspectives
that are out there and to develop a sort of
metaphor a holistic understanding as I would call it and
then because of that they remain petty small and bitter
throughout their whole life and they don't really understand what's
going on and also they're not able to be effective
to be effective you need holistic thinking you need to
see how all these systems interplay and work together because
if you're bitter about corporations or about other genders or
about other races or about how Wars work or you're
bitter towards other countries or other nationalities or you're bitter
at someone in a relationship or in your family you're
not going to be resourceful enough to actually go in
there and work the problem out you're just going to
stew in your bitterness and that comes from clinging to
your point of view so this idea of holism open-mindedness
radical open-mindedness as I refer to it seeking understanding changing
perspectives this is all extremely important if you want to
be highly effective in the world and also if you
want to be peace at peace in the world right
how you going to be at peace when all these
complex systems that you don't understand are encroaching upon your
little turf it's not going to happen so how does
understanding cure anger it works like this when you really
understand a situation when you really understand reality existentially at
very deep levels you stop shooting upon reality you stop
shooting upon yourself you stop moralizing I've talked about this
before this is very important to be angry you need
to have certain rules and should statements that you make
that you put up like standards that you establish like
people shouldn't get killed and politicians shouldn't be corrupt and
my family shouldn't fight with each other and my marriage
should be smooth and peachy and women and men should
treat each other better and there shouldn't be abuse and
religion shouldn't exist and so all this should not and
should be this way or that way right and when
you create all these shoulds again what you're doing is
you're you're insisting on your point of view and you're
not seeing and not allowing reality to be exactly how
it is when you see why reality functions has it
does what that creates is just acceptance you accept and
you realize like oh it's inevitable it actually couldn't be
any other way than it is and then that produces
peace see now again this might sound idealistic to you
I know that if I was told this five years
ago without a lot of the work that I've done
a lot of the research that I've done it would
have seemed like oh yeah I mean that sounds good
on paper but what about when the rubber hits the
road so let's take a look at some examples because
I want to show you that this is more than
just idealism or theory or philosophy right this is something
that I intend for you to implement in your life
in the way that I am and this really will
give you pete's so let's take a look at some
examples so let's say that you get mad or angry
at corruption in general maybe you're disgusted by all the
money and politics so corrupt these politicians are so corrupt
and maybe at the dinner table you come home you
know you watch some news and then you hear about
some corrupt politicians and you come home to your dinner
table and you start talking about how damn those politicians
you know we voted for for the right politicians but
they're still corrupt and so that pisses you off so
in that situation what I'm telling you is that there's
something larger that you're not understanding so your point of
view is that I should be able to go vote
for a politician and then he should be unimpeachable he
should be perfect and spotless and just do the good
work of the government and fight for my interests without
getting corrupted by government you know special interests or corporate
money ok that's your perspective that's your little turf that
you've carved out for yourself right that's what you need
that's your self agenda at work that's what you want
and you treat it as though that's what the whole
world won and what the whole universe was but that's
not the case so in this case if you look
deeper and you ask yourself what am i failing to
understand here could I take a larger more holistic meta
perspective you will discover that actually you can study why
corruption exists what is corruption where does corruption come from
isn't that interests as an interesting question to ponder why
does corruption exist at all why do people become corrupt
is it possible that there's corruption inside of me as
well could it be that the same mechanisms that are
running those corrupt politicians are the exam exact same psychological
mechanisms that I find in myself but that I like
to hide and deny could that be true and when
you start to investigate all that and you realize what
corruption really is and why it happens uh you can
no longer be angry at it that's my claim and
if you still insist on being angry at it what
I would suggest to you is that you haven't developed
a holistic enough understanding of it yet go study corruption
more go really understand the root causes of it and
why it exists and if you do that deeply enough
at some point you will just find it impossible to
be angry at corruption how about the example of lying
maybe the thing that really rubs you the wrong way
is when people lie to you it's like how could
that person lie to me maybe like your kids have
lied to you about taking drugs or something and then
you get pissed off at them understandable but also realize
that again you're looking at the situation from your point
of view how about stepping into the other person's shoes
and seeing it from their perspective how about trying to
get a holistic understanding of the whole structure of lying
and why lying exists why do people lie hmm that's
an interesting question maybe contemplate that for a bit maybe
study it maybe go read some books about it and
maybe start to realize that hey you know I get
angry at people lying but how much line do I
do myself this lying mechanism is a large larger mechanism
then we like to tell ourselves and these lies can
be sneaky a lot of times I lied to myself
and I don't even realize that I lied to myself
until until years later same and so what happens that
when you start to really understand how lying works and
why people lie rather than defending your little perspective of
course from your little perspective you want no one to
ever lie to you of course that serves you of
course you want that that's the easiest thing in the
world to want what's really emotionally challenging is to say
wait a minute let me open it up here and
see the larger mechanism why is everybody lying why is
that exists could lying serve a useful function in the
world why is lying a part of reality is it
because God is evil is it because of the devil
or is it just a structural component is it part
of something larger the larger design could I study that
larger design and see why it really functions that way
and my claim is that if you do that you
will stop being angry with lying not just lying in
general but lying specifically in the sense that your child
might come to you and lie to you about something
very important and while you might not like that lie
I'm not saying you're going to like it but you
will perhaps have such deep understanding of lying that you
will understand why it was there and when you understand
the why of it and when you stop shooting on
the situation and saying no nobody should ever lie then
what is there to be angry about try it same
thing with the relationship or family problems maybe you have
a problem with some relationship of yours intimate relationship maybe
your boss is an [ __ ] or whatever doesn't
treat you fairly and your angry at that well again
I would challenge you to look at it deeper from
beyond your own perspective and ask yourself what is relationship
why do relationships work the way they work or if
you feel a sense of injustice about your boss not
treating you fairly because he promised you arrays but then
didn't give it to you for example take a look
into that what is the larger dynamic happening there what
is business why does business work the way that it
works why is there unfairness and injustice in business and
if you really study that and you start to look
at it and really investigate the existential roots of injustice
of business of relationships you will stop being angered by
those things same thing with war same thing with religious
fanaticism same thing with rape you know a lot of
times when I share these larger higher consciousness principles with
you like here in this episode the principle is that
holistic understanding basically nullifies anger to people who haven't been
doing the work haven't been meditating haven't been doing consciousness
work haven't been doing years of personal development that can
be a difficult thing to swallow it sounds just like
sort of like a new-age wishful positive-thinking concept right and
then of course they come up with all sorts of
radical examples to challenge me and they say stuff like
well Leah what about rape I mean are you saying
that rape is good is that what you're saying here
is it really possible that by holistically understanding rape that
one who is raped would stop being angry at it
and actually that's exactly what happens with victims of rape
so if someone is a victim of rape my heart
goes out to you that's a terrible thing but also
if you want to get over that situation psychologically what's
going to have to happen first you're probably going to
be really pissed off for many years then you're going
to realize that being pissed off doesn't serve you and
it doesn't really serve the person who victimized you either
it doesn't do good for either of you so then
what you kind of go through this kind of forgiveness
process you start to forgive and as part of the
forgiveness process then you start to understand and then what
happens that you can actually develop compassion for the person
who victimized you in the sense that you start to
develop an understanding of why rape happens see when you
think of rape just from your little point of view
it feels like oh I've been violated and that was
horrendous the worst crime possible okay yeah from your point
of view that's exactly how it looks but look at
it from the larger systems holistic point of view and
you start to realize like hey you know that rapist
probably had abusive parents and maybe if you bother to
go talk to the rapist and I'm not saying that
you should do this but I'm just saying that if
you did in theory go talk to that rapist and
really learn about his history and all the [ __
] up [ __ ] that happened to him in
his childhood that led him to being this rapist you
would probably have sympathy for what he went through see
and now you might say well Leo what if there
was a rapist who didn't go through any bad stuff
well nevertheless when you investigate right when you investigate why
people do the things they do you ultimately learn that
it comes from ignorance you see evil actions come from
ignorance and when you understand that ignorant is such a
deep and powerful force and so difficult to correct not
only in others but in yourself when you really experience
how much ignorance is within you and when you really
try to go inside yourself and correct the ignorance and
you fail over and over and over again for years
and you really struggle through that ignorance that's when you'll
understand why people do stupid and evil thing is because
they also have that ignorance in them and many of
them are so ignorant they don't even realize that their
problem is ignorance yet might take them a decade to
get to that point see and when you start to
understand that it doesn't make the other person's evil actions
correct but it takes the edge off them and it
allows you to accept because you're now seeing the world
from more than just your little point of view and
that's exactly what's necessary to eliminate anger I'll give you
one last example and this is a minor one right
because I talk I talked about some big issues here
you know rape war religious fanaticism lying and corruption you
know these are big things to get angry about but
I also want to point out to you that there
are many little things that you get angry and annoyed
on throughout your day that happened every single week with
you so this could be stuff like someone steals your
parking spot and that makes you angry minor thing you're
right you're not in some full-blown rage over it hopefully
just a little annoyed by it or maybe your upstairs
neighbors making noises and you can't fall asleep on time
and then you don't get into a total rage about
it but it annoys you or maybe your spouse does
something that annoys you like they're they pick their teeth
or you know they scratch their nuts in public or
something like that just a little thing that annoys you
again apply what I'm talking about here this is a
very general principle you can apply this principle to stuff
like rape and war and terrorism or you can apply
this principle to very minor things so the example I
wanted to give you is just last summer I was
experimenting with meditating outside usually I meditate indoors but I
was meditating outside and I was really getting into it
it was at 115 degrees here in Las Vegas in
the summer but I was sitting under the tree in
the shade on my lawn chair and just meditating for
like 3 hours a day and I would do that
and I was sitting there meditating and I was kind
of in this higher conscious this zone state and then
I hear a bird off in the distance and he's
kind of squawking this annoying manner and I just I
feel myself getting annoyed and a little bit angry at
that just a little bit it's very subtle usually I
wouldn't even notice that if I wasn't sitting there meditating
for a few hours so I noticed it but then
also what happens is that something clicks in me and
I realize oh I am the bird there is no
separation between me and bird or the sound that the
bird made that literally is me and of course you
can't be angry at that point and so it just
becomes a non-issue now that right there that example right
there might not even make sense to you what I
even said here likely oh you and the bird how
can you be a bird that sounds silly this sounds
like you just you're just you know deluding yourself with
fantasies and then and you're using this as some sort
of technique to eliminate anger and then that's what you
want me to do know um what I'm sharing with
you here is actually a very advanced example you might
need to do consciousness work for five years to get
to the point where you can appreciate what this example
is actually demonstrating right this example is a very advanced
example because literally what's happening in this example is that
the mind is understanding and becoming conscious of the arbitrariness
of these partitions that are created and the most fundamental
partition you create is between self and other or self
in world and if you can ever erase that partition
between self and other or self in world that is
not just some positive thinking fantasy that goes way beyond
belief you're at the very very existential level there and
when you do that what pours forth from you is
love and you have incredible amounts of acceptance for everything
so when you can look into the eyes of a
rapist and realize that that rapist is literally you if
you can ever get your consciousness to that state um
you will weep with tears of joy and love that's
what will happen to you um that's how deep this
stuff can go now you probably can't do that right
now you can't fake it what I'm talking about here
at this very existential level it has to be real
you have to be fully conscious of it you can't
fake it and I'm not saying that I'm perfect at
this and that I can do it every single day
I certainly can't and I certainly have my frustrations every
day and I certainly haven't get angry at stuff sometimes
a little bit um not it's like some full-blown rage
but you know get annoyed by stuff all the time
so um I'm just trying to show you what's possible
this is your potential you can work towards this so
if you've been an anger prone person for your whole
life um that's just how it was but I want
you to see that if you really commit yourself and
you do this work and you stick with me and
you learn all the different concepts and you go and
apply it and you really want to you can reach
this state where um [ __ ] that you thought
would annoy you um indefinitely you can actually convert that
and transmute that into love that's what's possible but for
now just start with the basic stuff now let me
answer a few objections one objection is Vallejo uh you
know is an outrage justified and useful so it sounds
like what you're doing here is you're kind of like
taking my outrage away and then what am I going
to do am I going to be as effective in
the world this is a paradoxical point you will find
that if you take your outrage away you will actually
become more effective you don't really need it it might
seem to you like being outraged then kind of creates
certain motivation for you to go out there and solve
a certain problem maybe you've experienced this where you get
pissed off at something and then you really go and
get to work and you solve the problem I've experienced
that before um that certainly can happen anger can be
motivating but there's something greater that can motivate you right
there's different qualities of motivation and big part of personal
development is purifying the quality of motivation that really fuels
you so the people that think that outrage is somehow
important and that if they lose it they're going to
lose something valuable know what you'll find is you're going
to gain something much better than that and also the
new motivation that you do gain it's going to be
more love based more positive base than negative base it's
also going to feel a lot better it's not going
to stress you out it's not going to cause health
problems for you years down the road you know because
angry people tend to be stressed all the time and
then that leads to heart attacks and all sorts of
physical health ailments another objection people might have is nobly
oh I won't understanding lead to harboring of evil if
I understand evil isn't there a danger that then I
accept evil and then evil runs rampant through the world
I mean if if nobody is out there in the
world fighting evil that is in the world just going
to be full of evil this is another very paradoxical
point being angry added fighting evil and saying that evil
should not be is actually the same mechanism that creates
evil you are not going to stop evil by fighting
evil the way you stop evil is by accepting it
to death so will understanding lead to understanding of evil
yes it will you will actually stop seeing evil as
evil now for a lot of people this is threatening
because they developed this whole identity about fighting evil from
their point of view things look evil because they're so
locked into their point of view if you take the
biggest most holistic most existential perspective evil does not exist
what you call evil is just another form of one
unified reality doesn't happen to serve you which is why
you feel it's evil but that's another matter that's how
it looks from your point of view but your point
of view is just one out of infinite number of
points points of view in within reality right there's no
reason to demand that your point of view be the
the dominant one and if you live your life that
way you will suffer a lot for it and the
best way to stop evil is to actually accept it
so much that you're not triggered by it and that
you're at peace whether evil stuff is happening to you
or not and when you can do that you can
literally understand evil to death and then when you act
from that place of understanding of evil to death um
evil around you tends to melt away not always people
can still do evil [ __ ] to you but
it tends to melt away and you tend to develop
this extraordinary capacity to radiate love and to radiate happiness
in a way that people find it difficult to even
do evil to you although they still can right it's
not a not a foolproof method another objection might be
only oh yeah sure you're talking about this now here
standing here theoretically this all sounds good it's easy for
you to say all this stuff like you know loving
a rapist or something like that but what happens when
you're put in this tough situation you know what happens
if you lose your child or what happens when someone
steals some money from you or whatever um will you
actually be able to follow through on this I'm not
claiming that I'm capable of following through on it at
all times I'm putting this out there as an ideal
as a potential for you to work towards that's what
personal velvet is about is something I'm certainly working towards
my own life and in the last year I've developed
a lot of deeper understanding um and its really helped
me with the little annoyances I don't get huge anger
outrages but the little annoyances I do get and I
find myself a lot more accepting a lot more loving
of them now that I was just a year or
two ago so this objection at all leo you know
you just love a cushy life and it's so easy
for you to just talk about this stuff um you
know I've had some some evil [ __ ] happen
to me and I'm like um a few years ago
AB is a former business partner of mine stole 25
thousand dollars from me I have to go sue him
in court in another country I actually published the episode
about that a long time ago I won the court
case I won the court case and still four years
later I still don't have the money and I've had
to you know work to accept all that that was
challenging for me to do so you know some stuff
sometimes I do experience like in justices that I perceive
as in justices but also I understand that the injustice
that I perceive is only valid from my little point
of view within my partition and I understand why my
partition gets encroached upon because it's part of a larger
system where encroachment happens the deepest thing for you to
realize in all this work is that reality is absolutely
free that's what reality is is it's infinite degrees of
freedom to really grasp that not just as an intellectual
understanding but to really see it to experience it to
to grasp it directly with your consciousness that's a huge
breakthrough in this work and you start to realize that
your only job in this world is really to make
peace with reality and that a lot of what you've
been doing your whole life is resisting reality and making
peace with reality is a lot tougher than most people
think because the truth is an acquired taste you think
you like the truth you think you like reality no
the real test of whether you can stomach truth and
reality is when the [ __ ] hits the fan
and something evil happens to you that's the real test
because at that point yourself agenda and your ego get
most activated and what you have to do is you
have to have enough consciousness to let go of that
and to realize that you're just one little speck of
dust in the cosmos and that you have no right
to outrage see and to do that this is not
something you can fake this is something that you have
to develop your way to it requires spiritual purification work
it requires deep holistic understanding and that's something you can
work towards to understand evil to death not as a
belief but to actually to see it to penetrate it
with your mind so that's the theory now here's the
practice what do you do about all this how do
you actually implement this well first I'll give you a
very simple little technique that you can use so basically
the next time that you're angry I want you to
stop and to consider the other perspective the perspective that
you're ignoring I want you to really understand that you
have to be locked into a perspective to maintain anger
and you have to not be seeing the big picture
so here you're going to stop and you're going to
really look at the big picture what's the big picture
here that you haven't been seeing and the key question
you want to ask yourself is what am i failing
to understand no matter what it is so if you
get cut off in traffic ask yourself what am i
failing to understand there someone steals your parking spot what
am i failing to understand there if someone steals some
some money from you what am i failing to understand
there if your partner cheats on you and your relationship
what am i failing to understand there that requires you
taking a lot of responsibility and then force yourself to
dig deeper and understand the situation to such a deep
degree that you finally hits acceptance that's what will happen
and if you're telling yourself all you know I've dug
into it but I'm still angry what I'm gonna tell
you is that dig deeper because you haven't dug deeply
enough dig until you hit acceptance and you might not
succeed in every situation this is just something for you
to practicing and just notice how you feel even one
successful implementation of this will show you the results and
maybe you'll develop a taste for acceptance and for peace
rather than for being agitated all the time and pay
attention to the minor stuff practicing this on the big
stuff is going to be much harder and also you
have to wait a long time maybe to get a
big outrage going in your life but the little stuff
you can find every single day you get annoyed by
stuff all the time so find that and apply this
technique to it right and start to practice holism seek
holism in general in your life and holism now this
is a deep topic that i will have to cover
in the future I intend to cover pretty soon so
I'll talk about what holism really means and go into
a lot of depth about that which I can't do
here but that's it for now so I'm done here
