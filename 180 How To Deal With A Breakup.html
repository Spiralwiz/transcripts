            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/1MWR29_X4WE' target='_blank'>How To Deal With A Breakup</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Dealing with a Breakup</b>: Gura talks about his personal experience with a breakup, stating that he felt awful and miserable after it occurred, especially when he saw his ex-girlfriend change her relationship status on Facebook shortly after. He admits that he believed if he'd just done something differently, the relationship would have been saved. 
</li><li><b>The Importance of Personal Development</b>: The breakup was a significant reason that Gura started learning about personal development, including understanding female psychology and attraction. He perceived the breakup as an opportunity for transformation, which is something he believes other people can also do when experiencing a painful breakup.
</li><li><b>Weaknesses and Learning Opportunities</b>: Gura emphasizes that breakups often happen due to unresolved weaknesses and the need for learning about relationships and the opposite sex. He encourages viewing a breakup as a journey to personal growth rather than a completely negative experience. 
</li><li><b>Recognizing Neediness</b>: Gura admits that he came across as needy in the relationship and shares his regret about not having the confidence to take things to the next level with the girl he was seeing. This naivety and neediness ultimately led to the end of the relationship. 
</li><li><b>Professional Help and Self-Improvement</b>: After his breakup, Gura sought professional help to increase his understanding of women and improve his dating skills since he realized he was insecure about himself and lacked necessary experience. He was willing to do whatever it took to improve in this area, leading him to his journey of self-improvement.
</li><li><b>Desire to Get Back Together</b>: Gura shares that even after the breakup, he still held onto the hope of reconciling with his ex-girlfriend. His heartache significantly increased when he discovered through Facebook that she was in a new relationship. Despite this, he resolved to focus on improving himself, whether he got his ex-girlfriend back or not.
</li><li><b>Leo's decision to improve his attraction skills with girls</b>: During his personal journey, Leo aimed to get better with girls after a disappointing experience. He made a crucial decision to focus on personal growth and take control of his love life, whether he succeeds at getting his ex-girlfriend back or not. He braved social scenarios like nightclubs and bars to approach girls and worked on developing his attraction skills.
</li><li><b>Moving from romantic disappointments to personal growth</b>: Leo shares how his journey from feeling hurt and insecure after breakups led him to focus on personal growth, character development, confidence improvement, and understanding relationships, sexuality, dating, and attraction. This personal growth journey eventually led Leo towards life coaching and creating self-help videos.
</li><li><b>Linking heartbreak and self-improvement</b>: The emotional pain after a breakup can be utilized to instigate positive change. Leo addresses that breakups should be viewed as good occurrences as they might reveal personal weaknesses that one should focus on improving. He suggests that those dealing with breakup pain should engage in self-reflection and identify areas that require change, fostering personal growth.
</li><li><b>Taking responsibility for breakups</b>: To understand why a breakup happened, Leo advises viewers to take full responsibility and not blame the other party. It's important to identify personality flaws that contributed to the breakup, then commit to permanent improvements in those areas.
</li><li><b>Shaping personal growth through breakups</b>: Breakups present the opportunity to break away from a comfortable but stagnant life and set big goals for yourself. Leo expresses that breakups can serve as a turning point that catalyzes your life towards a new trajectory, and ultimately lead to sustainable personal growth.
</li><li><b>Learning about attraction and building a social circle</b>: Leo asserts that understanding what truly attracts the opposite sex is necessary, claiming that men might focus more on women's appearance while women can attract men through expanding their social circles. Improving attraction skills and extending social networks are both advised for developing a more enriching love life.
</li><li><b>Improving social circle by networking and dating</b>: Leo suggests improving your social circle by networking and going on dates. Being more outgoing can easily lead to more dating opportunities and relationships.
</li><li><b>Learning better relationship skills</b>: It is suggested to study and learn better relationship skills, especially in communication. Improving these areas can be achieved through self-education such as books, seminars, online classes, or even professional help from coaches and therapists.
</li><li><b>Building a better life</b>: Leo encourages the listener to create a more successful life for themselves which contributes to their overall attractiveness. Such improvements include a good career, financial stability, health and fitness, interesting hobbies, and a solid friend circle. However, the improvement should be for one's own satisfaction, not just to attract a partner.
</li><li><b>The importance of emotional stability</b>: Emotional issues such as neediness, anger, jealousy, and negativity can poison relationships. It is advised to work on these issues, which might stem from past traumas or childhood problems. Several strategies can be used to address such issues, including coaching, therapy, self-help resources, and techniques like hypnosis and NLP.
</li><li><b>Working on bad habits</b>: Leo recommends addressing unhealthy habits or addictions that may impact relationships negatively. These include overeating, smoking, and addiction to drugs, pornography, or even technology.
</li><li><b>Reframing neediness</b>: Neediness is considered repulsive in a relationship. This neediness could manifest as desperation for sex, companionship, or a stable figure in one's life. Leo stresses the importance of addressing these issues, particularly if rooted in a history of abandonment or neglect.
</li><li><b>Self-improvement is also attractive</b>: People who lead a successful, happy, and content life with interests and passions are considered attractive. To have such a lifestyle requires a focus on self-improvement, fitness, nutrition, and passion to make oneself the best possible version, which indirectly attracts a better quality partner. 
</li><li><b>Addressing neurotic emotional issues</b>: Certain neurotic emotional issues like anger, jealousy, toxicity, and depression can poison relationships. If you have these traits, it is important to handle them, which may require deep introspective work, therapies, coaching, or self-help resources. 
</li><li><b>Working on bad habits</b>: Unhealthy habits or addictions can jeopardize relationships. If you have addictions or bad habits like smoking, overeating, watching excessive television or internet, it is essential to work on these to improve your relationships.
</li><li><b>Personal Growth and Self Actualization</b>: Working on bad habits and undesirable elements of oneself should be an inherent part of personal growth and self-actualization. This is for personal benefit and not for somebody else. Introspection leads to the understanding that such personality traits cause misery which, in turn, affects relationships adversely.
</li><li><b>Hollywood Romance Illusion</b>: The concept of Hollywood romance creates an illusion of a lost special someone post break-up. It's crucial to understand that this is an optical illusion played by the mind and that the person lost wasn't exclusively special. The idea of a single soulmate is unfounded and in reality, there are numerous potential partners out there.
</li><li><b>Abundance and Options</b>: It's encouraged to cultivate an abundance mindset in terms of relationships. Feeling of losing a uniquely special person signifies a lack of abundance and options. Miles are advised to work on these issues to avoid feeling limited.
</li><li><b>Larger Vision for Life</b>: Adopt a broader vision for life post break-up. Use the situation as a catalyst for personal growth and evolution. Work on personality traits, build body fitness, deal with bad habits, childhood neediness, anger issues, and improve sexual abundance. This phase should be a trigger for developing stronger individuality in the future.
</li><li><b>No Going Back to the Ex</b>: Do not go back to your ex. This will sabotage the process of personal development and growth and send you back into your comfort zone, thereby, preventing the progress towards becoming your highest self.
</li><li><b>Sign up for Newsletters for consistent learning</b>: Leo encourages viewers to sign up for newsletters from actualized.org that offer insights, wisdoms, and strategies in various aspects of life. The newsletters aim to assist individuals in developing an accurate mental model of reality and their own psychology and to help them majorly in self-actualization.
