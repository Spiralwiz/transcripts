            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/kPZekGtwWxU' target='_blank'>How Ideology Works</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding of Ideology</b>: Ideology refers to a cohesive set of beliefs about the nature of reality coupled with a stubborn intellectual attachment to these beliefs. These belief systems tend to be normative, meaning they prescribe how things should be and the behaviours that should follow. 
</li><li><b>Misconceptions about Ideology</b>: There's a misconception that ideologies are exclusive to religious contexts. However, one can hold an ideology within a secular, rational, or scientific context. 
</li><li><b>Examples of Ideology</b>: Prominent figures such as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, and Stefan Molyneux, among others, have been shown to display ideological thinking in various degrees. 
</li><li><b>The Subtlety of Ideology</b>: Ideology comes in varying degrees and flavors, with some being exceedingly subtle. Therefore, it's essential not to dismiss someone as an ideologue just because they have ideologies. They may still have constructive ideas beneficial for growth.
</li><li><b>Idea of Non-Ideological Thinking</b>: The phrase "Don't be ideological" is a guiding principle for life. It encourages open-mindedness and provides the basis for overcoming mental obstacles. This concept is implicit, so it requires thorough elucidation to comprehend its full implications. 
</li><li><b>Effects of Ideology</b>: Ideology is seen as one of the most significant barriers to truth-seeking in various fields such as science, spirituality, and politics. It holds the potential to corrupt these areas and stunts growth. 
</li><li><b>Normativity of Ideologies</b>: All ideologies ordinarily provide prescriptions for certain behaviours, leading to norms that everyone is expected to adhere to. This characteristic contributes to the stubborn intellectual attachment associated with ideologies. 
</li><li><b>Role of Ideology</b>: The fundamental role of ideology is to provide a set of beliefs that encompasses an individual's understanding of reality. It then fuels the insistence that these beliefs should be universally accepted and the ensuing behaviours prescribed. 
</li><li><b>Highlight on Epistemology</b>: Epistemology, the theory of knowledge, involves studying how people perceive and understand reality. Contemplating ideologies contributes to understanding this because ideologies represent cohesive sets of beliefs that individuals have about reality.
</li><li><b>Ideology's addictiveness and prevalence among public figures</b>: Leo Gura examines the addictive nature of ideologies, comparing them to drugs for the mind due to their ability to provide a compelling, cohesive set of beliefs. He points out that various public figures, including intellectuals, often build successful careers peddling particular ideologies because of their addictive nature and lucrative appeal. However, he clarifies that these ideologies are often sincerely held by the proponents.
</li><li><b>Public figures' ideological beliefs aiding their success</b>: Gura states that people who disseminate ideologies often genuinely believe in them, which aids their successful propagation. He adds that public figures may even gain financial support if their ideology aligns with the interests of those in power.
</li><li><b>Exploration of diverse ideologies for self-awareness</b>: Gura discusses his interest in studying various ideologies, including neo-Nazism, atheism, conspiracy theories, among others. He views this exploration as an opportunity to understand the misuse of the human mind and reflects on his reasoning. This study helps reveal deep aspects of the individual and collective psyche.
</li><li><b>Common subjects of ideological attachment</b>: Gura lists common subjects for ideological attachments, including religion, politics, sports, morality and others. People tend to develop firm ideological views about identity, metaphysics, life and death, livelihood and power. This reveals an underlying link to ego, given the centrality of these matters to personal identity and survival.
</li><li><b>Ideology beyond serious subjects</b>: Gura mentions that even seemingly light-hearted subjects, such as video games, fitness, and diet, can become subjects of ideological attachment. He argues this occurs when individuals build identities around specific interests, leading to debates, flame wars, and closed-mindedness.
</li><li><b>Clinging to ideologies leads to problems</b>: Gura argues that the main issue with ideologies is not the content but how individuals hold their beliefs. When a person clings to an ideology and builds an identity around it, they become closed-minded and stubborn. Despite this, Gura reassures listeners that subscribing to an ideology's values doesn't automatically make one an ideologue. 
</li><li><b>Having and expressing strong opinions doesn't mean one is ideological</b>: Gura asserts there's a significant difference between the content of one's beliefs and whether one is ideological or not. An individual can possess strong beliefs or opinions without being ideological, as long as they donÂ’t become attached to those beliefs in a way that forms a central part of their identity.
</li><li><b>Alluding to ego as the root of ideologies</b>: Throughout his discourse, Gura hints that the deep commonalities of areas where people become ideological (identity, metaphysics, life and death, livelihood, power) point towards a connection to the ego. This lays out the groundwork for a deeper exploration of the function and roots of ideology.
</li><li><b>Ideological identities in various interests</b>: Leo discusses how people can build ideologies around various interests such as fitness routines, diets, and even art. He indicates that individuals create identities based on these interests, resulting in debates and closed-mindedness. 
</li><li><b>Dependence on culture and era</b>: The content people become ideological about is largely dependent on their cultural background and the era they live in. Leo suggests that people defend the aspects of culture they identify with while new developments can challenge this status quo. 
</li><li><b>Introduction of spiral dynamics</b>: Leo introduces spiral dynamics as a way to understand ideological perspectives. Different stages of development such as 'blue', 'orange', and 'green' can influence these perspectives. 
</li><li><b>Characteristics of different levels of ideology</b>: 'Blue' ideology is traditional, religious, ethnocentric, and militaristic. 'Orange' ideology is rational, scientific, materialist, and individualist, while 'green' ideology is focused on egalitarianism, social justice, and environmentalism. Each level of ideology has its own blind spots and limitations.
</li><li><b>'Yellow' ideology</b>: 'Yellow' ideology is described as a higher level of consciousness that begins to understand the general function of ideology. Leo's goal is to help people rise to this 'yellow' level of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Common attributes of ideology</b>: All ideologies are conceptual and belief-based and dependent on language. Every ideology feels true due to confirmation bias, and they all claim absolute truth for themselves. Ideologies are fundamentally arrogant, assuming they've figured out the reality and grossly underestimating its complexity.
</li><li><b>Ideologies and their impact on reality perception</b>: Leo Gura discusses how ideologies can profoundly influence perceptions of reality. Ideologies can create a rigid belief system, deterred from further inquiry due to an unwavering conviction in its truth. Ideologies lack self-awareness and openness to exploring new perspectives and experiences. These belief systems can often lead to extreme emotions such as fear, as they directly influence one's survival and lifestyle choices. 
</li><li><b>Problematic nature of ideologies</b>: Ideologies lead to suffering, often both internally and externally, due to their partial understanding of reality. This incomplete comprehension is responsible for the formation of a reality bubble, leading to a distorted worldview. Due to this, ideologies are incapable of grasping the vast intricacies of consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Ideologies as reality distorters</b>: All ideologies harbor the potential to distort reality by confusing beliefs with experience or actuality. The failure to distinguish between an individual's real situation and their ideological thoughts blurs the line between reality and fantasy. Ideologues often fail to realize that truth can never be fully captured through beliefs, models, or mathematical equations. 
</li><li><b>Close-mindedness of ideologues and its repercussions</b>: Ideology leads to a closed-minded approach, obstructing genuine inquiry and research. Preconceived answers and biases of ideologues can limit a truly open exploration of a subject. This predisposition towards a specific belief can be problematic if contradicting evidence is found as ideologues are unlikely to accept it.
</li><li><b>Ideology as a self-fulfilling prophecy</b>: Ideology tends to become an egoic identity that blends with an individual's beliefs about reality and themselves. Consequently, attacks or questions on these ideologies are often felt as personal attacks, stirring up emotions of defence and resistance. 
</li><li><b>Physical reality as a belief</b>: Our understanding of physical reality is also a belief. When presented with concepts that challenge this belief - for example, the idea that physical reality is not real - the mind immediately dismisses it, as it's too threatening to take seriously.
</li><li><b>Ideological limitations to growth</b>: Ideologies hinder growth by locking the mind into a single perspective. Progress in human development and growth lies in the capability to adopt and understand multiple perspectives, which is countered by ideological rigidity.
</li><li><b>Oversimplification and denial of reality</b>: Ideologies tend to oversimplify complex issues and disown parts of reality which might challenge or contradict their set beliefs. This results in creating a "shadow" that individuals drag around with them, affecting their attitudes and behaviors unknowingly.
</li><li><b>Intolerance and violence</b>: Ideologies can breed intolerance and even violence, especially when they target and demonize certain groups or individuals. This engagement with ideology wastes time and energy on spreading, defending, and debating these beliefs.
</li><li><b>Corruption of science</b>: Ideology can also corrupt science. High-quality science requires openness, continual questioning, and freedom from strict ideological constraints. The attachment to certain ideologies within the scientific community often slows down the pace of progress, with paradigm shifts taking decades or centuries to evolve.
</li><li><b>Tainting of truth</b>: Ideologies can also taint truths. Even when an ideology contains elements of truth, the act of ideologization can result in these truths causing more harm than good. 
</li><li><b>Maintaining self-identity and reality</b>: One of the core functions of ideology is to maintain a sense of separate self-identity and reality. The beliefs an individual holds about reality effectively forms their sense of reality, and without these, they feel lost or anchorless. 
</li><li><b>Denial of ignorance</b>: People often find it difficult to accept their own ignorance or lack of knowledge about reality. To maintain their notion of reality and self-identity, they remain attached to ideologies. Giving up on these ideologies is difficult as it requires admitting this ignorance.
</li><li><b>The deep function of ideology</b>: Leo Gura explains that the primary function of ideology is to prevent individuals from questioning reality. Ideology stops people from recognizing their connection with all of reality, including aspects that seem unpleasant. Any questioning or new experiences could cause their current reality to unravel, so ideology serves as a stabilizer, preventing this.
</li><li><b>How ideology disowns reality</b>: Ideologies enable individuals to disown certain troublesome aspects of reality that their minds can't comprehend, such as the existence of evil. People create divisions and narratives separating themselves from these aspects, thereby disowning parts of reality and themselves. For instance people might segregate themselves from "evil terrorists", thereby denying their intrinsic interconnectedness with all reality.
</li><li><b>Exposing ideologies through diverse experiences</b>: Limited life experiences restrict our perspectives, causing us to accept the ideology-induced model of reality without questioning it. Exposure to diverse experiences and perspectives, such as alternate cultures or psychedelic journeys, breaks down these limited models as they challenge our ideology-bound perspectives and understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Stopping self-reflection through ideology</b>: Ideology functions to prevent self-reflection and introspection by grounding identities in external constructs like roles, cultural attachments, and body image. Self-reflection is avoided because recognizing our true nature as empty and without these external identifiers is frightening and compared to experiencing physical death, as it dismantles our constructed identities. 
</li><li><b>Being lost without ideology</b>: With the absence of strong ideologies and presumed truths, a person might feel lost, confused, and groundless. This discomfort often leads back to the adoption of a belief system to restore a sense of certainty and reality. The profound questioning required to dismantle ideologies can lead to the realization of deeper truths, pointing to a reality that is constantly present and radically different than assumed.
</li><li><b>Formation of Ideologies through Imprinting</b>: Humans are born knowing nothing and start to construct models of reality to ensure survival. As children grow, they are imprinted with a wide array of information from parents, school, and society, without questioning its truthfulness. By the time they reach their twenties, their identity, largely shaped by societal programming, solidifies.
</li><li><b>Comfort Derived from Belonging</b>: Humans have a need to feel like they belong to a community or tribe. Whether defined by religious beliefs, scientific theories, or ethnic backgrounds, these affiliations offer a comforting sense of identity and belonging. Changes to these beliefs can make individuals feel disconnected and they may pursue new affiliations or distractions to re-establish a sense of belonging.
</li><li><b>Ideologies as Distractions</b>: Embedding oneself in an ideology consumes significant time and energy, often distracting individuals from introspection. For participants in underdeveloped societies, ideologies provide a faux life purpose, offering a sense of focus and direction that fills the void left by the unsatisfactory reality of their surroundings.
</li><li><b>Desire for Power and Survival Fuels Ideology</b>: Ideology appeals to the ego's desire for power and survival, allowing individuals to manipulate and control others. However, the comfort derived from ideology can shatter when reality stops correlating with one's beliefs, causing a crisis that may lead to questioning and potential deconstruction of their ideology.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Self-Reflection through Spreading Ideology</b>: Spreading one's ideology can act as a distraction from self-reflection and examination of one's true nature. It might feel easier and more rewarding to focus on influencing others than to face the challenging task of inspecting inwardly. Challenging one's own beliefs can bring discomfort, fear, and the feeling of solitude, but ultimately leads to personal growth. 
</li><li><b>Implications of Radicalization</b>: In underdeveloped regions, radical ideologies appease the ego's need for identity, direction, clarity, and survival. In communities where personal growth and development aren't feasible or encouraged, ideologies offer a form of purpose and belonging. 
</li><li><b>Critical Examination of Beliefs</b>: People should continually question and scrutinize their ideologies by checking for alignment between their thinking and reality. It is through this process of self-discovery that one can break out of ingrained patterns of thought and behavior. Maintaining curiosity and self-awareness of one's ideological tendencies is crucial for personal growth and liberation from ideologically scripted norms.
</li><li><b>Prevalence of ideology</b>: Leo Gura describes how an individual's lack of career prospects and infrastructure can lead them to adopt ideologies, such as becoming a jihadi, because it serves the ego's deficiency needs e.g., sense of belonging, identity, and direction.
</li><li><b>Ideology as false life purpose</b>: Some prominent intellectuals substitute dependent positions, such as writing books and giving lectures, for real life purposes. These activities serve their deficiency needs and attracts wealth and followers, reinforcing the validity of their ideology - a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
</li><li><b>The danger of power</b>: Ideology offers power, wealth, and status, features that the ego craves. This power can be used to manipulate and mobilize people, eliminating their independent thinking and making them susceptible to control. Because the ideology satisfies their core biological needs, it can be addictive.
</li><li><b>Satisfying deficit needs via ideologies</b>: Gura highlights that satisfying being needs, which relate to personal growth and fulfillment, should be considered over just satisfying deficit needs, such as survival, safety, and belonging needs, which can be easily met through ideologies.
</li><li><b>The difficulty of ideological recognition</b>: Recognizing one's alignment with an ideology, particularly for successful individuals, is described as a painful process comparable to going through an existential crisis, and therefore, often avoided by the ego.
</li><li><b>Manipulation through ideologies</b>: Ideologies can lead to the creation of personal power bases that serve survival needs and the ego's desire for power and wealth. This manipulation happens through the elimination of independent and nuanced thinking and by creating uniform, emotional mobs that are easier to control and sell to, as opposed to independently thinking, conscious individuals. 
</li><li><b>Link to politics</b>: Ideology can dramatically impact political landscapes, influencing election results and changing power dynamics through the use of manipulated mobs.
</li><li><b>The Opposite of Ideology</b>: The alternative to ideology is open-mindedness, experience, consciousness, being, and truth that isn't conceptualized or turned into a belief. It relies on actual truth, wisdom, detachment, and unconditional love. 
</li><li><b>Experience Over Ideology</b>: Leo encourages listeners to experience directly what it feels like to not be ideological, to embrace moments of simply not knowing and being present and conscious with no attachment, effectively letting go of all ideologies.
</li><li><b>Sages and Ideology</b>: High-quality spiritual teachers always try to guide their students away from ideology to facilitate awakening and consciousness, steering clear of filling students' minds with blind beliefs.
</li><li><b>Non-duality vs. Ideology</b>: Despite the common misconception, non-duality isn't an ideology. The one and only way reality is non-dual, and practitioners must achieve non-duality through consciousness, not through belief.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org as an Ideology</b>: Leo clarifies that Actualized.org is not intended to be an ideology, urging viewers to not blindly believe any content but instead verify, contemplate, read additional sources, and have personal experiences to prevent the conversion of Actualized.org teachings into an ideology.
</li><li><b>Deconstructing Ideologies</b>: Upon the discovery of having an ideology, one should question and deconstruct it. All ideologies are ultimately false, serving hidden egoic agendas and distorting parts of reality; through persistent questions about the assumptions and functions of an ideology, one would ultimately realize its falsehood.
</li><li><b>Questioning the Truth</b>: Truth can withstand questioning. By asking questions, the only part that gets discarded or threatened is falsehood. But when an identity or sense of reality is based on something untrue, then questioning can lead to the loss or change of that identity and reality.
</li><li><b>Changing someone else's Ideology</b>: It is difficult to change someone's ideology, especially if they are close-minded and unwilling to question their beliefs. Attacking their beliefs will only make them defensive and could lead to a counter-attack. However, if they are open-minded and willing to explore new perspectives, they could be introduced to new ideas through books, travel, videos, or even experiences like attending a meditation retreat.
</li><li><b>Dangers of Polarisation</b>: Current times are drastically polarising people in several domains including politics, culture, and on the internet. It is essential to see through the ideological games being played and not let them distract one from personal growth and self-reflection.
</li><li><b>Signs of Ideology</b>: An ideological person can be recognized by a certain demeanor, energy, and way of conversation. By being mindful of one's emotions and reactions during discussions or debates, one can spot an inner rise of ideological tendencies. Ideologies are often coupled with feelings of wanting to lash out, attack, blame, or the fear of being proved wrong.
</li><li><b>Homework on Examining Ideology</b>: It is worth spending time to contemplate and examine one's own ideologies. Journaling about "What is Ideology? Why does Ideology exist? How am I ideological?" can provide valuable insights into one's way of thinking. Contemplation is the key to understanding whether the things one believes are true or not.
</li><li><b>Contemplation as a resource for Personal Development</b>: Contemplation is a critical habit for personal development. Without it, the benefits from personal development exercises or resources might be minimal. A resource will be created on the forum as a mega thread of examples of ideology to help understand how ideologies are expressed today, contributing to a reality check on the ideologies one may have.
