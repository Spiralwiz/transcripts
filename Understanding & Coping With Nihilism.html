[Music] if you haven't heard already i released a second
actualized channel called actualize clips with short snippets of my
long videos make sure you go check that out subscribe
if you'd like those link down below alright now let's
get to the main topic of understanding and coping with
nihilism so here we're going to tackle really two two
strands of this problem first of all just what is
nihilism understanding it culturally historically where it came from its
meaning and then we're going to be taking a look
at what nihilism gets correct about reality what it gets
incorrect it's a mixed bag there's a lot of confusion
and misunderstanding that we're gonna address here today and then
at the very end i'm gonna you wanna make sure
you stay for the end because at the end after
we cover what nihilism is and some of its mistakes
and and proper understandings i'm going to talk about how
to actually cope with it specifically i'm going to talk
about how to deal with that spiral dynamic stage green
relativism which leads to a sense of meaninglessness in life
and how i coped with it in my youth and
i'll share some pointers very practical pointers for how you
can cope with it yourself and then get beyond it
all right so this is not just empty philosophy here
there's gonna be practical implications for all this stuff as
always with everything i talk about so what is nihilism
well nihilism is a very much misunderstood word in our
culture it's often used pejoratively in a negative way to
demonize or dismiss some set of ideas or beliefs and
that's a problem because there's something deeply true about nihilism
which we're going to explain but also there's problems with
nihilism so it's not so simple it's not so black
and white it's a gray area even most professional philosophers
don't really understand the implications of nihilism it's treated too
much as just some sort of historical artifact and no
serious philosopher tells you how to actually apply it in
your life and what you should do with it and
also what the mistakes of it are so today we're
going to clear this whole thing up all right so
the common meaning of nihilism there's sort of like a
two parts to the meaning there's like a a common
meaning and then there's a technical definition you might get
from a philosophy professor we're going to be going over
both of those but the common meaning of the word
the way it's used colloquially in our culture is to
mean something like godlessness or meaninglessness or pointlessness to life
the rejection of morality depression disillusionment negativity pessimism anarchy cynicism
skepticism belief and nothing atheism indifference destruction isolation feeling lost
even perhaps misanthropy and despair now a lot of negative
aspects to that and that's actually one of the problems
that our culture has with the word nihilism is that
they tend to use it very pejoratively and negatively and
we'll be looking at why that is there's there's some
very deep psychological reasons for that here are some dictionary
definitions of nihilism to get us started in the right
direction the first definition i found is the rejection of
all religious and moral principles in the belief that life
is meaningless a second one is extreme skepticism maintaining that
nothing in the world has a real existence a third
one is a world view that traditional values and beliefs
are unfounded and that existence is senseless and useless and
a fourth one is a doctrine that denies any objective
ground of truth and especially of moral truths so that
gets you a pretty good sense of it but i
also want to read some detailed descriptions of it from
from wikipedia and from certain online encyclopedia sources because i
in researching this topic i really liked what they had
to say and it's going to set the foundation for
everything we talk about and it'll show us some of
the limitations of these definitions because even when you go
to wikipedia or to the stanford encyclopedia philosophy or whatever
and you read through their descriptions of nihilism they're going
to give you more of like a historical account and
then it'll leave you scratching your head as to like
well is it true which parts of it are true
which are false how do you fit it in with
personal development work how do you actually make it useful
and practical what are its limitations and strengths and uh
what is it missing perhaps all right so wikipedia says
the following quote nihilism from the latin neil or nothing
is a philosophy or family of views within philosophy expressing
negation towards general aspects of life that are widely accepted
within humanity as objectively real such as knowledge existence and
the meaning of life different nihilist positions hold variously that
human values are baseless that life is meaningless that knowledge
is impossible or that some set of entities do not
exist german philosopher friedrich nietzsche used the term to describe
the western world's disintegration of traditional morality end quote quote
for nietzsche there is no objective order or structure in
the world except what we give it penetrating the facades
buttressing convictions the nihilist discovers that all values are baseless
and that reason is impotent every belief every considering something
true nietzsche writes is necessarily false because there is simply
no true world for him nihilism requires a radical repudiation
of all imposed values and meaning nihilism is not only
the belief that everything deserves to perish but one actually
puts one's shoulder to the plow one destroys end quote
and that's from the internet encyclopedia of philosophy so nietzsche's
work is associated with nihilism quite a bit although really
to call nietzsche himself a nihilist would be a problem
because nietzsche's philosophy was a little bit more complex than
simply that it wasn't about destroying all values and then
leaving it at that really for him it was about
clearing away all of the falsely constructed narratives and religious
systems and so on from the past 2000 years recognizing
their limitations and their artificiality destroying those but then what
that leaves is a clearing on top of which one
can build an authentic life and become what he would
call a super mensch sort of like the uberman the
superman and and then you're not living simply by somebody
else's social conditioning you're living by your own values so
it's not that nisha didn't really believe in values and
he wasn't properly a nihilist he just believed in nihilism
as a means to uh to an end towards actually
authenticity and some sort of higher values that come after
that which are not socially conditioned so um be careful
about that it's easy to to forget that additional you
know last step and really in that sense clearing out
social conditioning that's a very good thing unless of course
you're very attached to your social conditioning like if you
have a traditional religious orientation then that might be a
problem for you because you're attached to it and you
don't want that cleared away and you might be kind
of shocked at like well why would you want to
clear away all social conditioning well one of the things
you discover as you get deep into personal development work
and self-actualization is that a lot of the social conditioning
and values and norms and morality and religion that you
receive from your society has problems to it and these
problems have played themselves out for for thousands of years
have led to lots of violence and hatred and judgment
and and death and inequality and all sorts of things
like this and also how can you just know that
they're true for yourself if you haven't derived them from
first principles then maybe they're false maybe they're illusions maybe
they're constructions see now this last part of this uh
quote that i read you you know where he says
that nihilism is is sort of the belief that everything
deserves to perish and you should not just kind of
hope for it to perish but you should even push
it it's like to to break things down to destroy
this is a problematic rendition of nihilism i would suggest
because after all here's the problem is that if everything
is truly meaningless if you really believe that everything is
truly meaningless then why would you want to destroy it
you see that's an additional extra step the mind has
to take and in fact to actively destroy something or
even to actively dislike something or to hate it that
is already to attract a negative meaning to it that's
one of the problems with nihilism depending on how you
know how you construe nihilism because if you construe nihilism
as literally just complete meaninglessness to reality okay but then
if you go one step further you say and because
of that i have to destroy society and institutions and
things that's a secondary step that i'm not willing to
take with you and i'll show you why that's problematic
that is problematic but before we get into that let's
continue forward here because we have some more to read
continuing from the internet encyclopedia philosophy it says quote the
caustic strength of nihilism is absolute nietzsche argues and under
its withering scrutiny the highest values devalue themselves the aim
is lacking and why finds no answer inevitably nihilism will
expose all cherished beliefs and sacrosanct truths as symptoms of
a defective western mythos this collapse of meaning relevance and
purpose will be the most destructive force in history constituting
a total assault on reality and nothing less than the
greatest crisis for humanity end quote so nietzsche was writing
in the late 1800s and this was right at the
turn of the century before world war one and world
war ii and so what was happening in the western
civilized world at that time is that all of the
old fashioned christian values judeo-christian values and that worldview was
starting to unravel it was unraveling from the philosophical perspective
but it was starting to also unravel from the scientific
perspective because science was becoming more and more advanced and
materialism this was we're really talking about the birth of
materialism scientific materialism here of atheism stuff like that it
really started with with you might say with nietzsche and
then flowered very very seriously in the next 50 years
after that and then we're living with the fallout from
that and so of course one of the questions back
then was like well what happens if we lose all
our judeo-christian values and worldview what happens if we as
a society stop believing in god for the most part
or at least act like god is not important or
that god is just some sort of superstitious fairy tale
from the past from our ancestors and we have sort
of transcended that with our logic and our rationality and
our science what happens in this kind of society and
then some people claimed well it would unravel society and
lead to war and to disaster and to all sorts
of monstrosities and perhaps to a certain extent that is
what happened world war one and world war ii of
course there are many more causes to world war one
and world war ii than just this but you could
say that this is sort of like the backdrop against
which world war one and world war ii occurred and
all the stuff that you know the atrocities and other
uh problems that occurred in between those two wars moving
on here says quote nihilism is the belief that all
values are baseless and that nothing can be known or
communicated it is often associated with extreme pessimism and a
radical skepticism that condemns existence a true nihilist would believe
nothing have no loyalties and no purpose other than perhaps
an impulse to destroy in the 20th century nihilistic themes
like epistemological failure value destruction and cosmic purposelessness have preoccupied
artists social critics and philosophers end quote so what happened
basically within philosophy and also in a certain sense within
science as well just historically in the context of western
intellectual tradition is that many of the axioms and assumptions
and frameworks that existed for hundreds of thousands of years
that went unquestioned started to be questioned philosophically language started
to be questioned our notions of how language shapes reality
euclidean geometry was questioned even absolute space and time was
questioned by einstein and by quantum physicists the idea of
even there being matter out of which this universe is
made started to be questioned and so as this was
happening and everything was being questioned all these fronts also
in logic in mathematics there started to be questions about
the nature of what mathematics is whether mathematics is even
logical there were attempts to formalize mathematics that failed disastrously
and conclusively there were failures within logical positivism within the
sciences that failed so mankind's attempts at the at the
turn of the century at the early 1900s mankind was
basically getting to the point where we were getting pretty
cocky we were thinking like okay i think we got
this figure thing figured out we've got the world figured
out we basically got physics figured out we've got chemistry
almost figured out we've got biology pretty much figured out
we've figured out evolution now with darwin's discoveries so we
kind of know where man came from we know it
wasn't from god so the story goes and uh we've
got logic figured out you know in the next few
decades we're going to have all of logic locked down
we have all of mathematics locked down and then basically
there's even quotes of uh a famous scientist saying something
like we figured out 98 of of everything and the
other two percent we're going to figure out in the
next 50 or 100 years and then there's not going
to be any more like even point to doing physics
we'll have it all figured out and once we have
physics figured out since we're just living in this clockwork
universe and everything is perfectly deterministic well then uh we'll
have everything figured out because everything just boils down to
physics in this sort of reductionistic sense and then also
on the cultural front things were being questioned like art
molds were being broken within art with the impressionist movements
in europe and then with picasso you know he was
breaking the mold in terms of what art means then
abstract impressionism came after that and then other sorts of
weird art movements that completely broke the old classical and
neoclassical traditions and they broke with realism and then of
course the social norms and things were being questioned as
well with the rise of of feminism early feminism the
patriarchy was being questioned so all the sort of like
the old structures of the judeo-christian world were being questioned
um but then what happened within like within logic for
example is that that attempt to formalize all of logic
by people like god lafregae and alfred north whitehead and
bertrand russell and others those were shattered by google's and
completeness theorem which i have an episode upon where i
discuss its metaphysical and epistemic implications and so that that
crashed that endeavor you can't formalize logic you can't formalize
mathematics there's actually an infinite number of different kinds of
logics and also with physics we've discovered that we know
a lot less about physics that we really do and
so basically what it sort of opened us up to
is this where before we were very well buttoned down
a society and we thought we had it figured out
really what we discovered is that no we were fooling
ourselves we put a bunch of blinders up and we
made all these constructions where we thought we understood more
than we really do and now we realize how little
we really understand in terms of language logic mathematics science
physics and this kind of opens us up into this
unknown chaos which can feel nihilistic and our sense of
meaning and value is getting eroded as well because we're
losing our faith in god we're starting to question gender
identity and roles we're starting to question monarchies and other
sorts of political systems and then where does that leave
us as individuals and as a society where should society
be headed how do we get all of these individuals
to agree upon some direction for society in this new
directionless nihilistic world wikipedia also says quote the term was
also a pejorative for certain value destructive trends of modernity
namely the negation of christianity and european tradition in general
it was also in use during the middle ages to
denote certain forms of heresy end quote and then from
the encyclopedia britannica.com it says quote nihilism represented a crude
form of positivism and materialism a revolt against the established
order it negated all authority exercised by the state by
the church and by the family it based its belief
on nothing but scientific truth science would be the solution
to all social problems all evils nihilists believed derived from
a single source ignorance which science alone would overcome end
quote so there's actually something very sneaky here going on
in this particular formulation of nihilism again see here that
what nihilism purports to be and how it actually behaves
in the world can be two different things which can
be actually contradictory with each other so for example if
you truly wanted to deconstruct everything as a nihilist supposedly
does if you wanted to destroy everything well then how
could you say that then science will be what remains
why didn't you also destroy science why would you rely
on science to replace religion or good old-fashioned family values
you see and if what you're concerned about is ignorance
and you say that all of evil stems from ignorance
okay i would agree with you but then what about
science how can you say that science will allow you
to overcome that ignorance isn't science part of that ignorance
you see so there's a question for nihilus as far
as how deep are you really willing to go with
your nihilism there can be surface level formulations of it
and there can be deeper level formulations of it and
so i think this just varies upon how deep of
a nihilist you are and uh what i see is
that most people aren't really willing to go deep into
nihilism and the reason that is for very good reason
because it's not very useful to your survival to be
a nihilist how do you live in the world as
a nihilist and this is i think what what most
ordinary people would say about nihilism and they would say
something like well leo yeah sure i mean this is
all nice philosophy and theory and stuff but in the
real world if you have children you got to go
go to work and feed them so who gives a
[ __ ] about this stupid nihilistic philosophy it doesn't
get us anywhere and you know it doesn't help me
grow my business doesn't help me earn more money doesn't
help me get sex so what's the point how is
it useful it seems antithetical to usefulness and of course
yeah nihilism is not useful um or maybe it is
because maybe there are things in the world that need
to be destroyed structures belief systems social conditioning social norms
maybe these are holding us back and then destroying those
might be useful maybe it might be useful to clear
your mind of all social conditioning and all value systems
maybe is it well it depends on how you do
it so what we really had going here is we
had a deep spiral dynamic stage blue and if you
don't know what that is go watch my spiral dynamics
series starting with stage blue we had spiraling stage blue
that nietzsche came along and he was sort of at
the forefront of stage orange which we would say is
modern modernity so christianity gave rise after christianity exhausted itself
and it became untenable you know after enough scientific discoveries
after darwin after evolution after einstein after quantum mechanics after
all these sorts of things after electricity and and uh
and so on christianity basically became untenable for serious intellectuals
which led to a sort of nihilism but then that
nihilism very quickly was replaced with scientific materialism and the
sort of mechanistic pragmatic approach which is stage origin and
this was both good and bad it was good in
the sense that we shed a lot of superstition dogma
theocracy and very narrow ethnocentric thinking from the past we
put an end to holy wars and religious domination of
others we got rid of this idea that christianity is
the one true worldview and that all other ones are
heathen and need to be converted either by sword or
by proselyte evangelical proselytation proselytized proselytization that's a that's a
mouthful um so we got over that then came a
sort of a period of brief nihilism but that nihilism
that void to see the problems that nature reports a
vacuum as they say and that void quickly gets filled
up with with the world view of scientific materialism to
the point where today people born today into the scientific
materialist worldview they they they can't even imagine that there
used to be previous worldviews that our ancestors and scientists
and intellectuals of the past for example had idealist worldviews
rather than materialist ones or christian worldviews and they took
those worldview just as seriously those worldviews just as seriously
as you take your materialism so um and then with
materialism came sort of a sort of a pragmatic approach
to reality you know like if there's no higher order
values if there is no god and anything is allowed
basically and we're living in sort of a moral relativistic
landscape then what is life about then life is not
about worshiping or going to church or working towards some
beautiful afterlife or heaven or working to avoid the eternal
damnation of hell which is what life was for people
for thousands of years in europe for example now life
is just about what it's about material acquisition it's just
about carnal pleasure personal comfort success as much money and
sex as i can get the business that i can
build the science that i can do and just being
practical and normal having fun it becomes about that and
that seems like well that's a much better way to
live well in a certain way it is in a
certain sense but in another certain sense it's a very
hollow existence and this is where someone like jordan peterson
would come in and say if you take that too
far your life just becomes about work and money and
you lose touch of something higher than you you lose
the spiritual component and then in a sense that is
this sort of nihilism or this lack of direction in
your life and then because of that society becomes dysfunctional
you as an individual become dysfunctional because there's actually something
deeply important that was there in the old traditions that
is missing from this purely pragmatic materialistic way of living
so we need to go back to the old myths
and stories and extract the wisdom and lessons of our
ancestors and then of course after stage orange like in
the 1950s and 60s then came stage green came online
and green was even more relativistic and it not only
was it you know so far we've been talking about
modernity but then it went even beyond that into post-modernity
and then there was a lot of very deep questioning
of of all morals and and even cultural norms like
what does it even mean to be a man or
a woman even ask her to be questioned is heterosexuality
even correct even that became questioned and basically with sage
green the relativistic stage all the remaining foundations of western
civilization were undermined there was a loss of this sort
of simplistic top-down authority not just of religion which already
happened with modernity but now even with science so see
a lot of what sort of normies don't like about
post-modernism is that post-modernism doesn't just question the old traditions
of the ancestors it goes a step further it questions
modernity the idea of an objective reality the idea that
physics is the one true interpretation and explanation for what
reality is post-modernity questions that and a lot of folks
in the hard sciences don't like this because they like
the authority they have of the hard sciences they want
to say no no no yeah this post-modernism stuff this
is just from the soft sciences these people they're just
kind of philosophers and social critics but what they're talking
about this relativism sure maybe there's a relativism of different
cultures of morals and norms a hard scientist would acknowledge
that and and maybe you know western civilization is not
the best civilization maybe there's value in eastern civilization in
the middle eastern civilization and all this okay we'll admit
that but let's protect the foundation of science the hard
sciences physics chemistry biology mathematics and logic these cannot be
questioned because these are the deepest source of truth in
our society they produce all of our technology look we
landed a man on the moon look at the satellites
we launched look at the rockets we have look at
the nuclear weapons we have you can't deny that that
is real it's tangible you can't just say that's relative
and so biology truly does say that there's a man
and there's a woman and this is based on dna
evidence and a postmodernist would say no even that is
just a limited and biased way of looking at the
world and it is not the absolute truth and it
is not the most important and the most objective and
so post-modernist for example with level critiques even at the
hard scientists by saying stuff like well most of the
hard sciences have been done by privileged white men for
centuries for millennia and that presents a very certain biased
view of the physical world for example when women do
science they might have a different way of looking at
the world they might have a different epistemology a different
metaphysics a different emphasis on what's important to look at
because it's not just that you're looking at the physical
world as it is really what you're doing is you're
picking you're cherry picking data and facts you're running certain
kinds of experiments but then it's you who's determining what
kind of experiments are worthwhile to run and how to
interpret the data and how to frame the data and
what it means and then how to decide what kind
of society to structure based upon that data what kind
of normative rules and guidelines to give to people in
a society now of course the hard scientists they're at
stage orange they're stuck in stage orange and so they
will debate that and so now we have a debate
between orange and green and i'm not going to go
too deeply into that here because you can debate that
for hours there's a there's there's valid points to be
made on both sides but in general stage green is
above stage orange and if you if you move to
green properly in a solid way and you also integrate
orange as you move to green then you should still
be able to retain the truths of orange the partial
truths of orange and then transcend them with green but
with green comes a sort of a what ken wilbur
calls it a perspectival madness basically when you move into
green the reason people are scared of moving into green
the reason there's so much backlash against green is because
green is actually very difficult on you psychologically and i
went through this when i was in in my late
teens early 20s really more like late teens i went
through it pretty early where i realized that all of
the moral systems were just constructions and we're social conditioning
and programming whether christian and even science i started to
question even science the norms of science the method of
science and i started just to see that all of
these are just different and very limited and partial ways
of of interacting with reality and looking at reality and
that they're not absolutely true and when that happened i
was left in this sort of uh what i would
describe like in the middle of the ocean rudderless not
knowing which direction to go because i had all these
different perspectives and i couldn't determine which one was right
because for me i became sort of a complete relativist
and it was like well terrorists are are you know
bombing 911 is that good or bad well who should
say i mean after all as an american i have
biases of course i don't like it as an american
but if i was a lived in the middle east
and i was an oppressed uh you know muslim maybe
that would be a good thing for me and after
all you know american capitalism has done a lot of
bad stuff in the middle east so who's to say
they don't even have a valid point that's one perspective
you might take as a relativist um you know another
perspective you might take is like well um like on
war is the war in iraq a good thing or
a bad thing and you can make sort of a
case for both and so basically or like another example
would be like with the left wing and the right
wing at that point in my life when i was
in my late teens uh i would watch basically both
sides of the political aisle the left and the right
and i would treat them totally equally because at that
point i didn't have enough discernment to understand i didn't
know about spider dynamics i didn't know that there were
sort of lower and higher stages of development and so
i thought that everybody was just equal and that the
left and the right were just two equal sides of
the coin and so i watched a lot of conservative
media even though i didn't agree with it because i
myself was quite quite liberal but like i would watch
a lot of bill o'reilly sean hannity i would listen
to a lot of right-wing talk radio for hours and
hours and hours and even though i didn't agree with
with their ideas ultimately i had to say like well
but who am i to say that what i agree
with or don't agree with is the arbiter of truth
what if bill o'reilly is right what if sean hannity
makes a good point and so i listened to that
in retrospect now i realize how how foolish that was
but that was a phase i had to go through
because at that point i literally did not have a
means for adjudicating or discerning between any kind of value
judgments so i was very sort of neutral and i
thought that neutrality was the closest to truth but it
turns out that there's a there are higher ways of
looking at things and that not not every not every
side is equally valid so how to deal with this
a perspectival madness or this multiplicity of perspectives and views
and sorting them out and making sense of which views
are more valid than others which ones are more truthful
than others which ones are more beneficial and healthy and
which ones are more toxic which ones are more in
good faith which ones are more in bad faith this
is what it took me a good five or ten
years to learn of swimming around in this a perspectival
madness and i think and it was it was difficult
emotionally it was difficult uh you feel lost and i
think that this is precisely why people who are raised
into a traditional value system like judeo-christian the judeo-christian worldview
or any other value system islam or something like that
for it's so difficult to get them up into stage
green from stage blue because in doing so they become
unmoored and they become lost and they don't want to
go through that and also you start to question everything
you become very skeptical and that's really where i came
to nihilism from is from a deep skepticism early in
my teenage years i was just i just knew that
everything had to be questioned i couldn't take anything on
faith because to take something even one thing on faith
would would open me to a possibility for deep epistemic
error and so basically i questioned everything including science and
see most people if they question the religious norms that's
easy questioning the scientific norms that's really hard and i
fell into that trap too for a while at first
i started to turn my skepticism towards science because i
suspected that something there was fishy but as much as
i poured my skepticism into it i just couldn't crack
the nut of science uh it's too strong it it
it defends itself so it has so many ingenious defense
mechanisms that get you to believe that it's absolute truth
or objective truth or that it's the best method of
arriving to truth that we have and it's especially difficult
to challenge the hard sciences and i just couldn't wrap
my mind around how to do it i wanted to
do it as a skeptic but i didn't know how
and it would take me probably another decade to succeed
in that um but basically i tried to crack the
nut of of of science and i couldn't crack it
and as a result i sort of was resigned to
the truths of science because i couldn't crack them and
uh and i was sort of resigned to evolution and
i was sort of resigned to atheism at that point
because they don't really teach you how to crack the
nut of science because our society hasn't progressed to that
level yet although i mean they're starting to teach it
with stage green in universities and that's precisely what all
the backlash to stage green is about is because the
stage blue people and the strange orange people the religious
people and the scientific people the atheistic people the rational
people they do not want their atheism and rationalism deconstructed
and they're gonna they're gonna employ every single trick in
their in their ego's mind to prevent that from happening
so why is nihilism seen as so negative by society
fundamentally because it undermines the ego the ego needs to
construct meaning and value in order to orient itself and
to survive that is what meaning and value are meaning
and value are not things found in the outer world
this is basically what nihilism is telling you and also
to a certain extent post-modernism you don't find meaning and
value in the outer world and i mean a good
scientist will tell you this too science doesn't prove anything
is valuable or meaningful strictly speaking all science does is
it measures stuff that's all it does it makes predictions
science can tell you where the moon will be next
year that doesn't tell you if the moon is good
or bad it doesn't tell you whether you should fly
to the moon you should mine the moon you should
nuke the moon settle the moon it tells you nothing
about what you should do but you see us humans
were caught in an extra in an existential bind for
survival you don't really have an option as long as
you're alive you're surviving and in fact not just having
an option but you have deep instincts from a billion
years of evolution for survival you're instinctually biased towards surviving
and against doing airy fairy philosophy and deconstructing meaning you
can sit here with me today and deconstruct all the
meaning you want and you can even believe it you
can even call yourself a nihilist but then tomorrow you're
gonna wake up and go to work and earn your
paycheck to pay your electricity and to feed yourself because
you're hungry and the hunger will override any philosophical considerations
of nihilism you see this is the problem so it's
easy to call yourself a nihilist but then you don't
actually act like it this is one of the deep
problems with nihilism is that for you to actually live
like a nihilist would be very very challenging and so
a lot of nihilists they might call themselves that or
might they might fancy themselves that way but that's just
some sort of intellectual game they play they don't actually
live that way and most humans don't live that way
and most humans recognize that that's a bad way to
live but nihilism is treated as negative by society at
large because society at large is in the business of
constructing a civilization it has a bias and the ego
hates when its constructions are questioned because the questioning of
these constructions which are very useful for survival threatens survival
so for example if we start questioning money what money
is and we start telling everyone hey you know the
us dollar is just imaginary it doesn't have any value
or meaning that's going to lead to the destruction of
the economy and most people don't want that because most
people aren't interested in knowing the dollars imaginary they just
want to use the dollar to buy their food see
western civilization as it turns out is a house of
cards built on an unquestioned foundation of axioms assumptions both
metaphysical epistemic religious theological scientific linguistic even the idea of
a western civilization as a concept itself is a construction
it's a house of cards not to mention the idea
that western civilization is the best that too is a
is a house of cards you will realize if you
question it if you dare to question it and western
civilization has this bias of construction or survival which means
that western civilization if it finds some useful falsehood it
would rather go with the useful falsehood than with the
truth because the falsehood is useful whereas the truth what's
it going to do for me so see if your
attitude is very selfish and all you care about is
your own comfort and what things are going to do
for you then that opens the floodgates for all sorts
of falsehoods fantasies and constructions and illusions and then the
problem with that is that as you're building those and
you're connecting them together the more of them you connect
together the more your illusions take on a an air
of reality but this is not true reality it's a
pseudo reality it's merely that you're writing a novel and
you're adding in so many rich details into this novel
that you're writing that eventually you get so lost in
your own novel you get so lost in your own
[ __ ] that you forget it was [ __
] from the very beginning that it's a fantasy it
can be fun it can help you to survive but
also the problem with it is that it becomes very
vulnerable it becomes vulnerable to deconstruction and to prevent the
deconstruction this construct which we might call western civilization it
starts adding on additional lies and fantasies as defense mechanisms
so for example science is the foundation of today's western
civilization in the past it used to be christianity but
now it's science and materialism and rationalism and logic and
mathematics so that's the foundation if you start to question
that you will get so demonized and so attacked because
it's virtually impossible to deconstruct that foundation not because you
can't and not because it's true but simply because people
are so defensive about it that they won't even give
you the time of day to listen to you and
they won't even want to contemplate it because if you
can unravel that you will unravel all of western civilization
and i've i've done that in other episodes you can
see me doing that see my three-part series deconstructing the
myth of science where i go very deep into that
uh but anyways see so what happens with nihilism is
that nihilism is kind of like a for a very
deep part of skepticism um literally literally leads to a
disillusionment think of that word dis illusion meant it's the
loss of illusion and the ego doesn't like to lose
its illusions it doesn't feel good to the ego how
do you think a scientist feels who invested 40 years
into his phd work and research and into his academic
career how do you think he will feel if he
realizes that the entire foundation of science and academia is
built on illusions and fictions and constructions it's going to
lead to an existential crisis it's going to lead to
a nihilism he would say and therefore he associates negativity
with that but that negativity is not inherent to the
nihilism that negativity is simply because you've been building this
house of cards you've been constructing this ponzi scheme in
your own mind you and collectively with all your friends
and colleagues and then now it's getting unraveled and that
threatens you threatens your survival threatens your livelihood maybe you
won't be able to feed your kids anymore that threatens
you that's very scary to you as a matter of
life and death you've built your entire identity around this
so good luck getting one of these scientists to really
do a serious deconstruction of science or academia or logic
and of course they're gonna have very good excuses for
why leo no no it's not that i don't want
to or i can't handle it leo it's just because
you're some new ager who has a soft mind and
isn't isn't a true scientist that's that's the real reason
see you think you're being rational and truthful you're not
you're playing games you're playing ego games even when you
tell yourself you're being factual and objective and scientific and
rigorous and logical and all of that you tell yourself
that that's not ego stuff that's objective reality you're being
very hard-nosed and what i'm telling you is that no
all of that is a story you invented as a
defense mechanism by your ego to prevent you from actually
really doing a serious investigation and deconstruction of the foundations
of your mind in reality and you will say no
leah that's some psychobabble [ __ ] and i would
just say that's yeah it's another story you come up
with another defense mechanism see you have an endless amount
of these defense mechanisms no matter what i say you
have a defense mechanism against it so that's how the
mind works you have an infinite capacity for denial and
rationalization so you will rationalize away any critique i give
because you're not an honest actor see you're not interested
in truth you're interested in survival and i said no
leo is a scientist i'm interested in truth but you
aren't because if you were truly interested in truth you
would deconstruct science and then you would realize science is
not actually truth but no leo says truth well that's
the social conditioning you were taught that you never questioned
what if science is not truth see but you don't
want to go down that road it's too scary the
problem is is that you have no clue yet how
scary it is to deconstruct science you think it's just
like some philosophy here like it's oh it's all fun
and games it's just cool ideas no no no it's
not cool ideas this will radically send you into a
a spiral a nihilistic spiral an existential crisis and then
that will be very difficult for you emotionally to deal
with the problem here is not not that you're not
rational enough although that is a problem your rationality is
actually very poor uh you're completely distorting and twisting rationality
uh your ego has co-opted it as part of survival
but that's not the the main problem the main problem
is actually emotional emotionally you actually can't handle the things
that i'm saying which is why you deny it all
right so let's explicitly tell you how nihilism is right
nihilism is correct in that life has no meaning and
purpose that's correct how could it all meaning and purpose
is relative and completely contingent upon one's ego and what
one identifies oneself as all identity is of course also
completely relative so what's meaningful to one will not be
meaningful to another and this is so obvious just look
at look at history look at how mankind behaves look
at all the conflict and war it's completely obvious that
like to christians jesus is meaningful but to a buddhist
jesus is not meaningful to a buddhist buddha is meaningful
to christians buddha is the devil not meaningful or meaningful
and negative sense to a christian going to church and
you know eating a wafer that the priest gives you
like in the catholic church the eucharist or whatever it
is that's meaningful has a lot of meaning to a
buddhist or to a scientist or an atheist it looks
silly what does eating this wafer have to do with
being spiritual it's completely relative right you might even say
well yeah maybe those things are relative those are like
cultural things but but but leah what about like science
objective truth isn't that meaningful what about um happiness what
about living a good life what about life itself isn't
that meaningful inherently and the answer is no why would
it be why would life be any more meaningful than
death why would a good life be any more meaningful
than a bad life it's so it's all personal preference
some people actually enjoy cutting themselves or suffering in fact
most people enjoy their suffering and don't want to give
it up as far as purposes in life well you
can have whatever purpose you want i mean hitler had
the purpose of exterminating the jews that was his purpose
that got his juices flowing was that a wrong purpose
was it a right purpose it doesn't apply it was
a purpose that's what he liked somebody else might have
a purpose to evangelize the world you know some christian
missionary might travel to to polynesia and convert some heathens
there into uh christians is that is that a good
purpose is that a valid purpose is that a wrong
purpose it's whatever you imagine it is some scientists might
might have the purpose to to explore the galaxy and
to discover new scientific truth is that a valid purpose
i mean it all depends some scientists might have the
purpose of building a nuclear weapon is that a good
purpose again it all depends there's no good or bad
about these purposes it's however your ego structures itself and
conceived the world in the end all these purposes and
meanings are just functions of the ego all value is
created by the ego if you take a look at
an object just sitting out an empty space like the
moon the moon has no value is that obvious to
you that the moon has no value it only has
value relative to your ego's survival so for example if
you're a a businessman and you want to have a
mega yacht and you want to live in beverly hills
you know in a 50 million dollar mansion on a
hill with a nice view you might get the idea
that you can mine minerals on the moon and then
sell them to other humans because other humans want them
for survival it's useful so you develop some rockets and
a space mining you know facility up on the moon
to get get it up on the moon there with
the rockets and then you mine the minerals and you
send them down you mine gold and whatever else is
there you sell it and then if the moon becomes
valuable to you because you want to extract stuff from
the moon so that you can live in your nice
mansion with you know you can pay for prostitutes um
and you can have nice parties and you can drive
a fancy you know mercedes-benz or rolls-royce and you can
impress your neighbors and you can feel good about yourself
and in that sense the moon is valuable to you
but like is the moon valuable to your dog no
the moon has zero value to your dog is the
moon valuable to a tree no is the moon valuable
to the universe as a whole like does the universe
value the moon more than it values the earth no
obviously not so nihilism is also correct in that all
morality is relative because morality is basically just hinged upon
value meaning and purpose so if those are relative then
morality goes as well what's good what's bad it's it's
whatever you decide and if you look through him in
human history this is what explains all of the craziness
of human history all of the evil and all of
the finger-pointing and blaming and all the torture and all
the pillaging and raping and and uh spanish inquisitions and
all this why did all this stuff happen not only
did it happen but all the people who did that
stuff they thought they were being the good guys as
they were doing it they honestly thought they were the
good guys why because good is nothing other than what
your ego thinks is good for it that's how you
define good there is no absolute good without an ego
how can something be bad if you don't care what
happens to you see bad stuff only makes sense or
has meaning when you define things you don't want to
happen happen to you like you don't want to be
tortured so you define that as bad but if you
didn't care about being tortured then it wouldn't be bad
literally people think that badness is baked into the torture
no badness is just your reaction and fear and hatred
of it or the pain it causes you you might
say well leo but but can't we all agree that
pain is just bad suffering is inherently bad and the
answer is no absolutely not why would pain and suffering
be bad if you didn't have pain in your life
you would be dead pain is the mechanism you use
to stay alive so is suffering so if you want
to eliminate all the suffering in the world you're stupid
because without suffering all the things you love would be
dead they might say ah leo but then we can
say death is the is the is the worst thing
death is the bad one no who said that you
value life because you're alive and you're selfish and that's
a bias can you see that there's no reason why
you should value life over death science has not proven
that death is bad and moreover you can't have life
without death so if you condemn death then you also
condemn life you must say no no leo in the
future science will be able to get us to a
point where we will have eternal life and no death
there will never be such a future i hate to
break it to you everything finite dies the only thing
that doesn't die is the infinite but the infinite isn't
alive to begin with so doesn't apply the infant includes
both life and death and it doesn't uh distinguish between
the two and it doesn't value one over the other
that's the point so so the idea that death is
bad or suffering is bad or pain is bad this
is not scientific at all it's also not rational so
if you think you're being rational or scientific by holding
these beliefs you're not you're just you just haven't thought
through it science has no opinion if you do science
properly science has no opinion about death or life or
pain or suffering in fact science would tell you that
pain and suffering these were where they come from through
evolution why they evolved because they were useful for life
also how nihilism is correct is that all of reality
is relative there is no objective world there is no
objective external world relativity goes down not just at the
culture it's not just at the cultural level it goes
way deeper than that it goes to the ontological level
to the metaphysical level so you are hallucinating physical reality
i'm not gonna explain why or how i'm not gonna
prove that to you here i've talked about that in
many other places uh we'll keep going down the list
um nihilism is also correct in that the world cannot
really be known in the way humans try to know
it so this enterprise of science thinking that you can
sort of just acquire more and more knowledge accumulate and
eventually you'll know the whole universe no it'll never work
because the universe is infinite and and your knowledge is
always partial and limited all your models um are just
partial perspectives and you will never get to the full
perspective by an accumulation of all of those so epistemic
nihilism this is called epistemic nihilism uh sort of a
nihilism towards knowledge in particular the previous point was called
we might call that ontological nihilism or metaphysical nihilism uh
sort of a denial of the physical objective world of
course all social institutions and norms are groundless and self-serving
every social institution is is pure selfishness it doesn't care
about the truth it's not grounded in anything it's just
a house of cards built to perpetuate itself and to
serve those who are associated with it and ultimately nihilism
is correct in that all beliefs are ultimately untrue i've
also talked about that elsewhere we don't have time to
to go into an in-depth explanation of why that's the
case but if you are skeptical enough you'll realize that
all beliefs are ultimately untrue so so yeah so this
is what most people would deny and this is what
nihilism gets right but what about what nihilism gets wrong
this is also very important so let's give a list
of this the biggest way nihilism is wrong is that
it gives meaninglessness a negative meaning you have to distinguish
here between sort of meaninglessness with a lowercase m versus
meaninglessness with the uppercase m meaninglessness with a lowercase m
is a sort of meaninglessness which sends you into a
depression and the reason it sends you into depression is
because you give it a negative meaning which of course
is self-contradicting because if you truly realize that the world
was meaningless completely meaningless you couldn't be depressed about it
you couldn't be negative about it and it would not
be a justification for inaction do you see why because
if you're depressed about it or negative about it or
you want to now use it as a reason to
destroy things but that means you're giving it meaning it
means something to you that the world is meaningless but
that's not meaninglessness that's meaning so the problem here is
that the nihilism doesn't go all the way you need
to take your nihilism deeper until there's a sort of
a going full circle an inversion where you go from
the lowercase m to the uppercase m where you truly
realize oh it's actually absolutely meaningless that's not bad it's
not negative it doesn't mean i should destroy things it
doesn't mean even that social institutions are bad it doesn't
even mean that constructions are bad see if you take
nihilism as this sort of invitation to destroy things because
things that are constructed are fictions and houses of cards
and are illusions and that illusion is bad you don't
get it if you think illusion is bad you're judging
illusion you're giving meaning to illusion if you think the
us government is bad because it's just a house of
cards built on nothing but fantasies and you know fairy
tales we tell ourselves from the money to the constitution
that's written on a piece of paper to the language
we used to write it you don't really understand how
deeply meaningless it is it's so meaningless that you shouldn't
be pissed off at anything if you're angsty about stuff
if you're bitter about stuff if you hate stuff if
you want to kill people if you're turning into a
misanthropic person who doesn't like mankind all of that you
need to recognize is not true nihilism it is a
pseudo-nihilism it is negative meaning and that is the ego
that is the ego and in fact it's a less
functional and more toxic ego than the ego of those
people who are actually constructing these illusions and houses of
cards that is a problem and i think that that's
in something that normal people even though that they won't
be able to articulate this of you you know talk
with them they have that intuition about nihilism is that
your nihilism is like what is it going to really
do for you it's going to send you into a
depression and it's going to make you better at the
world that's not a good way to live the world
and they're correct about that you don't want to live
you don't want to live in the world that way
another thing that nihilism gets wrong is that you can't
derive an ought from an is so if you say
that reality is meaningless that does not mean that now
you ought to do something like destroy an institution or
destroy science or to kill somebody or to commit suicide
no reality could be completely meaningless and you could enjoy
it reality could be completely meaningless and you can buy
a ticket to hawaii and go on the beach and
sip your pina colada and enjoy beautiful women sunbathing on
the on the on the beach that's perfectly compatible with
true nihilism but see if you're doing a sort of
a pseudo-nihilism a false nihilism then you might say no
that's that's you're still part of the game and you
know you're not you gotta actually destroy the system man
no why why destroy why destroy anything why is destruction
better than creation why is creation better than destruction see
if you're truly annihilus you're truly left in this such
a neutral position that it actually frees you up to
behave in any way you want and now if you
want to destroy if you genuinely want to destroy that
makes you feel good i guess okay go for it
but does it does it make you feel good is
that really what you want if you think about it
you'll realize no i don't want that it doesn't feel
good it doesn't make others feel good so why would
i do it now you can say well but if
it doesn't make me feel good so what can't i
be a nihilist and destroy stuff even it makes me
feel bad and of course the answer is yes of
course you can because nihilism completely frees you up to
be any way you want but the question is do
you actually want that in the end what it comes
down to is just what do you want you're confused
about what you want that's the problem if you cleared
that up you wouldn't be destroying things or you would
be very careful in what you destroy because i mean
certain things do need to be destroyed like certain corrupt
social institutions they need to be questioned and reformed parts
of them need to be destroyed but this sort of
like desire to take a wrecking ball to all of
mankind and even maybe to yourself and even maybe destroy
your own life this is this is not going to
be a life that you yourself want so that's a
dead end another thing that's wrong with nihilism is that
it doesn't complete the deconstruction of the ego into awakening
and god realization so the problem is again the same
way that skepticism is often misused i've talked about this
in my episode called false versus true skepticism oftentimes the
way skepticism and nihilism is used is that it's used
to destroy all of the stuff outside of you and
it's not turned in towards you really what you should
be doing you take the wrecking ball of nihilism and
skepticism and swing it at yourself swing it at that
giant ego of yours deconstruct that before you go deconstructing
social systems and governments and even science deconstruct your own
ego but see the nihilist doesn't do that almost every
nihilus that i could run into i guarantee you they're
gonna have a giant ego they're gonna have a nihilistic
ego in fact nihilism itself will become the ego and
the identity but they're not gonna be conscious of that
so in fact they're contradicting themselves because see when the
nihilism gets so deep the nihilism has to destroy itself
too but most nihilists aren't willing to do that because
that's too threatening for the ego to do so what
the ego does is the ego co-ops nihilism is part
of its survival strategy and then what i would say
is that the survival strategy of nihilism if you're going
to use it for that is very dysfunctional and in
this sense normies are correct jordan peterson is correct nihilism
as a survival strategy in life ain't so good it's
not going to work out for you but there is
a deeper truer nihilism which leads to awakening if you
take it that far that means deconstructing your ego so
another thing that nihilism gets wrong is that mostly what
nihilism is as a philosophy is it's just stuck at
the level of belief and concept it's not actualized it's
also turned into a political ideology sometimes like maybe anarchism
that's also an invalid use of of of nihilism nihilism
doesn't make any political prescriptions truly if you think government
is bad and evil you're not being a proper nihilist
and finally what nihilism gets wrong is that it overlooks
what happens when you reach the bottom of nihilism if
you go all the way down down down down the
rabbit hole of nihilism eventually what happens is that you
awaken everything loses meaning but then after that you go
through the dark night of the soul and then the
ego dies and then you awaken to god not as
a belief not as some christian fairy tale god has
consciousness consciousness is the only real thing so what nihilism
overlooks is that yes the christian versions of god were
stupid and so are many of the other religious versions
of god yes religion is pretty stupid it's filled with
dogma and [ __ ] and so forth and the
meaning it comes up with is a false pseudo meaning
but it's missing the very soul and heart of reality
which is that you're god that god is everything that
god is beauty god is love god is divinity spirit
goodness truth consciousness all as absolutes so the paradox of
meaninglessness is that when it completely collapses you actually discover
infinite love and absolute goodness which is everything and then
you realize oh all these stupid nihilistic beliefs and philosophies
i had all these philosophers i read the existentialist nietzsche
and all this they were all deluded and i was
just using them as a defense mechanism against the realization
of what i am as god infinite love and then
you're no longer you're no longer depressed you no longer
want to destroy at that point at that point uh
you so fall in love with yourself and with reality
that you actually rediscover a higher purpose and the higher
purpose is to help mankind to awaken not because you
have to not because someone told you not because religion
tells you not because it's a moral tradition or a
norm but simply because that's what god would do that's
what consciousness does consciousness is a self-awakening system everything that
happens within consciousness is just a means to help consciousness
awaken to itself in the absolute sense in the biggest
picture sense and then you just when you relinquish your
selfish needs and concerns you lose yourself and then when
you lose yourself you just become a force of the
universe for its own awakening in whatever means that might
be it might be art it might be teaching it
might be engineering it might be science it might be
politics whatever there's a million ways that you could do
that and then your life takes on the highest and
deepest meaning but this meaning it's not a constructed meaning
really it's you realize that all meaning is a construction
but awakening is not a construction the universe awakening to
itself that's not a construction that's an absolute and so
what the nihilist is overlooking is the the existence of
the absolute and that's a problem a lot of people
have when i start talking about absolute truth many scientific
and atheistic and rational people they they scratch their heads
and they just can't open their minds to the possibility
of the existence of an absolute truth but consider that
you're wrong and that absolute truth does actually exist not
as a concept or a belief but absolutely this is
it you're in absolute truth right now you just don't
realize it so criticisms of nihilism as with many things
like i said before that distinction of criticism from above
or from below a criticism of nihilism from below would
be one coming from traditional values and it's fear-based it's
from someone it's from an ego basically so like a
christian or maybe someone like jordan peterson might criticize nihilism
on the grounds that it's going to lead to a
bad life uh a bad marriage and an inability to
function in the world and it comes that comes from
a place of fear because it's like it's going to
be total chaos relativity is going to lead to total
chaos and society will fall apart this is a fear-based
shadow based uh criticism from below of nihilism this only
comes because that ego mind that is making that criticism
has not itself actually gone through the nihilistic process and
you can tell because it's avoidant and is scared of
that process that's why it's doing the criticizing the criticism
is a defense mechanism this is why traditionally oriented people
are very fearful of nihilism like if you have christian
parents and you come home with a with a with
a nihilist textbook you're gonna freak them out um but
then there's criticisms of nihilism from above so i criticized
nihilism a bit in this episode from above and the
difference is that i've actually gone through the nihilism i
was a nihilist with the lowercase n and then i
became a nihilus with an uppercase n and then what
i realized is that nihilism itself is self-defeating and it's
conceptual and that there's something deeper than nihilism which is
just infinite consciousness and love and god it's the thing
that people like jordan peterson think they're defending when they're
defending traditional values against nihilism but actually which is paradoxically
the very thing which is keeping them from realizing god
and love and from understanding religion so if i was
debating a nihilist i could tell him all sorts of
things he's got wrong about his worldview but it would
be coming from above because i went through what he's
going through i've been where he's been stuck and i
can see how his nihilism is just another piece of
clothing that the ego has adorned it's a defense mechanism
from deconstructing the ego it's important before you critique nihilism
that you first acknowledge its core truths the core truths
of nihilism which are correct is that everything is absolutely
groundless and relative the world is inherently devoid of meaning
in a very radical sense and that all value is
self-biased but the trick is that that all applies to
nihilism itself too there's a deep twisted strange loopy self-reflection
that happens here which most nihilists are not aware of
so to get to the uppercase and nihilism from a
lowercase nihilism you gotta do the self-reflection complete the loop
do the strange loop and realize that your own nihilism
eats its own tail or a boros style so the
problem with nihilism is not that it goes too far
is that it doesn't go far enough the ego is
never fully deconstructed because the nihilism is kept at the
level of philosophy see the ego is so safe with
philosophy because it's just concepts the ego loves to take
anything actual that will change your life and turn it
into an idea or a philosophy or concept or a
model so you got to take it below philosophy and
into actual embodiment actual practice so the ego is never
deconstructed the negativity of nihilism is not fully deconstructed survival
itself is not deconstructed science and materialism are not deconstructed
if you deconstruct all those now you're becoming a true
nihilist capital n nihilist which is just to say you're
becoming a mystic a mystic is just a nihilist who
went all the way who took it from philosophy to
embodiment it sounds so counterintuitive because like for example if
i would tell that to jordan peterson that a mystic
is just a radical nihilist i'm pretty sure he would
disagree with me very vehemently he'd have a lot of
defenses and excuses for why that's not true because it's
just it's so unacceptable to a traditionally oriented person to
a conservative that mysticism is literally just nihilism actualized for
example to tell a christian that jesus was a radical
nihilist which he was effectively this is the last thing
they would accept in fact they would they would they
would call me a a satan worshipper or something like
that so spirituality is nihilism that's the thing everybody is
missing they think that spirituality nihilism are somehow opposed to
each other they're not they're spirituality just nihilism actualized you
see most people's attachments to the material world and their
to their ideas into their ideology and to meaning most
of this is socially conditioned they did not create any
of it consciously they didn't sit down and decide it
and think it through rationally they were just born into
it and this includes science and logic and mathematics and
all this hard stuff this is all social conditioning the
only reason you believe in science or an evolution or
mathematics or logic or anything is because it was programmed
into your mind like religion you didn't consciously choose it
even if you're a scientist you didn't consciously choose it
and so the value of nihilism is that it can
wipe the slate clean of all the social conditioning it
allows you to deconstruct everything and then the value of
that and this is where nietzsche was right is that
now you can from that clean slate develop your own
meaning in life your own purpose your own system of
values and when you do that that's going to make
you more spiritual than any other person who professes to
be spiritual under the social conditioning model because spirituality is
not something you can be socially conditioned into spirituality only
comes from your own consciousness and your own consciousness is
hindered by all of the social conditioning so it's very
paradoxical that by questioning and doubting and destroying christianity and
hinduism and islam and even buddhism and atheism and rationality
and science by doing all of that you will actually
become truly deeply spiritual and you will become very authentic
and you will become very grounded and strong as an
individual you will become a powerful leader and you will
start to become truly satisfied with your life because you
can't be satisfied with a life based upon the social
conditioned values of other people which are not authentic to
you so spirituality is not only awakening and deconstructing everything
but spirituality is also discovering what you truly value in
life now you might say bilio but all the values
are constructions yes but the difference is that once you
go through the nihilism and you burn everything to the
ground then and you become conscious that all of reality
is imaginary then it's like you're in a dream right
you realize you're in a dream you realize there's nothing
to do in a dream but to play so you're
going to be playing games now and you can play
the game however you want and you and then and
then you can be honest with yourself and ask yourself
okay so how would i play the game if i
was totally free and unattached and i wasn't coming at
this game from a position of neediness or attachment or
fear but from a place of love and now i
can play the game from a place of love how
do i want to manifest my love in the world
according to my own personal preferences because you're still gonna
have preferences the difference though is that you don't hold
your preferences as absolutes you don't try to force your
preferences on others see like maybe you don't like eating
pork but now you're not gonna force others not to
eat pork um you're gonna have sort of a a
very detached hands-off approach to life you can have preferences
and biases even awakened people do but you're not going
to be normative about them you're not going to be
needy about them you're not going to fool yourself into
thinking that these personal preferences are absolute in some sense
you're not going to fool yourself with the idea that
western civilization is the best one or that my religion
is the best one or that my god is the
true one or that my science is the only way
to look at the world or that logic is the
only way to look at the world you're not going
to be fooled and limited by these sorts of ideas
anymore so you free yourself up you're literally liberating your
mind and again remember when you do the nihilism properly
you're not holding construction and illusion as a bad thing
illusion has a negative connotation in our society but it's
really not illusion is reality illusion is a dream it's
a play you're in a play it's a drama for
your own entertainment maybe this bums you out but you
gotta get past that and then eventually you'll realize you'll
come out the other end and you'll realize how beautiful
that is this is the greatest gift the fact that
reality is an illusion is not something to be bummed
out about it's the greatest gift because that means there's
nothing to fear it's a game play it enjoy it
there's nothing else to do enjoy the [ __ ]
game construct whatever meanings you want and be honest with
yourself that you're constructing it construct it consciously rather than
unconsciously that's the only problem that's really the key difference
is that a person with traditional values like jordan peterson
is not consciously constructing the value set it's been programmed
into him and he's unconsciously defending it clinging to it
now he intuits that it's pointing towards something higher and
he's right about that but he's never going to reach
that something higher until he's willing to let go of
those social conditions and those beliefs and those concepts and
ideas and the ego and identity that's been built around
it this is how you become nietzsche's ubermensch the superman
this is what the superman is the superman is living
completely from his or her own core authentic inner core
inner motivations that run far deeper than anything that society
can program into you consciousness cannot be programmed it's not
mechanical because it's not finite it's infinite it's an infinite
intelligence so as the superman or superwoman you're living from
this place of deep consciousness and living presence and intelligence
which is the god within you that animates you that
makes you passionate that makes you enthused which is spirit
enthusiasm means to be filled with the spirit of god
to be truly passionate about life to be driven by
love this cannot be given to you by any human
because it's a superhuman capacity when humans try to give
that to you or teach it to you those are
all poor substitutes and facsimiles of the actual thing you
can't turn intelligence and consciousness and love into algorithms because
they're infinite you can't encapsulate the truth in any system
of human design because it's infinite so what nihilism deeply
it is that all of the human constructions of society
and morality and religion all this and science even is
that it's all petty human [ __ ] humans take
their own construction so seriously when really humans are just
bullshitters that's what humans are they're bullshitting all the time
even when they're scientists they're full of [ __ ]
it's just that simple it's so simple it's so obvious
once you realize it if you go into every human
situation whether it's a business deal a relationship a marriage
dealing with kids dealing with with friends entertainment art science
academia government religion go into any of these institutions and
activities and just go in there with the assumption that
this whole thing is full of [ __ ] it's
all [ __ ] and you will be right 95
of the time but but don't tell them that because
because they'll kick you out they don't like being told
that because it's too true it's profoundly true people don't
like being called on out on their [ __ ]
they get offended they start attacking you so here i'll
also connect nihilism with uh what's a concept from uh
from mythology and from joseph campbell and also some of
the stuff that jordan peterson teaches is you know the
hero's journey i'm really big on the hero's journey but
but people people like jordan peterson and so on they
don't even joseph campbell didn't didn't understand what the hero's
journey was really about i have an episode called the
highest hero's journey go check that out it's very important
i also talked about it in my life purpose course
go check that out it basically shows you how to
do your hero's journey related to your career very powerful
um but uh the hero's journey i explained it in
that video about the highest hero's journey the hero journey
has these very stages and steps that you go through
hopefully you still remember some of those it's a long
video that i long time ago that i shot that
video basically the hero sets out on the journey then
he faces threshold guardians it's difficult he gets defeated by
the threshold guardians he perseveres he finds the wizard or
the wise old man who gives him knowledge and wisdom
and gives him a weapon or some sort of boon
he takes that weapon or and that wisdom and he
uses it to to face down the threshold guardians and
defeat them one by one by one eventually he defeats
enough of those and then finally he encounters uh the
deepest you know his deepest obstacle sort of the monster
that he's trying to destroy here like the final boss
of the game you might say um he he tries
to battle this monster this final boss he fails he's
not strong enough and then he enters what's called the
belly of the whale the belly of the whale is
the lowest point in the journey it's your deepest turning
inwards into yourself to really figure out do i have
what it takes to defeat the final boss and to
defeat the final boss which you need is you don't
need a magic sword it's not the problem it's not
that your sword is not big enough or that you
don't have enough health potions or something material like that
the problem the bottleneck ultimately is your own heart and
soul your spirit is your spirit steeled enough for the
battle ahead and it's in the belly of the whale
that really the boss is defeated because physically the boss
is out there you're in the belly of the whale
by yourself alone facing your own self your own weaknesses
your own ego what happens in the belly of the
whale is that you you finally face your own inner
deepest inner weaknesses and self-esteem issues and all that and
you you come out of that you might call that
the dark night of the soul and then finally you're
spiritually steeled enough now to go fight the final boss
and now victory against the final boss is guaranteed because
the true victory was already won in the belly of
the whale so nihilism is the belly of the whale
but the problem is that the belly of the whale
is the place where very few are willing to go
that's the lowest point in the spiritual journey that's where
the real spiritual work happens and so people invent all
sorts of external excuses for distractions and doing stuff that
is not actually going and taking them into the belly
of the whale and people might demonize the belly of
the whale they might say it's dangerous it's bad and
it is from the standpoint of ordinary life if you're
living your ordinary life you're not battling some giant boss
monster then for you entering the belly of the whale
is uh it's a bad thing it's difficult but if
you come out of it then you'll be a true
hero the hero's journey is just god realization that's what
the whole thing is about it's it's a it's a
myth it's a mythic archetype that shows you how to
how to reach god realization how to realize your own
true self as god so going through nihilism is necessary
and it makes you stronger it makes your mind stronger
so don't fear it just go go through it you
have to be careful because you can go through it
in a dysfunctional way where you end up killing yourself
you don't want to do that i talk about in
other videos some of the you know the different traps
and mistakes you can make going on this journey i
have a video called the dangers of spiritual work which
explains some of the there are real dangers i mean
it's dangerous being a hero is dangerous fighting a dragon
defeating a giant final boss dragon monster is dangerous it's
difficult it's a more difficult life than just living complacently
in mediocrity going to your nine-to-five job just punching the
clock and just doing what everybody else in society is
doing that's the difference between not being a hero and
being a hero so the tragedy for the lowercase and
nihilus is that they never realized that god was nothing
nihilism literally means nothing and what you realize at the
end of the journey once you defeat the dragons and
everything is that you're left with nothing god is nothing
these nihilists were so close and yet they were so
far and they don't understand what nothing is the nihilist
idea of nothing is not what god actually is god
is an infinite loving nothing which a nihilist usually doesn't
comprehend the purpose of spiritual practice is nihilism meditation nihilism
that's what it is you're trying to shut down your
mind to zero so look at this nihilism in theory
as a philosophy leads to depression angst negativity destruction and
anarchy and chaos and a bad life and suffering whereas
nihilism fully actualized not as a philosophy but actualized leads
to enlightenment sainthood god consciousness love and truth and a
playful joyful life it also leads to immortality by the
way because nothing what's the one thing that can't die
nothing by the way if you're confused here um when
i say nothing i'm not talking about the nothing you
think of and i'm not talking about non-existence nothingness is
not non-existence it exists nothing exists non-existence does not exist
there's no such thing as non-existence there's only existence so
very counterintuitively meaninglessness goes full circle into liberation see my
episode called the theme of things going full circle and
also see my episode called the counterintuitive nature of life
both of those episodes give many examples of this sort
of going full circle effect which leads to a lot
of counter-intuitive results and uh conclusions in life a lot
of thing a lot of times you think you're going
towards something and then it ends up actually leading you
all the way back to where you started in a
cyclical or spiral manner the really deep irony here is
so interesting is that those who reject nihilism are actually
the devils because the devil is the ego scared of
losing all of its constructions go check out my episode
called what is the devil where i explain that one
of my best episodes it'll open your eyes as to
how evil functions huh so ironically it's the christians and
the muslims and the buddhists and the hindus who are
the devils the atheists are also devils the scientists and
and rationalists are also devils metaphorically speaking and that they're
selfish they're not they're not willing to give up yourself
they're not they're not willing to give up their constructions
the devil is busy defending his constructions the constructions are
always finite and they always separate the devil from god
so the devil is just busy lurking in the shadows
away from the light avoiding the light of god ta-da
and of course the devil co-opts spiritual truths to put
on a facade of spiritual work so some of the
biggest devils are the people who portray themselves to be
the most spiritual which is why you see these sorts
of scandals with christian evangelicals and and other you know
religious hypocrites and people don't really like religion for this
reason because it's so obvious how hypocritical those religious preachers
are um and that's the reason that is because they've
got egos that they haven't deconstructed and their christianity and
their religion didn't give them the tools necessary to do
the deconstruction so god is nothing god is void god
is groundless the ground was ground god is shunyata god
is emptiness god is cessation god is nirvana god is
mu god is consciousness now you might say but leo
maybe that's true for the buddhists but it's not true
for the hindus the christians the jews the muslims and
so on um actually it is it's true for all
of them what the christians call love it's nothingness actually
what the hindus call shiva is nothingness what the jews
call einsof their name for god is nothingness the muslims
the sufis they refer to um to the deepest spiritual
realization as fana alfana which translates as the passing away
of the passing away it's a nihilism so deep that
it even erases itself it's a self-erasing eraser fauna alfana
that is allah and i have an episode called aztec
non-duality where i talk about the aztec religion and uh
tayotal if you still remember remember tayota um that's actually
a really powerful episode go go watch that one it
explains a lot about the nature of god um yeah
toyota there it's explained i give a lot of quotes
in that episode uh it's explained that tayota is a
infinite shape-shifter that has no form of its own in
other words toyota is nothingness or emptiness so ask yourself
this why are you so threatened by nothing if your
worldview is true as you believe it is like if
you're a scientist and you believe your worldview is true
then why are you so scared of deconstructing it if
it was true deconstruction couldn't harm it and you wouldn't
be so triggered and emotional about defending it the way
you get to truth is you burn everything to the
ground and then whatever remains is the truth the problem
of course and your ego mind intuits this is that
if you truly do burn everything in your life to
the ground nothing will survive your science won't survive your
religion won't survive uh you know jordan peterson's ideas won't
survive sam harris's ideas won't survive your ideas of god
won't survive your atheism won't survive the biggest challenge in
this work is admitting that everything you knew was wrong
it takes an enormous humility to admit that can you
just see that the reason most people don't do this
work is because they simply don't have the humility to
admit that everything they believe is wrong now see sometimes
people criticize me and say leo but you're so [
__ ] arrogant how dare you talk about humility i
might come across as arrogant as though i'm talking down
to you sometimes that's mostly just a stylistic thing what
people don't understand is that deep down epistemically i'm extremely
extremely humble leo that's outrageous how dare you say that
that's so arrogant of you to say i realize the
irony in paradox of it um how dare you say
that you know you you give definitive statements about god
absolute truth and about science you say you know all
this stuff only an arrogant narcissist would say such things
or consider or i spent 20 years deconstructing my mind
and my reality coming from a place of deep epistemic
humility questioning absolutely everything about myself to the point where
i deconstructed it all and then what i was left
with was absolute truth and you're and then you say
but leo if you were truly humble you would even
question that no that wouldn't be humility that would be
stupidity you don't question absolute truth once you find it
you've found it you've arrived that's it it's the end
of your ideas of being humble or arrogant it doesn't
matter anymore humility and arrogance these are just social games
you play again your judgments of me as being arrogant
or whatever this is just more defense mechanisms for you
it's a convenient excuse for you not to listen to
what's actually being said and pointed to which is not
to say that i can't work on my delivery and
make it more appealing and comforting to your ego and
so forth and a little less arrogant and it's in
a style a little less sort of definitive you see
just because i say something definitively this doesn't make me
arrogant ever say i'm the biggest skeptic that there is
it's just that you don't see my skeptical process because
it was done years ago i was i was doing
skepticism and nihilism back in my like when i was
17 years old you don't see that today because this
is what you get when you sort of come out
from the other end of the belly of the whale
okay so now let's get to the part where i
actually give you some practical tips on how to deal
with nihilism and relativity so if you're entering stage green
and stage green is deep like i said before you
can go very deep on stage green you enter very
deep on stage green and you start to realize that
everything is perspective you don't know is the left wing
more right than the right wing is the right wing
more right than the left wing what kind of economy
should we have are the socialists right are the capitalists
right who's wrong who's right you don't even know if
if leo is right you don't even know if actually.org
is right because if you're truly going through this nihilistic
process then you might say well okay leo says all
this stuff but he's just one guy he could be
deluded he could be wrong it could be just a
partial perspective what if leo is no better than a
you know a fundamentalist christian or muslim what if actualize.org
is just another one of those things what if it's
whatever cult or whatever you don't know how could you
know unless you have finished the process so you're in
this place and then and then you also might think
like well especially if you're young like college age you
might be thinking like well what kind of career should
i have should i be a writer should i be
an artist should i be a business person i pursue
money should i pursue my passions if i pursue my
passions where my will my where will i get my
money if i pursue my money then i'll hate it
and i won't have my passions what kind of major
should i major in what should i do in university
should i go to university should i go get a
job should i go into the business world should i
go on wall street should i chase you know stock
investing in cryptocurrency should i build up a big nest
egg and then go do my passion or show you
my passion now while i'm you know penniless what should
i do and then you're lost so how do you
handle this i went through a lot of this in
late high school and early college basically your problem is
that you need to find yourself and you can't find
yourself unless you lose yourself and the reason most people
don't find themselves is because they're too afraid of losing
themselves and going deep into this nihilistic relativistic process the
way that i handled it in my youth is i
sort of came to this conclusion i was stuck in
this multi-perspectivalism and neutrality non-judgment but then i realized okay
we have to make a distinction between absolute truth and
relative truth that's the distinction i made very early on
in my in my teens and i basically said that
religion science these sorts of things they're not absolutely true
but they might have relative truths to them and even
though it might not be absolutely true that for example
right-wing talk radio conservatives are are more wrong than or
right whichever uh then liberals and progressives so like maybe
i can't adjudicate this this conflict of ideology and politics
at the level of the absolute truth but i can
look at it at the level of relative truth for
example i can just look at what will make for
a better society like for example i could ask myself
the question when it comes to liberals and um conservatives
i can ask the question of like well who should
i vote for should i republican or democrat well in
the absolute sense from absolute perspective you could say it
doesn't matter and i can't know but from the relative
perspective i can say like do i care about the
environment do i want a cleaner healthier environment if i
do that i should vote for liberals rather than conservatives
because conservatives don't give a [ __ ] um do
i think that there's a problem in our society if
the middle class is shrinking from both sides and we
have this gap between the very poor and the very
rich at the top and that's growing over time is
that going to lead to a society i want to
live in that i will enjoy and my answer is
no well which party cares about that the liberals the
conservatives don't give a [ __ ] um and so
this you're thinking more from a survival perspective and so
basically um what i realized is that from the absolute
perspective i don't really know the truth but from the
relative perspective i still have preferences like there's things i
want out of life i want to live a passionate
life that's something i knew i wanted not because it's
absolutely true not because some god is forcing me to
not because i'm going to go to hell if i
don't not because i'm going to go to heaven and
afterlife not because science says so but simply because i
want a passionate life and that in and of itself
is valid it's his own valid thing and i and
also another another point that i made this is very
actually important very important lesson from this going through this
nihilism is that you learn what it teaches you is
you learn not to rationalize and justify your preferences and
biases in terms of objective truths or normative statements so
what i mean by that is that usually when an
ordinary human is pursuing something in their life they're going
to try to ground it in some absolute truth or
norm they're going to try to make it objective they're
gonna rationalize it in their mind so like if they're
pursuing a family rather than just saying you know what
i'm just selfish and i just wanna have a family
i wanna you know i like playing with kids i
think i'll enjoy that i like having a wife i
like the companionship of it i'll just enjoy that and
i'm just doing it for selfish purposes see instead of
being honest and admitting that to yourself what most people
do traditional people is to say oh well a family
this is good for society god wants me to have
a family and uh you know i we really need
this family to maintain our civilization so they come up
with all these [ __ ] rationalizations when really you
just want to be honest with yourself about your biases
you can have biases and preferences just admit them to
yourself you might say well leo that makes no difference
it actually makes a very big difference because when you
admit to yourself that what you're pursuing in life is
nothing other than your own selfishness and biases and preferences
and you don't try to ground it in genetics or
biology or some sort of story about how well i'm
gonna go in business and i'm gonna compete against that
business because it's survival of the fittest and you have
this whole story about how actually it's the fittest who
survived fittest deserve to win and this and that no
just tell yourself you're selfish [ __ ] and you
want money for sex tell yourself that that would be
more honest than coming up with some sort of um
you know survival of the fittest and perpetuating the species
and and this is i mean this is it's [
__ ] ridiculous the reality is you're horny and you
want sex it has nothing to do with evolution from
your perspective and um and if you like if if
you're going to be a christian be a christian but
then say to yourself i'm not a christian because being
a christian is the absolute truth i'm a christian because
i was born a particular part of the world where
christianity was popular i was indoctrinated with it i have
these preferences now i'm stuck with them and i'm gonna
go with it this is my preference it's purely arbitrary
it's not about truth it's not about the bible this
is just purely arbitrary i prefer these things over let's
say hinduism and so i'm just gonna i'm gonna do
that because i prefer i enjoy it i enjoy the
christian god more than i enjoy the hindu gods why
just because i'm selfish and i'm biased and that's what
i grew up in see if you admit that that
would be truthful and then you wouldn't have to play
these defensive games anymore and you would have freedom from
ideology likewise with science admit to yourself that science is
just something you were culturally conditioned into and that you
have a preference for it but that it's not the
best it's not the truest there could be important truths
in christianity that you haven't been taught in science and
so forth and then you'll have a much healthier attitude
towards science also an important way to to deal with
this relativity and nihilism is to study lots of perspectives
that's one of the that's one of the things you'll
actually be doing when you're in this nihilistic funk and
this period could last for two to five years of
your life maybe more very much depends on you and
how you go about it but during this period what
you will do is you will read lots of books
if you're doing it properly you'll watch lots of videos
you'll study lots of teachers lots of different traditions and
you will get different perspectives these perspectives will confuse the
[ __ ] out of you in the beginning you
won't know how to make heads or tales of these
perspectives some of these perspectives will be bad some of
them will be better and uh you'll have biases towards
different ones and you'll have to just kind of like
play around with them and not get married to anyone
and you can play them off each other you can
cross reference them sort of triangulate them to get closer
to truth what should help you is if you make
the distinction between lower quality versus higher quality perspectives because
not all perspectives are equal that's the difficulty of really
being lost in relativity is that you literally start to
think that all perspectives are equal and even when i
tell you that not all perspectives are equal you will
say well lia that's just also a perspective and it's
also equal to all the other perspectives so the perspective
that all perspectives are equal and the perspective that all
some perspectives are not equal to others that this itself
is a sort of a meta perspective and that too
is whatever i don't know how to make sense of
it see here you get really lost in a perspectival
madness but eventually you have to give you have to
live your life and what you realize is that how
you're living your life exhibits certain biases and preferences you
have so you can't live life neutrally even if you
say well i'm going to do nothing in my life
at all because i want to align with perfect neutrality
and perfect relativity i'll do nothing but that itself is
a choice you've made that itself is an action so
you're stuck in in life in such a way you're
situated in such a way you're in such an existential
bind that you have to act somehow and even non-action
is action even non-choice is choice so when you realize
that what you realize is well choices get made no
matter what there's a default position no matter what if
i do nothing something will still happen i'm not really
at a blank slate i've already got ideas programmed into
my mind whether scientific ones religious ones christian ones hindu
ones buddhist ones whatever and that is what will be
running the show if i make no changes and i
pretend to just be neutral i won't actually be neutral
by being neutral see when you really grasp this this
now starts to help you to actually choose things because
you realize that you can't avoid choosing things even if
you're going to die starve yourself you're still choosing that
so you can't escape making a choice and when you
realize that then you have to realize that well what
kind of choices do i want to make what will
make for a good life and you realize that basically
what you want is you want a good life that's
the point of life is to create a good life
you're free to create whatever life you want all of
this relativity all of these perspectives in a sense is
sort of like you're a little kid and i come
to you and i dump a giant garbage truck load
of legos in your room like literally a metric ton
of lego pieces of every possible type and color and
with these lego pieces you can construct anything and then
that's how life is and then sort of life asks
you what are you going to construct you might say
well what difference does it make what i construct i
can construct a castle or a spaceship or a gas
station or uh a car whatever does it matter which
one is one better than the other and if nobody
tells me like you might as a child you might
say well tell me which one is the best to
construct and i'll build it and then what if there's
no response what do you do well you could say
well [ __ ] it then i'm not going to
build anything okay but then that's what you chose you
built you have built something you've built nothing is that
what you want is that gonna make you happy if
it is do that if it isn't why not do
something that makes you happy why make yourself miserable in
life so see by going through this chain of logic
you realize oh yeah the only thing left to do
in life is to make myself happy but then what
makes me happy i don't know i don't know what
makes me happy i think i might know but how
do i know that what i think i know will
actually make me happy and maybe i'll try some of
those things and i'll realize it doesn't make me happy
that could be useful feedback to figure out what does
make me happy so the point of life is to
basically play with these legos build different things and to
realize like well yeah i've built this castle i don't
like castles i built a pirate ship i don't like
pirate ships i built this car i don't like cars
i built this gas station on a gas station so
at some point you build something you say oh i
built something i built this unicorn oh i like unicorns
i like animals so maybe now i should start building
more animal legos so now you build a giraffe it's
like oh i like the giraffe even more than the
unicorn okay and then you build a dragon you're like
oh i like dragons even more i like i like
fantastical monsters so now you start to build uh you
know chimeras and manticores and goblins and things and now
and then and then you through this process you discover
like oh this is what i love about life is
building these mystical creatures and the more outlandish and mystical
they are the more excited i get and this is
what joseph campbell called following your bliss and through this
process you discover your life purpose i talk about that
more in my 25 hour life purpose course check that
out um so you see and the trick is that
you never fool yourself in this process that dragons and
manticores and goblins are better than anything else because the
other kids when they're playing with their legos what they
do first of all they're playing with a very limited
set of legos you're playing with like a a dump
truck full of them and they're playing with like 100
pieces their pieces are very limited their colors are very
limited so what they can build is very limited and
all that they're building is what every other kid around
them is building so if the kids around them are
building castles they end up building castles even though they
probably don't like castles but they build it anyways because
everyone's building castles and if i don't build a castle
people are gonna think i'm weird and i'm too weak
to stand up against that and i haven't discovered what
i really like to build and what i can build
is so miniscule compared to what that kid can build
with a dump truck full of different legos and when
somebody brings some additional legos you know in addition to
the 100 that i'm comfortable with they bring another 100
that are totally new and unique and different and different
colors and shapes and stuff they bring that to me
and i look at i'm like oh that's that's that's
evil that's wrong that's that's not the kind of legos
we play around with here those aren't castle pieces i
only want castle pieces and then now there's a fight
and a debate about why those are bad and these
castle pieces are the best and these god has ordained
these castle pieces he he hates the the pirate ship
cat the pat the pirate ship pieces those are from
the devil or those are irrational illogical they're too mystical
these creatures like if if you're doing this from a
scientific perspective you might be building like a spaceship right
you're building a spaceship you're this science nerd logic nerd
and then i come to you and i show you
my like fantastical lego dragon unicorn manticore goblin creatures and
you look at them and you're like oh my god
what kind of airy fairy fairy tale woohoo stuff is
that that's not scientific the only thing you can build
with lego pieces is spaceships that's the only valid use
of of lego pieces it has to be rational everything
has to be perfect squares and corners it has to
be scientifically accurate not these [ __ ] monsters that
you build and then i go well here here's some
here's some monster pieces that you can use to make
like organic living ships and stuff and the guy's like
no that's not how you build ships those aren't valid
ships that's not scientific that's not rational i don't want
to build your irrational ships i want to build my
my little simplistic ships um the way that all my
friends do see and so you artificially constrain yourself to
a much narrower life and you get less joy from
life and you know what the funny thing is is
that you might not even enjoy building those spaceships you
might actually want to build dragons but you're too scared
and your mind is too paradigm locked to venture out
into that space so anyways as you're dealing with this
nihilism you want to be studying lots of different perspectives
you have a lot of grist for the mill it's
going to leave you very confused and that's okay i
have an episode actually called how to deal with confusion
confusion is when the ego mind doesn't know how to
make sense of reality most people are scared of confusion
and they they think it's a bad thing they think
not knowing is a bad thing you're also going to
be not knowing a lot of stuff and so the
solution is to just embrace not knowing don't view it
as a negative thing embrace confusion and just trust the
process trust that as you're going through life and you're
studying a lot of different perspectives first of all this
is fun it's [ __ ] fun treat it as
fun play with ideas play with perspectives and trust that
slowly over time pieces like a puzzle will start to
fit together and you will develop some criteria for adjudicating
between lower perspectives and higher perspectives i can give you
some of this criteria but again you can't just believe
it you have to verify it for yourself so in
a sense what you're doing is you're sort of building
up your own epistemology from scratch by questioning everything this
is very very healthy to do so what are some
signs that a perspective is higher or lower fear hatred
judgment violence rejection of certain parts of reality and dogma
and ideology and clinging an attachment these are all telltale
signs of lower perspectives lower perspectives are all those things
are close-minded they're selfish they're fear-based they're hatred-based they're based
on us versus them they're best based on denial of
certain aspects of reality and the demonization thereof they also
try to monopolize perspective in other words when a perspective
says that ignore other perspectives just focus on me just
me my perspective is the the best one all the
other ones are stupid when a perspective does that it's
a lower class perspective because it's being selfish how about
the higher perspectives what distinguishes those well basically the opposite
of that higher perspectives are open they're non-monopolistic they're interested
in exploring more perspectives they don't lock you down into
one perspective in fact they they imagine a perspective that
tells you that you should study all the perspectives they're
meta they have a meta quality they're selfless they're loving
they're fearless they're courageous they're playful they're exploratory they're more
nuanced and sophisticated they're more complex they're more systemic they're
more holistic they're more self-aware in other words there are
some perspectives that are aware that they are perspective whereas
there are other perspectives lower perspectives that are not aware
that they are perspectives they treat themselves as reality that's
dangerous so you have to really be careful and watch
for the how a perspective tries to lock you in
even something like science see everyone kind of understands that
religion will try to lock you in but most people
don't understand that science is a perspective that tries to
lock you in for example science will lock you in
and try to prevent you from studying mystical or new
age stuff or paranormal stuff or religion that already should
clue you in on the dangers of the scientific perspective
which is not to say you shouldn't study it also
as you're studying all these perspectives try to find the
good in all these perspectives try to steal man the
perspectives so a low quality perspective will try to straw
man other perspectives where it's incapable of steel manning them
whereas a higher quality perspective is capable of steel manning
all perspectives and it's not just being selfish you see
the steel man straw man thing is just really selfishness
so really the distinguishing characteristic between higher and lower is
selfish versus selfless and also the higher perspective is able
to make sense of and understand the lower but the
lower is not able to make sense of and understand
the higher this is a crucial distinction so for example
a fundamentalist muslim probably doesn't understand and cannot make a
steel man out of christianity and a christian probably can't
do that with islam but you can find higher perspectives
which actually are able to make steel men out of
all the religions all the religious perspectives and they're able
to explain them and find the good aspects of them
but also be honest about the the bad aspects of
them you can also find perspectives that are able to
understand both religion and science but you can also find
perspectives that only understand science but can't understand religion and
you can find perspectives that understand religion but can't understand
science so the more powerful perspective is the one that
can understand everything beneath it basically it's more inclusive and
so you're moving towards greater inclusivity also the higher perspectives
are more intellectually rigorous and honest they have more integrity
whereas the lower perspectives do not so for example one
of the ways you can tell that right wing talk
radio is a very low quality perspective is because of
just how little integrity it has very little integrity the
way they skew the facts the way they cherry pick
data um the way they distort stories the sort of
emotion they throw into it the the way they make
it ideological the way they turn it into a sort
of a battle um the way they make you hate
the other side this these are all signs that this
is a low quality perspective and that the people themselves
speaking they have very little intellectual integrity which is why
you find them saying one thing one year and another
you know they're switching their positions all the time they
use double standards all the time the sanders they apply
to their party they don't apply to the other party
as soon as the other party is out of power
you know the standards completely change this is what you
see and i'm not saying the left wing is immune
to that it's not it has that but to a
much lesser degree than right-wing talk radio that's some of
the worst perspective you know some of the lowest quality
lowest integrity perspectives you can find and you might wonder
at this point well leo but how do i know
that what you're telling me is true i mean all
this you said is just one more perspective yeah that's
right you don't know i'm telling you the conclusions i've
come to after 20 years of doing this work if
you're new to this then you don't know and you're
gonna have to go through maybe a 10 or 20
year process to figure out and to come to conclusions
that i came to or maybe you'll come to your
own different conclusions but eventually if you're doing this process
correctly you'll realize that what i just told you here
is gold this is gold this is i'm telling you
how to distinguish truth from falsehood in the end the
biggest thing that distinguishes truth from falsehood is fear versus
love that's the easiest way if a perspective is coming
from fear it's false if a perspective is coming from
love it's true because what you'll ultimately realize is that
truth is love and then there's just many many degrees
of it so in the end what you discover after
you go through this nihilistic phase is that you discover
that the best way to live your life is to
live your life like it is a work of art
live for beauty and live for love and live for
truth and live selflessly not because you have to not
because somebody told you to do it but simply because
love is its own reward what do you want ultimately
in your life you want to love your life you
want love in your life you want others who love
you in your life and you want others whom you
can love in your life that's what you ultimately want
even if you're a nihilist and so the only thing
to do is just to surrender to love and to
align yourself deeper with love and to find what are
the authentic ways of you of loving for you of
loving reality and life and put your focus into that
love work towards that love with courage ignore all the
distractions and the lower consciousness stuff and then what's going
to happen is that you're going to come out of
this nihilistic funk and relativity towards a a life that
is actually very purposeful but it's purposeful in a sort
of a higher order way in a meta way it's
a meta purpose it's a purpose with a capital p
beyond uh the lower p purpose it's your own authentic
purpose and really your own authentic purpose is just your
love for life expressed uniquely through you free of the
distortions and corruptions of social conditioning and that is how
you deal with nihilism all right i'm all done here
please click like button for me and come check out
actualize.org that's my website you will find on there my
book list you will find the life purpose course that
i mentioned you will find my blog you will find
the forum you can support me on patreon.com actualized you
can check out my new second channel called actualizedclips and
then really what actualize that org is about is it's
about guiding you through this nihilistic process but in a
very practical and positive way because truly nihilism is [Music]
the most positive of things when you do it properly
the problem is that most people don't do it properly
they get stuck and so i sort of pioneered this
process for myself from a young age thinking about epistemology
and metaphysics and philosophy very deeply and taking it from
the point where it was just philosophy to the point
where you're starting to implement it in your life and
using it to change your life at a practical level
and then it starts to change how you feel about
yourself you stop being a victim you stop getting depressed
you develop a sense of meaning in your life that
is authentic to you you're honest with yourself about the
meaning you're not fooling yourself you're not trying to rationalize
it or grounded in some sort of social construct you're
freeing up your mind more your mind gets liberated you're
able to think more laterally more outside the box you're
able to be more creative you're able to be a
better artist and and then from this sort of foundation
you can set up the rest of your life and
then eventually you can you can awaken and you can
reach god realization and you can break through into infinite
love and then you can bring it back down to
earth and exhibit it in your practical everyday life which
is really what the hero's journey is about the hero
is not defeating the dragon just for the sake of
defeating the dragon the hero is defeating the dragon to
acquire the holy grail which is literally immortality or god
the hero is realizing god realizing love and then bringing
that holy grail back to his villagers and helping them
to drink from the cup of infinite love in his
own way that is the hero's journey that is what's
most worthwhile to do and that cup that love is
nothing perfectly consistent with true nihilism you
