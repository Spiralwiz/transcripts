hey this is Leo for actualised dari and I want
to talk to you about the defining moment what is
the defining moment the defining moment is that point in
an endeavor that you're undertaking or a project that you're
working on or anything that you're trying to master where
you feel like giving up it's when your brain says
ah you know I don't want to do this anymore
let's quit it's too hard or you know what I'm
just bored let's go watch TV or you know what
this project isn't going to be a successful I thought
it would so I'm just going to drop it so
all the excuses that your mind will come up with
to get you to go back to the status quo
that you were at before and to stop working on
this thing that you are working on you know whatever
project or endeavor it might be might be something at
work might be something hobby related whatever you're trying to
master and I think what really sets people apart the
people that get success in their life and the people
that are able to accomplish something the people that are
able to get really good and master something versus those
people that are kind of ordinary and mediocre and are
not good at anything and I'm not accomplished anything is
that they lean in to those moments those defining moments
right when their brain is telling them to give up
because those moments you actually do a reframe here and
you can refrain yourself when in the middle of a
project and something just goes horribly wrong and you want
to quit what you can say is that this is
exactly what happens with everybody else out there right with
the six billion people they're living on the earth whenever
they undertake something the reason that most of these people
are average or mediocre by definition is because they want
to do the things that are easy the things that
are comfortable and so when they get an idea to
go out there do something new like learn a new
hobby or start a new business or advance their career
what ends up happening is that at first they're gung-ho
and they jump on it and they work eagerly and
they're getting some success but then they start seeing obstacles
in the resistance and also their brain starts to send
them signals of discomfort because now they're actually advancing out
of their comfort zone and their life situation is changing
but your body in your brain has to want to
keep you in homeostasis even if you're advancing in a
positive direction it still wants to keep you in homeostasis
just because that's kind of how your biology is wired
so whether it's a fitness goal or a business goal
this tends to happen you don't have like a thermostat
setpoint with your with your body in your brain and
so what happens is that as you're hitting those boundaries
as you're getting to the upper boundary of your thermostat
setpoint then you start getting these these excuses coming up
from your brain and this discomfort and most people start
giving up at that point you if you're smart what
you're going to recognize is that this is happening this
is a normal process that you're going through and that
every project every endeavor is going to have its setbacks
is roadblocks and that the reason that more people aren't
successful doing whatever it is you're trying to do especially
let's say with your career or your business the reason
that you're trying to go after in the first place
is because let's say it's profitable right if you're trying
to become a doctor that's a long path to becoming
a doctor and it's also a profitable path there's a
reason why you're doing that hopefully there's more to it
than just profit but let's just talk about profit for
a second there's that if you're starting a new business
right in some area of the market that you have
to work at hard to get success in well the
reason that you're working hard is probably because you see
that there's some money to be made there there's some
potential but the reason that there's actually potential there is
because nobody else has come in and taken that that
niche yet the reason they haven't taken it is exactly
for this reason because it is an uphill battle if
it was super easy if it was just a cakewalk
someone would have come in and already gotten it and
then it wouldn't be very valuable to you anymore and
the same thing with being a doctor the reason that
a doctor gets paid so much is because they do
have to go through hell to become doctors right whereas
someone works at McDonald's they don't really need a lot
of education or training to do that and so they
get paid appropriately so if you're chasing after something valuable
if you're pursuing rather something valuable in your business or
in your career then the point here is when you're
feeling discouraged that's the time when you actually want to
get excited because here's how you have to reframe in
your mind it's like oh okay I'm about to quit
that means that if I make it through this obstacle
I just burned a good chunk of my competition right
it's kind of like when you're running a race and
I don't like to make this competitive but I think
sometimes you know life is competitive and I think in
the marketplace there are competitive forces that determine how much
someone gets paid whether in business or in career and
so I don't think that you're always competing against other
people by no means is that true but let's say
that you're running a race right and you're running like
a marathon race with a thousand other people and you're
running a big big tall mountain obstacle course you're doing
something something gnarly where you have pits and falls and
people are falling by the wayside and people getting tired
all this is happening you know every extra mile that
you make it that's an extra mile that somebody else
refused to go through because it was too tough they
quit they gave up for whatever reason so if there's
an obstacle it's almost like if you were running that
race and you saw that there was like a pit
full of alligators and there's like a rope that you
had to swing through and that your chances of swinging
through that pit with alligators was like 5% on the
one hand it's kind of scary right it's like damn
well I don't want to follow that alligator pit okay
fair enough but if you do make it through think
of think of the flip side of it what does
it mean if you make it through if you had
a 5% chance of making it through and you did
then you just beat 95% of everybody else right you're
at the top you're all of a sudden there's something
that you did something exceptional that other people didn't do
and in most cases we're not ever faced with a
such life in death situation like that but I think
like in your career just something simple you know even
if you're bored right now on your career and you're
feeling like oh you know I put in a couple
of years and now I'm getting to this phase where
I'm just kind of bored with my career it doesn't
seem to be advancing as quickly as it used to
be well think about it most people are probably that
same exact position in your career and if you want
to really advance the to the top ranks of your
career you got to figure that you're going to to
go through that phase and you got to ask yourself
if you really want it then you should stick with
it and the silver lining is that a lot of
people are going to be deterred by that by that
lull that you're now going through and a lot of
people will decide to quit because of that but you
can decide to be different and that's the defining moment
that's why I called the defining moment and Seth Godin
talks about this beautifully in his book the dip that
I highly recommend he talks all about this is that
when you're feeling this dip he calls it the dip
when you're feeling this moment of discouragement in whatever it
is that you're pursuing then you got to really ask
yourself is this worthwhile and if it is worthwhile this
is a an endeavor a purpose for you that's really
meaningful that you can see has a lot of long-term
potential down the road then what you got to do
is you've got to plow through no matter what and
you can't quit despite how you feel in a moment
and in fact you've got to reframe it and tell
yourself that this is a defining moment and that this
dip is going to stop a lot of the competition
it's going to it's going to really create me this
dip is also something that's challenging you and quite literally
making you better right because it's asking more of you
counter kind of counterintuitive Lee this little lull that you're
going through maybe you're actually not very productive in it
maybe you're actually not learning a lot of stuff but
the fact that you're going to make it through this
lull in your career this this phase where nothing much
is happening that's still growing you because you're learning to
cope with that maybe you're learning to cope with boredom
maybe you're learning that you need to take yourself up
another notch right maybe you're learning that there's something that
you're doing or something you don't know that could take
you and take that lull and turn it into an
expansion and so that Lowell is going to make you
aware of that fact and maybe that's going to prompt
you and kick you in the ass to go out
there and actually do something learn something new ask somebody
else how they dealt with the problem and eventually get
through that whereas a lot of other people will just
give up and so that's ultimately how you get to
those to that rarified top you know if you if
you're interested in being world class a world class athlete
a world class entrepreneur world class any profession that you're
trying to master world class out of any hobby or
trying to mask if you're trying to come really good
the reason that you're going to get world-class is because
you're going to go through all these obstacles that have
being basically like filters that are filtered out one layer
of candidates another layer of candidates another layer of candidates
and another layer of candidates and the reason that's happened
is because there's emotional labor involved and most people are
too lazy to go through the emotional labor of achieving
their goals that's why you have to be super driven
usually to achieve your goals especially if you want to
be in some high-level position in life right if you
want to be like a really well-paid movie star or
you want to be a politician or you want to
be a leader in your industry or you want to
be running like a hundred million dollar business the way
you do that is because because those positions are so
an vehicle everybody wants one of those positions the question
is are you willing to work for it because there's
billions of people in the world everybody would want one
for free and everybody would probably want it for a
small cost and maybe a lot of people would still
even want it for a medium cost and maybe even
still a lot of people would want for even a
high cost but are people going to want it for
the extreme cost probably not and that's why most people
are not highly paid athletes or actors or the President
of the United States or owning a hundred million dollar
business right because they've been filtered out and then want
it bad enough and the ultimate solution to that is
to have a vision have a purpose that's why I'm
so big on life purpose and I'm telling you that
you got to get that really straightened out for yourself
because I want you to go to the top I
want you to achieve your full potential and I know
that to do that you're gonna have to go through
quite a bit of obstacles it's going to be a
gauntlet that you're going to run and you're going to
have these moments for you I want to give up
and I want to set you up for success in
the long run and to be world-class to get there
to be super successful to have all the high high
level peak experiences that you get when you're really on
the top of your game in position like that well
to do that you need to have really vision you
need to be extra motivated and if you don't have
that vision right now don't despair that's something that can
be corrected so I don't want you to think that
well I don't have a vision so I'm kind of
stuck I'm ordinary I'm not going to be successful that's
not the case at all you can build vision and
I thought it might in my life there been points
where I've had no vision at all and I built
it up it's a process right I have a lot
of videos and techniques and strategies for how to build
up vision so I'm not going to cover that here
but the point being is that when you face those
defining moments I want you to think about them differently
start to see them as something really positive because those
defining moments are really defining how motivated and committed you
are to your goal and really each of those moments
that you see you should be thanking yourself and saying
wow this is an opportunity for me to really advance
if I just if I just go through it you
know if I just make it past this little obstacle
that's a huge advance for me so that can be
a nice reframe where you're going through a tough time
I know sometimes you know you're at the gym and
you want to quit or you're on the middle of
a project and something goes wrong your hard drive crashes
you lose some data or whatever happens your boss gets
mad at you customers get upset something catastrophic happens and
you want to quit and really what you got to
tell yourself is that this is the time when you
got to keep going alright this is Leo I'm going
to sign off now go ahead and share your comments
about the dip tell me about where you've experienced the
dip and maybe some of the struggles that you're facing
right now and maybe how you persevered and how that's
paid off for you and then if you like this
of course please share it and like it I want
to spread this message around Thanks you
