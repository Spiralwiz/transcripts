            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/yAmb4H0PRAs' target='_blank'>The Importance Of Real Yoga</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Misunderstanding of Real Yoga</b>: Western understanding of yoga tends to focus on hatha yoga or a physical exercise and relaxation routine offered in gyms, which lacks the meditative and spiritual essence of real yoga that is rooted in ancient India. Yoga means "union," symbolic for the collapse of distinct identities and realization of oneness. The aim of true yoga is enlightenment or awakening, not merely relaxation or exercise. 
</li><li><b>Genuine Purpose of Yoga</b>: Yoga is meant to profoundly silence your mind, enabling awareness and union with the absolute. Its techniques purify the body and mind to prepare for profound mystical states. The practice aims to clear chakras, the energy centres located along the spine, to eliminate physical and emotional blockages holding back awakening. Chakras help regulate energy flow and, when cleared, could relieve certain health conditions and improve overall vitality. Yoga can also develop spiritual abilities, or "cities," but these should not be the primary focus.
</li><li><b>Benefits of Yoga</b>: Yoga portrays a more holistic approach to awakening than traditional meditation or self-inquiry, involving the body in addition to the mind. Yoga has the power to hasten progress towards awakening, taking less time than regular meditation, and goes beyond traditional meditation in that it can lead to permanent awakening by opening the crown chakra and other energy centres.
</li><li><b>Yoga versus Western Yoga</b>: The westernization of yoga focuses on aspects like exercise, relaxation, and flexibility, often disregarding yoga's metaphysical aspects and consciousness awakening. Conversely, real yoga, being a meditative and spiritual practice, offers a deeper and broader range of benefits, including emotional release, improved energy flow, and potential for awakening. 
</li><li><b>Introduction to Yoga</b>: If one attempts traditional meditation or self-inquiry and struggles to see progress, Leo Gura proposes incorporating yoga as a powerful tool. He considers himself a researcher into spiritual and personal development techniques, encouraging open-mindedness and a willingness to experiment with various methods to discover success. 
</li><li><b>Yoga and Chakra System</b>: Yoga employs techniques to clear and open the system of seven chakras or energy centres located along the spine, enabling the release of tension, energy, and emotions. By purifying these energy pathways and channeling Kundalini energy from the base of the spine to the top, significant physical and emotional benefits may be realized, leading to awakening.
</li><li><b>Westernization of Yoga</b>: Western culture has adopted a physical, exercise-focused form of yoga, primarily for health, relaxation, and community, which skews away from the primary purpose of traditional Yoga. 
</li><li><b>Metaphysical Aspect of Yoga</b>: The main focus of real yoga is metaphysical understanding and consciousness awakening. Western yoga often strips this crucial aspect, focusing more on physicality rather than mental exercises and techniques that channel energy towards awakening and mind tranquility.
</li><li><b>Different Schools of Yoga</b>: There exists several branches of yoga including Ashtanga yoga or Raja Yoga, Gyana yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga, Kundalini Yoga, and Kriya yoga, each holding different paths to achieve union with the absolute. Every branch has sub-schools that hold varied techniques and often find themselves in disagreement.
</li><li><b>Yoga Superiority over Meditation and Self-Inquiry</b>: Yoga is deemed superior as it clears chakras, purges trauma and emotions, and awakens mind and body in a more holistic manner. It might also cure certain diseases, thereby increasing one's capacity to go deeper into practices. Yoga offers quicker and stronger results with less time investment than traditional meditation. 
</li><li><b>Breathwork in Yoga</b>: Yoga emphasizes proper breathing techniques, transforming breathing from shallow chest breathing to deep belly breath. Breath acts as the source of physical vitality and energy, while a regulated breathing pattern promotes better mental focus and stillness.
</li><li><b>Issues with self-inquiry and traditional meditation</b>: Many people struggle with self-inquiry and traditional meditation due to poor concentration skills, often exacerbated by digital media addiction. Yoga can help develop better concentration and even paranormal abilities. It can also help address the problem of intellectualization, which is common in self-inquiry practices, thereby preventing stagnation.
</li><li><b>Need for a guru and issues with finding a suitable one</b>: Traditionally, yoga schools require a guru for learning yogic techniques, involving surrender, initiation, vows of secrecy, and a gradual imparting of techniques over several years. However, finding a good, trustworthy, and geographically accessible guru can be challenging. Also, gurus can introduce unwanted religious or dogmatic elements in the teachings.
</li><li><b>Recommendation of Kriya yoga and a specific book</b>: Leo Gura recommends Kriya Yoga, in particular the original teachings of Lahiri, the master of Kriya Yoga. He suggests a particular book, available on his book list, which includes all the techniques taught by Lahiri in detail, along with worksheets and an exercise plan for developing a Kriya yoga practice from beginner to advanced stages. The book makes practicing yoga straightforward, powerful, and safe without the need for a guru.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's Experiment</b>: Leo Gura himself has started practicing the yoga techniques from this book and has seen benefits. He plans to keep practicing for a year and invites others to join him.
</li><li><b>Commitment to the practice</b>: Aspiring practitioners should commit at least 30-60 minutes daily to yoga and stick to it for a minimum of one year. The commitment might boost quietening of the mind, transformation of breathing, increased consciousness and awareness of the spine, improvement in health, potential experience of Samadhi states, and progressive opening of chakras.
</li><li><b>Potential benefits and timescale</b>: After approximately twelve months of practice, significant mystical experiences and profound states of consciousness can be expected, though the actual duration may vary from individual to individual based on their previous experiences and practice.
</li><li><b>Questioning the scientific validity of Yoga</b>: Leo Gura addresses doubts about the scientific validity of yoga, chakras, Kundalini, and awakenings. He emphasizes that traditional Western science focuses solely on materialistic aspects, neglecting the metaphysical aspect of human existence.
</li><li><b>Psychoanalysis versus Yoga Practices</b>: Contrasting the external observation-focused approach of Western psychology to the internal investigation of yoga, Leo defends the latter as a science of consciousness, providing a deeper understanding of the human mind. 
</li><li><b>Personal reason for championing Yoga</b>: Leo gives insight into his motivations, sharing his interest in mastering his emotions, consciousness, and his inner self rather than focusing on academic validation or studies. 
</li><li><b>Exploring metaphysical techniques through personal experimentation</b>: He challenges scientific skepticism and urges viewers to experiment with yoga practices. He emphasizes that the results derived from these experiments are of utmost importance, countering common concerns about placebo effects.
</li><li><b>Addressing skepticism about chakras and Kundalini</b>: Instead of focusing on concrete, physical proof for the existence of chakras and Kundalini energy, Leo encourages individuals to view them as models or tools for personal development and spiritual growth.
</li><li><b>Potential resistance to yoga practices</b>: Leo warns of the resistance that may come with the deep, transformative experiences that yoga can bring, comparing it to psychotherapy where discussing painful experiences signals the area needed for healing.
</li><li><b>Acknowledgement of the necessity for a proper Guru</b>: Leo recognizes the traditional need for a guru in learning yoga but also acknowledges the potential problems, such as corruption and dogma. He recommends a self-driven approach over a guru-led one.
</li><li><b>Kriya Yoga's Do-It-Yourself Approach</b>: Leo Gura lowers emphasis on needing a guru for spiritual progress, instead suggesting a solo practice with Kriya Yoga. Chalking it as a "do-it-yourself" approach, where one's personal relationship with the universe is the core focus. All techniques are accessible, free, and open source, providing a sense of self-sufficiency.
</li><li><b>Combining with Other Techniques</b>: While Kriya Yoga is effective, Leo insists on not limiting oneself to a single tool. He suggests combining it with self-inquiry, meditation, personal development techniques, and contemplation, including using psychedelics, journaling, reading theory, and other personal development methods.
</li><li><b>Swerving Western Yoga for Kriya Yoga</b>: There is emphasis on understanding the limitations of western, gym-style yoga. While it may provide suitable physical benefits, it barely scratches the surface of original yoga's spiritual tapestry. He encourages to incorporate Kriya Yoga techniques along with the western methods and move closer towards the original teachings.
</li><li><b>Distinct Goals of Yoga</b>: Leo points out three ultimate goals of yoga: achieving a permanent state of union with one's environment (sahaja Samadhi), realization of one's true nature as infinity, and purifying all karma and ego. Purification entails getting rid of bad habits, thinking patterns, trauma, and other obstructive elements that are impairing human potential.
</li><li><b>Destination before Route</b>: Most people undertake the self-help journey without a clear understanding of their end goals. Knowing the destination, it would be easier to chart the course. Leo stresses the importance of action, recommending devoting at least 60 minutes per day to yoga practice to observe significant transformations in ones life.
</li><li><b>Potency of Books</b>: Leo underlines the underrated power contained in books. On repeat encounters with certain books, he acknowledges their ability to provide all the wisdom one needs to master life. Theory isn't everything, but it serves as a fundamental foundation for successful development.
</li><li><b>Sharing Future Insights</b>: Leo promises to continue sharing the most effective techniques for mastering life's aspects through his platforms. Recognizing that hundreds of techniques exist, he prioritizes those that provide maximal results for the time invested.
