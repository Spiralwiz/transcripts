hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment in about ten minutes I'm going to
tell you the benefits of meditation and really this should
convince you why you should be doing meditation which I
bet right now you're not if you're looking at this
video so quickly what are the benefits of meditation there
are many of them and they're really really powerful so
let's start with some of the basics first meditation is
good for reducing stress so if you're stressed out in
your life if you're having a lot of stray negative
thoughts you've got a lot of monkey chatter up in
there and you can't keep focused meditation is just the
right thing for you and it's really the right thing
for everybody because all of us are all always plagued
by negative thoughts distracting thoughts we're not able to focus
which is preventing us from getting the kind of performance
that we want our life and also getting the kind
of peace and kind of a tranquility that we want
in our lives right who wants to be stressed so
meditation is great for that meditation of course going along
with this theme of focus is great for building up
your prefrontal cortex this is scientifically proven it literally builds
up the the front part of your brain here which
is responsible for controlling impulses and responsible for this self
discipline basically so you can be more creative you can
be more productive you can be a better thinker you
can be sharper with your mind and you can be
more disciplined and stick to your habits better and get
the stuff that you need to get done easier with
less pain involved and less waffling less procrastination if you
do meditation so another awesome benefit another benefit create of
of meditation is performance it improves your performance at work
it will improve your performance in athletic events and sports
it will improve your performance in your relationships it will
just improve performance everywhere it just kind of spills over
into all of your life because what it does is
it just kind of calms you down it makes you
grounded it makes you happy in being right here in
the moment right now and when you're like that and
you're relaxed performing from a relaxed place rather than intense
and stressed place it's always good and making decisions from
a relaxed place is also very very good because when
you're stressed and you're overwhelmed and you're overworked and you're
fearful and you have these negative thoughts how are you
gonna make an effective decision in your business and your
career in a relationship you're not going to be able
to you're gonna be influenced by those emotions by those
negative emotions whereas if you're clear minded and you're very
conscious then you can make very smart decisions you can
resist impulses like going for that doughnut when you know
you shouldn't or falling off your gym routine or not
performing well at work you're just gonna be able to
stick with those things much easier because you're gonna be
able to control your impulses the next benefit of meditation
is actual brain health so we talked about building up
the the willpower muscle which is which is awesome it
gets you a lot of performance but there's also the
brain health benefits there's been a lot of MRI studies
and fMRI studies and other brain scan studies have been
done over the last couple of decades these are new
technologies that are showing the benefits of meditation and what
they do is they take a look at like monks
that have been meditating for decades and they took a
look at normal people and they take a look at
people who for example have degenerative brain disease like Alzheimer's
or various brain tumors and cancers and just poor and
brain shape physically that the brain is just alike is
deteriorated and what they find out is that the brain
is the health of the brain is improved with how
much the brain is being used it's just like any
other muscle in your body the brain is not a
muscle but it behaves like a muscle so when you're
training it up you're actually making it healthier you're making
it stronger you're making it more complex the structures of
it or actually working and what has been shown is
that when you meditate you reduce the effects of brain
degeneration with age you reduce things like memory loss which
tends to happen with age because you're still using your
brain you keep your prefrontal cortex working you keep all
other parts of your brain working and you prevent Alzheimer's
disease so those are some really powerful benefits of meditation
and let's see what else do we have next on
the list I think I will cover let's cover enlightenment
this is kind of something that I'm a little bit
hesitant to cover especially in a newbie introductory quick segment
like this because enlightenment is a very deep topic it
takes serious commitment to reach to if you're not willing
to spend the years and maybe a decade or more
in serious contemplation and meditation then you're never going to
reach it but I think a state of enlightenment is
something that you can really shoot for it can be
a long-term vision of yours and it's really awesome because
what happens when you reach a state of enlightenment is
literally your ego melts away the petty distinctions that you
make right now the judgments the criticisms all the emotional
baggage that you have all that melts away and you
become one with the source you become like one with
the universe and you see everything interconnected and like you
feel everything as love you drop all the fears you
have you drop all the anger and the pettiness and
life just becomes a joy just a joy right now
in a moment that's something that's like amazing to reach
that kind of level I've nowhere near that kind of
level but I aspire to be at some point which
is a lie and do a lot of meditation right
now and I'm really committed to it it's because I
want to get to that point that to me that's
it's a really amazing peak experience to have in life
it's to reach that state of enlightenment so that is
out there for you next on the list I would
say is of course I should mention this earlier but
it's just happiness it makes you happier meditation makes you
happier because you're just happy without external stimulation it's so
much of life and so much of culture is getting
hooked on external stimulation whether it's food drugs alcohol television
media gossip whatever but when we can just be happy
right here in the moment in the present without worrying
about the past or worrying about the future just be
happy I mean what more do you want from life
that's ultimately the ultimate aim of life is to be
happy and if you can get that by basically doing
nothing but meditating and meditation is nothing but just sitting
down and clearing your mind of thoughts it's that simple
with subtle variations in technique then that's what you want
did you want happiness why not give that to yourself
right now rather than go chasing money or a trophy
wife or great car or house you don't need that
stuff to be happy you can get that through meditation
a lot cheaper a lot simpler to do it that
way time time-honoured been proven through millennia that it works
and I think the last point that I'll cover as
a benefit of meditation is this idea of meditation is
therapy if you do meditation consistently and you have to
do it consistently and that means on a daily basis
then what will happen is that naturally from your subconscious
things will bubble up you will start to get quirks
that are in your subconscious to bubble up and your
eat because your ego what's happening is that your ego
is resisting the meditation and as you meditate more and
more your ego has to your brain has to evolve
it has to evolve to more complex structures to handle
the new thoughts that are going through it and what
happens is that to do that it literally has to
give up and shed off the old skin that it
had like a snake shedding its skin and so what
happens is that old preconceived notions that you had about
right and wrong and about how the world works and
about my comedy the economies in the world like good
and bad and right and wrong these start to kind
of melt away and not in a sense that you
don't care about right and wrong anymore but just like
you start to see things as more like one more
unified and you start to let go of the baggage
baggage from your childhood baggage from your early adulthood you
shouldn't let go this you become free and you're no
longer held back by that stuff limiting beliefs are shed
it's basically like doing therapy but it's a little bit
more subtle and it just happens spontaneously as you're meditating
over a long period of time so as you do
meditation for months and years stuff will bubble up from
your subconscious and then you'll have to deal with it
consciously you'll resolve those conflicts and then you'll get you'll
get tranquility from that and you'll no longer be triggered
by those and then new things will bubble up and
deeper things will bubble up and you'll resolve those and
eventually through that process you're gonna resolve a lot of
the stuff that is bothering you a lot of the
stuff that's triggering you a lot of stuff that's holding
you back so if you really want amazing performance in
the future if you really want to live up to
your full potential then meditation is the right way to
go because you need to shed some of that old
junk that you're still carrying around in your subconscious mind
then maybe you don't even realize right now it's gonna
come up for you as you're doing meditation so those
are the benefits of meditation I hope that that has
built a pretty strong case I don't know how much
stronger of a case you would need to actually get
involved with meditation these benefits are pretty amazing pretty massive
especially given what meditation is it's so simple I actually
have more videos about how to do meditation tips and
tricks about meditation common pitfalls and how to make meditation
to habit it actually get the results from it that
you want all these benefits that I'm describing there's actually
techniques for getting them most people when they start meditation
