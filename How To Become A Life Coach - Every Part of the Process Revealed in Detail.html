hey this is Leo for actualised org and here we're
doing another quick self-help segment where I'm going to quickly
cover the topic of how to become a life coach
so I am a life coach so I'm kind of
qualified to talk about this I went through the process
it's actually not very hard so if you're interested in
becoming a life coach then listen up because I'm going
to give you some some quick little tips and techniques
and basically give you a little plan for how to
do it and I'll go into much deeper detail on
it at some in some other video where I can
talk about it for at length but this is a
quick rapid-fire segment I'm just going to give you the
skinny and the practical things you can do right now
so if you want to become a life coach basically
the best thing that I can recommend for you is
to join a life coach training program there are many
programs out there make sure that you get one that
is credible that has some good reviews and that provides
you with certification certification comes from the International coaching Federation
you can look up there their website and there they'll
have a list of all all sorts of schools that
they that they accredit and that will will give you
the kind of a training that is in line with
international coaching Federation so you really want to align with
the school that's aligned with the ICF because the ICF
is like the standard the standard governing body across the
world for coaches and so it just kind of came
out as the standard and now everybody is is on
board with that but honestly you don't even need a
coaching certification to be a coach what I do find
valuable though in the training programs is that they really
teach you what it means to be a coach because
it's not all that it seems to be at the
beginning these certification programs let me give you some details
on them I went through a program called Ipek you
can google them they're one of the best programs out
there it's a comprehensive program it costs around nine thousand
dollars to do it so it is a little bit
pricey but you got to put that in perspective with
everything else that is out there right any coaching program
around is going to cost I say a decent one
is going to cost you in the range of eight
to ten thousand dollars so Ipek is competitive there and
they don't have any extra hidden fees or anything and
that's it you just pay the nine grand and then
you do the program very pretty pretty nice and you
know nine grand you got to ask yourself is that
worth it to you if this is going to be
your career in your profession then it's actually not a
big price to pay any other profession that you would
go into any serious profession you would spend way more
than $10,000 to get degrees and certifications for and training
for and it would take you a lot longer than
it will take you to finish a coaching program even
a very comprehensive one like I Peck the way I
Peck works is it it takes about ten months to
do the whole curriculum they they do it in modules
where you you have four modules you take one module
then you get like two or three months to do
the work and then the the homework assignments and also
the practice of coaching throughout that and then they have
another module where they train you for a weekend and
then you do another couple months of training and kind
of homework assignments etc and then and then they do
more of these modules so through this module process you
can learn to become a coach actually what's great about
the program is that it's not a full-time program so
you can do it while you're still working in your
current job if you're if you're employed right now and
you can't quit your job then this is a really
great program because you can take it on weekends and
there's only four modules so each each weekend is like
three days and it's really not that bad because you
know you can take a Friday off and then you've
got the Saturday and Sunday you learn all that information
and then you go home and you can do the
homework over the course of two or three months and
it really doesn't take up that much time what I
would say is that if you want to become a
coach the core of it is not even the training
the training is important because they're gonna teach you some
techniques and some principles of coaching that are that are
actually really important that you're not really going to get
by yourself and I find that the value of it
is that you actually experience it because you can buy
some books out there on on life coaching which I'll
recommend but the problem with those is that you don't
really get a taste for how the process works you
want to get a taste for how to actually coach
someone in person and also over the phone to do
that why these programs and training programs are so so
effective is because they put you into group environments with
other newbie coaches as you guys are learning it and
you get to coach each other and you get to
try this stuff out in a very kind of a
low risk low pressure environment and you also get the
instructors who are coaching you and you're coaching them and
they give you immediate feedback and you're you're working with
a manual and like you've got stuff to go on
it's actually really easy and fun process to learn some
of these techniques and to learn the coaching process what
I would say though is that if you really want
to become a serious coach you got to become you
got to go above and beyond what the program is
doing the program will put you into teams where you
can coach other people that are also in the program
and that gets you the experience that you need but
I find that you need more than that you need
more experience so when I went through my program what
I did is I went out I made sure to
find extra people in the program and in other groups
that I could coach I just partnered up with them
I just shot them some emails we connected with on
the message boards and what I try to do is
I try to get as many coaching hours in as
possible so I was doing many many calls a week
to the point where I wanted to get as many
calls in as possible the more calls you do the
more people you coach the better you become and it
doesn't take that many coaching calls maybe takes a hundred
coaching calls to get really really comfortable with the process
because when you start it's going to feel scary you're
not going to know if you're doing it right but
after about 100 calls it's all going to iron out
it's going to become easy it's going to become effortless
and you're going to do great so really the bottom
line is that you got it you got to join
a training program I don't think it's very very feasible
to learn how to coach all by yourself in isolation
just by buying a bunch of books or maybe watching
some some seminars or some DVDs you really got to
go out there and join one of these programs get
certified so that you know how to actually be professional
as a coach and you know some of the guidelines
and some of the principles of coaching and also what's
great about the coaching programs is that they give you
business and marketing support which is actually the hardest part
about coaching the coaching is not what's hard you'll master
that pretty easily what's more challenging is how to set
up the business of coaching how to market yourself how
to niche yourself and how to go out there and
find clients that's the tricky part because most people that
go through the program what they don't do is they
don't actually start a business because they're not able to
get the clients and they're not able to build enough
of a client base to the point where they can
actually sustain this model and so what they do is
they join the program and then then dropping and dropping
their business dreams and going back and doing their old
job because they don't have the business mind in the
entrepreneurial mind to make a coaching practice you got to
realize as a coach unless you're working in a in
some sort of corporation then you're working for yourself and
that basically makes you an entrepreneur it makes me makes
you self-employed and you got to understand that beyond being
a coach you got to understand how to be self-employed
that means you got to be self-motivated you got to
be able to set your own schedule you got to
be able to set priorities you got to understand business
you got to understand money and you got to understand
marketing and you got to understand sales you got understand
the process of going out there and finding clients whether
it's online through online sources or where whether it's in
person through networking events and public speaking or whatever whatever
other kind of vehicles you're going to use to market
yourself so make sure that whatever coaching program you get
into the one that you choose also gives you business
and marketing support because they will give you important information
about the coaching business there are just certain practices within
the coaching business that you want to know you want
to know for example that you need to choose a
specialty and that nobody hires a generic coach you want
to be specialized in some aspect of coaching whether its
life purpose or spirituality or career or money or fitness
and weight loss you know you got to pick a
niche and even within all those categories you can still
sub-specialize the more you specialize the better and that's kind
of a counter intuitive notion especially for newbies I know
I really resisted that for a long time and everybody
does that goes through the program but these are kind
of things that if you don't go and people don't
tell you about it then you're really going to trip
up on some of these points and then also you
know what are the common ways to mark yourself as
coach what are the do's what are the don'ts how
do you go out there and work networking events how
do you present yourself declines how do you pitch yourself
how do you share your value to the client so
that they understand that they're actually paying you for something
how do you charge money for your services how do
you set up the paperwork how do you handle the
legal side how do you handle the payment processing etc
so they're going to tell you all those logistics at
least a good training program will so that is kind
of the gist of it is I would say that
if you're interested in coaching research a little bit about
it and then you just got to dive in if
you're really serious about you think this is something that's
right for you scrounge up the money you need about
10 grand and pay it forward and then go ahead
and join that program and work that program work the
program and my advice would be work the program more
than the program works you which means that go above
and beyond do more than the homework assignments coach more
people than they're telling you to coach go out there
and buy books and study some books on coaching and
and then eventually what will happen is that through that
process you will become so good that you'll easily out
coach and out market the rest of your class and
then you're gonna be in a really good position to
go out there and create a business out of it
because you got to understand that a lot of people
go into coaching and they think that they really want
to help people and they want to connect with people
they're really people people they they love helping they love
contributing but you understand that it is a business and
if you're not able to sustain the business side of
it then you're not going to be able to help
anybody so there's a little bit of that trade-off between
helping people but then also being business savvy about it
too and knowing how to market yourself and so that
is really important all right this is it this is
going to do it for this quick quick self-help segment
on how to become a life coach if you want
more information I'm going to have more detailed videos about

your are a coach on some of the advanced prosol
development techniques and strategies that we have that will help
you both in your coaching practice in your business but
then also to develop yourself as much as possible because
I feel that to be a coach the most important
thing is that you have to live the example right
what you're selling is you're selling a lifestyle you're selling
something to your clients you're selling them personal development you're
showing them that they can be something more than they
are and to do that they have to see it
in you because if you are not demonstrating it how
are they going to believe it how are they going
to trust you with their money to deliver them real-world
results if they don't see you delivering it to yourself
and I found to do that you got to really
immerse yourself in personal development study it become a master
of it and there's no better way than check it
