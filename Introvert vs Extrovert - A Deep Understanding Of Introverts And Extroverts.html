hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're talking about introverts versus extroverts okay welcome back
so let's talk about introverts versus extroverts what is an
introvert really what is an extrovert really and how does
this play into the bigger picture of your life how
is this going to affect the performance of your life
the kind of results you get in your life and
how can you start to play with these variables because
I'm not so much interested in just defining introversion and
extraversion which I'm gonna do here on a much deeper
level than you will get in most other places but
I'm also interested in how to actually take those and
start to to play with them in your life and
tune them to get the best results that you can
possibly get alright so in this video we're gonna talk
about some definitions we're gonna go into a deep understanding
of what introversion is versus extraversion we're gonna talk about
some of the origins of these terms we're gonna talk
about the pros and cons and then we're gonna get
into some techniques for how to actually change this stuff
that's really exciting alright so if you're looking forward to
being more extroverted or more introverted or vice-versa then we've
got you covered here so let's get into this some
definitions well before I even give you some definitions let's
talk about a little bit of kind of the history
where did what are these terms even come from well
this is something that came from an old school psychologist
in the early 1900's Carl Jung he what he did
is he started to create personality types and he started
to create these archetypes of you know what what psyches
fell into so he started looking at people and started
saying what are the kind of the common strands between
people and some of the archetypes that he identified are
now used in the myers-briggs personality assessment type you might
have taken that at work or at school in college
someplace else online so that is deriving from his work
and there he made the really really kind of fundamental
distinction in psychology of the introvert and the extrovert so
what does this mean well quite simply it you you
have a good understanding of it already but we're gonna
go into a deeper understanding of it so an introvert
is someone who is comfortable and really enjoys being by
themselves and they are in their head more than they
are out in the real world so they like being
in their head they like to be deep thinkers they
like to be by themselves they're comfortable being alone they
don't particularly enjoy being in loud noisy environments and their
energy tends to drain when they're out there interacting and
socializing with other people so this is what you might
stereotype as the shy person although that's really not a
good way to think about it it's kind of a
caricature cartoon caricature and it's greatly exaggerated so what's the
extrovert well the extra word is the opposite of that
the extrovert is the social butterfly this is the person
that loves to go out there and schmooze with people
he likes to gossip he likes to talk he's verbose
she is really excited by people she draws her energy
from other people from the external environment and she doesn't
like to be by herself and he doesn't like to
be in his head all the time he prefers to
be out there with people interacting with the world groping
feeling looking observing being much more sensory rather than logical
and analytical so that is the extrovert those are the
two kind of classic definitions now as far as really
understanding what this is this is a really powerful idea
that I got from one of Evan pagan seminars about
personality types is they really went into a deep discussion
of what introversion versus extraversion is and this really hit
me so hard when I when I saw this and
I really understood this with my mind's eye here's how
it is here's what's really really going on and when
people talk about the fact that an introvert his battery
gets drained when he's out and about talking with people
and that his battery charges up when he's by himself
and the Vice you know the opposite of that for
an extrovert here's why that's happening so an introvert on
the fundamental level thinks and believes that his world is
in his mind he lives in a world of ideas
what's real is not out there what's real is in
here so what's literally going on here is that he's
so absorbed in the thoughts and the analysis and the
processing that he does on all the stimulation on all
the all the the sensory perception that he's getting from
the world that he needs to process that so for
example an extrovert when he goes in and he talks
to a group of people he'll just go in there
and immediately right off the bat he'll have something to
say he's in there he's he's got energy bam-bam-bam things
are going right you ask him a question he'll just
respond right off the cuff maybe he'll even say something
that he didn't mean to say but he'll just backtrack
and then he'll say something else and he'll just shrug
it off that's kind of an extrovert goes as an
introvert and this is how I am I am an
introvert very much so and if your neutral you're gonna
relate to this as an introvert that stretch this is
very foreign right that's not how we process the world
how we process the world is we go into that
situation someone asks us a question and it takes us
about a second or two to kind of come up
with an answer to it and then respond we don't
respond off-the-cuff and the reason that is is because we
we are living in our own heads and our reality
is here it's not out there and so if our
realities in here literally what's happening is that something comes
in it takes me more time and also more energy
than an extrovert to process it and then give back
a response and then I'm trying to see in my
head whether the response that I give is gonna be
authentic and accurate because again just because I give the
response does not mean that the value is in the
response the value is and how the response then strikes
me so I will be more reflective I'll say something
and I'll say hmm I wonder what he thought of
that I wonder if that is that what actually meant
to say see that's what's gonna go on in an
intra ORS mind with an extrovert for an extrovert it's
the opposite it's like what's real is out there right
the real world is out there it's in the it's
something that I can grow it's something that I can
see it's something that I can smell and taste and
hear and something I can smile add and frown out
and have an emotional interaction with whereas my thoughts about
it that's secondary it's not that an extrovert doesn't have
thoughts sure he does it's just that it's it's that
it's that a very kind of fundamental baseline level he
sees as reality really being out there and the thoughts
is being like a secondary layer added on top of
that so for him he's gonna go out there he's
going to talk sometimes for example an extrovert will say
things that he didn't even mean to say and you'll
you'll notice because next year it is really good at
backtracking and kind of backpedaling and he'll say something and
maybe he'll say something wrong he'll have a mispronunciation or
whatever and he'll immediately just say oh I didn't mean
to say that or oh that's not what I meant
or whatever and he just kind of glosses over it
and he's just something new because for an extrovert the
way that it works is that literally he has to
him say it himself say it before he even recognizes
whether it's real or not for him so he'll just
blurt it out there he's not gonna say it in
his mind first the way an introvert will he'll just
blurt it out and then he'll think about Neil say
hmm I wonder yep that's what I meant to say
or nope that's not what I meant to say and
that's why an extrovert will be more verbose more talkative
a lot of times I think it seemed a little
bit more shallow because they just kind of throw stuff
out there without thinking about it too much and that's
kind of what makes them very spontaneous engaging in charismatic
that is really the deep difference right it's the difference
of what is real and you can actually play with
this it's kind of it's kind of funny sometimes because
I'm very introverted when I have this idea and I
have this deep understanding in my on the forefront of
my mind and I go out let's say I go
out to a club or I go out to some
bar or I'm just walking around into the public place
with their people and I can literally kind of when
I'm thinking about this I can to kind of meditate
on it and I can flip myself I can do
that flip where I see that I'm walking around and
I'm observing people I'm doing my normal introvert thing and
I'm just thinking about mmm you know that person this
this is that and I'm just I can feel and
then I recognize oh I'm in my mind I can
flip that and I can be perceptor II in the
sense that perception is like I'm taking in perception and
things are very tactile for me and when I make
that transition in my mind like there's like a switch
that flips and all of a sudden I can say
okay why don't I be an extrovert right now and
I can literally start sur just taking in whatever's there
taking in a stop thinking about or just like start
taking it in and you start to feel like there's
a very subtle but but also significant shift when you
do that and it's unnatural for me to be that
way but you know when I'm doing it consciously I
can kind of shift shift myself and it's it's kind
of freaky it's kind of cool I encourage you to
try that try that if you're an introvert go next
time you're out and about with people try to flip
yourself and if you're an extrovert also do the opposite
try to get in your head all the sudden when
you're out about and just see how it feels you're
start to get a real first-hand experience of the difference
between between these two personality types okay so let's talk
a little bit about the pros and cons of introverts
and extroverts well pretty obvious some of the stuff here
is that an introvert is gonna be better at introspection
introverts gonna be better at analytical things logical things planning
doing creative things and extruder is going to be better
at socializing with people and doing things that require cooperation
management leadership that kind of stuff just on a surface
level you sir you know I'm painting with broad strokes
this does not mean that if you're an extrovert you
cannot be a really great writer or really great thinker
and vice versa if you're an introvert that does not
mean that you can't be a great manager or a
great leader or even a great socializer you can in
fact that leads me to the next point and the
next point is that there's this is a big trap
of of thinking between should I be an introvert should
I be an extrovert or getting so caught up in
who you really are like oh I'm real introvert I'm
a real extrovert and that's just how I am and
so getting caught up in that and thinking that you
have to choose sides you don't have to choose sides
in fact I think that as a full well-rounded fully
self developed self actualized human being you need to have
both you need to value both you need to see
that both of the each one of them has its
own sets of pros and it's so sense of cons
and that if you are extremely introverted you are not
going to have the best kind of life and if
you're extremely extroverted you're also not gonna have the best
kind of life you really want to be able to
blend the two in a way and when you start
to blend them what I notice is that not it's
not the case that you start to somehow average out
it's actually the case that they kind of their cumulative
so what you're doing is you're taking the best of
being an introvert you're taking the best of being an
extrovert and you're making those your strengths and you're dropping
away the cons and so now you just have the
strengths not the weaknesses and you get you get conscious
control over this stuff so when you need to be
extroverted you can go out there and be extroverted and
when you need to be introverted you go out there
and you be introverted and this is important because I
found that to get the kind of amazing results that
I want my life for example certain success in business
or certain success in relationships I've really had to work
on my introversion I had to get out of it
and become more extroverted I had to do that work
otherwise I saw that my life was just not nearly
at the potential that it could be and I can
imagine the same thing for an extreme extrovert is that
if they're always extroverted then they're starting a business or
they're doing something like personal development even then that's gonna
hurt them because they are not doing enough contemplation enough
introspection and they're gonna want to move themselves here and
shift towards introversion and get some of those strengths up
in their repertoire right so really I challenge you to
not make this an either/or choice but a both you
want both you want to be a fully well-rounded human
being right you don't want to be lopsided here and
I think that that is really how we were intended
to be that's how kind of our brains were designed
is it we want to be incorporating both and you
need both to really have a rich successful life okay
and the last point that I want to get into
is actually some practical techniques so we talked a lot
about the theory what are the specific ways that you
can go about starting to shift yourself because at this
point you're probably saying yourself well I'm more introverted than
I want to be I'm more extroverted that I want
to be how do I go about making a chant
transition and if you don't know whether you are introverted
or extroverted then go ahead and take the myers-briggs personality
assessment you could find that online you can pay some
small price for it or maybe even find it for
free there's all sorts of different assessments out there but
the myers-briggs is really the best take that test take
that assessment see where it places you as an introvert
or an extrovert okay so once you do find out
and you decide that you want to make some changes
because you see that being too much of an introvert
or too much of an extrovert has been hurting you
in some part of your life then what you want
to do is follow some of these techniques okay for
my let's see let's start with my introverts for my
introverts if you are extremely introverted and you want to
become more extroverted here is a really good way to
do it number one is start going to bars and
clubs start getting out there and start interacting with people
get into really social environments where people are free to
talk actually bars and clubs are great because people are
drinking there they're kind of a carefree crazy atmosphere and
that's really gonna challenge you because when you go there
first you're gonna feel extremely uncomfortable but then you're gonna
open up you're gonna shells gonna open up you're gonna
get more comfortable and that is exactly what you need
to break you out of that shell to challenge you
a little bit right to get you talking with people
get you into smooth highly sociable environments and when you
do that I would even courage you don't drink do
that without drinking and see how that feels it's gonna
feel really challenging and scary at first but it's also
gonna be a lot of growth next is try to
join some groups so some meetup groups maybe religious organizations
whatever you're into Toastmasters just groups of people who are
like-minded like you and who you can interact with who
you can have to talk with maybe is that it's
gonna be you're gonna meet once we get Starbucks you
can go to meetups calm and meet all sorts of
find all sorts of groups there on any kind of
a hobby that you have or any kind of topic
of interest start to form those and I don't mean
internet groups I mean real life groups person-to-person face-to-face you're
not going to build your extraversion on an internet chat
forum or over Skype you're going to build extraversion in
real life face-to-face conversations and the last point the third
one is going to be talk more I want you
to talk more stop being so quiet stop being so
reserved be more assertive every situations you get literally if
you are talking to the checkout clerk at Starbucks chat
her up talk to her poke fun at her talk
about the news talk about something that is on your
mind or ask her a question if you're at the
gas station do that with the gas attendant if you're
at the ATM and you're going into the bank and
you're talking to a live person talk to the ATM
teller there if you're at work and you've got an
opportunity to go to lunch with somebody go with them
and actually talk with them get yourself to talk more
talk more and be more in those kind of situations
and try to leverage every single opportunity for talking that
you have throughout your day whether it's with your kids
with your spouse but especially with strangers I find that
that's where your biggest gain is going to be is
with strangers you do not realize how many strangers you're
interacting with on a daily basis that you could be
talking to more and using this to build your extraversion
so start doing that okay and now for my introverts
what can you do to become more introverted how can
extroverts become more introverted the way that you can do
this is number one I would say is with meditation
start a meditation practice start practicing any kind of activity
where you're unplugged from especially people you got to start
to get yourself comfortable of being alone by yourself and
if this feels uncomfortable for you right now don't worry
about it you're gonna get used to it being alone
by yourself is a really powerful advantage for your creative
thinking skills for your happiness for your peace all sorts
of things that I can't even go into right now
so start a meditation practice 20 minutes every day at
least then I would say mindfulness practice mindfulness throughout your
day what does this mean mindfulness simply means that you
are always aware of what you're doing that means that
when you walk out your door your front door to
your house you walk out and you're aware of it
you notice it and then when you come back from
work at night you notice yourself walking in start to
notice that you don't even need to say anything to
yourself you just kind of register Seco oh yeah I
walked through the door oh okay I walked through the
door again just register that how about every time you
sit down to have a meal I want you to
start to be aware of that every meal that you
take from now on for the next week just be
aware of it that you're sitting down now to have
a meal and tell yourself oh I'm having a meal
just little things like that start to be aware of
yourself and especially when you get caught up emotionally for
example you get angry you get frustrated you want to
yell at somebody you feel really despondent for some reason
during your day you're very stressed have those emotions running
through you but then kind of take a step back
and say okay I'm feeling very stressed right now I'm
just feeling very stressed and just kind of notice yourself
doing that so it's like a self-awareness a self-consciousness that
you're developing that's mindfulness and then the third point is
read I find that's a really good way to get
into your head is to read a lot when you
read especially stuff that's rich and guess you think and
get your imagination going gets you full of new ideas
a lot of great nonfiction books are good for that
like biographies and psychology self-help books are amazing for this
not all you're going to be getting valuable information and
you're gonna be just releasing stress when you read you're
also gonna be starting to think about things you're gonna
start to contemplate naturally and that will get you more
introverted alright so that's it those are the techniques you
can use these are these are the definitions of introversion
and extraversion erm I hope you got some good insight
