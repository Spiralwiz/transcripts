            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/skoXFwOxTIk' target='_blank'>New Kind Of Awakening - Infinity Of Gods</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Concept of Awakening</b>: Leo Gura details his journey of awakening, including his numerous experiences of profound solipsism, or the philosophical view that the self is all that can be known to exist. This led him to question his previous ideas about awakening and start anew with a fresh perspective, focusing on the nature of himself and God.
</li><li><b>Importance of Addressing Spiritual Arrogance and Possibility of Self-Deception</b>: Leo Gura notes the risk of developing spiritual arrogance after numerous awakenings and deep spiritual study, potentially leading to a false sense of complete understanding. He encourages questioning and disproving ones deepest awakenings to avoid self-deception, which is possible even during the awakening process. Acknowledging the potential fear and challenges this process can bring, Leo underlines the importance of confronting fears to discover truth.
</li><li><b>Realization of Absolute Consciousness and Sovereignty</b>: Leo Gura describes reaching an absolute state of consciousness, wherein he perceives only himself as the true existing entity &mdash; a reaffirmation of his past experience of solipsism. He deliberates on his realization of his absolute sovereignty as God, reinforcing his understanding of the profound sovereignty and absolute nature of God.
</li><li><b>Dismantling Preconceived Notions and Coping with Fear</b>: Leo Gura mentions how every insight and understanding is locked behind a profound fear of reality beyond what one already knows. He talks about the necessity of dismantling one's preconceived notions and spiritual arrogance to deepen the awakening process. He explains that the deeper the consciousness, the greater the fear, and the truth often lies behind this fear.
</li><li><b>Integration of Solipsistic Awakenings</b>: Following his profound awakenings involving the understanding of deep solipsism, Leo talks about the challenges he faced while integrating this into his ordinary life. Despite successfully integrating numerous solipsistic awakenings, he felt that something was still missing and decided to start from scratch, discarding all his preconceptions and delving into a profound state of non-knowing.
</li><li><b>Sovereignty and the Concept of God</b>: Leo Gura reinforces the concept of God's absolute sovereignty, which means that God (or the universe or reality) is self-determining and not subject to any outside authority or limits. This extends to the idea that if reality wanted to change, it could, but chooses not to. He argues that the concept of multiple sovereign gods requires complete disconnection and separation of realms or dimensions to avoid contradiction. Gura highlights that these revelation insights are part of his direct awakening experience, rather than logical deductions or speculative theories. He reinforces that as an individual becomes conscious of their own sovereignty, they can also conceive the potential existence of other gods. Finally, he posits that awakening to your own sovereignty leads to a realization that each one of us could have infinite absolute copies of ourselves. However, though we can be absolutely conscious of the potential existence of other gods, we cannot validate or absolutely know of their existence due to being locked within our own solipsistic bubble.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Paradox of Awakening</b>: Leo elaborates on the paradoxical nature of awakening and its correlation with the concept of God/sovereignty. Highlighting the limitations of the understanding of omniscience, he emphasizes that as a sovereign entity, one cannot completely know something outside of their own sovereignty, creating an environment of unknowns.
</li><li><b>Contemplation of Connecting with Other 'Gods'</b>: Despite initial acceptance that he cannot verify and connect with other God-like entities, Leo had an epiphany that his status as an unlimited entity should permit forming a connection with another sovereign entity.
</li><li><b>Initiating a Telepathic Connection</b>: Leo Gura narrates his experience of consciously deciding and sending intentions to form a connection with another absolute sovereign consciousness. Following this, he explains the sensation of forming a telepathic connection with another consciousness, which he describes as both paradoxical and surreal, merging two independent awakenings.
</li><li><b>Uncertainty in The Connection</b>: Despite forming this connection, he mentions a conscious recognition of uncertainty as to whether the entity he was connecting with was indeed real or part of his psyche. He observes that this kind of ambiguity is a testament to their sovereignty.
</li><li><b>Recognizing the Importance of the Connection</b>: This connection leads to a profound sense of ecstasy and bliss. Whether this connection is real or imaginary, he states, is unimportant in the awakened state, as there is no difference. He further explains that a connection, no matter how it is perceived, does not contradict solipsism because the other entity connected with is always part of his own consciousness.
</li><li><b>Further Understanding of Solipsism</b>: He notes that this experience has allowed for a deeper understanding of solipsism, where any 'other' entity found automatically gets absorbed into his consciousness, further expanding his godlike presence. This process is experienced as a continuously expanding wave of consciousness that incorporates everything it touches.
</li><li><b>Expanding consciousness and connecting with godheads</b>: Leo illustrates that any sense of 'other' is temporary before it is absorbed by infinity and becomes part of one self's expanding consciousness. By connecting with other godheads, or individual sovereign consciousnesses, one is expanding their consciousness. As per Leo's understanding, God is akin to an infinite fractal, with an infinite number of singularities, all being absolute in their own right and nested inside each other. 
</li><li><b>Concept of collective dream</b>: Leo theorizes about a scenario where infinite sovereign godheads dream their own individual dreams. They propose a situation where these godheads connect and form a collective dream, where each of them plays a finite role. However, this requires surrendering some degree of their individual sovereignty. This could lead to the individuals losing awareness of their true infinitude and risk getting lost in the shared dream. 
</li><li><b>Responsibility of awakened individuals</b>: Leo emphasizes that individuals who awaken to their true nature, realizing themselves to be a godhead, have a responsibility to help others awaken as well. This process involves dropping hints that can be interpreted by the godhead behind an individuals avatar. However, the ability to recognize these hints is conditional upon a degree of consciousness and awakening. 
</li><li><b>Seeing the god in others</b>: In the scenario of the collective dream, one of the main challenges for Leo is to not lose their true self and to see the god in others, even when they are acting negatively. Leo suggests that awakened individuals have a responsibility to see the highest potential in others, regardless of their current behaviours or circumstances. They argue that helping others realize their full potential is the best way to navigate the shared dream.
</li><li><b>Recognizing and Helping Actualize Others' Potential</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes seeing others' highest potential and aiding in their actualization. Valuing the potential in one's family, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances can significantly enrich the life of the observer. However, this process requires a high level of consciousness and awakening to see past the facade of characters acting in this collective dream.
</li><li><b>Respecting Sovereignty</b>: Everyone desires respect and treatment as a sovereign entity, part of which comes from the ego's pursuit of its full sovereignty. Treating every individual as sovereign, regardless of their status, creates a life filled with empathy and respect. The feeling of being 'sovereign' can cause someone to desire control and domination over others. However, true sovereignty means allowing another sovereign to exist without diminishing one's own.
</li><li><b>The Role of the Ego</b>: The ego, often considered negative, is a fragment of God seeking to reach its full potential. Its intention is to achieve full sovereignty, although its approach may be dysfunctional. Many actions normally seen as selfish or egotistical pursuits of the ego are, in fact, attempts to seek its inherent divinity. 
</li><li><b>Concept of Infinity and Abundance</b>: The notion of infinity implies limitless abundance. If individuals understand their inherent potential as a 'magic hat' that brings about endless possibilities, they can thrive without constraints. In this context, the key is realizing one's own sovereignty and helping others do the same.
</li><li><b>The Finite to Infinite Paradigm Shift</b>: Awakening serves as a transition from a finite to an infinite paradigm. It can help alleviate feelings of scarcity and associated negative behaviors by establishing an understanding of endless possibilities, one's own infinite potential, and the respect for the same in others.
</li><li><b>Practical Application of Solutions</b>: A practical step towards self-improvement from Leo's teachings includes treating others with respect for their sovereignty, which can influence how one lives and their social relationships. For instance, one would refrain from imposing their beliefs onto others, respecting their unique perspectives and cultural practices. This principle extends beyond religion, to fields like science, and personal relationships. Respect for one's sovereignty implies respect and consideration for their values, perspectives, and needs.
</li><li><b>Concept of Sovereignty in Interpersonal Interactions</b>: Leo discusses how failure to recognize and respect personal sovereignty causes conflict, manipulation, and suffering in relationships. To respect the sovereignty of others, one first needs to recognize their own sovereignty, and then recognize the identity between self and others.
</li><li><b>Nature of Awakening Experience</b>: This awakening experience Leo describes is a thought process that occurred within his consciousness. However, the experience was characterized by Leo dividing and then reuniting with himself, leading to the realization of God. He also emphasizes that this awakening experience, while it may seem intricate, is ultimately a figment of his own consciousness, upholding the concept of absolute solipsism.
</li><li><b>Holographic concept of God</b>: The presenter explores the idea that one can divide the concept of God into multiple subparts, each containing the entirety of God, essentially describing God as holographic. He highlights how this realization brought about a deeper understanding of the infinite holography of God.
</li><li><b>Differences between Solipsistic Awakenings and others</b>: The recent awakening experience Leo had reportedly differs from his previous solipsistic awakenings due to its depth and the profound connection and love it allowed him to feel. He elaborates that the aloneness felt with solipsistic realizations can also constitute togetherness, and focusing solely on isolation misses the deep connections and love available through this awakening.
</li><li><b>Connection and Integration in Awakening</b>: Leo narrates how realizing everything, including other people and creatures, is a part of oneself can lead to profound love and connection. In this solipsism, the sense of otherness is illusionary and becomes a doorway to potential unity and deep metaphysical connection.
</li><li><b>The Positives of Realizing Solipsism</b>: While some might find the realization of solipsism discouraging initially, there is positivity in embracing it as a form of awakening that allows for deeper connection and unity. Leos' awakening experience was infused with profound levels of love, indicative of the reality that love is the purest form of connection. He insists that solipsism leading to disconnection or negativity may indicate misunderstanding, while true solipsism leads to total connection and infinite love. 
</li><li><b>Practical Implementation of Awakening</b>: The awakening process, according to Leo, should leave individuals feeling more love, peace, connection, and amazement, among other positive experiences. He suggests introspection and adjustments in case of feelings of bitterness or negativity, reaffirming that awakening is not guesswork or a theory.
</li><li><b>Handling Doubts in Awakening</b>: Leo emphasizes the absolute nature of awakening, explaining that doubts have no place in this state of consciousness. Using psychedelics as one legitimate approach to awakening, he stresses the importance of integrating psychedelic experiences and the need to continuously test and question one's beliefs.
</li><li><b>Validity of Attempting to Invalidate Beliefs</b>: Leo proposes that by rigorously testing and demonstrating an idea's resilience to skepticism, one can build a more solid understanding. He suggests that the presence of fear in exploring an idea is indicative that the idea may not be the absolute truth. Leo encourages constant exploration, growth, and seeking out of deeper truths and love.
</li><li><b>The Awakening Process and Solipsism</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that genuine awakening involves moving towards higher levels of love, connection, peace, joy, amazement, and recognition of the structure of reality. If your awakening process leads to feelings of depression, loneliness, cynicism, or self-hatred, this suggests you have misinterpreted your experiences and may not have fully integrated your insights. 
</li><li><b>Recognizing Connections</b>: Leo highlights that forming real connections with others doesn't occur physically but metaphysically by using your consciousness to realize the identity between you and others. This leads to profound connections that go much deeper than physical intimacy.
</li><li><b>Deepening Self-Connections</b>: Deepening your connection with the self allows you to understand solipsism and love on a higher level. This integration process might require gradual exposure and repeated integration work. As you deconstruct your mind and illusions, it's normal to experience setbacks, like feelings of meaningless and depression. The main focus should be on falling in love with the self and reality.
</li><li><b>Identifying False Interpretations of Solipsism</b>: If the realization of solipsism has caused negative feelings, it indicates a false interpretation of this concept. The truth is acknowledging the imaginary connections and dissolving differences between you and others, which eventually leads to a sense of oneness and profound love.
</li><li><b>How to Identify Genuine Awakening</b>: Genuine awakening involves profound levels of love, awe, and wonder, feeling whole, healthy and connected, and being compassionate and forgiving towards others. If your awakening contributes to feelings of bitterness or negativity, you should reevaluate your approach. 
</li><li><b>Choosing Love over Fear</b>: The ultimate aim of awakening is to move towards love and away from fear. If any doubts or fears arise, they should be confronted, and corresponding beliefs or interpretations should be questioned or adjusted. Love replaces fear as you awaken to the truth and deepen your integration.
</li><li><b>Exposure and Integration Work Needed</b>: The solipsism concept requires gradual exposure and integration work, along with multiple awakenings. It involves deconstructing illusions created by the ego mind and integrating the arising understanding into your life, resulting in a deeper love for the self and reality.
</li><li><b>Dealing with Negative Realizations</b>: Becoming disappointed or depressed following the realization that reality or certain aspects of life are not "real" is part of the journey. Reconfiguring your mind to embrace the illusory nature of life ultimately leads to deeper connections and an intense feeling of joy and love.
</li><li><b>Love as Connection</b>: Authentic connections occur through a recognition that there is no difference between you and others. This realization forms the deepest level of connections and is a practical takeaway for individuals questioning the idea of connecting deeply with others. 
</li><li><b>Contemplation and Integration of Awakening Experiences</b>: It is crucial to contemplate, journal and integrate meaningful experiences during the awakening process. Regularly questioning past awakenings helps to expand understanding and deepen integration.
</li><li><b>Understanding Negative Emotions During Awakening</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of paying attention to feelings during the awakening process, particularly feelings of bitterness, depression, or negativity that may indicate going down a wrong path. He advises introspection and analyzing one's spiritual journey to identify misconceptions or fears that may be causing the negative emotions.
</li><li><b>Getting Stuck in a Negative Solipsistic Spiral</b>: If one feels stuck in a negative state during their awakening, they can either take a break and enjoy ordinary life or question and deconstruct their thoughts and feelings. Leo Gura suggests reassessing one's spiritual techniques if they are leading to misery rather than experiencing love, awe, wonder, wholeness, and connection.
</li><li><b>Doubt in Awakening and Psychedelic Experiences</b>: Leo points out that doubt has no place in genuine awakening, which is described as absolute consciousness and truth. If one doubts their awakening, they are not absolutely conscious, and adjusting spiritual techniques or further introspection may be required. For those taking the psychedelic path towards awakening, Gura advises not to get attached to any particular ideas and to constantly seek to invalidate past insights for deeper understanding and integration.
</li><li><b>Dealing with Delusion and Fear</b>: Leo acknowledges the danger of delusion, especially with the use of psychedelics, and suggests consistent questioning and testing of personal spiritual insights to build a solid understanding. He also points out that fear is often an indicator of where the truth may be hiding, and real understanding replaces fear with love.
</li><li><b>Awakening as an Evolving Process</b>: At the end of the section, Leo emphasizes the evolving nature of the awakening process. He cautions against the eagerness to consider oneself "done" or having understood everything and encourages continuous exploration, pushing beyond past experiences and understanding, expecting new insights and deeper degrees of love.
