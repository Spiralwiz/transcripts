[Music] in this episode i'm going to explain to you
a core pillar of my understanding of consciousness and my
teachings about spirituality and consciousness we're going to just focus
on this one pillar here i've touched upon this pillar
in other episodes but i wanted to devote a whole
episode to it and that pillar is that state of
consciousness is everything and sometimes i just shorten that to
say that state is everything for me this one idea
has been central to helping me to understand and wrap
my mind around consciousness in a way that i wasn't
able to get from any other spiritual teacher and so
i'm going to explain what consciousness is to you here
and this one powerful principle with many examples i want
to try to help you to grasp it uh and
it's going to be an explanation that you don't really
hear from any other spiritual teachers or teachings and honestly
i'm kind of surprised that nobody has spoken of it
in the way that i like to speak of it
and that i'll speak of it here today so in
the past i've said this but it really bears underscoring
and stressing but that there is nothing but states of
consciousness that's it there's nothing but states of conscience that's
all that reality is is it's states of consciousness reality
consists of one thing consciousness and this consciousness takes different
states that's simple the problem is that you probably don't
understand what i'm really talking about here because it requires
some deep awakenings to start to understand this but we'll
we'll get to that so let's build up to it
basically no object can exist outside of consciousness that is
not what we're taught as we're growing up as we're
growing up under the materialistic paradigm uh we assume that
there are objects and that consciousness is a byproduct of
certain objects physical objects or somehow is some extra layer
on top of physical objects that's not the case all
physical objects exist within consciousness and they are part of
whatever state of consciousness you're in so no matter what
is happening no matter what you're experiencing whether you're alive
or even if you're not alive you're in some state
of consciousness always that's the fundamental universal rule and sometimes
i hear people even spiritual people will deny states of
consciousness they'll say no there's something beyond states of consciousness
or they'll say something like oh well leo but that's
just a state of consciousness that's just an altered state
of consciousness as if there's anything else but states of
consciousness what's ironic about people who deny states of consciousness
or propose something beyond states of consciousness or something more
true than states of consciousness that they're doing all of
that from within a state of consciousness so the denial
of states of consciousness is of course just another state
of consciousness now what do i mean by states of
consciousness here are some examples that most of you are
familiar with and then we'll get into some more wacky
cases but the standard cases are dreaming when you're dreaming
that's a state of consciousness ordinary waking life what you're
experiencing right now probably that's a state of consciousness being
drunk or high on a drug that's a state of
consciousness being sleepy or dead tired when you're right on
the brink of falling asleep you're so sleepy and tired
you can barely think straight you've got a certain kind
of like very tired fatigued mood remember a time like
that that's a that's a distinctive state of consciousness that
you're in and what you notice in that state is
that your mind works differently your thoughts think differently you're
drifting off half asleep but not fully asleep you're conscious
but you don't have that kind of lucidity that you
do in normal waking life that's a specific state or
think about a time when you were really sick with
a cold or with a flu that's also a very
specific kind of state of consciousness maybe you have a
high fever and also think about a case where you
were very emotional you were very angry to the point
of rage or very sad very depressed maybe very heartbroken
after a a relationship of yours ended you're very heartbroken
it feels like you're not even yourself at that moment
you feel like you're you've become a different person have
you noticed that so uh maybe if you're having some
sort of manic episode if you're bipolar that would also
be a state of consciousness that you're in and it
doesn't have to be negative emotions it can also be
positive emotions think of a time when you were really
horny and sexually excited that's a that's a very distinctive
state of consciousness it also affects how you feel it
affects how you think the decisions you make and so
on so these are the kind of states that most
of us are familiar with and we don't spend a
lot of time distinguishing them very carefully or thinking about
them very carefully and notice i may be listed like
seven different states here um [Music] but in reality it's
not like there are clear boundaries between these different states
see consciousness is you you better you got to think
of it like a fluid medium it's very fluid so
it's a mistake to try to just say well leo
how many states of consciousness are there let's categorize them
all this is a mistake i know that certain spiritual
traditions make these sorts of various kinds of categorizations they
start to enumerate the number of states of consciousness that
there are this is a mistake this is artificial all
these kind of categories of course you can categorize them
but all these categories um they're very artificial and they're
really human projections and so really the answer to the
question of how many states of consciousness are there is
there's infinite number of them infinite and they can vary
one from another very slightly or significantly and so even
to call it a state is in a certain sense
not correct because that gives you the idea that like
well there's the dreaming state then you flip some sort
of binary switch and then you exit the dreaming state
and you enter the normal state and then you flip
another switch and then you enter the drunk state and
you flip another switch and you enter the sleepy state
or the sixth state or the angry state but that's
not how it works of course all these states can
flow into each other and it's not like a binary
switch is being flipped it's more like a combination of
different knobs and dials are being turned but the idea
is that conscious can flow between all these different states
and many other kinds of states and there's really no
limit to what kind of state consciousness can put itself
in so here now i want to introduce an additional
idea which is figments of consciousness so really a state
of consciousness is composed out of figments what do i
mean by figments well i'm calling them figments like figments
of imagination as opposed to how we would normally think
of what reality is is we normally think it's mad
of objects we think reality may is made of objects
or atoms or molecules or we think reality is some
sort of computer simulation but that's not what reality is
made of reality is matter of figments of consciousness and
these figments make up different states and then the state
sort of determines how the figments combine together and how
they interact and how they flow so here's an example
of what i mean by figments of consciousness and now
try to follow along and actually get a direct feel
for this a direct experience because that's what's necessary here
so imagine for example a snickers candy bar that somebody
has taken a bite out of that right there is
a figment of consciousness but i don't just mean that
you imagining it in your mind as a thought because
right now as i'm telling you to imagine it it's
just a thought in your mind this snickers candy bar
of course that's a figment of your imagination and a
figment of consciousness but i'm saying something much more profound
than that i'm saying that if you actually saw or
held in your hand this sneakers candy bar with a
bite taken out of it that that would also be
a figment of consciousness the actual candy bar not just
your idea of it of course right now you don't
probably have a candy bar in your hand right this
minute so it's just an idea but i'm not pointing
to the idea i'm pointing to the actual thing that
thing is a figment of consciousness and what i'm saying
when i say that reality is made out of figments
of consciousness is that see ordinarily you if you ask
like a physicist okay what is this snickers candy bar
made out of they would say well it's made out
of um molecules and those molecules may have atoms and
those atoms made out of quarks and it's mad of
energy and blah blah blah that's standard materialistic story um
and here i'm trying to get you to like look
at reality from a totally different paradigm which is the
figment paradigm rather than trying to reduce the candy bar
down to some elemental particles just grasp the fact that
reality can just be a snickers candy bar held within
consciousness full stop no reductionism that means it's not made
out of atoms it's not man of energy it's not
an image inside of a brain it's not a network
of neurons it's not a mathematical equation it's not a
calculation in a computer somewhere if you think that reality
is a simulation it's none of those things it is
a figment within consciousness can you get a little taste
of that no pun intended why do i call them
figments of consciousness because they're like strands in a story
or elements of a dream if you think about how
you dream at night you might ask yourself like what
is the dream made out of you might say well
the dream is mad of adams again drop that idea
the dream is not made of atoms it's much better
to think of a dream like if you ask like
what are the building blocks of a dream it's not
atoms the building block of a blocks of a dream
are the different elements i mean really figments of your
mind people places occurrences within the dream but what are
these things they're figments and you can almost think of
like think of think of if you think of reality
as like a dream machine a machine that can just
come up with dreams in such a machine you don't
need atoms or energy or mathematics or computer simulation you
don't need any of that all you need are you
need the actual elements of the thing you're dreaming so
like if you want to dream of a snickers candy
bar that's what you dream you dream that figment and
that figment becomes your dream part of it now you
can you can of course a dream can consist of
many figments you can bring these figments together and weave
them together so you might have a snickers candy bar
in there you might also have a human body in
that dream holding the candy bar you might have a
table that the candy bar is sitting on you might
have the grocery store that you go to the isle
of the grocery store where you buy the candy bar
you might have the money that you exchange with the
cashier for the candy bar so all of these would
be different figments right the money the grocery store aisle
and so forth and you could almost like think of
it almost like if you're a movie director trying to
compose a movie you don't need to think about like
the atoms you know a movie director isn't thinking in
terms of atoms and energy and molecules when he's designing
the movie he's thinking of the actual elements that he
needs for the movie directly like i need an actor
that looks is this tall and has this kind of
hair and i need him to be holding a snickers
candy bar that he's purchasing with this money right and
those are the literal pieces of the movie that the
movie is made out of and then those are we
woven together to come up with some sort of you
know story and you know a sort of a uh
a timeline where experience is unfolding so here are some
more examples of figments of consciousness and as i'm going
to be giving you all these examples again i'm not
talking about the ideas in your mind because all these
examples are just going to be ideas in your mind
yes those are all figments of consciousness but i mean
the actual things that you think are solid and real
that these concepts are pointing to i mean that those
are figments of consciousness and i would like you to
actually try to grasp that as i'm going down this
list of examples so for example a yellow rubber ducky
that a child might play with in a bathtub now
if you ask a a physicist if you take the
smartest physicists in the world and you sit them down
and say okay here's a yellow rubber ducky what is
it what is it made out of like really let's
cut the [ __ ] and get to the rock
bottom metaphysically what is a yellow rubber ducky they're going
to go into their stories about its molecules its atoms
its quarks its strings its mathematical equations it's it's this
all of that is wrong they don't actually understand what
a yellow rubber ducky is a yellow rubber ducky is
a figment of consciousness that means what it means to
say that there is a yellow rubber ducky that a
yellow rubber ducky is real and that it exists to
say that what it means to say that is that
consciousness is imagining a yellow rubber ducky and not some
other thing it could be imagining that is being held
by consciousness now there's an additional wrinkle here because when
i say that it's very likely that you might say
oh yeah well yeah yeah leo my mind is holding
that okay fine maybe it that's part of consciousness but
then like but then actually that's like neurons in my
brain yellow rubber ducky is part of my is part
of my body it's in my brain somewhere like no
or you might say well yeah yeah a yellow rubber
ducky is like um is something that a living organism
is experiencing it's part of a living organism's experience it's
perceptual system it's nervous system no that's not what i'm
saying that's not what a yellow rubber ducky is when
i'm saying that consciousness is holding a yellow rubber ducky
i'm talking about consciousness as an absolute as a universal
that means consciousness ungrounded in anything else that means it's
not consciousness grounded in a nervous system it's not consciousness
that's part of your body it's not consciousness that's part
of some neural network it's not consciousness that's part of
a computer simulation it's not conscious that's part of a
living organism it's just pure absolute consciousness it's not even
consciousness that is inside of a physical universe you get
that so in this example physical universe is a figment
of consciousness consciousness is not inside of a physical universe
a physical universe is inside of consciousness as a figment
of consciousness and i don't just mean your idea of
a physical universe i mean the actual physical universe is
a figment of consciousness so look around you right now
look around the room you're in notice that you have
an idea of the physical universe obviously that's a figment
of your consciousness can you grab that grasp that that's
obvious but what's not so obvious is when you're looking
around the room this is supposedly you're telling yourself this
is the physical the actual physical universe not just my
idea of it right the actual thing is right here
i'm inside of it what i'm telling you is that
that is also this is a figment of consciousness okay
let's keep going with the list the smell of a
skunk is a figment of consciousness a gallon of gasoline
is a figment of consciousness braces on a child's teeth
is a figment of consciousness a used condom is a
figment of consciousness and acts to the skull is a
figment of consciousness 1.28629 bitcoin in your bitcoin wallet that's
a figment of consciousness albert einstein is a figment of
consciousness now this is where it gets kind of heavy
because of course there's nothing special about albert einstein that
makes him a part of your consciousness a figment of
your consciousness and somebody else like uh arnold schwarzenegger um
or kobe bryant not a figment of your consciousness every
person is a figment of your consciousness including me this
is this is a mind [ __ ] right here
because if you ask like a scientist you know what
is albert einstein they're gonna say well albert einstein is
a a homo sapien mammal living on a planet that
used to live on a planet a hundred years ago
and uh he was made out of uh cells and
organs and those man out of molecules and dna and
proteins and atoms and all this and he was a
biological being a biological living organism that used to exist
all of those are figments of consciousness that consciousness has
woven together to create the larger figment called albert einstein
and i'm not just talking about albert einstein your idea
of him i'm talking about the actual albert einstein that
your idea is pointing to so if albert einstein was
sitting right before you looking you in the eyes he
would still be a figment of your consciousness and so
the way that conscious works is that it weaves together
these figments into think of it almost like weaving together
yarns right you have a large yarn woven together with
smaller substrands of yarns and then you can you can
do this infinitely you can nest yarns within yarns you
can create larger larger threads of these yarns spin them
together then you can take multiple of those and thread
those together into an even thicker rope and in this
way you can construct something as elaborate as albert einstein
because of course albert einstein you can break that down
into sub figments you can break it down piece by
piece by piece you know into hundreds thousands millions and
even trillions of figments of consciousness you could imagine every
tooth in his mouth you can imagine every hair on
his head and on his body you could imagine every
cell in his body that make it up and you
can imagine every molecule and atom in every molecule every
protein all of that you can imagine all of that
and all of those are figments of consciousness coming together
in this brilliant way to create the larger figment of
albert einstein and what's really crucial to get here is
that part of materialism and the materialistic paradigm is this
idea that reality is built from the bottom up using
small elemental building blocks almost like you're building something out
of legos and so a lot of times when you
ask a scientist what is something they get lost in
the process of reducing something down into its subcomponents thinking
that that actually tells you what a thing is it
doesn't this is a mistake and the even deeper mistake
is the metaphysical assumption that reality is something that is
built out of smaller particles or elements and that everything
reduces down just to these elements and that everything needs
to be built up from these elements that these elements
came first and everything else was built up afterwards over
time but this is not actually how reality works or
how consciousness works so what's so remarkable about consciousness is
it actually works top down not bottom up consciousness can
just imagine an albert einstein from scratch from the top
down it doesn't need to build albert einstein up from
subatomic particles and molecules that combine to make proteins that
combine to make cells that can combine to make organs
and so on it doesn't need that it can just
hold albert einstein in its mind and that is what
albert einstein is and then when you start to do
a deconstruction process on albert eins and you try to
reduce it down in a physical manner what you're doing
is you're you're not actually you're not understanding what albert
einstein is what you're doing is actually you're spinning further
fragments of consciousness figments of consciousness rather you're you're inventing
more of them and then you're trying to ground albert
einstein the figment of albert einstein you're trying to ground
it into sub-figments you're using figments to ground other figments
that's the name of the game and this is how
you create reality this is how conscious creates reality so
consider the radical possibility the paradigm shift that there wasn't
some big bang 14 billion years ago that ultimately had
to happen and led to the existence of snickers candy
bars that exist today because some humans invented them and
created them and put them into a grocery store where
you went and bought one that whole paradigm and instead
i want you to see that reality can simply spawn
a snickers candy bar from scratch as a figment of
consciousness and in fact that is what a snickers candy
bar literally is and that whole story about the big
bang and all that stuff that led to the existence
of this figment of consciousness called a snickers bar that
is a story that you are literally constructing on the
fly in order to ground this figment called a snickers
candy bar and that what you're grounding it in is
not something more fundamental than a snickers candy bar you're
grounding it in something that's less fundamental actually other figments
of consciousness which are actually further removed from the figment
that is right before you right now because mostly all
of that story that you invented about the existence of
this snickers candy bar and where it came from that's
all conceptual you know the big bang molecules and people
creating this candy bar that's all conceptual that's not in
your direct experience so it's actually a lesser form of
consciousness than the snickers candy bar that's right before your
eyes let's say right now if there was one it's
a very different paradigm a radically different paradigm than what
you're used to and it's because people cannot even really
fathom the possibility of such a paradigm that scientists are
not able to make sense of consciousness and really they're
stuck in their ability to do very deep science because
their paradigm is backwards and the paradigm i'm describing here
it sounds so fantastical it sounds like it's impossible this
can't possibly be true and yet it's absolutely what's true
and you can discover that simply by observing your direct
experience this is not a belief system you have to
adopt that's what's so cool about it you can become
directly conscious that all of these things i've been listening
to you are figments of consciousness that's not like a
speculation it's not like i'm just sitting around here doing
philosophy in my arm chair just kind of like speculating
like oh yeah you know maybe maybe that albert einstein
was just a figment of consciousness or maybe a used
condom is just a figment of consciousness it's like no
you can absolutely be conscious that a used condom is
a figment of consciousness absolutely that's absolutely true right there's
no speculation about this you don't need to go run
a science experiment you don't need to ask some professor
to verify it for you you can become directly conscious
right now that a used condom is a figment of
consciousness that's what it is literally let's keep going think
of a pirate ship that you built out of legos
when you were a kid that pirate ship is a
figment of consciousness how about a racist tweet by donald
trump that's a figment of consciousness an up quark is
a figment of consciousness the milky way galaxy is a
figment of consciousness a teen selling drugs on the sidewalk
in a bad neighborhood that's a figment of darth vader
is a figment of consciousness the game world of skyrim
is a figment of consciousness the entire christian faith and
mythos is a figment of consciousness christian hell you know
with the fire and the burning and the eternal torture
and the devils with pitchforks that's a figment of consciousness
an atheist arguing that god does not exist that's a
figment of consciousness a role of soft charming toilet paper
that's a figment of consciousness the entire history of america
that's a figment of consciousness the intel i9 12th generation
cpu that's a figment of consciousness a swamp in lagoon
in louisiana that's a figment of consciousness the ancient egyptian
god osiris that's a figment of consciousness the art archangel
michael that's a figment of consciousness a tesla model s
being assembled in a factory that's a figment of consciousness
the insta the entire state of california that's a figment
of consciousness the city of new york as it was
in the year 1950 that's a figment of consciousness do
you understand what i'm saying when i say this is
a figment of consciousness the actual city of new york
as a whole can be a figment of consciousness that
means you don't need to create new york out of
molecules and atoms and individual bricks the entire city as
a whole can just be imagined and held within consciousness
and that literally is what new york city is now
of course if you want you can further subdivide in
fact you can infinitely subdivide any figment of consciousness into
an infinite number of sub-figments of consciousness so while you
can hold new york city as a whole you can
also zoom into any part of that figment and then
create finer resolution figments to fill in the details so
to speak it's like a fractal zoom you've seen those
fractal zooms on youtube where it just keeps zooming in
and zooming in and the more it zooms in the
more detail is revealed about the fractal it's like that
you can keep zooming into new york city as much
as you want you can zoom in onto an individual
street corner you can zoom in onto an individual person
on that street corner you can zoom into um you
know an article of clothing on that person like maybe
he's wearing a scarf you can zoom into that scarf
on that scarf you can zoom into one thread uh
of wool on that scarf then you can zoom into
that thread of wool and find uh one one little
fiber one little hair you can zoom into that one
little hair that makes up that yarn and then you
can you can zoom into the protein molecules that are
making up those uh that hair and then you can
zoom into further and further and further and you can
zoom in forever consciousness is doing that you see but
it's not that here's where people make the mistake is
they think well the new york city is made of
atoms no it's not made of atoms new york city
as a whole is just a figment of consciousness and
then you can you can keep inventing other figments underneath
that to ground it you keep grounding it grounding and
grounding it until you get bored of grounding and then
you just say okay well [ __ ] it it's
mad at something i don't really know what it is
we can just keep going forever that's right you can
keep imagining further figments forever this is otherwise known as
infinite consciousness the pacific ocean is a figment of consciousness
and melting ice cream cone in a child's hand is
a figment of consciousness a mosquito bite is a figment
of consciousness so ask yourself metaphysically what is a mosquito
bite the actual mosquito bite not your idea but the
actual mosquito bite let's say you had one right now
on your hand and it was itching you what is
that thing it's not a collection of molecules or atoms
it's a figment of consciousness the mosquito bite is exactly
a mosquito bite it's not anything else you might say
well a mosquito bite is is a collection of colors
no it's not colors are further figments of consciousness you
can break it down into that but that's not really
what a mosquito bite is a mosquito bite is precisely
a mosquito bite the concept of hierarchy or capitalism those
are figments of consciousness the category of insect insects as
a category that's a figment of consciousness disneyland is a
figment of consciousness five meow dmt is a figment of
consciousness a memory of you going to grade school and
learning the multiplication tables bring up that memory right now
that's a figment of consciousness a helicopter is a figment
of consciousness a stomach ache is a figment of consciousness
a pina colada is a figment of consciousness the feeling
of intense anger that's a figment of consciousness a sex
a sexist joke is a figment of consciousness this is
an interesting one see there's something funny about thinking of
reality as being made out of a sexist joke like
a scientist can't accept that a materialist can't accept that
reality is mad of a sexist joke that that doesn't
compute it's like no leo a sexist joke is just
sounds and sounds are just reverberations of oxygen molecules or
something like that nitrogen and oxygen molecules and then those
are hitting the eardrums and those are reverberating and those
are you know sending electrical signals through through a neural
network and that's what a sexist joke actually is no
a sexist joke is a sexist joke stop trying to
break it down into its elements furthermore what i'm saying
is that these different figments of consciousness no one figment
is more fundamental than any other figment therefore you can't
say that reality is made out of certain kinds of
figments of consciousness reality is made out of as much
a pina colada as it is a sexist joke as
it is disneyland as it is a helicopter do you
see how radically different this way of looking at reality
is ask yourself why reality can't just create a sexist
joke because see it might at first on first glance
it might seem like no that's leo that's preposterous reality
can't be mad at sexist jokes um but why is
that any more preposterous really than it being made out
of what what do you think isn't preposterous you think
atoms aren't preposterous you think quarks are not preposterous you
think energy isn't preposterous you think mathematics isn't preposterous it's
like it's okay if riau is mad at mathematics and
computers and molecules that's all fine but if you say
it's mad of a sexist joke or a pina colada
oh that's impossible do you see how silly and arbitrary
that is when you recognize the relativity of substrate you
recognize that one thing one building block is no more
preposterous than any other this is what really frees your
mind up this is like the thing that unlocks your
whole mind and turns your mind infinite because as long
as you think that one thing is more plausible than
something else that for example it's easier for reality to
create an atom than it is for it to create
a pina colada or sexist joke you or if you
say well leo it makes sense that uh reality is
made up of something small and fundamental like a molecule
you know because it's so simple but actually if you
zoom into a molecule it's not simple at all if
you zoom into a single atom it's not simple at
all that's what science has discovered and it's discovering more
complexity to all the subatomic particles such vast complexity that
you can't even create an image of what an individual
subatomic particle like an electron you you can't create an
image or even a diagram of an electron because of
how complex it is um and yet you think an
electron is somehow simpler or easier for reality or more
natural for reality to create than just a pina colada
what you have to understand is that the complexity of
a pina colada versus a electron is identical actually there's
there's no more complexity to a pina colada than there
is to an electron they're equally complex you can zoom
into an electron forever just like you can zoom into
pink collada forever and so therefore it doesn't matter where
in the infinite zoom scale you're at you can keep
zooming in or out infinitely and so it doesn't really
make a difference from reality's point of view there's there's
nothing that's easier or harder for reality to create you
have to understand this right this is a silly relative
human idea that some things are easier for reality to
invent than other things no if reality has the power
to create an electron it has the power to create
a pina colada just the same doesn't matter they're both
figments of consciousness really the the mistake you're making here
is that you're not recognizing that a that that an
electron is a figment of consciousness and you're trying to
you have this sort of idea that well somehow i
can take all the figments of consciousness and boil them
down to something so fundamental that it's not a figment
of consciousness and then i can say i've got it
i figured it out it's all made of electrons or
something and that whole idea that whole endeavor is foolish
and faulty and it rests on the um on the
fact that you you're in a state of consciousness where
you're not conscious that an electron is a figment of
consciousness and furthermore you're not conscious that no matter what
it is that you would try to posit as the
ultimate substrate of reality that it would just be another
figment of consciousness you might say well leo maybe it's
not an electron maybe it's a string and then if
i say no it's a string it's just a figure
of conscious then you'll say well leo it's not okay
maybe it's not a string maybe you're right a string
is a finger of conscious but maybe there's something deeper
underneath that maybe we're in a computer simulation like no
you're not getting it you're not getting how how radical
this goes how absolute this is a computer simulation is
also a figment of consciousness and what you need to
grasp is that no matter what you come up with
as the grounding source for all the figments of consciousness
that's just gonna be another figment of consciousness and so
when you grasp that then you can say okay [
__ ] it's not this is not going to work
i need a totally different way of understanding reality and
now what i want you to consider is the possibility
that your entire life as a whole think of your
entire life your entire life as a whole as you've
lived it that that is a figment of consciousness woven
together out of strands of sub figments of consciousness so
that memory you have of you in grade school learning
the multiplication tables that's one strand of the larger yarn
that is your whole life which is just a figment
of consciousness and when you say that you were born
in such and such a city in such and such
a country at such and such a date that's a
figment of consciousness and when you tell yourself that you're
going to die 50 years from now maybe from old
age let's say if you're lucky to live that long
without any diseases uh on your deathbed you'll be lying
there and you'll be dying that's also a figment of
consciousness and when you think about the dreams you've had
when you were sleeping in your bed last night those
are also figments of consciousness even your dreams are figments
of consciousness and when you say yeah leo but what
about when i'm not conscious what about when i'm deep
asleep and i'm not even dreaming what about the time
before i was even born i was not conscious at
all i didn't even exist what about that that is
also a figment of consciousness so try to really grasp
experientially what a figment of consciousness is this is the
key either do this as you're meditating do this right
now as you're sitting there or do this on a
psychedelic if you really want to go deep with this
um there's various ways you can do it but like
try right now for example just as an exercise try
to grasp that all the material objects around you are
figments of consciousness so like pull out a material object
take out your smartphone hold your whole your phone in
your hand right now as i'm talking to you hold
your phone in your hand look at that phone as
you're listening to me and try to grasp that that
phone is not a material object matter of atoms that
phone is a figment of consciousness your consciousness this object
that you're holding in your hand is qualitative that's what
consciousness is consciousness is qualitative it's also holistic it exists
as a whole this phone is an entire chunk of
consciousness that you're holding it's not built up from the
bottom up of atoms neurons or pixels or whatever you
think it's dreamed up from the top down so to
speak it's crucial that you get this this is the
whole point if you can get this you're going to
be so close to understanding the nature of reality it's
absolute nature figments of consciousness have no size no shape
no bounds and no ground there's no limit to how
large a figment of consciousness can be what shape it
can have or what it can do a figment of
consciousness can be as tiny as an ant or as
large as the entire galaxy it makes no difference to
consciousness because consciousness is infinite in all directions it's scale
invariant because scale is a completely relative notion the way
you get a sense of scale is by comparing one
figment of consciousness to another figment of consciousness and scale
itself the very idea of scale or resolution or finiteness
or a bottom layer to reality those are all figments
of consciousness so if you're sitting there thinking but leo
you know there's a there's a bottom level to reality
reality is quantize at the bottom level it's sort of
like a grid of pixels at the very bottom it's
discrete it's not continuous there's a plank length and you
can't get below the plank length something like that if
you're saying that what i want you to recognize that
plank length is a figment of consciousness discreteness is a
figment of consciousness if you're imagining that at the very
bottom of reality if you keep zooming in more and
more eventually you get to the very bottom and it's
just like a grid of pixels if that's what you're
imagining it is that's a figment of consciousness consciousness is
unbounded stop trying to bound it or to ground it
also stop trying to think that one figment of consciousness
is somehow easier to create because it has a simpler
shape or because it has a smaller size like you
might think well it's easier to create an electron than
it is to create an elephant because an elephant is
created out of many millions of electrons whereas an electron
is just like this simple circular object you might think
elephant is a very complex object and it's made of
many electrons so the elephant is harder no that's a
mistake adopt the attitude that any object of any size
of any shape of any complexity is equally as easy
for consciousness to imagine as the simplest object you can
think of that's the proper attitude there's an additional layer
of mind [ __ ] to this is that an
implicit assumption that's baked into materialism is the idea that
that reality is concrete like if you ask a scientist
what is reality actually whatever answer they give you that
answer is always going to be something concrete like it's
this it's that it's math it's equations it's numbers it's
strings it's quarks it's it's one thing versus another thing
right concrete but what what really boggles the mind is
to open your mind to the possibility that reality could
be uh it's not limited to being concrete it could
also be abstract and vague so for example if you
ask a traditional scientist in a university like is reality
made out of um little subatomic particles or do you
think it's made of like waves discrete particles or continuous
waves they're going to say well it's either one or
the other or you might say is it a computer
simulation or is it not a computer simulation they're going
to say well it's either one or the other and
they're going to debate each other about this or you
might say is is reality made out of language or
is it made out of neurons or is it made
out of qualities like colors they're gonna these scientists and
academics will take definitive positions on these things as though
it has to be like this way but not that
way but what will never occur to them is what
if there actually isn't an answer to that question what
if the actual nature of reality is that there actually
isn't some one way that it is because at the
bottom you might say you zoom in so so so
deeply into at rock bottom there's not a collection of
objects it's made out of but that the objects actually
lose their their definition and they actually turn into an
indistinct soup of pure abstraction and vagueness that is in
fact what uh quantum physicists are discovering when they try
to peer into the subatomic particles is that they realize
that um the the more they look for something concrete
it slips through their fingers and it just becomes something
abstract and indistinct so you have to recognize that concreteness
itself is a bias of your mind you're expecting to
find some concrete substrate that itself could be a flawed
metaphysical assumption that you're sneaking in to your inquiry into
the nature of reality but at the same time i'm
not also saying that it has to be abstract because
you might say well leo but if it's abstract isn't
that also a bias yes that's also a bias so
it's so abstract that it's like meta abstract to the
point where it could be concrete it could be abstract
and it's unspecified but then you say leo but then
it's unspecified that's what it is and it's like no
it's so unspecified that you can't even say it's unspecified
because it could be specified but then you say no
believe so then it's specified which is it leaves it
specified or is unspecified well specified and unspecified are again
two figments of consciousness if you take pure consciousness you
can ask okay leo yeah you're saying figments of conscience
but what is consciousness leo you're just you're just kind
of kicking the can down the road you're not actually
answering the question because now it all hinges on the
answer to the question of what is consciousness because you
never explained what that is but that's not uh that's
not a that's not a bug of my system um
it's because and it's not because i don't know what
consciousness is or that you don't you can't know what
consciousness is that's not what i'm saying what i'm saying
is um you can't reduce it it's irreducible see you're
asking me to reduce consciousness but i can't reduce conscious
because conscious is the rock bottom what is consciousness consciousness
is infinity that's what it is the problem is that
you're not conscious enough to understand what that means consciousness
is the sum total of every possible fragment if you
take not fragment but figment if you take all the
figments of conscious that we talked about every but that's
just the tip of the iceberg every possible figment of
consciousness literally imagine every possible figment of consciousness ever that
could ever exist that is infinity and that is what
consciousness is it's every possible figment of consciousness but if
you if you fuse every possible figment of consciousness into
itself what you end up with is a is nothing
you end up with just pure consciousness or pure emptiness
or infinity here you need a deep awakening to to
understand what this is um what i'm pointing to what
i'm talking about you can't know what consciousness is without
awakening so that's something you have to work on but
for now let's keep going consciousness and reality same thing
uh is unlimited and holistic it can weave together any
figments it wants to create a cohesive life or state
the state could be flowing it could be frozen it
could be any possible way there's no limit to it
and this state and this weeding process of these figments
can happen from the top it happens from the top
down not from the bottom up therefore it's irreducible therefore
any attempt to try to reduce it the way that
science tries to do it's it's never gonna get it
you have to grasp it from the top down not
from the bottom up now what's what's so striking about
how this process works is that consciousness has to weave
these figments together perfectly and cohesively in order for you
to have a sense of sanity and really this is
the obstacle that we're dealing with here in trying to
explain consciousness to you is that you're sort of assuming
that you can understand what consciousness is and what reality
is while maintaining your sense of sanity and that's not
the case you have to recognize that that's that's a
very sneaky assumption sort of an epistemological metaphysical assumption that
you're sneaking in when you're trying to question reality is
you're just sort of assuming aren't you that you can
question reality and understand it while maintaining your sanity what
if that's not the case what if to understand what
consciousness really is you'd have to lose your sanity what
if the actual process of getting it leads to you
losing your mind that would be very challenging now if
that was the case because see when you begin inquiring
into the nature of reality and yourself and consciousness it's
sort of like an armchair philosophical exercise for you it's
it's it's interesting you can sit around and kind of
speculate and theorize maybe we're in a computer simulation maybe
we're in a matrix oh that's kind of cool you
know maybe it was evolution maybe it was god who
created us okay that's kind of interesting right you can
you can sit there and speculate and debate about these
things that's all fine fine and good but it never
occurs to you that to really get the answer you
might have to lose your sanity then if it was
posed to you that way like do you want to
have the answer to the ultimate nature of reality and
where it came from and how it is work how
it works or do you want to maintain your sanity
what if you had to lose your sanity to understand
how many people would choose to understand over losing their
minds very very few and that's why this is not
very well known so the key insight here is really
appreciate that your sanity is at stake here you wonder
leo why does reality feel so real and solid and
material i mean leo if this is all a dream
and these are just figments of content i mean you're
saying the wall the walls of my house are just
figments of consciousness well if that's true why can't i
walk through them if i'm in a dream why does
it not feel like i'm in a dream why does
it feel so real and solid and if if mysticism
is true why isn't my experience so mystical why is
my experience of reality right now very non-mystical well understand
the depth of the problem see if all the sudden
you realized that you could walk through the walls of
your house and that the walls of your house were
not real or solid or physical but figments of consciousness
you would think you've gone insane really appreciate that if
you start to realize that physics is imaginary you would
start to lose your mind and it would terrify you
in a sense what i'm telling you is that your
sense of physical reality and your sanity are intertwined such
that if you want to experience non-physical reality you're going
to have to go slightly insane and the more insane
you go the less physical reality will seem and if
you want to completely pierce the veil of physics and
physical reality you're going to have to be insane because
that is how you literally define what sanity is if
you woke up tomorrow got out of your bed and
fell through your floor because you realize your floor was
non-physical think of how terrified you you might say leo
that's so cool i want that but think of do
you really want that think about that think about how
terrified you would be think about how you would carry
on with your normal life how would you go to
work how would you take care of your children what
would happen if you took your hand and you tried
to comfort your your crying daughter and your hand just
went through your crying daughter's face because you realized she
was just a figment of your consciousness how would you
feel again you might be tempted to say oh leo
that's so cool i want that but do you understand
how attached you are to your little existence to your
little life the way that it is you're very used
to life unfolding in a very specific particular way and
as soon as life unfolds even in a slightly different
way you get all pissed off angry outraged depressed your
whole life is about surviving within the dream that you're
dreaming and anything that disturbs your dream too much or
shakes its foundations this terrifies you because you're no longer
able to survive you don't know how to survive you
don't know what to do you don't know what to
do with your life you don't know should you go
to work what's going to motivate you if you realize
that your daughter is imaginary what's going to motivate you
to keep feeding her to keep going to work to
keep loving her how are you even going to know
if you're experiencing truth or if you've just lost your
mind see if you woke up tomorrow and you fell
through the floor of your house as you got out
of bed it's not merely that you couldn't survive you
wouldn't even know what's true anymore you wouldn't know is
that true did that really happen to me or did
i just fantasize it am i losing my what's happening
am i schizophrenic see you would need to invent a
whole story to explain to yourself what's happening you would
rush to the um to the emergency room or to
a mental hospital you would try to find the best
psychotherapist in the world to try to help you you
would start stuffing your mouth with the antipsychotic medication just
to get back to where you were to get your
mind back and of course you would tell yourself that
this isn't happening something is wrong with me i'm having
some sort of brain disorder and the doctors you would
turn to to help you all of them would tell
you no no no yeah you're you're you're this isn't
actually happening this isn't this isn't real you're just you're
just hallucinating things your mind is going unstable you probably
have some schizophrenia or some psychosis it's just a psychotic
episode relax we're gonna give you some medication here uh
you know watch some television play some video games we'll
give you some good food stay with the with us
here in this hospital you know our therapist will take
care of you and they will reassure you that actually
your daughter um your daughter is not a figment of
your consciousness and the floor is not a figment of
your consciousness they're all real calm down relax you're gonna
be back to normal in a few days and this
would all reassure you and eventually you would fall back
into your normal state of consciousness see all that mental
illness and insanity r is a loose incoherent state of
consciousness and so what you think of as material physical
reality this is just a very very coherent well woven
together collection of figments of consciousness and you're mistaking its
coherence and its consistency it's internal consistency you're mistaking that
for materiality or for truthfulness or for what you call
reality and as soon as that consistency starts to unravel
you think you're losing your mind and you are terrified
you scramble to get it back together again to be
coherent and if you're unable to do that then the
rest of society and your children and your parents and
your spouse and all your friends we will all tell
you that you've lost your mind and that you're sick
and eventually we'll lock you in a room or inject
you with medication why because for us to maintain our
dream of coherence we need to make sure that there
aren't crazy people running around who are questioning material reality
because if too many people start doing that then eventually
we'll realize that [ __ ] maybe this is not
as material as i thought this was maybe i'm in
a dream maybe i'm not as sane as i thought
i was maybe what i call sanity is just a
very narrow spectrum of the full range of what consciousness
is capable of and i only call things sane which
are within my comfort zone of what i'm comfortable with
being conscious of and the stuff that i'm not comfortable
being conscious of that stuff is so insane i don't
even want to look at it so here's the next
mind [ __ ] states and figments of consciousness are
not merely personal experiences happening inside of a brain a
body a physical universe or a computer figments of consciousness
are absolute absolute again this is not something you're going
to understand until you awaken because until you awaken or
have at least one awakening you don't have any reference
point for what absolute is but what i'm saying is
that red is absolutely red mickey mouse is absolutely mickey
mouse evil is absolutely evil that's what it is every
quality of consciousness every figment of consciousness is exactly itself
it's self-identical making it absolute so when you're seeing the
color red or mickey mouse that's not merely as philosophers
of mind would say some sort of qualia or some
sort of perception underneath which there's the real reality no
no that is absolute reality mickey mouse is absolute reality
everything is absolute reality there's nothing that isn't absolute reality
reality is absolute whatever quality it takes whatever figment is
arising in your consciousness right now is absolute reality brain
is a figment of consciousness physical universe is a figment
of consciousness atoms are a figment of consciousness science is
a figment of consciousness history is a figment of consciousness
computation is a figment of consciousness and you're trying to
use all of these and more figments of consciousness to
somehow ground absolute the absolute and relativize it and turn
it into something like a a field of perceptions that
you a biological creature who is made out of matter
sitting on a planet earth is having situated somewhere in
history in the history of the universe so to really
awaken what you have to do is you have to
cut all of these figments you know these figments are
all tightly woven together almost think of it like a
sweater knitted out of yarn and really it's just one
one long strand of yarn making up this whole sweater
but it's the way it's knitted it seems like it's
more than that and it and it the the yarn
is like you know it's tight like this so when
you pull on it it seems it kind of like
it's just one solid object when you're pulling on it
pretty much you know you can flex it a little
bit here and there it's flexible but you can't really
pull it apart and so the process of awakening to
really fully awaken to understand what consciousness is and what
reality is you're gonna have to you're gonna have to
unravel this whole yarn and you have to realize that
the whole yarn the whole sweater is just made out
of one chunk of yarn and you're gonna have to
untangle all of it to realize that that's what a
sweater is it's just one long piece of yarn another
way to to explain reality is to call it mind
i call it mind with a capital m infinite mind
now what is the difference between whether we call it
mind or whether we call it material well here's the
key differences a mind unlike material a mind is fluid
and it can work holistically top down material has to
be made of little simple elements and it has to
work bottom up because of this kind of bottom-up approach
material actually can't be intelligent mine since it works top-down
it actually can have sentience and intelligence this is the
key difference between materialism and what i'm describing here you
could call it idealism i guess mind materialism can't have
intelligence you might say oh leo but yeah material can
have intelligence you can have a brain with neurons neural
networks and that creates intelligence no intelligence has to be
top down it can't be bottom-up so all the bottom-up
explanations of intelligence uh they actually they don't work i
can't explain to you why uh because you'd have to
awaken to understand that you'd have to actually awaken to
absolute intelligence to what intelligence says you're not conscious of
what intelligence is therefore i can't explain it to you
and the reason i can't explain it to you is
because the only way you can understand what intelligence is
is to be top-down conscious and intelligent and right now
you simply lack the intelligence to understand what intelligence is
you lack the consciousness and that's because you're trying to
understand intelligence from the bottom up by dissecting it into
little you know reductionistic pieces like neural networks and molecules
and neurons and atoms and computation information flow no none
of that is intelligence intelligence is an absolute and has
to be understood from the top down so um the
only reason you are intelligent to whatever degree you are
there's many degrees of intelligence but the only reason you
have intelligence at all is because you're a mind you're
not matter your mind that's why you're intelligent if you
are intelligent and see intelligence can reduce itself from the
top down it can't build itself really from the bottom
up it has to reduce itself from the top down
so what you have from the highest level is you
have infinite intelligence and that intelligence can dumb itself down
infinitely low to turn itself into something dumb like a
doorknob so a doorknob it's not that in something highly
intelligent is built up of simple dumb objects like doorknobs
or neurons or nodes in a neural network no no
it's the ups it works the opposite way it's that
you have infinite intelligence which dumbs itself down puts itself
to sleep reduces its consciousness until it reaches the level
of a of a neuron or a doorknob and then
it looks dumb so the dumbness of material objects is
actually an illusion because it your entire field of consciousness
is actually infinite intelligent infinitely intelligent but it's it's acting
dumb because it's trying to construct a finite life and
it's also trying to maintain your sanity in the same
process because if you actually experience infinite intelligence you're going
to be so intelligent you're going to feel like you've
gone insane high intelligence feels like insanity most humans don't
understand this because they're simply not intelligent enough but i've
reached levels of intelligence that are so high states of
intelligence that are so high that it feels like i'm
losing my mind and it would terrify you if you
had that level of intelligence you would be so intelligent
humans would perceive you as other worldly as an alien
or as a um some sort of supernatural entity as
a as a deity so mind has a fundamental capacity
for sentience and intelligence in fact that's the actual nature
that's the that's the highest nature of what mind is
is infinite sentience and intelligence consciousness mind is also capable
of comprehension unlike material a material system is not capable
of comprehension a mind is again you might say well
leo but but i know material systems which are capable
of comprehension like the human brain no no um all
those material systems you think are capable of comprehension they're
they're not material systems there are no such thing as
material systems everything you call a material system is not
a material system it's mind so the only reason the
material system is capable of comprehension is because it's actually
mind masquerading as material you actually can't point to an
example of a material system because they don't exist because
mine is absolute there is no such thing as a
material system material is just a dumbed down state of
infinite mind when you're not aware of that then you
can think that well oh but there can be a
material system that's also capable of comprehension no there can't
there absolutely can't but to understand that you'd have to
awaken also a mind is creative a material system cannot
be creative again you could say but leo i have
a computer that's running an ai and it's a material
system and it can be creative no the only reason
your computer is creative if it is if it's running
an ai is because your computer is a figment of
consciousness an infinite mind it's mind that's doing that only
mind is capable of creativity another feature of mind is
that mind can remember and mind can forget and material
systems don't have this capacity another feature of mine is
that mind has no substrate or ground whereas material systems
need to have a substrate or ground uh why is
that well because mind is infinite that's what not having
a the only reason you could have no ground is
if you're in the only way you can have no
ground is if you're infinite if you're finite you need
to have a ground um but it's i mean it's
it's funny because you can't have something that has a
ground because where would it be situated in it there
always needs to be an infinite regress in terms of
grounding something so actually there can't be anything finite everything
has to be infinite so there actually cannot exist a
finite material system a finite material system is actually an
infinite system which has dumped itself down from the top
down to pretend as though it's finite and limited and
the the last feature of mind is will a mind
has will whereas the material system cannot have will so
the way it works is that a mind can imagine
dumb dead matter but matter cannot create a mind and
the reason that can't happen is because matter is mind
now you said malia can't there just be matter with
no mind no mind is absolute you can't have anything
outside of mind you might say malia that's like a
tautology you're not like you're not leaving any wiggle room
here it sounds like you're very closed-minded and absolutist about
this yes mind is absolute you have to open yourself
to the possibility that there literally is not even space
in existence for anything but mind because everything is mind
what you call matter is mind if you imagine something
that's not mind and you say ah leo but i
can i can think of something we can open our
minds to the possibility there's something outside of mind but
that's inside of mind you're doing that with mind that's
a figment of mind you can think of reality as
an infinite field of pixels all communicating with each other
and coordinating intelligently from the top down although you have
to be careful with this metaphor of pixels because when
you're imagining a field of pixels this is actually sort
of a materialistic analogy because the pixels become finite as
soon as you start to imagine them you start to
imagine sort of bottom lower resolution to the pixels but
the infinite field of pixels you might maybe even better
is to call them voxels not pixels because they're three-dimensional
um or they're even more than three-dimensional you can have
as many dimensions as you want it's not limited to
any number of dimensions but let's call them voxels for
now so you have this let's say 3d infinite field
of voxels but these voxels have like sort of like
minecraft right but these voxels you know minecraft has some
sort of smallest resolution unit but the way that consciousness
works is it doesn't have a smallest resolution unit it's
just infinite all the way down and all the way
up and then you might ask well leo are the
pixels square or are they circular like atoms and of
course the answer is since it's infinite it goes infinitely
far down um the question doesn't apply uh because the
pixel itself has no boundary or shape so imagine a
screen made of pixels or voxels that have no shape
to them they're unbounded that also means that each pixel
is infinite it can be infinitely subdivided it has no
lower resolution it's an infinitely resolution high resolution reality and
that is what you see before you right now you're
inside of an infinite resolution field of consciousness see and
then you can't even call them pixels anymore or voxels
anymore because what is a pixel what is a voxel
um that already assumes a certain shape but if there's
an infinite number of them and they have no shape
they're not square they're not round they're not anything then
what is the difference between having an infinite number of
pixels versus having no pixels at all of course they're
identical infinite pixels zero pixels is the same thing infinity
is zero so um or you can just think of
it as one single pixel but it can subdivide itself
infinitely so conscious is an infinite field that has infinite
potential for subdivision and then infinite communication between all the
sub divided parts infinite possibility to coordinate them this is
intelligence the possibility to coordinate and to unify or to
subdivide all the pixels without any limitation whatsoever from the
top down and this if you look at your hand
right now if you pull out your hand and look
at your hand this is exactly what your hand is
your hand is a figment of consciousness a field of
infinite pixels that have infinitely subdivided themselves and also intelligently
unified and coordinated themselves and are communicating with each other
to render this object that we call a hand intelligence
is the communication and coordination between all of the subdivisions
of an infinite field of of these pixels of consciousness
and this is not occurring with within a brain and
it is not occurring within neurons and it is not
grounded in atoms or molecules pretty cool huh see the
actual structure of reality is pure [ __ ] genius
it's way more genius than anything you could possibly all
the [ __ ] that humans have invented to explain
reality all the models all the quantum physics that is
like kindergarten crayon drawings that's like horseshit compared to the
actual genius design of what reality the way reality actually
works the actual mechanism of reality so here's a here's
an important additional insight for you about consciousness consciousness has
the remarkable feature of remembrance and forgetfulness think of it
as though there's a a switch in the universe you
can you can it's not really a switch it's um
it's a dial you can you can turn this dial
this knob and as you crank it up the universe
remembers itself and as you crank it down the universe
forgets itself it literally forgets parts of itself this is
completely unlike a material system see in a material paradigm
you can sort of ask the question like well what
is the state of the universe and you could say
well it's a bunch of atoms with these xyz coordinates
located here and there and and so forth and if
you ask the question like well does the universe know
all of its parts so to speak um the materials
would say yeah the universe kind of knows all of
its parts it kind of sees itself the universe like
is just all these arrangements of atoms it's a funny
way of speaking about it but just kind of go
along with me here um it's really hard to articulate
these these things because we're really talking about things that
do not exist or do not make any logical sense
within sort of normal human discourse or language or logic
we're talking about translogical things here things that i've accessed
from ridiculously high states of consciousness uh so um what
was i saying yeah so so if you sort of
ask the question of a physicist like does the universe
know all of its parts the physicists would say yeah
um and there's not a possibility the universe can just
like forget parts of itself like can the universe forget
that the the earth exists just kind of forget you
flip a switch the universe forgets that the earth exists
and then you flip a switch and then it remembers
all of a sudden see in a material model there's
no there's no room for this but in the model
that i'm describing where you just have consciousness one of
the features of consciousness is remembrance and forgetfulness so literally
right now the state of consciousness you're in the switch
of forgetfulness is cranked all the way up that means
you're you're very forgetful that means you have forgotten literally
how you have constructed the planet earth you're not conscious
of that right now if i was to flip this
switch and turn you on to full remembrance you would
actually remember how you constructed the planet earth see under
a materialist paradigm to say this to a to a
serious physicist the physicist would say like that i've lost
my mind or that i'm talking complete nonsense the reason
they say that is because their minds are so narrow
that relative to the narrowness of their minds yeah what
i'm talking about is insanity um but if you expand
your mind very far then you become very conscious and
very awake then and then you find this switch you
can find the switch to remembrance and then you'll remember
how you created the whole earth see this this kind
of idea doesn't fit within the materials paradigm and if
a materialist experiences this switch being flipped the materialist will
[ __ ] his pants and will think he's lost
his mind he'll he'll check himself into a into mental
institution and he'll take antipsychotic drugs because from his little
narrow paradigm you can't have such a switch such a
switch can't exist well maybe that's because you've lost your
mind or maybe that's just because your mind was very
small to begin with and you were very deluded and
self-deceived about how well you understood reality and maybe reality
is structured in such a brilliant way that it it
it goes way beyond anything you you could imagine was
possible so consciousness has the ability to hide things from
itself at will this is impossible under materialism so keep
that in mind this switch is actually the switch of
awakening when you are waking up you're flipping this switch
you're twisting this knob and you're going from forgetfulness to
remembrance for example you can remember how you imagined and
created your own birth here's another key insight for you
thinking modeling and conceptualizing all the stuff we're doing right
now together cannot substitute for states of consciousness so even
though i'm telling you all this interesting stuff and you
might even agree with all of it it doesn't matter
because your state of consciousness actually probably hasn't changed since
the beginning of this episode and the things that i'm
talking about will only make sense from very high certain
states of consciousness and since your state of consciousness hasn't
changed you don't understand what i'm talking about even if
you tell yourself that you do you actually don't and
you will not understand that you actually don't until you
access these higher different states of consciousness which is why
we're talking about this all thinking and logic takes place
from within the frame of the state of consciousness that
you're in right now that means what you're able to
think and understand and communicate to yourself and to others
everything you're able to model all of science all concepts
all explanations every single book that has ever been written
it can only make sense within a certain frame of
consciousness then it's all relative to a certain frame of
consciousness state of consciousness which creates this frame and to
experience and understand things beyond this frame you have to
go outside of this frame and no amount of talking
within the frame will get you to understand what's outside
the frame this is crucial crucial crucial crucial what you're
able to think and how you think is completely bound
up with your state of consciousness and right now you're
not in a high state of consciousness therefore some of
the things that i am trying to explain to you
you cannot understand and they are impossible to communicate to
you and also it's not just your limitation it's also
my limitation the state of consciousness that i'm in is
also preventing me from communicating to you and even the
method i'm using to communicate this linear method of putting
one word after another the english language it's way too
limited it doesn't have enough bandwidth to communicate the things
that are beyond this narrow ordinary set of consciousness that
most humans are in most of the time the material
state we could call sort of the default human state
of consciousness of waking consciousness the material state there are
things i'm trying to communicate to you from beyond the
material state but i can't because you're in the material
state and the language i'm using to communicate is also
part of the material state but what's really interesting is
that a lot of spiritual teachers frame thinking as an
obstacle to spirituality and to awakening and they teach you
to shut down your mind and stop thinking but that's
not technically correct and it took me a long time
to to figure this out but i finally did is
that actually thinking comes in various kinds of degrees and
your thinking expands and becomes what i call hyper thinking
thinking can acquire extra dimensions to it that it simply
cannot have within the material frame and so as you
expand your state of consciousness and your frame expands your
thinking can expand it can turn into what i would
call hyper thinking and now all of a sudden you
can reason and think in i would call hyper dimensional
ways and you can literally think things that are impossible
to think in your current state of consciousness and that
hyper thinking is a new dimension of intelligence that most
of mankind doesn't know exists it's a kind of thinking
or intelligence that you would imagine an alien that is
a million years more evolved than the human species if
we ever encountered such an alien and communicated with it
somehow it's the kind of intelligence that that alien might
have like if that alien had a brain that was
100 times larger than ours try to imagine what kind
of intelligence they could have and what kind of ways
of thinking like imagine an alien mind thinking in sort
of hyper um in a sort of a hyper manner
like hyper intelligent not just i'm not just talking about
the difference between like 150 iq points versus 200 iq
points i'm talking about the difference between like 150 iq
points versus a million iq points like that level of
difference so imagine what a million iq mind could think
this would be a a super intelligence that maybe you
would only attribute to some sort of ai you know
if we if we linked every computer on the planet
together every supercomputer and somehow it turned into some sort
of you know sentient ai or whatever you know in
these sort of science fiction um scenarios you can kind
of imagine how much smarter it would be than the
average human right well um well the funny thing is
that i've already accessed this intelligence and you can access
it too the reason we're talking about this because i
want to help you to access this intelligence it's [
__ ] amazing to access this intelligence you can access
a million iq points and see what that's like you're
able to think thoughts that are impossible to think in
your current state of consciousness imagine a mind that's able
to think like a hundred different threads of thought at
once and then interconnect them together it's not just more
thinking it's not just faster thinking it's a it's a
much it's a much more robust um uh higher bandwidth
multi-dimensional way of thinking it's incredible um and it doesn't
just scale linearly it like scales exponentially it's not just
more thinking it's it's a much higher quality thinking and
all the limitations of normal human thought those are all
transcended and the thinking process itself becomes spiritualized it's a
mystical kind of thinking it's rationality but it goes beyond
rationality it includes rationality includes logic but it becomes a
sort of a hyperlogic plus it combines with with visions
with uh you know with with mis with mysticism it
all kind of combines together with a hyper intuitive understanding
and just as just profound intelligence and so when your
state of consciousness expands your thinking expands and all of
a sudden shutting off your mind is no longer the
goal it's no longer desirable you can think and your
thinking is so powerful that you can just cut through
all the [ __ ] of normal human thought and
you can access spiritual truths that are impossible to access
otherwise and in fact there are spiritual truths you could
access through this what i'm going to call hyper thinking
that you're not going to be able to ask if
you just shut off your mind and go into a
meditative state like the zen buddhists do which is one
of the limitations and problems that i've always had with
stuff like buddhism and zen buddhism and so forth where
they teach you to shut off your mind is that
yeah you can do that you can access some cool
states of consciousness and you can even have some awakenings
but you don't access hyper thinking and you might say
well leo i don't need to ask hyper thinking but
you don't really know what you're missing until you access
hyper thinking some of the coolest deepest insights require access
to this hyper thinking furthermore some states of consciousness are
so radical that they cannot even be remembered or explained
to oneself so there have been states of conscience that
i've accessed that are so radical that even as i
sit here now because my state of consciousness is lower
than it it was at that peak as i sit
here now i can barely remember those states and i
can barely even explain them to myself let alone to
you and that's astounding because it just shows you how
crucial your state of consciousness is my current state of
consciousness does not give my mind enough bandwidth to access
the deepest and most profound insights and thoughts that i've
had even my memory in this current state of consciousness
is not sufficient to hold truths and insights from those
higher states of consciousness my current state of consciousness does
not allow enough bandwidth and memory for that and it
does not allow enough um processing power and verbal communication
power to even explain those states to myself but i
have you might ask well then how do you know
about it well i have some very vague fuzzy recollections
of those insights intrudes and states but it's it's like
very very um um diminished so think about taking an
hd 4k image and then compressing it down into like
a 6 pixel by 6 pixel square that's black and
white that's how much you can do that you can
do that compression process but think about how much you
lose going from a 4k hd image to a 6
pixel by 6 pixel image um that's kind of like
how it works and it's almost to the point where
this little image i mean it's better to have this
little six pixel by six pixel image than nothing at
all but it's so degraded that like you you can't
really it has like almost no comparison so much has
been lost that um you can't even really use that
image to navigate in this ordinary life it's it's insufficient
to navigate it's insufficient to really transform you so so
part of what we're dealing here we're dealing with sort
of a lack of bandwidth problem by sort of accessing
these higher states of consciousness and coming back down to
our normal states of consciousness there's not enough bandwidth really
and so ideally what you do with spiritual work is
you got to open up that bandwidth so here's the
key and some more key insights right now you are
in some kind of state of consciousness whatever that is
uh whatever state of consciousness you're in that state completely
determines the parameters of your experience what you're able to
think what you're able to communicate what you're able to
understand how you emote how you feel what you think
is right and wrong sane or insane logical or irrational
possible and impossible and you cannot imagine or think beyond
the state of consciousness that you're in right now without
expanding it it can also contract further too so it
can it can contract a lot as well um and
there exist radical new states of consciousness beyond your current
state of consciousness which you cannot even imagine it's something
totally new and if you were to experience it it
would completely shock you and you would think that it's
impossible but that's only because what you think is possible
or impossible is defined by the frame of your current
state of consciousness which is not very high by the
way you cannot avoid being in some state of consciousness
no matter what you're doing or how you are you're
in some kind of state it could be a low
state it could be a medium state it could be
very high state but you're in some kind of state
states have trade-offs and pros and cons some states are
more resourceful than other states there are certain things you
can do in certain states but not do in other
states for example in your current state you can open
a book and read it there could be another state
it could even be a high state of consciousness where
your conscience is so high that it's beyond your ability
to read a book you might say well how can
that be if it's so high shouldn't i be able
to do all the stuff i used to do no
there's actually trade-offs you can have a state of conscience
that's so high that paradoxically it cripples you you're not
able to walk you're not able to talk you're not
able to think you're not able to read a book
you're not able to even see the material world imagine
state of consciousness where you're so conscious you can't even
see a a cup of water because you're too conscious
to see a finite cup of water this actually explains
why humans have a relatively low state of consciousness because
in a sense that's what comes with being human to
be human to perceive as a human to experience the
world in a human way to have a family to
have children that you care about and to um go
to work and do all this sort of human stuff
that we like to do to have sex to be
interested in that kind of stuff to be interested in
money to care about pain and suffering to want to
avoid it to even care about living these only make
sense within a low state of conscience if you were
in a higher city college you wouldn't care about any
of these things you wouldn't care if somebody shot you
you wouldn't care if your children got raped you wouldn't
care about going to work you wouldn't care about being
on time you wouldn't care about taking a shower or
brushing your teeth other things would these things wouldn't matter
so that explains why humans struggle so much to understand
reality is because there's just there's such higher dimensions of
reality that are so beyond being human i want you
to really grasp that this idea of something being impossible
impossibility is a function of your state of consciousness and
at the highest state of consciousness nothing at all is
impossible the high state of consciousness is infinite possibility there's
literally nothing that consciousness cannot imagine when it is fully
conscious because consciousness is unlimited that's what infinity is it's
complete lack of limitation we could call that god mode
that's what god mode is nothing is impossible from god
mode but from a lower state of consciousness a lot
of things are impossible because the lower states are filled
with finite things and limitations so changing your state of
consciousness is the number one most significant change you can
make in your life it's more important than earning money
having sex or anything else there's two kinds of changing
your state of consciousness one is a temporary state change
and two is a change a permanent change to the
baseline of your consciousness the state that you're usually habitually
in most of the day when you're not sleeping let's
say you can even change the baseline state of how
you sleep the state you sleep in you can even
change that something like lucid dreaming or whatever um but
um but yeah so raising your baseline both are both
are very important both have their utility obviously the more
you can raise your baseline the better that would be
the ideal the problem is that it's actually very difficult
to change your baseline state of consciousness it's much easier
to get a temporary peak and then it's hard to
maintain um that peak and you come crashing back down
to your baseline or even sometimes lower than your baseline
then you kind of even back out and you stabilize
at your baseline um but a lot of times the
mistake people make is that they dismiss the importance of
a temporary peak they say well leo if it's just
a peak and it's just temporary that it's not true
it's not as true it's not permanent therefore it's not
real it's not absolute or what's the point even because
you're going to crash back to the baseline anyways so
what good is it this is a huge mistake these
peaks are a lot of good first of all because
you're never going to be able to raise your baseline
if all you're doing is focusing on raising your baseline
your baseline it's it's much harder to raise your baseline
and you're never going to be able to to reach
the the kind of level you can get at a
peak as your baseline in practice you're never going to
reach that so people who just do work on their
baseline they might think that they're being like all disciplined
and you know traditional following some traditional buddhist path that's
all fine and good but the problem is that you're
not going to access the highest states of consciousness and
so you're you're going to be deluded even if you
do manage to raise your baseline significantly of course the
other problem is that if all you do is chase
the peak experiences and you do no work on your
baseline then you're going to be very frustrated and spiritually
unrounded because um you're just going to be jumping up
and down on these peaks but your baseline is not
going to be shifting and basically you're going to have
a lot of maybe intellectual understanding but your ability to
embody and to actually transform your life and to have
the happiness and all the benefits that come with with
the higher states you're not going to have those consistently
and that's going to cause a lot of problems for
you too so really you need both you want both
uh it's not one or the other and there's different
techniques for accessing or training up one or the other
so science rationality skepticism thinking physicality these only happen within
certain states of consciousness birth only exists within certain states
of consciousness death only exists within certain states of consciousness
science doesn't understand this and science doesn't understand that science
itself is a state of consciousness all science is relative
to this low state of consciousness that most of us
are in most of the time it's important to understand
that there is no best state of consciousness and there
is no invalid state of consciousness so just because you
have a higher or a lower state of consciousness doesn't
mean the higher ones are better again it all depends
on it's all relative it all depends on like what
you want to do with it if your desire is
to understand the entire universe then higher states are better
but if your desire is to live as a human
and just do normal human stuff then the high states
of consciousness are not good for you they're bad for
you if your desire is to maintain your sanity as
a human high states of conscience are very bad for
you and there's nothing wrong with being in a human
state of consciousness or being in a dog state of
consciousness or a a warm state of consciousness that they're
all equally valid they have their pros and cons spirituality
basically boils down to changing your state of consciousness without
changing your state of consciousness spirituality doesn't make any sense
and it devolves into something stupid like organized religion most
people have never experienced a high mystical state of consciousness
which is why there's so much confusion about religion and
also about the nature of reality why both the religious
people are so confused but also the academics and the
scientists and intellectuals public intellectuals are also so confused because
they haven't accessed sufficiently high states of consciousness and they're
trying to do their best to understand reality from their
current state of consciousness and maybe they do a little
bit of practice to expand it a little bit but
it's not sufficient and they think they can just figure
it out with their mind or through reading a book
or through doing some math equations or doing some science
experiments and none of that will work that's why i'm
so stressing in this episode states of consciousness i really
want to communicate to you how important this is this
is the master key that unlocks everything and if you
don't use this master key nothing else you do will
compensate for that you can't compensate for it by saying
a bunch of hail mary's and praying a lot and
going to church a lot and doing good deeds and
being nice to your kids and donating to charity and
doing chanting mantra meditate like none of that matters none
of that will compensate being the perfect buddhist will not
compensate for your lack of consciousness so all religious teachings
and religious wisdom and truths come from higher states of
consciousness that's where they come from and then they get
written [Music] and degraded and corrupted and passed around society
and culture by people who have never accessed those states
of consciousness and therefore these religious teachings do not make
a lot of sense for ordinary people because you're trying
to interpret truths and wisdom and insights from very high
states of consciousness from super intelligence of like a million
iq points and you're trying to understand that using your
100 iq point capacities from this current state that you're
in and that's just it's never going to work there's
way too much degradation way too much law is lost
in the narrow bandwidth way too much is lost in
translation and that's why you have people like sam harris
jordan peterson um other folks who like to talk about
religious topics or spiritual topics or even non-duality or psychedelics
or whatever they talk about you know in this domain
or science or rationality or logic or language or post-modernism
right they talk about all these topics but they're always
just like they're just going around in circles and very
lost very confused um and like they just do they
do not have a clear enough consciousness because they haven't
accessed those higher states and yet they want to like
make a whole career out of teaching these ideas and
things to to sort of to normies to their audiences
and they're just they're not able to do it and
no matter how much they do what they're currently doing
they're never going to make sense of it never no
matter how many scientific books they read how many studies
they run how much neuroscience they do none of it
will ever be good enough the only thing that will
help them is to access those higher states and of
course they have a lot of defense mechanisms to prevent
them from accessing those higher states because if they access
those higher states then many of the things they teach
and their ideologies and their models and systems would all
collapse and also they would lose their minds in the
process so changing your baseline state of consciousness is very
important accessing those higher peaks is also very important and
all of it takes a lot of work it's all
scary it's all difficult and it's dangerous it's also dangerous
and therefore almost nobody does it and that's why society
is in the state of ignorance that's why we're living
in the dark ages there are some people who do
this but it's they're pretty rare um there's many different
degrees of higher consciousness that could be accessed but few
people access the highest um states and um even fewer
people embody all those states it's one thing to access
another thing to embody it um and so just um
yeah we're living in the dark ages changing your state
of consciousness can be scary threatening and dangerous it pulls
the rug out from under you it dematerializes reality it
can feel like insanity and it can also be very
isolating and lonely because it feels like nobody understands you
the higher stages you access or the higher states that
you access the more you understand the more intelligence you
access the more alone you feel because so few other
people have accessed it that you have few people to
connect with and the things you realize you have like
nobody else to help you to validate those you have
nobody else to bounce those ideas off of um and
at the very highest levels there literally ceases to be
an other whom you could communicate or validate these ideas
or truths or insights to or against and there even
stops being anyone left to teach at those higher levels
because it just all boils down to your own consciousness
and that in itself is very isolating lonely and scary
or it can be uh as you're struggling to integrate
it so you might be wondering now will leo changing
states of consciousness sounds like it's very important how do
i do it well here's a list of all the
ways that you can do it meditation concentration vipassana really
concentration is the key if you want to access the
highest states you gotta concentrate like a [ __ ]
i mean you gotta concentrate so powerfully that you can
sit for a week and just concentrate for a solid
[ __ ] week like imagine sitting staring at a
wall for a week just concentrating on a [ __
] wall for a week that would do it that's
hard to do that's why nobody does this stuff do
nothing meditation is good being present very present is good
contemplation maybe i mean it's hard to access i mean
contemplation by itself won't really get you to access very
high states not in my experience you'd have to combine
it with like intense concentration so but contemplation is good
if you want to sort of like start to think
in more abstract ways some of those hyper thinking qualities
come from contemplation but it has to be combined with
expanded states of consciousness because contemplation by itself doesn't really
expand consciousness enough in my experience uh yoga various kinds
of yoga and pranayama i've talked about korea yoga in
the past that's that's a good way chanting in mantras
even though i kind of made fun of that um
if you do it very seriously serious chanting serious mantras
as a meditative practice really as a concentration practice that
can do it like tibetan style chanting and mantras or
hindu style deep breathing shamanic breathing i have an episode
on shamanic breathing check that out that can do it
psychedelics herbs and drugs that's really the most powerful way
that i've discovered nothing will shift your state of consciousness
faster and more radically than the right psychedelic i've discussed
that a lot in the past so i won't talk
much about it here i have videos you can watch
about that visualization can also be very powerful but visualization
has to also be done with intense concentration and it's
really it's about the qual like the intensity of it
the intensity and just the sheer quantity of it right
like if you're gonna be doing some yoga or some
chanting or some mantras or some visualizations or whatever like
it's not enough to just do it for an hour
a day that's not gonna do it that's not gonna
shift your state enough like you gotta be doing it
for like a [ __ ] week straight for a
month straight that will shift your state significantly prayer also
can work in this way if you're doing serious prayer
it's basically a combination of like visualization concentration practice and
sort of like a mantra it's like all of those
combined together and if you do that for weeks for
months for years that that could work to expand your
state shaktipat if you've heard of that that could work
dark room retreats i've heard could work i haven't tried
all these methods there's just so many methods to try
but these are the ones that people report work for
them and of course you also have to understand that
this list some of these gonna work for some people
not for other people so i'm not saying that all
these will work for you or that all these will
work for me um some of them just it depends
on your personality type your brain your your level of
consciousness the state you're already in like there's a lot
of variation your genetics all that determines how well these
techniques will work for you also how much you like
the techniques because if you don't like a technique you're
not going to be able to do it with sufficient
intensity and duration to make it work so right you
have to find what works for you so dark room
retreats astral projection various kinds of work you can do
within sleeping and dreaming like lucid dreaming type stuff um
vision quests traditionally have been used for this extreme suffering
danger and pain this can shift your state of consciousness
being out in nature can raise your state of consciousness
various kinds of radical experiences travel adventure know if you
jump out of an airplane i've actually done this you
can jump out of an airplane and that will certainly
change your state of consciousness it'll make you a lot
more present now will that actually transform your baseline forever
no probably not um this whole problem of how do
you how do you shift your baseline state of consciousness
permanently this is this is still a open question for
me that i'm still researching and experimenting with and trying
stuff out honestly it's quite challenging to do um it's
a lot easier to access the peaks than it is
to raise your baseline um i've done a lot of
work accessing the peaks at this point in my life
and then i'm going to do a lot more work
in the future to raise my baseline that's still something
on my to-do list that i'm working towards so i'll
i'll share more of that in the future as i
have better more experiences and sort of more stuff to
share there more understanding of what it really takes to
do that um falling in love even and experiencing deep
forms of genuine love can raise your state of consciousness
so those are some of the ways if you're trying
to raise your baseline the most direct method i would
say is just it's really the hardest one sit and
concentrate for weeks at a time without distraction that's basically
it um [Music] maybe some yoga and breathing intense yoga
intense breathing that can also work and then if you're
if you're looking for ways to experience the highest peaks
then nothing is better for that than psychedelics so there
you go the function of psychedelics is to show you
how consciousness changes how fluid it is go watch my
episode called how psychedelics work where i explain that because
a lot of people are confused about what the function
of psychedelics are in spiritual work so as i've said
your state of consciousness determines what you can do mystics
can do impossible seeming things because they are in different
states of consciousness paranormal abilities and cities are possible from
certain higher states of consciousness stuff like clairvoyance telepathy that
kind of stuff if you think it's [ __ ]
that's because you haven't accessed those states of consciousness it
seems like [ __ ] from your current state of
consciousness and if you don't think it's [ __ ]
but you're wondering like leo why how do i get
telepathy or where do i get clairvoyance why don't i
have these things well because you're not in the right
states of consciousness and now you're asking me will you
how do i change my state of consciousness to access
those things i want those things well honestly i don't
know i don't know what it takes to get those
abilities uh i know i know it's possible because really
nothing for conscious is impossible but um i don't know
what you would have to do what kind of work
you would have to do to get those as a
baseline to access those as a baseline consistently i don't
know that would take probably years and decades of practice
that the majority of you don't want to do and
that i haven't done yet myself so i don't really
feel qualified to teach it uh every living being is
in a unique state of consciousness whether it's an aunt
a kangaroo a human an alien or even you versus
your mother and your father you're all in different states
of consciousness is god god is the highest state of
consciousness but it's not just a single state there's many
high states of consciousness and god is all those states
but even more interestingly god isn't just the highest states
god is all states but the trick is the wrinkle
is that god is only self-aware of itself as god
from certain high states of consciousness those states are what
i call awakened states so even though all states are
god not all states are aware that they are god
so for most of you listening to this right now
right now you're in a state you are god god
is the state you are but you're probably not aware
that you are god unless your god realized then maybe
you're aware of it then you're in an awakened state
but most of you aren't awakening in enlightenment is a
state of consciousness it could be a temporary state or
it could be a permanent state but it is a
state there is not a single awakened or enlightened state
there are dozens and hundreds of them awakening comes in
many degrees it's not an on off switch it's like
a volume knob there exist states of consciousness in which
you can access omniscience from which you can be conscious
of how you created all of reality and how you
created your life the point of this episode is to
guide you towards that and to open your mind to
that possibility and to explain to you why you don't
have access to that right now now you understand why
because you're in the wrong state why do humans disagree
with each other so much about reality seemingly believing crazy
things it's not because they're dumb per se is because
they're in different states of consciousness which disagree with each
other if you've only been in one state of consciousness
your whole life then mystical teachings will seem insane and
irrational to you and you will rationalize it to yourself
that anyone who's teaching this kind of stuff or talking
about it is delusional or insane or a cult leader
or a grifter or charlatan because your mind needs some
way to explain it to yourself otherwise your mind won't
be consistent and so your mind comes up with these
kinds of rationalizations and so it would be a lot
easier if you submit to yourself that there are higher
states you haven't accessed yet and that's why this stuff
doesn't make sense to you if it doesn't make sense
to you and so most the times when you think
some spiritual teacher or teaching is coming from some idiot
or grifter or cult leader who's delusional actually that's a
projection coming from your own lower state and actually it's
you who's the deluded idiot because you think you got
all figured out in the state that you're in right
now but there are much more expansive states where you'll
realize how dumb you were to think that disputes between
religions mystical teachings spiritual gurus and enlightened masters are rooted
in access to different higher states of consciousness that's why
there's disputes between your various spiritual teachers that you might
have studied or read their books and you wonder well
how come they're disagreeing well because they've accessed different states
of consciousness and there are so many different kinds of
states of consciousness that it's unreasonable to expect every spiritual
teacher to access all of them there's way too many
of them to access it's sort of like expecting your
spiritual teacher to have visited every country on the planet
there are too many countries for everyone to have gone
to all of them and to experience them all and
to be able to do a very precise comparison and
contrasting between all the different countries that exist and all
the different cultures all the different cuisines all the different
languages it's too many of them usually what happens is
that your spiritual teacher picks one language one country or
maybe a couple of them and they can teach you
about that but then they can't teach you about the
places they haven't been to as we're wrapping up here
you might wonder well but leo but you didn't tell
us what consciousness is you spoke a lot about consciousness
but you didn't say what it is you can't say
what it is because it's infinite it's unbounded and it's
everything and it's the rock bottom it's absolute it's more
fundamental than explanation or language it's also beyond your current
state of consciousness to grasp but you can figure out
what it is for yourself just shift to a higher
state of consciousness and that'll do it now you might
want to but leo where did consciousness come from where
and coming from are figments of consciousness so consciousness didn't
come from anywhere because those are figments it invented which
means that consciousness has always existed it's eternal it's always
been here it didn't come from anywhere it's infinite it's
been around forever it's not bound by time since time
is some is just another figment of consciousness and then
finally you might get a little smart alecky and say
well leo but then what about god isn't god also
a figment of consciousness if everything is a figment of
consciousness then surely god must be a figment of consciousness
haha i got you god is not a figment of
consciousness god is consciousness god is all possible figments god
is a meta thing god is you you you are
consciousness and you are dreaming up various figments one of
those figments that you're dreaming up is the biographical biological
human self that you imagine yourself to be right now
that was born and that's going to die that's a
figment of consciousness that you as god are imagining so
you can drop those figments but then you'll just be
god that's it that's the end of this episode hopefully
that clears things up now you understand what consciousness is
and how it works now a few caveats and and
sort of like final warning warnings that i want to
give is my understanding of consciousness is still evolving it
might seem like i'm presenting this as though i understand
everything about consciousness but i don't i understand consciousness relatively
well compared to most humans and i understand it very
well at its absolute highest level but then where i
still struggle is understanding all the nuances and mechanisms and
details of how consciousness works that's that's still stuff that
i need to research and experiment with and test and
a lot of methods for how to raise your consciousness
all that kind of stuff i'm still testing that stuff
out i still struggle with that stuff i also struggle
to articulate to model and to explain consciousness that's like
actually a separate thing it's one thing to access the
highest levels of consciousness and kind of get it for
yourself it's another thing to then come back and then
explain it to others teach it to others create models
about it articulate about it and so forth that's that's
a separate activity and just because you're good at one
doesn't mean you're good at the other and vice versa
like you can be very conscious but then bad articulating
it you can be good at articulating it but then
also not be that conscious and so yeah i'm trying
to try to do both here also i struggle a
lot with embodying it i've accessed very high levels of
consciousness but i still struggle to live and embody like
at a very kind of like micro day-to-day level i
still struggle to embody all that i have a lot
of work probably decades more work to do on that
front and it's challenging work it's not easy i struggle
with it every day um so don't think that i'm
some sort of know-it-all i mean yeah i've accessed i've
accessed omniscience i've access to absolute consciousness i know what
that is but it's it's still a challenge for me
to figure out exactly like why consciousness works the way
it does at these finite realms uh it's i still
have questions in terms of like um a deeper understanding
of various facets and aspects of consciousness like love and
intelligence i'm still trying to like grasp and understand like
one of the questions i still have is like i'm
trying to get a better handle on what intelligence is
like i know intelligence is infinite i've accessed that but
then to actually articulate what intelligence is um that's a
[ __ ] that's a real [ __ ] that's
hard to do so i spent a lot you know
a lot of time thinking about that working on that
um i understand that the highest level consciousness is absolute
infinity like i know that that will never change but
then what does it actually mean absolute infinity what are
all the ramifications of that all the ways it manifests
that i still struggle with and i work on that
every week and i'll have more insights into that i'm
sure in the years to come um so um so
yeah there's a lot there's a lot to say about
about consciousness it's a very tricky beast and it's it's
very humbling um you would think that oh you just
awaken you reach the highest level and you understand everything
it's like no just because you reach the highest level
doesn't mean you understand all the like intermediate levels and
then how do you know you reach the highest level
there's a higher level beyond what you you know maybe
you reach something that you think is the highest level
but there's something beyond that how do you know that
well you have to stay humble and be open to
the possibility there's something more that you haven't reached yet
um and so there's a lot of potential for self-deception
here so i want to refer you back to my
episode three-part series called self-deception part one part two part
three where i talk a lot about you know that
that's a foundational piece of my work is self-deception that
theme of self-deception and i i stress again i gotta
stress to you guys because sometimes you get the wrong
idea that like oh leo thinks that self-deception is so
important and all that but then he's self-deceived because he
doesn't understand that he can deceive himself it's like no
as i explained especially in part three of that series
i'm not immune to self-deception i always have to be
double triple checking myself sometimes i'm i'm second guessing myself
20 30 times for years and months at a time
about some point about this or about that because i'm
very cognizant of how easy it is for me to
deceive myself and at any point in time i know
that i'm self-deceived about certain things not all things but
certain things um there's things that i know i'm self-deceived
about that will be corrected and improved in the future
it's like you know i i can't be perfect it's
kind of like as i'm teaching this stuff to you
guys understand that it's sort of like i'm constructing the
airplane as we're taking off on the runway it's like
i feel like i'm a pilot in a jumbo airplane
i kind of know how to fly it i have
a vague sense of it but the plane is is
only half constructed you guys are on the plane we're
lifting off and it's not complete it's half complete and
then and that that's just how this process is like
it's not a perfect process you're going to be scrambling
to scrap this stuff together and you're flying by the
seat of your pants you're trying to figure it out
as you go along because you know my life is
unfolding as i'm figuring this [ __ ] out and
i'm like i'm in the thick of it right it's
not like i'm above it all teaching it to you
i'm in the middle of it figuring it out making
mistakes going through the process going through self-deceptions weeding out
my own self-deceptions as i'm trying to teach this stuff
so it's challenging and it's a big responsibility to teach
this stuff because i'm very cognizant of the fact that
if i say something wrong uh if i deceive myself
the biggest problem is not that i deceive myself that's
that would be okay but it's that i deceive you
too right and so one of the safety mechanisms that
we need here for this process to work is that
you have to figure you have to do the work
here you can't just sit back and listen to me
passively and just accept it or believe it you have
to be open to the possibility that i could be
wrong about things you don't know what i'm right about
and what i'm wrong about and so you have to
be picky you have to think for yourself contemplate this
stuff access your own insights cross-reference what i say with
what other people say with your own direct experiences do
the practices and that's the safety mechanism here that's what
keeps you from falling off a cliff so make sure
you take responsibility for that i take responsibility for trying
to teach you the most accurate things that i know
to not lie to you to not deceive you to
not financially exploit you i take responsibility for all those
things i'm not offloading that i am responsible for that
don't get me wrong and if i make mistakes i'm
going to try to do corrections and so forth in
the future if you stick around many people don't stick
around so they never hear the corrections um but i
can only do the best that i can do and
i am stuck in a finite form to a certain
degree and so there's just going to be limitations to
my own mind to my own thinking to my own
ego my own biases these are all going to distort
and corrupt my teachings and i'm very cognizant it's painful
to me when i look back at my older teachings
how corrupted they are by my own selfishness by my
own pettiness by my own human [ __ ] by
my own fantasies and like this isn't anything new i've
been conscious of this from the very beginning but also
it's like what do you expect from me do you
expect me to like be perfect and to not have
any of those that's also unrealistic right anybody who's going
to be teaching you is going to have their own
biases and certain traumas and shadow stuff and thing you
know weaknesses and and vulnerabilities and things they're embarrassed like
they're going to have all these things so it's important
that if you're learning from anyone any professor any teacher
spiritual or non-spiritual you have to understand that they're all
fallible i'm fallible i make mistakes uh we all deceive
ourselves we all have biases um we have different ways
of communicating and so forth and you have to take
responsibility and double check everything for yourself and run it
through your own filters and see whether it applies to
you whether it works for you whether it makes sense
for you and that's this process and there's no algorithm
for it it requires intelligence and wisdom on your part
it requires work and effort on your part this is
not like sunday school where you come here every sunday
and i just give you a bunch of uh dogma
and you just memorize it and then you're spiritual this
has been a problem with spiritual teachings since the dawn
of civilization and this problem is not going away because
spirituality is deeply personal you have to be doing it
for yourself so be you know i've told you in
the past be the ceo of your life well be
the cso of your life chief spiritual officer of your
own life you have to take responsibility for doing spirituality
this is one thing you cannot outsource to others it's
okay to learn from others you know i've studied hundreds
of spiritual teachers read hundreds of spiritual books gone to
all sorts of retreats and workshops and this and that
but in the end like one of the things i'm
trying to model for you is like i take radical
responsibility for my own spiritual work i'm not looking for
somebody else to give me the answer i'm mostly struggling
through it myself trying to cobble together ideas from other
people and figure it all out test different methods and
so forth and it's a very messy hairy process it's
difficult but i don't know any other way it could
possibly work so i hope you're doing that for yourself
as well you
