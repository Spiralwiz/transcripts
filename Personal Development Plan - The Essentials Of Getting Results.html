hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to give you a personal development plan
alright so let's talk about personal development plans what does
this involve what is a personal element plan how do
you do personal development how do you actually do it
this is super fascinating topic for me this is something
I've been researching very heavily for the last five years
really for the last five years of my life doing
a lot of personal development and looking for the best
ways to accomplish it how do I actually get the
results one of the biggest challenges I've found is that
you start reading some of these books and some of
the going to some of these seminars and maybe buying
some of these self-development products watching some videos etc and
what you start to notice is that you're not quite
getting the results that are promised you're not quite getting
the results that you wanted from yourself and that you're
still stuck basically where you were and and so to
get yourself unstuck if you get yourself moving forward and
get those awesome results there are some things that need
to be happening it's actually a very very deep topic
it's not something I could cover in one video it's
not something I can even cover in five videos all
my videos are ultimately showing you how to do personal
development and are creating a very very big picture personal
development plan so ultimately here's a solution to this and
I've been researching personal development now for five years like
I said I've processed over $100,000 worth of person development
material from very expensive exclusive seminars to hundreds of books
to audio programs video programs like you name it so
I've covered so much of this stuff and I have
a very big picture in my head of how this
looks how does this look from a you know 10,000
foot bird's-eye view sort of perspective and I think it's
very important to have that perspective because until you understand
how it works you're not going to be able to
get results you might have a little technique here that
you use but then either fall off track you might
have a little strategy here that you go and you
try to implement and maybe it works for you a
little bit but then ultimately your life doesn't transform and
so to get those transform a tional results that's where
you need to to see the big picture and so
that's one of the reasons that I found it actualize
not org you know my whole website the my youtube
channel all of that is about giving you the big
picture but what I need to tell you is that
this is a deep topic like I said and that
you're not going to you're not going to you're not
going to fix that with one video really if you
want the ultimate solution first of all this is a
bit self-serving plug for myself but watch all of my
content I mean most of it is free I literally
have probably close to a hundred hours now maybe 50
to 100 hours if not more depending on when you're
watching this of material either for free about very deep
topics that have cost me a lot of money too
and a lot of time to research and to understand
and to bring those nuggets out kind of into the
open and just share it with you guys literally some
of the some of the gold that I bring to
you I take from ten thousand dollar seminars ten thousand
dollar trainings alright so take it very seriously but I
think the the best way that I would do it
if I was doing it from your position is I
would subscribe to all the stuff that I've got and
I would watch it I would watch it again and
again again and I actually have done this not with
personal twelve men in general but in other areas of
my life when I wanted to master something I would
go and I would finally get a really good YouTube
channel of someone who is very knowledgeable about it now
would subscribe to that person or follow all their stuff
and look at it again and again and again until
I kind of drilled it into my mind right and
I do that with the seminars that I watch and
the books that I read like I drill and drill
and drill in order to really soak it all in
to develop a mental model of how this stuff works
that makes it much easier to follow through on it
because you know where you're going you know what kind
of what the pitfalls are etc so that's kind of
that's kind of where I'm leading you to is to
start watching this stuff because if you're really serious about
finding a personal development plan then I'm going to give
you a bare-bones one right now but it's going to
be very bare-bones and you have a very difficult time
really understanding the depth of it and the profound effect
they can have on your life you're just not going
to buy into it you're not getting motivated to follow
through and you're probably they're not going to know the
specific details because to outline all those takes a lot
of time and frankly a lot of my videos already
have outlined that stuff act if you're really serious I
have the personal velvet blueprint that's on my website at
actualized org slash blueprint and that that has been I
spent the last six months taking all the personal notes
that I've compiled from all this research and distilling it
down and I wanted to find about a hundred of
the most important principles and concepts for how to do
personal development like what are the most critical essential things
without which you cannot be successful or fulfilled in life
in any area of your life and I distilled those
I found those a lot of research and I'm constantly
updating that thing and putting in more and more knowledge
as I'm doing even more research and I'm going to
be filling that thing up with videos and a lot
of exercise files other stuff so go ahead and check
that out at actualizado sauce blueprint that is my version
of the personal development plan but even that you look
at it you know right now it's like 100 maybe
110 or even 120 points deep and each one of
those points is a super deep principle that can take
you months maybe even years to master so there's there's
so much depth here and this is not a bad
thing it's actually a really good thing this means that
these are all tools you know each one of these
principles the each one of these bullet points is a
tool that you can use to revolutionize and transform your
life it's quite amazing I haven't really seen anything else
out there that's this comprehensive so go ahead and check
that out it's free might as well check it out
but I'm going to give you even an even more
bare-bones plan right now right so check out the blueprint
and everything watch everything on this channel watch all the
free stuff that I've cut coming to you watch all
my videos but then here's the bare-bones plan if I
was doing personal development here's what I would say the
kind of you know the the low-level tactics are the
techniques that you should be using alright so first of
all I think it's critically important if you're very serious
about personal development getting results from it is to have
that big picture you need to basically learn the big
picture that's going to take some time that's going to
take you reading some books it's going to take you
following my stuff watching all my videos multiple times that's
going to take you reading other people's stuff go into
other blogs you know watching other videos about personal development
that's going to you going out there and kind of
trying a little bit here and there but ultimately just
building a picture what does this look like why are
you doing it how have people done it in the
past are there principles to being successful and happy in
life and if it there are like what are they
and what is the consensus you need to kind of
build a model in your own mind I've got a
model in my mind but that's me right so my
model might be different from yours and just because I
gave you my model doesn't mean that you can appreciate
it the same way as if you built it up
yourself so you have to do a little bit of
that legwork too right I can give you a lot
of gold and stuff that will shortcut that process you
don't have to spend five years doing it but you
have to spend some time doing it don't think that
you can just now slack off look at that list
of you know like go to the blueprint look at
that list and all of a sudden just kind of
like look at it once and you're good no that's
not going to do anything for you you need to
look at that list multiple times you need to then
go to other sources as well and paint a picture
in your own mind of how this process is going
to look and create basically a personal building plan for
yourself it has to be tailored to you something's very
personal so that's where I would start is there that's
part of your bare-bones plan is to understand the plan
right the next point that I would say is vision
you need to have vision vision and goals what is
your ultimate vision for your life for what you want
out of your life and what are some of the
goals you have set for yourself you have to sit
down and do some goal-setting you're going to have to
come up with a very powerful vision that's going to
motivate you and push you through all the challenging obstacles
that are going to come your way why are you
doing personal development you know what is it really going
to add to your life how is it going to
improve your life you got to answer these questions for
yourself need to be very methodical about them coaching is
very good for this I'm a life coach I'd love
to coach people on these topics professionally because I feel
like a lot of people get stuck on this vision
and goal-setting process it's a lot it can be a
lot more perilous than it seems on the surface so
coaching is great for that if you're stuck the next
one the next one is I'd say unhook from distractions
right now if you're struggling in your life and I
would say that you I can pretty much guess that
you have at least two three maybe five or ten
major distractions in your life they're just robbing you of
your energy robbing you of your fulfillment and robbing you
of your time you might be saying yourself well I
don't have time to study this and learn books and
read your 100-point blueprint multiple times and watch all your
videos I don't have time for that well you do
have time for it the question is what are all
the what are all the things are doing right now
that you really shouldn't be doing watching television hanging out
with friends that are negative people that are holding you
back all the different psychological crutches and addictions you have
to food to internet all the time that you're wasting
right you have to start to look at those things
and start to unhook yourself unhook from all the distractions
the video games the internet the porn the the TV
you're watching well this stuff is just a huge time
sink and an energy sink and not only is it
taking time away from the positive work that you will
be doing through personal development but it's also actually putting
you into low consciousness state so it's making very difficult
for you to follow any sort of plan even if
I gave you a perfect plan you just probably wouldn't
be able to follow it because of those things so
get yourself off of those distractions and addictions the next
thing is build positive habits it's a very broad a
very broad category of you know an activity but basically
you need to start putting habits into place in your
life that are supporting you supporting your vision supporting your
goals supporting your life purpose you need to you know
what does that have it for you I don't know
it's gonna be different other people for different people so
maybe for you to have it go into the gym
or a habit of doing some yoga or habit of
reading every every night for an hour a habit of
meditation a habit of journaling a habit of waking up
on time or a habit of waking up earlier than
you currently do a habit of going to sleep on
time you know positive things positive things that you could
be doing to to really to push yourself forward and
sultanate lee where your personal moment plan is going to
be consists of is various positive habits that you're working
on okay the next point I would say is live
purpose this goes along with vision and goals but deserves
its own mention life purpose what is your purpose in
life if you don't have a purpose in life then
what is your plan going to lead you towards it's
going to lead you round in circles you have no
direction you have no sense of direction your energy your
thoughts are not going to be concentrated towards anything and
life purposes of D - ah - topic of finding
out life purpose I've really struggled with a lot myself
and in my my own journey to find my own
purpose which I'm now very solidly on track with I've
discovered a lot of kind of tricks and secrets about
how that should be done so my purpose is very
important the next one I would say is journaling this
is kind of a more of a you know a
little tactic that that I can offer you is journaling
is you need to journal more part of your personal
moment plan should involve journaling journal all the time journal
every single day it does have to be for a
long time you know just for 5 or 10 minutes
could be enough but just start to get your thoughts
out start to be more introspective and do it in
a way where you can refer back to it so
it's on paper I have other videos to talk about
journaling so I'm not going to get into all the
details here meditation that's the next point I think that
any solid personal moment plan must include a daily habit
of meditation whether it's for ten minutes thirty minutes or
an hour I personally do an hour every day maybe
you want to start off with something like 20 minutes
it's what I recommend I have other videos to talk
about meditation but that's a really important element and the
final element that I would say which is super super
critical is to start to learn and to work with
programming your subconscious mind this is such a powerful idea
I really discovered it only about a year ago and
it started using it my own life to get some
ridiculous results and I don't even know how you can
do personal development without this and this is just basically
the idea that you need to start to understand what
your subconscious mind is and use various techniques and strategies
for whe reshaping it reprogramming it finding the negative beliefs
that you've got the limiting beliefs that are holding you
back start to work those out introspect about them kind
of psychoanalyze them pull them out rip them out and
then reprogram yourself so that you've got positive beliefs instilled
in you right and this can be used this can
be done with with various tactics from affirmations visualizations other
stuff that really I can't go into here because that's
such a deep deep topic it to do that properly
takes take some training and again seeing that big picture
like we talked about so that would be my personal
development plan bare bones if I say I had to
pick just like the top ten things this is it
learn the big picture have a vision goals unhook yourself
from distractions build positive habits have a life purpose Journal
meditate and then reprogram your subconscious mind if you do
those things Wow your life will be so so different
that you will be shocked it'll be hard for you
to believe where you came from you'll literally look back
a few years later it's not going to happen in
one day so I can have in a week or
a month but over the course of a couple of
years you'll look back and you'll see and your life
will be so different that you'll you know kind of
like you'll you'll do a facepalm kind of thing and
you're like wow that's that's incredible I can't believe other
people aren't doing this aren't people other people aren't following
a personal development the way that I've been following it
so that's a it's going to be a profound moment
for you and at that point you're really going to
be bought in and you're going to keep growing and
growing and growing and your potential Wow you can you
can go really high if you do that you'll go
really high in business go really high in career and
you'll go really high with your personal relationships and your
whole life your satisfaction with your whole life will just
skyrocket it's quite incredible so that's it I'm signing off
that's what I have to say about personal moment plan
