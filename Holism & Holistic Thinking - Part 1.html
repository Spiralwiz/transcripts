[Music] let's get into the heart of holism and holistic
thinking there's so much material to cover here that there's
actually going to be an additional part next week so
stay tuned for that as always sometimes the best material
i save for last as we build up but if
you haven't watched already make sure you go watch my
previous episode called what are holons where we lay the
foundation for what will for what we'll be talking about
today so basically at this point you should understand that
everything in the universe is connected to everything else in
case that wasn't clear but for a lot of people
this isn't clear because they're looking at the universe through
the filter of their selfish ego mind and this creates
distortions and causes us to think unholistically and when people
tend to think unholistically this leads to pathology disease and
even evil in quotes evil and that's why this topic
is so important and we'll be going into just exactly
what the connection is between lack of holism and evil
deeper in this episode but before we get to that
first let's define holism in a formal way if we
look at the dictionary the oxford dictionary definition says the
following quote it's the theory that parts of a whole
are in intimate interconnection such that they cannot exist independently
of the whole or cannot be understood without reference to
the whole which is thus regarded as greater than the
sum of its parts end quote so that's basically what
it is the key there the key the whole key
behind holism is this idea of irreducibility you can't just
reduce reality down to a collection of independently existing parts
because in fact everything that exists exists together as a
unity it can't exist otherwise for very deep metaphysical reasons
that i've explained elsewhere and that i will elaborate upon
some more as we keep going here but this is
the key see it's not just that reality is a
collection of loose objects what really matters is the relationships
between these objects not just the objects themselves it's the
relationships and how they interconnect and how they flow and
merge into and out of each other and also the
different various levels of subordination and super ordination that they
are in relationship in the various hierarchies which lead to
our keys and so on so holism is the opposite
of reductionism or atomism reductionism or atomism is the idea
that you can treat nature as just a collection of
discrete individual objects and this reductionism is actually an implicit
sneaky hidden part of the materialistic paradigm which we've talked
about in the past when we talk about metaphysics and
we talk about epistemology the maturistic paradigm is the idea
that the universe is is real and it's material it's
out there it's physical it's external it's objective it doesn't
depend upon the mind and these sorts of ideas a
lot of scientists subscribe to this sort of paradigm well
it's not just that it's also the idea that you
can just boil everything down to something like atoms such
that a human is nothing other than just atoms and
the planet is just nothing other than atoms and that
everything ultimately is just physics and then if we can
just figure out physics at the quantum scale or whatever
then we will understand all of the universe and that's
going to be it and everything else is just some
sort of epiphenomena or just some sort of uh second
order third order fourth order effect from the molecules bouncing
around it's this kind of idea and then we tend
to approach everything in life that way and it creates
all sorts of problems because this is an unholistic way
of thinking and ultimately leads to many dysfunctions and pathologies
as we'll be talking about so it's this idea that
if we want to understand what a frog is what
we do is we go into the swamp where the
frog lives we yank the frog out of there we
put it into a in a glass terrarium and then
we study it for a few days then we throw
it into a blender blend it up and we study
the juice of the frog and that's the real essence
of the frog to understand the frog you gotta blend
it up and study its juices under a microscope and
there you see the little molecules and proteins and then
you break that up even further you put it into
this sort of uh centrifuge machine that separates all the
different cells and molecules into different layers based upon their
size and weight and density and so forth and then
that's how you really understand what the frog is the
frog is really carbon atoms and nitrogen atoms and oxygen
atoms and that's what it is this is a very
uh unholistic approach to doing science and this is where
science creates a lot of problems for itself you know
people sometimes say leo why are you so anti-science i'm
not anti-science i'm actually very pro science but i want
science done in a holistic manner because the spirit of
science is to understand reality as a whole not to
understand little bits and pieces because the problem is that
just because you understand one bit or one piece of
reality does not mean that you have the same kind
of understanding as the whole of reality you can't just
stitch together a little bit of you know oh someone
blended a frog here and someone did something there and
someone understood some molecule there and then we just we
just stitch all those together and then we understand reality
you can't understand reality that way and if you think
you can that's an implicit part of your epistemology and
metaphysics that you're sneaking in which you did not actually
validate or prove no scientific study has been done to
demonstrate that this is the right way to do science
or that this is the only way to do science
or that this is how you get to truth or
the highest understanding we've discussed this in my series deconstructing
the myth of science part one two three go check
that out if you're interested more about the the deep
epistemology and metaphysics of how science is done and the
various corruptions that exist within science so you see like
look at how much is missed when you blend this
frog and you only study its juices what about how
the frog lives what it eats how it interacts with
the frogs how it relates to the environment it's a
part of to even think of a frog as this
separate discrete object separate from the swamp in which it
lives separate from its other members of its species and
its mates and its society or community that already is
a deeply reductionistic unholistic highly problematic way of understanding a
frog you might think that just by yanking that frog
out of its habitat and then studying it inside of
a terrarium that that would be better than blending it
in a blender and you're right that is better maybe
you play with the frog you feed the frog you
learn something about the frog that you don't understand by
blending it but even that doesn't really capture the whole
of it because if you really understand frog you got
to go into the swamp where it lives and study
its natural habitat because the frog is going to behave
differently in your lab terrarium than it will in its
swamp and it will behave differently depending on what season
it is what time of day it is wha how
the rainfall is whether it's mating season or not and
you might say okay leo fine i'm gonna i'm gonna
spend more money and i'm gonna go into the into
the swamp i'm gonna set up a little uh cubby
there camouflage in the swamp and i'm gonna study those
frogs that way but even there you're not understanding the
depth of the problem because just you being there in
the swamp next to the frog studying the frog that
already influences the frog's behaviors and you might say no
but i'm camouflaged so it can't see but you're assuming
that the frog has the primary mode of seeing you
through its vision but what if the frog's got other
senses that you don't even know about maybe it can
hear you maybe it can smell you maybe it's got
some six or seven cents that that we don't even
know maybe it can sense your magnetic signature or your
infrared radiation or whatever you don't know see you haven't
thought about these things very deeply because your whole approach
is very reductionistic and so ultimately the the fatal flaw
of most scientists is that they they underestimate the entanglement
problem we've talked about that before the integral problem that
exists between the scientists and the subject or object that
he's studying see in a sense you're entangled with the
frog your understanding of what the frog is and how
you think about the frog this is all really it
doesn't exist out there in the frog it exists in
your mind how you think about the frog just the
fact that you think of it as this separate isolated
creature is already a sort of a category in a
projection and a bias that you're imparting upon the thing
you're studying and then you make various kinds of assumptions
about whether you can study this frog in a blender
or in a terrarium or in the natural environment or
however see now it's understandable why scientists do this because
reductionism makes your life a lot simpler you can pare
down the problem to some convenient little box and then
study it within that little box this makes it easy
to do science but also it's a it's a sort
of a crippled version of science because your understanding then
becomes very compartmentalized and limited too you see and so
understand that there's different gradations of science you can have
low quality science you can have very high quality science
but then the higher quality science is more difficult to
do that's why it's not done requires a lot more
money it costs a lot more money to go out
into the swamp and live with the frogs there it's
not very comfortable and convenient it's a lot better from
a scientist's point of view to study the the frog
in a lab but you know what a lot of
the stuff that is studied in labs isn't actually how
it works in the real world which creates blind spots
and biases and it creates bad science you know a
lot of scientific research and studies they are literally done
with like college students why is that because most act
most scientists and academics they live in a university setting
and of course what do they have an abundance of
and overabundance of uh eager free fodder in the form
of undergraduate students that they can do surveys on polls
on research studies they can drag them into a laboratory
you know pay them a little bit of money to
be lab subjects they're little guinea pigs and then they
experiment on them but you know this leads to biases
because when all of your research and surveys and studies
are done on on college students that's a very narrow
unrepresentative sample of the larger population we're talking mostly about
uh western kids between the ages of like 18 and
25 that are at these universities these tend to be
affluent they tend to be more white they tend to
be more secular non-religious if they're going to a university
they tend to be more liberal more progressive as opposed
to conservative they tend to not represent all sorts of
segments of the population they tend to be within a
very narrow band of spiral dynamics stages of development uh
they tend to have similar cognitive moral spiritual development and
then so when you do research on these types of
people you get a very narrow result back but then
scientists tend to just extrapolate that out say well if
it if it's true for my undergraduate students then it
must be sort of true for the whole human race
which of course isn't the case for example if you
wanted to as a scientist to research uh something like
meditation well the problem with that is that you might
conduct you might design an experiment and then you might
recruit some some of your undergraduate students to participate uh
in that but the problem is that none of them
are going to be very expert meditators at that age
in that cultural uh in that sort of cultural uh
bracket in that level of cognitive and spiritual development in
western culture they're all going to suck at meditation you
see so you're going to get very skewed results if
you really want to understand the effects of meditation you
got to go like to india and find advanced yogis
who are living in caves who have been meditating for
20 30 years their entire lives and then you got
to study them and see what they can do now
there you'll get totally different results than you will on
your undergraduate students you see but is the scientist is
the academic really thinking this holistically and even there of
course if you just do it in india you might
get skewed results too you got to go and do
it in different countries all around the world if you
really want to understand how spirituality works how meditation works
and so on so it's tricky the reality is that
it's because reality is so infinitely complicated it's very difficult
to do good science on it holistic science so usually
we get rather crummy limited reductionistic science and as we're
growing up and we're going through the education system were
really indoctrinated into this materialism and this reductionism this kind
of linear analytical way of thinking school academia science medicine
business healthcare government all of these institutions are infected with
this sort of reductionistic linear analytical thinking they all have
a bias towards analysis and division and you see as
it turns out your mind can work in different ways
the mind can be very analytical or divisive using your
mind to carve out various categories within reality that's mostly
what you're taught in university and in school if you
remember back or the mind can be used in a
more unitive fashion in a more holistic fashion where you're
trying to synthesize and draw connections between things this is
a very different approach and we're generally not taught this
approach in school and in university it's de-emphasized because most
of our institutions have certain biases in school and academia
and science and medicine and business and government a lot
of times we're using analysis to achieve a certain survival
result we have a certain agenda and we're not really
interested in a holistic understanding of reality we're interested for
example in our department figuring out like if we're working
within quantum mechanics we're only interested in quantum mechanics very
narrowly we're not interested in biology or chemistry or how
they all interconnect with each other so we compartmentalize into
literally a university you'll have all these different departments with
various sub-specialties but then what we have is we have
a ton of narrow specialists and analysts in the world
but we have very few holistic synthesizers and this creates
a big problem because we have a lot of people
with good technical expertise who seem if you look at
it on the surface they seem like they're very responsible
well-educated professional people you'll see them on tv you'll see
these pundits and experts you'll see scientists with phds with
nobel prizes they will seem very authoritative it might be
a doctor in a white lab coat it might be
a lawyer it might be you know a judge or
whatever and you think well surely these people are like
the top intellectuals they understand what's going on in reality
we should listen to these people and just follow them
but the problem is that most of these people even
though they do have uh certain technical expertise uh it
tends to be very narrow and unholistic and this gets
us into a lot of trouble because we have high
technical expertise but very little wisdom and wisdom check out
my episode what is wisdom i said in that episode
it's a holistic thing that's one of the features of
wisdom is that it's holistic and we'll explain a bit
more about that as we keep going so you should
start to get a little bit of a sense here
why holism is important really that's one of the biggest
lessons from this episode is just start to see how
important holism is and how little it is stressed in
most institutions and areas within society and you start to
understand why we have so many problems in our society
and in the world both individually and collectively so but
let's uh let's really stress this point uh as to
why holism is so important because this is this is
the major lesson here for you even if you say
well yeah i already know it's important no you don't
know how important it is and you don't know how
much you're lacking it because again holism isn't just a
binary thing you're either holistic or you're not it's there's
there are many degrees of holism and so our work
here is to to help you to elevate yourself to
the higher degrees and to show you how to do
that which we'll be doing so but here's a few
examples of why holism is so important so imagine for
example that there's something wrong in the body like with
your heart and uh and let's say i'm the ceo
of this corporation is a pharmaceutical company and i want
to help people to uh to heal their heart but
in fact more likely it's like i want to actually
earn a lot of money that would probably be my
first priority if we're realistic about how ceos are on
these companies which is a unholistic way of thinking in
and of itself but let's just focus on on healing
the heart so let's say that we want to create
a drug that reduces cholesterol and plaque in the heart
okay great so we think that you know i tell
my scientists focus on finding me the right chemical that
we can manufacture and patent to reduce cholesterol go find
it that's your number one priority that's all we care
about just focus on that and some scientists says well
but what about what about other effects of this drug
i say no it doesn't matter we just need this
drug by next quarter to you know drive up our
stock prices that's what we need uh damn everything else
focus all your energy on just finding this chemical and
so the scientists go they obey because under capitalism they
have to to uh you know not to starve so
they they obey the ceo and they they do this
and they find the drug that will do it this
one chemical and that they test it and it seems
to work in these double-blind placebo-controlled studies works cures people's
heart disease and so forth great right except what if
this chemical creates cancer in the kidneys or in the
liver see in order to catch that you would have
to think more holistically you'd have to think of this
chemical not only affecting or curing one part of the
body but also not only does it have to cure
the heart problem it has to also not cause other
problems in the body and there are thousands of other
problems it could potentially cause and it would be difficult
to study all those problems and to eliminate them as
side effects sometimes the drug can have worse side effects
than the disease that it's curing but that's not all
see you might say well okay fine if the ceo
is a little bit more holistic in his understanding he's
a little bit smarter he has to he has to
tell his scientists don't just look for a drug that
heals the heart but also doesn't damage any of the
other parts of the physical body well that's better that's
certainly a better approach uh and through that method we
might find some new chemical which both heals the heart
and doesn't cause cancer or other diseases anywhere else in
the body okay good but but notice how limited this
still is because see when you're manufacturing a drug it's
not just about the physical body it's also about the
mind and if you have a very materialistic approach very
reductionistic approach to to human health you might think well
damn the mind i'm not in the you know as
a ceo i'm not in the business of healing people's
minds i don't care about their minds i care about
their bodies that's my business everything else that you know
that's for psychologists to think about the mind that's for
their guru to worry about that that's not my job
okay but then what if this drug that was invented
it doesn't harm any of the body but when you
take it you get depression after a few months and
then this depression becomes very bad and maybe even this
drug has some addictive qualities such that even after heart
disease you still keep taking it and then this leads
people to commit suicide from this depression now the ceo
might compartmentalize this and say well that's again that's not
that's not my concern that's not my business let him
go to a therapist and work out his depression but
what if the chemical is actually causing the depression and
also there's addiction there see if you're thinking he's not
holistic you can compartmentalize that problem you can ignore it
and you can deny it and you can make a
lot of money selling this drug but if you have
a more holistic approach you might say oh damn i
mean we could have earned 10 billion dollars selling this
drug but we can't we have to we have to
look for something else because this drug causes depression in
people and i care about that because i'm a more
holistic sort of leader and ceo how many ceos would
would make that difficult decision not very many not these
days not to say they couldn't but they just as
part of their culture they wouldn't because their responsibility is
more for driving up stock prices than it is for
caring about people's psychological well-being but it doesn't stop there
it's also about how we market this drug even if
this drug is is is fine and doesn't cause depression
and so forth the way we market it very aggressively
how we price the drug pricing out people who don't
have the money for it for example or marketing it
so aggressively that people who don't need the drug end
up taking the drug and it causes bad effects in
them so it might heal those people who are actually
sick but then it causes more disease and problems in
those who aren't sick but we push the drugs so
hard through television ads and various kinds of free giveaways
that they do through doctors and so forth that we
create harm that way and then there are all sorts
of secondary and tertiary cascading effects from that you see
it's going to affect your country your citizens your neighbors
your community that you live in such that maybe you
sell this drug to somebody who doesn't need it they
get addicted to it they get depressed from it then
they go by a ar15 then they go shoot up
a school and it turns out that that school is
where your daughter was going and she gets shot and
see now you can fully appreciate how everything in the
universe is deeply interconnected and that you can't just treat
it as though it's not your problem in a sense
everything is your problem and so part of what it
means to be a holistic thinker is that requires taking
much more responsibility for all of your actions and all
of the secondary and tertiary consequences but the way that
many leaders and business people operate these days is very
much unlike that because it doesn't serve them it doesn't
serve their survival it doesn't serve their pocketbook to be
this holistic because then you have to take a lot
of responsibility for your actions of your business you see
so this is just one example of how deeply problematic
this sort of lack of holism can be and also
it shows you why there is a sort of a
perverse incentive for people to be deliberately unholistic in their
thinking you'll find if you start to practice holism that
the more holistic you become the more difficult it is
to actually do certain things in life because you can't
do them for the fact that you're conscious of how
responsible you are and what collateral damage this would do
to everyone in the universe that you feel connected with
and the more beings in the universe you feel connected
with the more carefully you have to tread through the
universe you can't just you know walk through a forest
stomping on every creature that's under your foot without giving
a damn that makes it difficult to walk through a
forest or to drive your hummer through a forest you
know trampling squirrels and bugs as you go here's another
example of why holism is important and this one is
uh is uh about star wars if you're a fan
of star wars like me at least the original trilogy
or the second i i liked all the lucas trilogies
i mean there were problems with the with the um
with the prequels but still way better than what disney
has done with the trilogy so if you've if you've
seen what disney has done with the with the star
wars trilogy and i haven't actually even watched it i've
just watched the reviews because i knew they were gonna
butcher it and break my heart so i didn't even
bother watching it but uh the whole problem with the
disney trilogy it's a total mess because see the original
star wars was designed by one visionary george lucas and
he had sort of a overarching vision a holistic vision
for what star wars would be and uh in fact
it was it was so much material such a long
story they had to break it up into multiple episodes
that's where the trilogy came from so it sort of
evolved organically from the sort of quality and depth of
the story he wanted to tell but with disney why
did they want a trilogy did they even know no
they just bought it from from lucas and they just
wanted to maximize the profits that was like their only
concern they didn't have a holistic vision for what star
wars could be or how it tied in with the
old trilogy or what it'll how it'll tie in with
future trilogies they didn't care about anything in fact they
couldn't even construct one overarching story arc for the trilogy
they gave each episode in the trilogy to other different
directors and different writers such that there was never a
single cohesive vision i mean it's it's the height of
of stupidity to do this with your brand probably one
of the most popular brands on the planet with loyal
fans who will get their hearts broken if you don't
treat the trilogy properly and you know have an overarching
vision for what the episodes are going to be a
nice arc with nice conclusions none of that was done
for the star wars trilogy why not because they don't
have a holistic approach to to this creative challenge right
that's one of the functions of a visionary is that
the visionary brings to a project this overarching holistic sense
of direction of what they're doing of vision and without
that you just have a bunch of people doing stuff
slapping stuff together hoping that it'll lead to something magical
and beautiful and usually it doesn't so notice how various
forms of entertainment you know fall to this problem maybe
some of your favorite brands or your favorite franchises have
fallen prey to this whereas originally there was some higher
vision that led to some sort of magical beautiful game
or story or set of novels or a or a
set of movies or a tv series or whatever and
then later that visionary died or went off doing his
own thing and then the people who took over it
they have no vision and they're just slapping stuff together
and when you slap a bunch of characters and and
things together like with star wars if you just slap
some laser swords and some uh you know some jedis
and some evil sith people you slap them all together
it does not equal the same thing as the original
star wars you can't just reduce star wars that when
you do you lose something that's greater than the sum
of its parts you see or consider another example of
why holism is important consider who wins or loses at
chess if you're a bit of a chess fan like
i am i used to play it a lot when
i was younger not so much these days but i
still enjoy a good chess game or even watching youtube
videos of some of the classic you know chess games
of grand masters there are some beautiful games you can
watch what are the most beautiful chess games the most
beautiful chess games are those in which some sort of
a deep sacrifice is made only to come out with
a checkmate at the very end despite the sacrifice so
for example sacrificing your queen to lure in your opponent
to make him think that oh he he has outsmarted
you but actually that's all part of a larger plan
you have to outsmart him so in chess the one
who wins is the one who has a more holistic
the most holistic understanding of the board in that particular
game that's who wins so really chess in a sense
is a battle for holistic understanding of that particular scenario
and those who are geniuses at it and the most
beautiful games you can find online and so forth of
the grand masters you'll see this you'll see that they're
thinking 10 15 moves ahead and they're they're making these
gambits and making these brilliant plays which are highly intuitive
and intuition of course is is directly related to holism
which we'll elaborate upon a little bit more later in
this episode but uh they're using this profound powerful intuition
in order to synthesize all the possible strategies and then
to come up with this sort of a brilliant overarching
strategy that is supposed to lead to a checkmate so
we see this uh over and over again with uh
with various situations in life where in a sense people
who are unholistic they paint themselves into corners easily just
in the way that you can paint yourself into a
corner uh if you're sort of a fool at playing
chess you can be easily uh fooled like there's there's
actually something called a fool's mate it lures you in
you think you're gonna quickly win something and then actually
you lose very fast like that and so what i'm
talking about it might sound like what i'm talking about
are these large societal problems with science or with health
care or something like that but but a lack of
holism is also a problem just in your personal life
because you easily paint yourself into a corner in your
personal life as well by a lack of holistic thinking
but now we get to the heart of this episode
here's what i really want you to learn this is
the most important part i'm going to give you two
equations here these are the sort of master equations that
explain all of life these are very profound you should
write these down in your notes and contemplate them for
years because you will get payoff from this so i'm
going to give you the two equations and then i'm
going to go to a lot of elaboration upon the
terms because i could talk about these terms and how
they equate with each other for hours but we don't
have that much time so we'll have to summarize all
right so the first equation is this holism equals wholeness
equals health equals healing equals unity equals oneness equals the
infinite equals harmony and balance equals goodness equals love equals
god equals selflessness equals wisdom equals beauty equals holy equals
heaven equals bliss and then the second equation which is
the flip side of the first equation a lack of
holism equals division equals fragmentation equals partiality equals brokenness equals
a lack of harmony and balance equals limitation equals the
finite equals selfishness equals the ugly equals evil equals hell
equals suffering all right so now let's explain so when
we're talking about holism what we're really talking about is
seeing the biggest picture or the highest hole we're also
talking about health because as it turns out health is
nothing other than harmony or balance within the highest whole
so for example when we say that the human body
is healthy or it's not healthy it's diseased or it's
broken what are we really saying a healthy human body
that's nothing other than to say that all the different
parts in the body are in balance with each other
and working synergistically in harmony for the greater good of
the whole of the body and if some part is
out of order out of harmony doing something selfish it's
misbehaving then we say that's a broken body there's disease
in that body one part of the body is fighting
some other part of the body like with cancer or
with autoimmune or whatever there's literally division within the body
the body is at war with itself it's divided against
itself as in the case with cancer these cancer cells
are selfishly in a divisive partial broken way trying to
multiply themselves but eventually what happens if that keeps going
it ends up being self-terminating because the cancer overtakes the
body destroys the good parts of the body that are
needed to function and then of course that also destroys
the host and the substrate that the cancer itself needs
in order to live and so not only does the
cancer kill all the rest of the organs it also
kills itself at the very end and so this is
a pathology this is brokenness it's unsustainable it's a selfish
strategy we might say uh the self the cancer in
this case is is being too selfish it doesn't want
to limit itself to play well with the rest of
the body and to keep itself in check it's out
of balance and so what does it mean to heal
the body to heal the body literally means to bring
different parts of your body into balance with themselves to
remove the divisions into a unity or oneness you see
similarly what does it mean for a human being to
be evil or pathological within society see disease can exist
within your body but disease can also exist within society
at large a disease within society is when certain human
beings or groups of human beings are behaving in an
unbalanced unharmonious way a selfish way where they are dividing
and fragmenting society leading to brokenness leading to suffering which
makes the society unstable and eventually could destroy the society
for example think of adolf hitler what does it mean
to say that adolf hitler is evil a lot of
people would call him evil he's not really evil evil
is just uh as i've talked about in the past
evil is just a relative designation what does it really
mean to say that adolf hitler was evil it wasn't
that he was some you know morally demonic person it
was just that he was very selfish he got indoctrinated
with a very limited partial divisive ideology when he was
growing up in germany at that time and it was
a challenging time for for germans in that in that
era after their defeat in world war one and so
the german population felt demoralized they felt victimized and so
various kinds of toxic ideologies were developed that were anti-semitic
that were anti-marxist anti-communists and so there was a sort
of a swing of the pendulum very far to the
right within german politics and hitler got wrapped up in
this propaganda he read a lot of these sort of
magazines and listened to these radio programs and whatever and
got involved in this sort of uh toxic ideology of
nazism and this led to a lot of it was
filled with racism and hatred and all of this and
uh and this was a very selfish way of thinking
about reality right why is it selfish well because it's
like it's me and my people the german people the
pure people versus those dirty others over there who are
depraved and evil and it's you know it's the jews
and the and the communists who are trying to you
know degrade the germans and infect our german blood with
their you know bad genetics and whatever else and they're
bad ideas and so it's this us versus them this
divisionary fragmentary uh very broken way of of seeing reality
and then when you project the divisions of your mind
onto reality which is what hitler did then that's how
you see because you know your reality is intertwined with
your mind such that whatever you think influences what you
see out there and then so this leads to a
very fragmentary worldview and then that leads to very fragmentary
actions and so of course that's just what world war
ii was it was just a series of of divisive
and fragmentary and selfish actions that destabilized the whole world
brought it out of balance and then had to be
put back into balance by ultimately defeating hitler and it
was ugly people called it evil for for many who
suffered through it it was hell it was hell both
for the germans who had to fight it was hell
for uh the jews it was held hell for the
russians and and and the americans and and the british
and everybody else who fought in it it was hell
for many uh folks it was felt hell for those
at hiroshima and nagasaki uh you know it was hell
in the east it was hell in the west it
was full of suffering it was ugly it was brutal
it was broken that's what selfishness leads to at the
individual level i mean hitler was not a happy guy
it wasn't that there was just brokenness within the german
society it was also he was a broken guy so
the the brokenness of the german society was a reflection
of his own inner brokenness but consider how it could
have gone it could have gone where hitler recognized maybe
somebody told him he watched some actualized videos or something
somebody told him that hey you know you've got these
fragments in your mind the way that you're thinking about
reality when you're fragmenting reality into you know the germans
versus the non-germans the non-aryans you know the semites versus
the anti-semites of the communists versus the nationalists when you're
when you're doing this you're creating these divisions and this
is actually disunifying reality and leading to disease what if
instead we healed these divisions in your mind such that
your mind was unified and you weren't at war with
the rest of the world and maybe that would have
to start by healing the divisions within you maybe there
are aspects of you that you have disowned and denied
and demonized that need to be loved maybe you need
to give up certain selfish attachments and fears that you
have and as you do that you become more selfless
you become more in balance with your own self you
become a better human being a more compassionate human being
who is cognizant of how one's mind influences what one
sees and and what one receives back from reality and
you think more holistically about the kind of beliefs and
ideologies that you've been programmed with you let those go
and as you do that you experience more unity more
love you literally become healed your body becomes healthier various
kinds of ailments and diseases that you have will go
away as you do that as you fight less with
yourself and then you will fight less with others around
you as well because you'll recognize that they are just
a part of a larger system that we're all a
part of that we're all in the same boat together
and that none of them are really your enemies and
as you do that you will see the beauty of
life more and instead of experiencing suffering you will start
to experience moments of temporary moments of bliss and heaven
and eventually if you keep going and going and going
you raise your consciousness more and more and more you
become more conscious of of how much everything in reality
is interconnected at some point your conscience will actually go
from finite to infinite as your your mind becomes completely
unified and healed into a into a oneness and you
will realize that you're not just a part of the
universe you are one with the universe you are the
universe and when you recognize that furthermore your consciousness goes
even more infinite and you realize that the universe is
actually you as god dreaming up this dream in your
own mind and when you recognize that you realize yourself
to be holy and everything around you becomes holy and
that's the discovery of spirituality true spirituality that's all that
spirituality really is is a it's a it's a healing
of divisions and biases and partiality within your own mind
to such a radical extent that eventually your mind becomes
completely unified and one such that even the division between
subject and object me and you us and them all
these divisions get so healed and so unified that literally
you merge into the universe and you realize that the
whole thing is god a holy absolute unity or infinity
or love and then you align your life with that
most holistic of consciousnesses or you could go the other
directions you could go into the selfish direction that was
the selfless direction you could go into the selfish direction
and you could just double down on your partiality your
biases your selfishness your desire to survive and to dominate
others and then you can live that very limited way
of life and you become more and more entangled in
selfishness and then you suffer more and more from it
and then your life becomes a living hell and then
eventually you might even need to kill yourself the way
that hitler did once uh you know he's backed all
the way into the corner that he painted himself into
this is it i i just gave you the two
master equations of life this is what all of reality
and all of life is about consciousness can have various
levels of holism to it really it's an infinite scale
from infinitely unholistic and fragmented and divided to infinitely unified
and everything in between and depending on where you are
on this scale is going to be the quality of
your life and how beautiful and holy life seems to
you as an individual but also us collectively as a
species as a species the more unified we are the
more holistic we are uh the more beautiful our societies
will be the more beautiful our cities will be the
less war we'll have the more peace we'll have should
have really included peace as part of this first equation
because all of that stuff equals peace that's how you
get peace through unification but see it's tricky because there
are many orders of unification unification needs to happen not
only at the individual level also at the family level
also at the local community city level also at the
level of your state at the level of your country
at the level of the globe at the level of
all races at the level of all species so you
see we're going through the whole lawns that we talked
about in water holland's episode we're going through these hollows
higher and higher and higher until we reach an infinite
unity and this is what human history has been about
for the last 10 000 years is that we've been
unifying at smaller scales you know at first we unified
as tribes then we unified as city-states then we use
it unified as nations now we're starting to unify as
the globe but a lot of people are resistant to
this idea of a unified uh global collective of humans
people are nationalistic they want to just unify only with
their with their nation and this of course leads to
war and genocide and all sorts of other problems because
the reality is that anything short of infinite unity is
going to lead to suffering ugliness and limitation so the
whole point of spiritual work is to let go of
all your partialities all of your divisions and that means
becoming more selfless but of course that's the most difficult
thing to do and when you become completely selfless if
you ever achieve this then you realize that you're god
because god is nothing other than infinitely selfless consciousness whereas
the reason you don't realize your god right now is
because you're in a divided highly fragmented highly partial sense
of consciousness so you think you're a little human that's
separate from the universe that's separate from other humans that
separate from other animals that separate from other planets and
solar systems and things that's that's the level of consciousness
you're at right now that can change changing that is
the function of spirituality powerful stuff right make sure you
write down these equations and you contemplate them deeply i'm
telling you how to heal the world right here i'm
telling you how to heal yourself you know there are
entire mental disorders that have to do with just fragments
severe fragmentation of one's psyche like schizophrenia or multiple personality
disorders there are people who literally have like multiple multiple
personalities multiple egos you think having one ego is bad
they have multiple egos fighting uh inside their skulls and
of course this leads to very dysfunctional ways of living
and so what's the solution to these sorts of disorders
well again it's to unify is to unify the various
parts of your psyche and don't think that these are
just extreme people who live in psychiatric wards you also
suffer from a certain degree of multiple personality disorder because
your ego is not fully unified your ego is fragmented
and this is very easy to tell because you know
one day you're all gung-ho about meditating and self-actualizing and
eating healthy and going to the gym and then the
next day you're lazy and you don't go to the
gym and you eat a bucket of ice cream and
you don't want to self-actualize and you have a giant
ego backlash what's going on there well there are multiple
parts within your psyche that you haven't harmonized yet there's
that part of you the reptilian brain part that wants
food and sex and pleasure and to be lazy and
then there's that part of you that's aspirational the spiritual
part of you the higher self that wants to self-actualize
that wants to eat healthy that wants to be successful
that wants to be spiritual that wants to pursue the
truth and beauty and it wants to love but then
this part of you is too afraid to love and
so now there's a war between which one will allow
well one day one wins out another day the next
one's out that's why you have fights with your family
or with your loved ones with your spouses and girlfriends
and boyfriends that's why you struggle to self-actualize and to
grow because there's this tug of war within you there
might be wounded parts within you maybe you gotta be
bullied as a child or abused or ridiculed and then
that wounded part of you is is has like fragmented
and been severed from the rest of your psyche such
that normally you function pretty well but then something once
in a while will trigger you and then you will
regress back and then that that little part of you
that's been wounded it'll come out like a monster from
its cage and then it'll it'll overtake you know the
normal uh reasoning part of you it'll overtake that and
it'll turn you into a monster for a day or
two and that will keep happening until you learn to
to heal this part literally see and the mistake that's
made here is that people people say oh well that
part of me is bad and evil so i'm going
to just hit it and punish it i'm going to
guilt myself for having that part you know i'm gonna
guilt myself for wanting food and sex and i'm gonna
i'm gonna you know i'm gonna force myself never to
have sex again and i'm gonna never masturbate and i'm
gonna never eat bad food and i'm just gonna be
perfect all the time but then this this doesn't work
because what you've done is you've demonized and actually further
fragmented the good part of you from the bad part
of you so you've created this good versus bad dichotomy
and now this just perpetuates the division you didn't actually
harmonize the situation by guilting yourself or shaming yourself over
this and so how do you fix this well with
love love is what heals love is that which can
understand and recognize and incorporate and accept integrate through acceptance
through a higher understanding right you might for example recognize
that yeah that part of me when i was little
was bullied at school and i still live with those
wounds but you know what i'm going to accept my
wounds i'm going to still love myself despite those wounds
i'm going to try to be understanding about you know
the situation i was in i was sent to a
bad school and there wasn't really a lot i could
do and as you try to do that work you
might even forgive some of those people who bullied you
out of a sense of love and holistic understanding and
then you integrate that and then after some years of
doing that kind of therapeutic work shadow work um speaking
of which i still have to release that episode on
shadow work but yeah you do that work and then
at one point you heal it you heal it so
much that it it merges back together and then you're
whole again and then you can love yourself again i
just told you how to do shadow work i'm gonna
have don't worry i'm gonna have a dedicated episode on
shadow work with more detailed explanations and exercises but but
this is the essence of shadow work shadow work is
just recognizing parts of reality that you've disowned by expanding
your consciousness a more holistic understanding of that situation incorporating
it integrating it loving it accepting it unifying it until
there's no shadow um god is that which has no
shadow because it's infinitely conscious of itself and when you're
infinitely conscious of yourself and you recognize that you're infinity
you're one you're the entire thing there's no more shadow
and there's no more warding with no no more warring
with yourself or with others because really warring with yourself
and warring with others it's actually the same thing that's
what you recognize and the higher your consciousness goes the
more unity you experience the more blissful your life will
be the more loving you will be with others in
your life and with yourself the more you will accept
yourself the more happy you will be so really you
should add happiness to the first equation as well because
this is how you attain true happiness and if you
take this far enough your conscience becomes infinitely unified you
actually will experience literally heaven paradise that's what heaven is
and what is hell hell is just the absence of
love the deepest hell is when your mind has been
or consciousness has been so limited so constrained so fragmented
so divided that it has completely severed itself from god's
love such that you don't even believe there is a
god or that there is any love when you're in
the deepest hell so when you tell somebody who's in
the deepest tell about love he doesn't understand it he
doesn't believe you because there is no love in the
deepest hell and there can't be because love is literally
unity and in the deepest hell there's only division making
sense these are the equations of life so unholistic thinking
creates duality and division that's the problem let me give
you a few examples of how this works have you
heard this ben shapiro quote of facts don't care about
your feelings this is not just popular amongst ben shapiro
fans uh but it's also uh it's also sort of
attitude that even many scientists take many atheists and rationalists
take this sort of attitude that you know science doesn't
give a about love science doesn't care about emotions science
is just brute numbers and calculations is just pure truth
well of course this is absurd the idea that the
rational part of you is separate from the emotional part
of you is one of the biggest unholistic ways of
thinking about the human psyche and it's completely false and
it leads to all sorts of terrible pathologies the fact
is that your facts are very much influenced by your
feelings especially in the case of someone like ben shapiro
or someone who follows him but even with scientific type
people this is still the case see you think that
rationality is superior to emotions and that emotions need to
be subsumed under the authority of rationality but if you
live your life this way this is going to create
all sorts of divisions and problems for you in a
sense it's sort of like severing your head from your
heart and in fact that's how many of these people
live and then you you literally can develop diseases in
your body this way see we tend to treat the
body as though like we can almost cut off the
head and stick it into a vat hook it up
to a computer and the head can just function i
can just keep being me just if if we save
the head but the reality is that you can't really
do that because even if you could do that something
important would be lost because a lot of who you
are is in your body not just in your head
a lot of the emotions and trauma that you carry
is in the body and that's actually what secretly drives
you in most cases it's not the head that usually
drives you it's your emotions and wounds that drive you
which are all subconscious very deeply subconscious and then the
only part of it you understand is the rationality and
you're using irrationality to in fact uh justify and rationalize
a lot of stuff that would change if you took
care of those issues in your body that's why people
see a lot of benefit from yoga from various kinds
of bodywork energy work and so on that's an important
facet of personal development personally that's not one of my
strengths i'm a very heady guy so i don't teach
a lot of those sort of energetic body techniques i
have one episode called body awareness so you can go
check that out where i talk a little bit about
that but um again it's not my strong suit you
can find other teachers who will teach you about these
sort of more bodily techniques there's like bioenergetics there's yogic
practices there's uh obviously physical various kinds of physical exercise
i mean i did uh share the technique with you
called shamanic breathing that's one of these exercises and if
you practice shamanic breathing breathing even for a few days
as i showed in that video on shamanic breathing you'll
see how much powerful stuff comes out of your body
just through breathing so that shows you how facts don't
care about your feelings or this idea that the rational
is separate from the emotional this creates pathology and that
if you want to be a fully well-integrated human you're
gonna have to heal that that division you made in
your mind and think of where that division came from
it came from your culture it came from your upbringing
it came from school in school they sort of taught
you to separate facts from feelings and the objective from
the subjective the rational from the emotional this is part
of our education system it's part of the materialistic paradigm
another example uh for how thinking creates division and pathology
is excuse me is uh there's a popular duality that's
been created lately within politics of globalists versus regular folks
the globalist elite versus the ordinary little people as though
such division really exists in the universe it doesn't this
is the delusion of many both left-wing and right-wing populist
movements is that they think that they can separate these
two but in fact there's not that much difference psychologically
between elites and regular folk in fact i would say
that most elites are more educated they're more conscious they're
more developed they're actually more loving people than regular folk
that's difficult for many populists to swallow but if you
don't understand this will actually lead to a lot of
problems within your politics your politics simply won't work because
see if you think the regular folk are actually better
than the elites and you think that the elites are
evil and they're bad and they're all sociopaths and they
don't care about anybody except themselves all they want is
money to rule the world if that's how you think
which is a popular way to think some of them
are like that but what you have to understand though
is that the regular folk most regular folk are uneducated
and they don't have a very high level of development
cognitively morally spiritually if you take some regular folk and
you put them into positions of power they will start
to abuse that power even worse than the elites that
you despise because the regular folk are less well-educated um
they're more uh uh dogmatic and ideological in many cases
or they're less open-minded in many cases and they don't
even recognize how corruption can infect them so they become
even more corrupt and we see this you see this
especially with the with the recent uh populist uprisings on
the right in america and in other part parts of
the world uh these right populist uprisings they're very very
low consciousness these people fool themselves into thinking that they're
gonna take over the globalist elites and uh and they're
gonna you know the ordinary people the the you know
the ordinary right-wing folk are gonna like take over the
government and things will go well no those ordinary right-wing
folk are the most corrupt the most unconscious the most
fearful the most hateful the most racist some of the
most most of those in all of society so it's
extremely dangerous to let those people take power and even
though i say that that doesn't mean i necessarily you
know defend uh some of these elitist capitalists i mean
there's definitely deep corruptions within the elites themselves but the
thing you have to recognize is that there's no matter
how much corruption you see in the elites the corruption
in the lower classes is way worse than it is
in the elites and that's the key mistake that many
trumpists um and supporters of trump and right-wing populism make
and that's exactly really it's an analogous to the problem
that happened with hitler see i mean hitler's whole spiel
was that he was sort of taking over germany from
the globalist elites on behalf of the regular folk that
was hitler's whole appeal it's really not different from from
trump's appeal or many of the right-wing populist appeals around
the world these days it's just not i mean i'm
not saying they're of equal severity they're not of equal
severity uh trump is better than hitler but but uh
but there are definitely deep analogies there and you see
what happens when these right-wing regular folk take over bad
stuff happens now that does not mean that when left-wing
populists take over that stuff that doesn't happen either bad
stuff happens all around like i said in my wisdom
episode there's a lot of foolishness to go around on
both sides right um so so take that into account
how about this sort of division that's created between criminals
and the good guys the upstanding people this sort of
division creates problems and pathologies and disease within society because
when we treat criminals as someone who's other than us
we actually create a shadow those criminals are then people
who we demonize and hate we don't treat them humanely
and then that just increases their recidivism rates they get
out of jail and they just become even deeper criminals
because they're not really reformed especially for example in the
american incarceration system uh some of it which is for
profit and so forth uh they actually get much better
results in the scandinavian nordic countries where they have uh
much more humane prison systems where they actually do um
rehabilitation rather than punishment and see if you think that
these criminals are separate from you you're going to want
to punish them and demonize them and hurt them inflict
pain upon them but by hurting them that's just going
to make them more pissed off and more criminal not
very wise in the grand scheme of things uh because
you know most those criminals have to get out of
prison at some point and come back into society so
it wouldn't be better to rehabilitate those people but to
rehabilitate them to even want to build rehabilitate them you
have to open your mind and think holistically about the
fact that actually the criminal is not separate from you
they have a lot more in common with you than
you think and in fact if you want to be
totally honest you yourself are a criminal how many crimes
have you committed in your life how many laws have
you violated so it's a complete hypocrisy to sit there
demonizing criminals while i mean literally most of us are
criminals in one way or another we did something criminal
at some point in our lives if we're really honest
about it if we're really holistic right if we're really
even minded in the way that we think about things
but see that's not convenient for many people for many
people they just want to have somebody to scapegoat and
they'll just scapegoat the criminals now again i'm not saying
that the criminals are angels some of these criminals are
bad people and they've got to be locked up not
to hurt others so we don't want to be foolish
in the way that we treat criminals but at the
same time if you take a very holistic approach and
you realize that there's not a separation between you and
the criminal and that the criminal elements of society are
literally just parts of your own psyche as as the
universe or as god you start to treat things very
differently with more love and more compassion and you get
better results and you actually see this borne out in
scandinavian countries how about the duality that's created between science
and spirituality or science and mysticism this sort of division
has been created in our universities where anything spiritual or
mystical is seen as anti-scientific and it's really not allowed
within universities it's treated as a joke it's treated as
unscientific it's treated as some sort of a lack of
rigor lack of truthfulness and conversely in many spiritual circles
there's sort of the opposite problem is that these spiritual
people become so new agey and so mystical and shmystical
that they start to ignore rationality they stop thinking they
stop uh trying to test their own theories and so
right now we sort of have this schism between science
and academia on the one hand spirituality and mysticism on
the other hand and they tend to be two different
camps they tend to not communicate well with each other
and both suffer for that science suffers and academia suffers
for lack of spiritual understanding and mysticism because for science
to fully flourish and to really understand reality at the
deepest level it needs spiritual insight insight from meditation and
yoga and such things and it needs to consider deep
metaphysical issues which are at the heart of science and
which spirituality can shed some powerful light on for example
the mind body problem can be resolved through spirituality it
cannot be resolved through materialistic science but science doesn't understand
that yet so they're stuck so science is suffering from
a lack of unity spirituality is also suffering from a
lack of unity because spirituality needs a lot more science
behind it our spirituality would be so much better if
we had rigorous science into psychedelics into yoga into different
meditation techniques and we applied more scientific methods to these
to these practices this would help a lot more people
become enlightened so we really need a synthesis of these
two but there tends to be an opposition where each
camp gets stuck in its own you know bubble and
they don't want to integrate and unify so as you
can see unholistic thinking creates conflict fights violence war racism
genocide slavery exploitation and uh even civilizational collapse can occur
from this whereas holism interconnects everything and also what it
does very importantly is it tells you what is important
and what is meaningful in life so one of the
consequences of this materialistic reductionistic attitude or paradigm that has
been adopted by our culture in the west over the
last 100 years especially through the 20th century and still
to today is that it has in a sense tried
to demystify nature too much and in so doing it
has stripped life of its meaning or its spirit such
that everything has just become sort of technocratic and analytical
hyper-rational and pragmatic to the point where there's nothing more
to life than just being pragmatic about everything and just
building better technology and that's it that's sort of our
only connection to life is with our technology that's sort
of the attitude that western culture has adopted over the
last hundred years and it becomes very pathological and problematic
because of course when you take this sort of very
narrow divisionary approach to life you lose sight of the
highest most important thing which is holism and unity and
love and your spiritual connection to life not just through
your head but also through your body and through your
emotional system and your intuition and your feminine side but
see we've had this sort of schism between the feminine
and the masculine and the feminine has been demonized the
masculine has tried to dominate the feminine for a long
time and this creates problems you're not a whole person
this way so remember in my wisdom episode i talked
about how wisdom is holistic and wisdom the essence of
wisdom is that keem discernment well and that sense of
priorities prioritizing the higher over the lower so the foolishness
of our current societies that we've actually prioritized a lot
the lower over the higher we've prioritized technology and materialism
and money and um and pleasure and hedonism and just
like raw data and facts and information and technology above
everything else we've placed the lower over the higher whereas
really like for example if you go into a university
what i mean is this if you go into a
university and you tell them for example that love is
an important is the most important thing for you to
study in your university they'll laugh at you they'll say
oh love that's some sort of hippie-dippy stuff we're real
scientists here we don't study love we study like quarks
and atoms and stuff this is the definition of foolishness
this sort of attitude to do good science you actually
have to be able to feel into reality with great
sensitivity and mindfulness not just think about it and see
so when we have this sort of very rationalist reduction
of science become the new religion sort of it's supplanting
the old religions that's a step up in a certain
sense because the old religions are very problematic i'm not
saying that we should return to the old religions of
centuries past but when science becomes the new religion otherwise
called scientism this uh this creates all sorts of problems
and pathologies and we're seeing those pathologies everywhere in medicine
in business in universities in government we're seeing it now
the solution is not to go back it's to find
the next level the next level of synthesis and holism
which starts to integrate the best from religion with the
best from science finding a new higher synthesis of those
two see without holism your life becomes petty mechanical utilitarian
demystified and dysfunctional you lose your connection to life and
that's why we have these epidemics of depression suicide opioid
addiction because when you rob people of their spiritual connection
they just become zombies and robots and then they kill
themselves if they're not able to get the sort of
success that they see people getting on tv you literally
feel disconnected and alienated from people from society from nature
from animals from spirit from goodness from the self from
love from god that's what love is love is the
connection to all those things the more connected you are
the more in love you are with yourself with the
universe what you want most of all is you want
to feel infinitely connected to everything that's love that's what
all human striving should be towards it is towards that
the problem is that most humans don't understand it and
most in most cases we're striving for a very limited
partial love right so you experience dysfunction when you strive
towards partial forms of love so when you go shoot
up some heroin really what you're doing is you're finding
a source to love but it's very partial when you
are laughing at your political opponents and you're ridiculing them
that's a form of love but a very partial unlimited
dysfunctional form when you're chasing money and trading stocks that's
a form of love you're actually chasing love but in
a very dysfunctional manner that harms the rest of society
and that doesn't really get you that feeling that you
want what you really want is a feeling you don't
want a fact you want a feeling think about it
everything we seek in any domain of life is wholeness
and unity that's what we seek for example what do
all the world religions seek they all seek world domination
every major religion wants to dominate every other to completely
exclude it and destroy it such that it becomes the
one monolithic religion christianity wants that islam wants that probably
many many buddhists in secret want that see what they're
seeking there is they're seeking wholeness and unity but they're
seeking in a dysfunctional manner they're trying to access unity
and wholeness through selfishness which is completely ass backwards and
it will never work so the solution here is to
recognize that hey we could have a unity where christianity
dominates and destroys all the other religions and becomes the
only one that can be sort of a monopoly or
unity or we could actually as christians learn to appreciate
the other religions see reality as being accessible through various
different spiritual paths not just one not just christianity christianity
is not the ultimate one it's just one out of
many out of hundreds and we can we can see
the richness and beauty and diversity of that and we
can embrace that whole thing as part of our religion
and so can all the other religions and then that
will be the highest unity in love that will be
the true religion the religion that loves all other religions
see but that's a counter-intuitive move and to do that
move you have to be very selfless you have to
surrender yourself surrender your attachments and your beliefs in christ
as being the ultimate one the one true savior or
muhammad being the last prophet you have to surrender that
belief in order to do what i'm saying and you
have to stop judging people who are not the same
as you and your religion and your ethnicity and you
have to stop treating the bible as the only word
of god but recognize there are many holy books that
are also the word of god equally as beautiful as
the bible and you have to be able to recognize
and admit certain contradictions and errors in the bible and
you have to be able to admit that christianity doesn't
have all the answers it has some of the answers
but other religions can have better answers in certain narrow
domains and that they all offer some some valuable new
perspective but see this is difficult to do the mind
has to surrender so much stuff it has to be
so selfless it has to be so open to do
that that would be healing the world at the at
the plane of religion but what about business in business
business also seeks unity and wholeness that's what everybody business
seeks every business seeks to be a monopoly that's the
dream of every business person is they want to monopolize
their their marketplace be the best crowd out all the
competitors buy them all up if they're allowed to by
the government and then once they've mastered one field of
business they want to spread to other fields until they
master every field and dominate everybody and then ultimately we
will just have one company amazon that would own every
other company that's sort of the uh the ideal of
every business person of course it doesn't have to be
you could recognize that this is actually a very selfish
pathological way of achieving unity and it will never work
instead you recognize that actually to achieve a healthier unity
within business we have to recognize that it's healthy for
us to have business competition and to have different sectors
controlled by different companies and that we shouldn't be buying
up and using various kinds of uh you know anti-trust
methods to you know to collude and then to to
to squeeze our competitors out of the marketplace and so
forth but actually we want a healthy economy which has
many different companies of different sizes that creates more innovation
that will actually help to create a a better economy
from for more people people will have better wages there
will be more um inventions and it'll benefit everybody to
do that way but see that means you have to
surrender your grand megalomaniacal ambitions of being the world's richest
person or the world's biggest company you have to think
more holistically to do that how about in the family
every family seeks wholeness and unity nobody likes these family
fights over thanksgiving dinner but that requires holism why is
it so difficult to achieve unity within the family because
there's all these different actors with different agendas that are
trying to do their own things and also at the
same time trying to control each other thinking that others
are doing the wrong thing and so there's fights how
about within science science is trying to achieve unity and
wholeness scientists are always talking about a theory of everything
science's whole mission is basically a theory of everything science
wants to understand everything but it thinks it can do
that through the methods of science without realizing that it
can't because science is not everything see it's so simple
how can science understand everything when science isn't everything the
only thing that can understand everything is everything not science
science can understand some things but science is limited but
science is so stuck in itself that it wants to
understand everything only through science while denigrating any other kind
of understanding or even denying that any other understanding is
necessary beyond science well when it takes that approach it's
self-defeating and in this way science will never have a
theory of everything a similar thing happens in mathematics mathematicians
want to try to understand reality only as numbers without
realizing that they're just projecting numbers onto reality see you
can understand a lot about nature through math that's good
math has been very effective but it only gets you
so far if you think you can use math to
understand everything you're deluded that is not a healthy way
to approach reality and in fact right now we're suffering
pathologies of this science deeply suffers from this because in
science basically current science and academia doesn't consider a thing
true unless it can be quantified and put into an
equation which is called formalization if you can't formalize something
it isn't considered true which is just extremely unholistic extremely
reductionistic extremely myopic and it leaves out the most important
aspects of reality for example you can't quantify love which
is what reality is you also can't quantify infinity speaking
of which which is what reality is you can only
quantify the finite not the infinite so uh yeah it's
a very big problem for math infinity is not a
math thing infinity is all of reality of which math
is just one subset so don't confuse infinity with a
number it's not a number it's not math now uh
we also have this problem within geopolitics in geopolitics what
do people seek they seek wholeness and unity but they
can seek it in more healthy or less healthy ways
if they seek it in less healthy ways they want
unity by dominating other countries or by exterminating other countries
and races and people or we can have a healthy
geopolitics where we seek a unity through peace through alliances
through mutual agreements where we respect each other's boundaries and
differences and we don't try to dominate everybody else we
don't try to create an empire a global empire and
we don't try to put our country above all the
other countries we recognize that every country is equally valid
has an equal validity to exist different cultures have different
pros and cons and they have a right to exist
without being dominated by other cultures or undermined by other
cultures this is part of the pathology of the trump
policy of america first see when you put america first
you might think well that's going to um that's going
to be the best for america that's going to make
for the strongest america right if we put america first
and we're just very selfish this way but actually it
ends up boomeranging and having the opposite effect because when
you put america first everybody else in the world of
which there are more people than americans americans are only
like less than one tenth of the whole planet are
americans that means that the other nine tenths of the
planet are gonna rally together against these selfish americans they're
gonna make their own trade alliances their own economic systems
their own currency the dollar will lose its value in
the long term uh america will lose its its spiritual
standing in the world as the world leader and other
countries will just organize themselves into a more selfless alliance
that will ultimately be stronger and more powerful than america
and america will wither away that's effectively what america first
gets you in the long run that's what would happen
if trump's policies continued for 50 more years luckily that
didn't happen but see this is this is the short-sightedness
of selfishness when you're very selfish you think you can
get away with these kinds of things you think oh
we'll just be america first we'll bomb anybody who disagrees
with us their alliances we'll just force them to pay
more and and whatever you know will manipulate their governments
it doesn't matter but when you take this approach it
comes back to you it's no different than being an
at your workplace maybe for a short while being an
at your workplace or being an in your relationship or
in your family maybe that'll get you some short-term benefits
but if you think more holistically you realize it's going
to be a negative in the long run speaking of
relationships what do you seek in a relationship you also
seek unity you seek peace in your intimate relationships and
you seek sexual unity and there are healthy and unhealthy
ways of going about this as well what do you
seek with your physical health unity what do you seek
with your psychological well-being unity what do languages seek languages
seek unity originally if you look at languages in underdeveloped
parts of the world like in india they don't have
a single language they have like a thousand different languages
in india one of the challenges they face in india
is how do you unify all the different dialects and
sub languages into into one national language because it's much
easier to do business with a single language than with
just than with thousands more developed countries like in america
and europe they have unified their languages just to be
a single language like the russian language the japanese language
it's it's singular there's not a hundred different japanese languages
now there's probably dialects and so forth but they're they're
so minor because they're it's better to have a unified
language and right now english is sort of becoming the
unified language of the world but if america keeps behaving
like maybe it won't be english maybe it'll be chinese
or something in the future who knows uh there there's
a unification force within currency as well we have all
these different currencies around the world but it's nice and
more convenient to have a single currency the dollar is
sort of the unifying currency right now but bitcoin is
coming up people are saying maybe bitcoin will be the
universal currency of the future every currency is trying to
fight for domination and unification to see which one comes
out on top this is evolution this is life we
have unity and division unity and division unity and division
in a fractal infinite fractal all the way up and
down the different levels of the holocaust hold on within
whole lawns within hold ons fighting each other unifying with
each other fighting each other unifying with each other at
all levels and scales up and down if you want
a deeper discussion of that check out my episode called
division versus unity where i go into a lot of
depth on that and also check out my episode called
understanding duality part one part two part three where i
go and give you a giant list of hundreds of
different dualities that the mind creates and how to unify
some of those together that's a very powerful series especially
part three of that series check that out so another
problem with reductionism is that it's easily exploited by devils
because it's very easy to be selfish by deliberately limiting
the scope of your holistic understanding to something very small
and narrow you carve out a little domain and then
you externalize you create externalities outside of that circle such
that you can benefit everything in the circle this is
a classic strategy uh so we use our minds to
carve up reality to tiny parts then it becomes easy
for nobody to take responsibility for all the parts as
a whole we can just take responsibility for one little
part and from this leads all sorts of pathologies this
is common for example within science departments where we have
sub-sub-specialties such that a scientist will only care about one
little narrow thing and anything beyond that he doesn't care
about he doesn't study he's he doesn't get paid for
that he views it as a distraction but really truly
for science to understand reality it needs to interconnect all
the different departments you can't have separate little departments biology
is really not separate from physics separate from chemistry separate
from psychology separate from philosophy this creates a fractured view
of of nature it's the sort of a phone tag
game you ever call a giant company like your phone
company and you need something from them you have some
billing error you call them up and the operator answers
and you're like hey yeah i got a billing problem
here you guys charged me too much last month on
my on my phone bill uh who can i speak
to about that and she's and the operator says well
we're not the billing department here we're just the uh
we're just the sort of operator department so i'll transfer
you to billing so she transfers you to billing then
you call billing and you know you talk to them
and you you tell them about this and they say
oh well yeah uh sorry sir but um this isn't
actually a billing problem it's actually it's a it's a
technology problem there's some there was some technology error with
the way that they were calculating your bill so actually
we got to transfer you to technology department so she
transfers you over to the technology department and there you
talk to them and they say oh no this is
not a technology problem this is actually some other department's
problems so they transfer to that one and then that
one transfers you back to the billing department and you
just go around in a circle forever and and you
can't get anywhere because nobody takes responsibility for the whole
of the problem see your problem is not about a
particular department your problem is your problem it is what
it is i've experienced similar problems for example within medicine
and health i've been having some health problems over the
last year and i've experienced this situation where i go
to one doctor and he says oh i'm a generalist
you got to go to a specialist because you got
a stomach problem so you got to go to a
stomach doctor so i go to the stomach doctor and
he says oh well this thing you're having oh this
is a psychology problem you got to go to a
shrink and i said no i have a stomach problem
you know you got to go to a shrink then
if you go to a shrink then the shrink will
say oh this is not a shrink problem this is
a doctor problem you got to go back to some
other specialist and so they just send you around in
circles and you get nowhere and nobody takes responsibility for
the whole problem and that's what is really important is
the whole problem not just one facet of the problem
it's very convenient for a devil to have the excuse
that oh this is not my problem it's not my
responsibility because it falls outside of my circle of concern
and of course the devil deliberately draws the circle of
concern extremely narrowly to serve his ego his ego is
that circle of concern and it's usually a very dense
narrow ego so the function of our work here and
with spirituality is to expand that circle of concern until
it becomes infinite and then you have no more excuses
everything is your problem everything is your responsibility another example
is how easily single-issue voters get misled for example in
american politics this is a very popular way to manipulate
people most people aren't very well educated about all the
issues that are important to a well-functioning society instead they
have a couple of pet things that they care about
some hot button trigger issues for example i don't know
how government works but i want my guns i don't
know how government works but i care about abortion being
illegal and so on those issues it's very easy for
a devil to manipulate me in that case because all
he has to do is fear monger to me about
how they're going to take my guns away and then
i'm gonna go vote for anybody who's pro-gun the most
pro-gun without considering though the larger issues at stake even
if let's say let's say that the second amendment was
very important to protect but if you really think about
it is it really that important like i mean it's
important let's say it's important but is it more important
than the health of the entire country is it more
important than the economy is it more important than health
care is important more important than the environment is it
more important than anti-corruption laws is it more important than
campaign finance reform is it more important than the judicial
system right so i'm like obviously not even if you
love guns just ridiculously much still you have to admit
it's not more important than all those other issues combined
so when you go to vote for president for example
for a senator what you have to really consider is
the totality of the situation not a narrow issue and
so most people who vote they vote on a single
issue that they've been galvanized or fear-mongered about whether it's
abortion guns or health care something like that but that's
not what is most important and so this leads to
the political pathologies that we experience today to have a
well-functioning democracy we need citizens that are so holistic that
they care about the well-being and health of the entire
country but not even just the country but actually the
entire world and they have to vote in that manner
and they have to be immune against fear-mongering and manipulation
by devils on single narrow issues because a single issue
is not important as all the issues by definition and
hey i mean i understand when i was younger i
i loved guns i was sort of a gun nut
i mean my friend my friend was sort of into
the military he went to iraq but like in high
school in college you know we would hang out together
we would we would create like fireworks and explosives and
stuff we would blow up we would shoot guns we
would go to shooting ranges we would talk about guns
we would have magazines and catalogs of guns so like
i get it and i grew up in california so
in california we had the strictest gun laws and at
that time i thought like well why can't i have
a fully automatic gun like i want that that would
be so cool but then as i matured and my
circle of concern expanded my whole holistic thinking expanded i
realized that you know i still think guns are cool
i'll go to shooting range and shoot a fully auto
i did that recently uh in vegas but i also
understand that my passion for guns is a much lower
priority compared to other issues we've got going on and
no matter how much i love guns my love for
guns can't outweigh the love that parents have for their
children when they get shot in schools right so you
have to balance this stuff out and what that required
of me is that required more empathy increasing my circle
of concern and setting aside my own agenda it literally
required me to become selfless in that area where i
had to say you know what as much as i
love guns and as cool as it would be to
own a fully automatic machine gun maybe if we want
to have a healthy peaceful world that's not the right
way to go and i have to surrender that for
a greater good for greater harmony and balance because if
i'm just going to be stuck on this one issue
that's going to distort my entire thinking about politics for
the rest of my life and think of how pathological
that is yet this is exactly what we have going
on with our politics these days so the way that
a devil operates and by devil i just mean any
deeply selfish organism is that it creates a very narrow
circle of concern within infinite consciousness and then it defends
that to the death and it externalizes every single how
should i call it every single i mean it basically
feeds off of its environment right when you draw that
circle you're getting nutrients from the environment you're leaching those
and then you're excreting literally you're out the stuff that's
not useful to you into the environment this is how
an organism functions at the highest level well that's literally
how most of our corporations function how most of our
religions function how most of our families friends and others
function is like this this is called externalities these are
sort of the excrements of life and it's these externalities
you end up on others you know a good example
of an externality is a when a bird shits on
your windshield that was the bird's externality and then you're
not happy about it because your windshield got shat upon
you got to clean it up happened to me recently
so uh but see this is this is how most
humans behave they create these gross externalities whether it's a
company or a religion or a political party or an
individual person without being conscious or taking responsibility of the
they put out the collateral damage they cause and then
this creates a toxic commons for everybody to swim in
we're all swimming in the same pool and everyone's in
it that's fundamentally our problem as humans and so uh
when you realize that that takes holism to realize right
because if if you lack holistic thinking you can just
think you can in the corner of the pool and
everything will be okay but when you realize we're all
swimming in the same pool you start to take responsibility
for where you and then the pool becomes more enjoyable
to swim in for you and for everybody else and
it all begins with you because if you say oh
leo i'm going to stop shooting in the pool only
when everybody else does well then everyone else is going
to say that too because they think just like you
because they don't want to take responsibility they don't want
to lead and then we swim in a shit-filled pool
for the rest of our lives someone so someone has
to lead it might as well be you and of
course that means you have to be less selfish that's
what leadership is leadership is nothing other than selflessness the
more selfless you are the better of a leader you're
going to be there's many other factors i have some
uh older videos about leadership and i'll release some more
videos in the future about leadership that's an important topic
but that's the that's the spirit of of good leadership
there's also bad leadership bad leadership is extreme selfishness and
narcissism a la hitler or trump see self bias privileges
one part of the universe at the expense of another
go check out my episode self bias about that self
bias is very important here because self bias is what
creates the brokenness and is what creates the lack of
holism so to be more holistic you have to surrender
self-bias you have to recognize that your mind carves up
reality not arbitrarily and not in accordance with the truth
but in whichever way serves your ego best your selfishness
narrows the scope of your perspective and this is the
antithesis of holism so the reason that most people aren't
holistic is simply because they're too selfish another problem with
a lack of holism is that narrow expertise is vulnerable
to recontextualization go see my episode called understanding recontextualization that's
an important concept what i mean by this is that
you can discover some facts about the universe but those
facts it doesn't matter what the facts are it really
matters what they mean to you and how you understand
them and what you intend to do with them but
how you understand them and what they mean to you
and what you intend to do with them and how
important they are in the grand scheme of things only
makes sense when you have the grand scheme of things
so a set of facts without its context doesn't mean
very much and when you're very narrow with your perspective
on the universe that is unholistic that means that whatever
understanding you have whatever facts you have they're always vulnerable
to a radical recontextualization because the context can be changed
or expanded and that will completely change what your facts
mean it could turn them inside out upside down 180
degrees and that's exactly what happens for example with science
scientists grossly underestimate this problem of radical recontextualization if you
understand more about that go see that episode so if
you want a very solid robust science which is not
fragile it needs to be immune to radical recontextualization and
the only way you can be immune to radical recontextualization
is by expanding your context until it's infinite which means
you have to you can't narrow your field down to
one thing you have to your field has to be
the entirety of the universe as a whole think of
it this way if you had a binary choice between
understanding a single part of the universe or the whole
of the universe but no individual singular part which would
you choose so for example if you're a mathematician you
could say i want to understand all of mathematics perfectly
and if i was like a magic genie i could
just grab that wish to you right now but if
you understand all of mathematics perfectly you won't understand physics
you won't understand cosmology you understand philosophy you won't understand
relationships you understand anything else just math or you pick
you could pick to understand all of physics or all
of uh economics or all of psychology or you could
wish for understanding the entire thing without understanding any particular
one which would you choose can you see why it's
wiser to choose the whole rather than any particular part
you see there's a trade-off between understanding something in detail
understanding it from the big picture the more big picture
you're understanding the less detail you have the more detail
you have the less big picture understanding it's sort of
like zooming in or out of the earth you can
zoom all the way out of the earth and you
will see the entire thing but you won't see the
ants on it you won't even know there are ants
on it or you can zoom into the earth get
all the way close to the ground and you'll see
the ants but all you'll see is the ants and
you won't even know that there's an earth that they're
on so holism is zooming out although of course understand
that these are not necessarily in opposition to each other
you can do both but practically speaking your human life
and your resources are limited so you have to be
selective about which one is more important to you because
you can't zoom in on every thing also notice that
there's an interesting uh asymmetry here is that when you
zoom out you only really zoom out once to see
the whole earth whereas to zoom into the earth you
can zoom in on a million different things you can
zoom in on an ant on a cow on a
human on a turtle you can keep zooming in on
a thousand different things and you will still be infinitely
far away from understanding the earth but if you zoom
out that's a you see that's a single operation it
kind of works like a cone as it converges it
converges into a single unity whereas as it diverges it
diverges into an infinite number of perspectives so there's something
powerful about the ultimate holism because you get you actually
zoom out so far that you you grasp the whole
thing even though you don't understand all the details and
that's what omniscience in a sense is so i want
you to notice that there are two ways that you
can use your thoughts you can use thoughts to divide
reality and you can use thoughts to unite your reality
and we in our education in our culture are biased
towards divisive type of thinking so i could go around
saying oh that's a that's a monkey that's a giraffe
that's a rhinoceros and they're all separate creatures i could
think of them that way or i could say oh
that's a monkey that's a giraffe that's a rhinoceros they're
all the same sorts of creatures they're all part of
life they're all part of a single ecosystem divisive versus
unit of thought take notice which kind of thought you
use most of the time for example those are white
people those are black people those are yellow people those
are jews those are christians those are muslims they're all
different or we can start to recognize how much they
have in common which type of thinking do you think
leads to more peace and which leads to more conflict
and war and which one do you want do you
want peace or do you want conflict and war how
about in your relationships do you want to notice how
much you two have in common or how much you
disagree and which do you think will lead to more
fights and which do you think will lead to more
sex and which do you want fights or sex it's
important to recognize that all thought is fundamentally dualistic and
incomplete even unitive types of thinking still very good much
better than divisive i would suggest but even unitive thinking
even the most holistic of thinking is still thinking and
thinking is inherently dualistic every thought divides reality in some
way because every thought is a division within reality even
a holistic thought is still divisive it's still only a
part of the whole it's not the whole you can't
use the part to grasp the whole but still there
are degrees of quality to thought not all thought is
equally good so what i'm suggesting is that you incrementally
increase the quality of your thinking make it more holistic
more integrative more unitive without surrendering your ability to do
analysis analysis is still important so you got to have
that flexibility and then eventually you want to get so
high in your holism that you recognize that even thought
itself is too limited and too unholistic and then you're
able to transcend thought itself and the highest holism doesn't
occur within thought it occurs within consciousness the highest holism
is infinite consciousness which is beyond thinking but even though
i say that thinking is still important because we don't
really have an option in our society but to think
and therefore it is important to talk about different qualities
of thought and improving your thought so we're talking about
holistic thinking here if you want to talk about holistic
consciousness i've talked about in other episodes uh you get
there through meditation through yoga psychedelics you don't you don't
um get there through thinking so much but holistic thinking
is still a good place to start see the more
holistic you're understanding the better you can manipulate systems towards
health and the highest good without them boomeranging on you
so we can't create a healthy society without thinking and
we can't create a healthy society without holistic understanding of
the systems we're dealing with another feature of holistic thinking
is that it can foresee the counter-intuitive twists and turns
that reality takes for example in the way that freedom
creates enslavement a lot of libertarians stumble into this problem
they can't see the counterintuitiveness of freedom they think that
just absolute freedom is going to lead to the highest
good but it doesn't because if you minimize government completely
you eliminate the state you eliminate all taxation and everybody
is just free to do what they will and just
to you know live on their land and own their
own property as libertarians and vision but what's going to
happen is that some of those people are going to
use that freedom to enslave other people and you as
libertarian would say no but that's not libertarian of them
to do but they don't care because they have a
different moral system so they will still enslave you and
then what you'll realize is that your libertarianism and your
cry for absolute freedom is actually foolishness because it boomerangs
on itself freedom is not an absolute thing freedom as
humans desire it has to be delicately balanced and harmonized
with restrictions and regulations to ensure that your freedom doesn't
turn into enslavement because that's literally what absolute freedom means
absolute freedom means i have the freedom to enslave you
and you have the freedom to cry about it and
i have the freedom not to care that's true freedom
but it takes a very holistic understanding to see that
so complex problems require holistic solutions and holism generates more
robust solutions than otherwise which is a practical reason for
why you should care about it let's start to wrap
up by talking about why the highest intelligence is holistic
so intelligence itself i'm claiming is a holistic thing inherently
when we say someone is intelligent or more intelligent than
somebody else what we really mean is that their intelligence
is more holistic in a sense you can think of
intelligence as holistic pattern recognition which leads to insight which
is also basically identical to intuition it's the ability to
interconnect dots and to grasp the entirety of a situation
in one single snapshot not in bits and pieces it's
to see the whole picture of a situation for example
you walk into a a room like let's say you
walk into your mother's house and you see a gun
on the floor and you see blood splattered on the
on the carpet and you see the vos has been
broken and you see the door has been busted in
the window has been broken you see that and then
intelligence is the ability to interconnect all of those separate
elements and to recognize a crime has occurred whereas a
lack of intelligence is to walk in there and to
just kind of look around and to see these different
things and to not be able to interconnect them all
together and to be clueless about what's going on there
are a few other features of the highest intelligence highest
intelligence includes the ability to see context very deeply the
ability to go meta and to transcend the ability to
self-reflect the ability to take on multiple perspectives and higher
perspectives the ability to be unbiased and selfless and equal
concern for all levels of the holarchy i want you
to contemplate for yourself why these things are the case
as you contemplate what intelligence is and as you experience
higher levels of intelligence but i'll give you some answers
that i have come to in my own contemplations so
why for example is seeing context so important for the
highest intelligence well it's because if you don't see the
context of a thing you can easily get fooled by
a thing you can easily misunderstand what the true nature
of a thing is by missing its context just because
i cut out a single sentence from a book i
can use that single sentence to completely misrepresent what that
book is about to understand that single sentence i would
have to read the whole book to really understand its
context or at the very least read the paragraph or
the page or the chapter that that sentence is on
so there's no way that the highest intelligence can be
non-context aware because that's how foolishness happens and the highest
intelligence can't be foolish okay how about the ability to
go meta and to transcend why is that an inherent
feature of the highest intelligence so the ability to transcend
or to go meta is to step outside of some
system that you're thinking about or that you're in really
we're talking about awareness self-awareness so the reason that it's
important for the highest intelligence to be able to go
meta is because if it doesn't go meta it's enrapt
and entangled in the thing that it's trying to understand
so for example i could be using language right now
as i'm speaking and not be meta about it and
then i would just be sort of using this language
unconsciously whereas if i was using this language in a
meta way i would be conscious of the fact that
i'm using language as i'm talking about language this is
creates a sort of a self-awareness loop and this is
a feature of high intelligence because see if you're interacting
in the world and you're treating the world as just
some object that you're interacting with but you're not taking
into consideration your own self in relation to that thing
then you don't have an understanding of the entire situation
and you're gonna make foolish mistakes so you need to
be able to interconnect everything for the highest intelligence the
more you interconnect things the more intelligent you are and
so you have to be able to interconnect the fact
that you are participating in the creative process of the
universe so it's not just that i'm using language i'm
actually constructing this language as i'm going and i need
to be aware of that likewise when i'm doing science
is not just that i'm doing science i need to
be able to go meta on science and recognize that
yes i'm doing science but i'm also creating the science
as i'm doing it and i have to take responsibility
for that and for that i need to be able
to go meta and to transcend science i got to
do meta science epistemology metaphysics why is the ability to
self-reflect a feature of the highest intelligence basically for the
same reason self-reflection is basically a form of going meta
on your own self ultimately when you become completely selfless
you realize that there's nothing but the self it's a
sort of a strange loop and an inversion where it
goes full circle you have the infinite self everything is
the self when you realize you're not the human self
that means that you're the universe that's what it means
so if you are the universe if all there is
is the self but nothing else that means the highest
intelligence must necessarily be able to recognize and reflect on
itself because if it's not reflecting on itself then what
is it trying to understand you're always trying to understand
some aspect of yourself no matter what you're trying to
understand if you're trying to understand evil really you're just
trying to understand more about yourself because you are evil
if you're trying to stand good you're trying to stand
more of yourself because you're good if you're trying to
understand women you're trying to understand yourself if you're trying
to send men if you're trying to understand a dog
all of these are just aspects of consciousness it's the
universe trying to understand itself so you the universe at
its highest level of intelligence needs to be able to
self-reflect and that's one of the characteristics of wisdom this
is actually a feature of consciousness as its ability to
self-reflect because consciousness is itself what about perspective why is
it important for the highest intelligence to be able to
take multiple perspectives because if you're only taking one perspective
by definition that's a limitation of all the other perspectives
that consciousness could experience consciousness has an infinite capacity to
generate perspectives literally infinite perspectives it's a field of infinite
perspective so if you're only taking one perspective on a
thing you're seeing it from a very narrow limited angle
similar to like if we were looking at an elephant
and you only looked at it from a single angle
you wouldn't see the whole elephant you'd only see one
part of the elephant and that would not give you
a deep understanding of the whole elephant to understand the
whole elephant you really want to have one of those
matrix cameras where you can just like circle all around
the elephant from every angle even go inside of the
elephant zoom in zoom out then you can appreciate what
the elephant really is so the highest intelligence needs to
be able to be so flexible that it can take
all of these different perspectives this is why we talk
about the sort of perspectival nature of reality go check
out my episode called what if reality is nothing but
perspective where i talk about that yeah one of the
biggest problems with science is that science does not materialistic
science does not really understand just how multi-perspective reality is
and this creates all sorts of problems for it because
science wants to remove the subjective element from reality but
the reality is absolutely subjective so what are you trying
to do you're fooling yourself and this problem happens because
science is not able to self-reflect sufficiently and it's not
able to go meta sufficiently to understand that subjectivity is
all that there is to reality there's nothing else but
subjectivity um and so because of this science is not
operating at the highest level of intelligence the highest level
of intelligence would understand this but the only way to
understand this is to go meta to self-reflect and to
see reality from all these different perspectives and now finally
why is the ability to be unbiased and selfless so
crucial to the highest intelligence because ultimately everything is yourself
ultimately everything is one so really ultimately it makes no
difference whether you like that thing or that thing or
hate this thing or hate this thing all of these
are just biases these biases are what selfishness is selfishness
is saying that well i like this part of consciousness
but i hate that part of consciousness this part of
consciousness serves me that part of consciousness doesn't serve me
but look at look at it like this if you
recognize that you are the entire thing then how can
anything serve you or not serve you how can you
really care about one thing more than another thing it
makes no sense that only makes sense from the limited
limited egos perspective so the only way you can really
be selfish and biased is when you fool yourself into
thinking that you're some limited aspect of consciousness and not
the entire thing if you realize you're the entire thing
then all the biases become groundless and unjustified and that's
the highest intelligence the highest intelligence in the universe is
selflessness and a lack of all biases and that's what
god is god is infinite consciousness infinite intelligence infinite selflessness
because if you were infinitely intelligent why would you ever
be selfless it's stupid the only reason you're selfish is
because your consciousness is limited if your conscience was unlimited
you would never be selfless i mean you would never
be selfish because selfish just selfishness just creates suffering and
it's a limitation of love and if you were infinitely
intelligent why would you be anything or choose anything else
but love are you getting this this is deep stuff
this is like advanced calculus level stuff to understand this
on the other hand it's all very simple when you
finally experience it the problem is that you're not conscious
enough to experience it yet maybe try a psychedelic to
get it so here i have a picture for you
i love this picture of what intelligence looks like and
what holism looks like so we have two circles one
of the circles is very filled in with a lot
of interconnections and the other one has a few interconnections
but mostly dark black space so this actually comes from
a study that they did on psilocybin mushrooms magic mushrooms
those people who take the mushrooms experience these deep interconnections
and those people who don't take the mushrooms the placebo
the sober state the quote-unquote sober state the state you're
in right now if you're not on mushrooms is the
one with the very few interconnections this represents your mind
this is sort of a semantic map of the mind
different parts of your mind become more and more interconnected
on psychedelics and that's why psychedelics are so important to
this work and are so powerful because all that they
do is they basically just change the neurotransmitters uh upgrade
them to ones that offer more interconnections and they just
interconnect more and more of your mind together to the
point where ultimately the interconnections become infinitely dense and you
can imagine that when your consciousness becomes completely infinite every
corner of the universe interconnects with itself infinitely such that
this circle becomes just a completely solid glowing white orb
of pure interconnectedness and this is god love intelligence beauty
infinity eternity the self that's what you are that's your
true highest self at this level of interconnectedness and holism
literally the boundaries and physical divisions of everything in the
universe collapses it's what you might imagine the universe was
before the big bang when every molecule was smushed into
every other one literally the boundary and difference between you
and your mother and your father and hitler and trump
and dogs and cats and aliens and planets and stars
and love and hate and good and evil all these
boundaries are completely meaningless because you're so conscious that all
of it is you equally you without any bias or
partiality or favoritism and that's the godhead that's infinite consciousness
that's complete awakening to yourself as god and then there
are many lower scales of this sort of consciousness all
the way down to humans as you are right now
and then down to cats and dogs and ants and
lower and lower lower and lower so it goes as
low as you want then it goes as high as
you want and this this complete interconnectedness it's it's it
goes on forever you might think it's a static object
but it's really not a static object it's like a
infinite well down which you fall it's an infinite well
of love and you just keep falling deeper and deeper
into this love it becomes more and more interconnected forever
pretty cool huh and you you can experience that for
yourself what i'm talking about now i'm talking from direct
experiences that i've had this is something i've experienced this
is something meditators and yogis have experienced this is something
that you can experience on psychedelics or through various other
ways so that's it this sort of shows you the
highest level of of holism now of course most holism
is much lower than that holistic thinking is far shy
of this completely solid sphere of infinite interconnectedness but it
points in that direction just so you know now if
you love actualize.org you probably love the holism of it
and that has been one of the guiding drives behind
my work is holism when i started to actualize that
org one of the things that motivated me so much
to do all this content in such depth is that
i really didn't see any deeply holistic books teachings or
teachers everything i saw when i started to learn about
self-help and personal development it always underwhelmed me i mean
there was great stuff i read and studied and it
was all important but it always left me feeling lacking
like there's something lacking it's not holistic enough for me
i wanted the highest holism and i just didn't find
it anywhere in books or in science or in religion
or in philosophy everywhere i looked i never got enough
holism and then only now in hindsight can i understand
why that is because really what i wanted was i
wanted infinite holism i didn't know that's what i wanted
but i intuited it somewhere deep down that that's what
i wanted and so i just started creating actualize.org content
in that direction not really understanding where it would ultimately
lead me to and ultimately led me to that infinite
white ball of solid love and that's ultimately where i
hope it leads you to as well but it's a
long road to get there so we're breaking it up
into chunks here um but there's a cost to holism
see it doesn't come free if if holism is so
rare you might wonder why is it so rare what's
the cost that people are not willing to pay well
here are a couple of them one cost is that
you can't break holism down into bite-sized chunks very easily
it's hard to do episodes of holism it's hard to
do 10 minute videos that's why my videos are so
long and they require because see they require putting a
lot of pieces together and holding them in your mind
at once there's a lot of moving pieces to reality
and so my episodes are long because i'm trying to
bring them all together into your mental ram so to
speak so you can capture it in maybe an hour
or two you're not going to be able to hold
it for very long maybe for a few hours you'll
hold it then you'll drop out of it it's also
mentally overwhelming to keep all these moving pieces in your
mind i mean it's a lot easier to just be
like a physicist and to only know physics stuff and
nothing else life is so much easier that way you
can you can be such a devil and you have
such plausible deniability for being a devil you can avoid
responsibility that way you can avoid the struggle and difficulty
of putting all these contradictory worldviews and perspectives together which
is challenging and confusing and frustrating as but you don't
get to see the big picture and what you really
want especially if you're a physicist is you want to
see the big picture you want to see this big
white ball of love that would be the culmination of
all your physical study that is the ultimate physics but
you're so myopic you don't even understand that if i
told this to a physicist in some university he would
just dismiss me as a as a fool so that's
one cost another very great cause to holism is it
requires selflessness a selfish needy person can't be concerned about
anything very far beyond himself and holism requires a transcendence
of one's survival of one's biases because at the highest
holism you are completely unbiased conscious is completely unbiased at
the highest level of holism there literally isn't any difference
between you getting raped and you getting tortured and you
getting a birthday cake there's no difference between these things
at the highest level of holism this is very threatening
to the ego this is very threatening to people even
to say this already some of you listening will take
offense at what i just said because it's a threat
to your ego and i get that but then again
we're trying to be holistic here see holism requires surrendering
yourself until ultimately you surrender yourself so deeply that there's
nothing left to surrender and then you die you literally
die for the sake of holism that's if you want
to go all the way you don't have to go
that far you can stop far far short of that
most people will but if you want to go all
the way that would be going all the way but
even just to increase your holism even if you don't
go all the way just to increase it still requires
surrendering something to be holistic within the field of religion
requires you surrender certain prejudices you have about your favorite
religion to be holistic with the science you'd have to
surrender certain biases and prejudices you have for science maybe
you think physics is better than biology well you have
to surrender that if you want to be holistic with
science maybe you think science is better than spirituality well
you'd have to surrender that if you're going to want
to integrate those two together if you want to be
holistic within politics you're going to have to surrender all
sorts of political biases you have and prejudices this is
tough work and almost nobody wants to do it because
most people are just so selfish they're wrapped up in
their own survival and they think that there's nothing more
to do in life well i'm presenting you with a
an alternative possibility the selfless life not selfless for the
sake of others selfless for the sake of yourself paradoxically
you're not doing it for anyone else but you that's
the tricky thing about selflessness people misunderstand they think that
well oh i'm being selfless just so that i could
feel good because other people think i'm selfless no that's
not it that's not true selflessness that's selfishness true selflessness
is when you honestly want to surrender every bias you
have about how you see reality think about that think
about that possibility imagine if just you forgot about everything
else that was important in your life the money the
sex the drugs the business the the career the house
the children surrender all that forget about it it's not
important anymore the only thing that matters to you is
to be completely unbiased in how you see yourself that
would be true selflessness and that would lead to the
lead rather to the ultimate love because you see the
reason you can't love everybody and everything is because you're
so partial you're always judging everything as being good or
bad and that's because yourself needs to survive as that
little thing that it is and so as you can
see what happens is that as you surrender more and
more of your partialities and biases you have to surrender
more of yourself and as you do that the distortions
that obscured your vision of yourself and of reality they
fall away they clear the fog clears the clouds clear
and what you see is you you approach closer to
truth you become closer and closer and closer to truth
until finally at that moment when you completely surrender every
single bias you have and every single personal preference for
good and evil and you completely surrender yourself at that
moment you die and you become the truth and the
truth is complete selflessness love and that's god and at
that moment you become god realized you realize what god
is and then everything makes sense but the cost is
everything you held dear the cost is all of your
selfishness so the reason people don't realize god is because
they're just too selfish and when people suggest hey you
can realize god by being less selfish they say but
but leo why would i why would i choose to
be less selfish what would i get out of it
leo tell me the benefits i will get from being
less selfish and maybe i'll try it see you can't
cure a person like that there can't be a reason
for pursuing selflessness because if there was a reason that
reason would be selfish that's the whole point and power
of selflessness is that it has no reason you don't
select to be selfish or rather you don't select to
be selfless because it's going to do something good for
you you select to be selfless because you want to
be selfless and that is its own reward that is
the highest wisdom is to see that this is the
most counterintuitive thing about the universe is the decision to
become selfless because everything in your body and in your
mind is screaming for you to be more selfish you
think that by being extremely selfish you're going to get
everything you want and that's going to be the best
survival strategy for you and actually it ends up being
the opposite so now you understand why holistic thinking is
rare all right there's still more to say though so
make sure you stick around for the next part coming
up next week where we will talk about actually a
little bit more practically we're going to talk about how
