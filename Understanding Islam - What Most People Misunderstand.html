[Music] you it's quite unfortunate that there's lots of confusion
today about Islam what Islam fundamentally is about people in
the West don't understand this very well and actually a
lot of Islamic people don't understand this very well either
it's kind of funny there's lots of ideological positions and
political debates which take place which you see in the
media which you can see videos of on YouTube and
so forth and you can read about and people write
about Islam and the problems of radical Islam and all
this sort of stuff and what this turns into is
this turns into a sort of like a mirror of
the the silly one-dimensional debate between science and religion it's
like you got science on one side religion on the
other side and then you pick one side then you
fight with the other side it's this sort of situation
which is going on between the East and the Middle
East and it turns into this culture war and it's
very unfortunate because the core of what Islam is is
lost on 99.9% of people it's heartbreaking for me to
see this which is why I wanted to shoot this
episode because we're just not taught about this you're not
taught about this in school if you grew up in
the West and this of course stems from a couple
of factors it stems from xenophobia it stems from fear
of foreigners it it stems from this sort of tribalist
mentality that also goes on in the West just as
it does in the Middle East but fundamentally it stems
from the problem of not really understanding religion not understanding
the roots of religion and mysticism and it's actually very
simple to understand Islam literally in the Arabic language means
submission that's what Islam means that tells you what it's
about but submission - what is it submission to the
ideology of Islam you might think that that's what that
means but no that's not what it means it means
the total surrender of oneself to the truth or reality
or God the surrender of one's ego of one's sense
of identity to the larger thing that's going on here
this this is God right here this is reality right
here that's what you're submitting yourself to other synonyms for
the translation of Islam from the Arabic into the English
include words like obedience peace and purity and those are
all what come with submission of your ego to God
what we're talking about here is we're talking about self
transcendence the same as is the goal and objective of
Christianity and Judaism and Hinduism and yoga and Zen and
every other tradition it's no different it's just framed in
the style of the Middle East it's framed from their
cultural point of view based on their values and their
traditions and their history the word Muslim to be a
Muslim translates as one who submits to God what many
Westerners don't understand about Islam is that Islam is not
some separate religion from Christianity or Judaism Islam recognizes Christian
and Jewish prophets like Jesus Moses Noah David Abraham and
others it also recognizes the validity of Christian and Jewish
sacred texts like the Bible and the Torah and others
so it doesn't reject these Islam builds on top of
them Islam is really just like the third incarnation of
judeo-christianity so you had Judaism which was like the earliest
incarnation then with Jesus you had the Christian incarnation which
is the second incarnation was sort of an innovation on
Judaism and then you had the third innovation which came
with Muhammad and Muhammad's era was around 600 AD so
six hundred years after Jesus and so the the additional
extra little twist that Islam adds on top of the
judeo-christian philosophy is that Mohammed was the final or the
last prophet which ends up being a big problem because
of course like most religious traditions they try to get
a monopoly over the truth which of course is completely
antithetical to the truth there's no such thing as the
last prophet there will never be a last prophet you
can become enlightened right now and you can be a
prophet there are millions of well not millions but hundreds
and maybe thousands even prophets that are alive right now
who you can go speak to and visit and they
are as equally spiritually awakened as Mohammed was at the
very least so by no means was Mohammed actually the
last prophet but in their tradition that's how they frame
it and also what Westerners don't understand is that Allah
Allah is just another name for the Christian God it's
not some other God that that Muslims worship it's the
same Christian God Allah the one God so there's there's
a lot you can learn just by studying the history
of Islam sort of its origin story and the biography
of Muhammad and just the historical developments of this tradition
which again is not taught very well in the West
which is why there's a lot of this sort of
xenophobic reaction against it because you're really not taught it
unless you go out specifically and you educate yourself or
maybe you took some more advanced classes or some broad
ranging classes in university it's like if you were studying
comparative religion or some like that then maybe you learn
something about it but generally Westerners have a very poor
understanding of this topic I know I did even though
I got a pretty good education just because this is
not part of the core curriculum what I want to
talk about here is I want to talk about several
aspects of Islam which can be illuminating for those of
us who are into self development and into self-actualization and
spirituality there's something to be gleaned from most every mystical
tradition and every religion if you know how to see
the truth and ignore the corruption and the minutiae to
be sure there's plenty of corruption within Islam just as
there is with every single religious tradition just as there
is even with science even in academia and everywhere else
corruption is not a problem exclusive to Islam corruption is
a problem that runs rampant throughout every facet of human
life so don't make the mistake of thinking that all
just because there's corruption here that there's nothing valuable to
be gleaned no let's cover some of the different facets
that are valuable for our purposes here so perhaps the
most important one of which is jihad jihad literally translates
from the Arabic to the English as struggle jihad is
struggle now there's what's known as the lesser jihad and
the greater jihad but really there's no distinction there's only
one jihad so jihad means the struggle for what is
it the struggle to kill your enemies is it the
struggle to fight over oppression or evil no it's the
struggle with yourself it's the struggle with your own ego
it's the struggle with the evil inside of you there
is only one form of evil there is only one
devil and he is you the ego that's it that's
the only struggle that exists in the world all external
struggles the lesser jihad as it's known so the distinction
between the lesser and the greater is that the greater
jihad is supposed to be the spiritual inner journey to
self-realization okay but then they're supposed to be like the
lesser jihad which is what the terrorists and the Muslim
radicals are accused of doing they're accused of engaging in
the lesser jihad which is fighting enemies abroad fighting enemies
who are the infidel or fighting enemies who are the
enemies of of Islam or who are the non-believers the
enemies of Allah but there's no such thing because the
inner and the outer the lesser and the greater this
is these are dualities all these dualities will collapse and
break down and so really there's only one jihad it's
to struggle with the self any enemies that you have
out there infidels whatever they are you without you being
conscious of it so if you actually completed the greater
jihad you would become conscious that there is no difference
between the greater and the lesser jihad and that actually
you're fighting enemies out there somewhere is you really just
fighting with yourself you're always fighting with yourself there is
nothing but Allah Allah is the only thing there is
Allah is fighting with itself Allah can be ignorant or
Allah can be awake when Allah is awake he stops
fighting with himself when Allah is ignorant and stuck inside
of Maya or illusion then he thinks that there's separation
and boundaries and there's us-versus-them and there's the believers and
the disbelievers and we got to punish the disbelievers and
fight the disbelievers because they threatened the believers the fully
awakened Allah is not frightened by anything his faith is
unshakable because it's not faith anymore it's being its direct
consciousness Allah is Allah you can't shake Allah when you
realize that you are Allah so it's all about overcoming
your own inner self deceptions to ultimately transcend the ego
and to realize the self the true self the infinite
self which is what Allah is and this is self-actualization
jihad is nothing other than what actualize that org is
about jihad is not some some radical Islamic philosophy I
mean it is radical but it's the the essence of
every single spiritual path it's the essence of self-help and
personal development and self-actualization actualized gorg is jihad it's a
modern version of jihad framed in a culture and in
a way that is suited to the 21st century materialistic
rationalist secular Western mind that's what actualizado his tada that's
also what Zen is Zen is jihad neo-advaita is jihad
advised Vedanta is jihad Yoga is jihad self-help is jihad
jedd McKenna's work if you're familiar with with his writings
is a very potent form of jihad what's interesting about
Jen McKenna's work is that unlike a lot of other
spiritual work which tends to be very indirect and sort
of loosey-goosey and has a lot of fantasies about improving
the self and about being spiritual and lovey and dovey
and all this sort of stuff his work is very
directed cuz the [ __ ] it's very much about
the jihad part he really emphasizes the jihad part it's
a self annihilation it's so it's a waging of a
war with yourself and that's very direct and it's very
radical it is very radical which is why McKenna's work
is polarizing people either love it or they hate it
because either you're at the point where you can do
a direct jihad or you're at the point where you
can't and 99% of people in the world can't they're
not ready to surrender their ego they're not even ready
to hear about it or to even read about that
possibility but then those who are are and that's a
very direct path if you can just go and straight
straight up wage a full-on war with yourself and burn
yourself alive in the spiritual fires so if you resonate
with jedd McKenna's work well then you understand jihad very
well the other spiritual traditions tend to emphasize the jihad
component less because what does the what does the ego
hate the most the ego hates the most it so
empower being threatened so most spiritual traditions what they actually
do is they try to trick the ego into doing
spiritual work they don't tell the ego that you're outright
gonna kill yourself they don't tell you that because if
they tell you that then no one's gonna listen no
one wants that no one's gonna buy into your spirituality
if you tell them that so instead what you do
is you tell them the opposite you tell them oh
you're gonna you're gonna grow your yourself life is gonna
become more beautiful and this and more loving and and
you're gonna have more power and more of this and
so you tell the ego all the stuff it wants
to hear because as the ego then gets going into
the into the practices as it starts doing yoga and
meditation and self acquiring all this then it slowly starts
to realize like holy [ __ ] I am I'm
actually gonna kill myself but by that point it's sort
of already like well I've already been doing this for
a couple of years I'm already sort of bought into
it fine [ __ ] I'll just I'll just carry
but it still doesn't really understand the ego will only
understand what it really means to die after it's dead
and that's such a radical thing that if the ego
knew about it beforehand it would never go there it
can't go there so many spiritual paths would they do
because most people are not ready for a true jihad
what they do is they have to do a gradual
ramp up so most spiritual teachings are weaksauce they're not
strong sauce it's weak sauce for the ego it's a
little bit of like I'll just meditate to relax to
melt away your stress or do this technique this breathing
technique it'll help to to calm your monkey mind that's
sort of like how it starts right it's the ego
looking to improve itself thinking that oh I can do
spirituality but still stay fundamentally in power I can still
stay alive I can improve my self-image I can become
this enlightened master or this this spiritual guru type person
and and that all that's that's a nice image to
aspire to but of course what's not realize is that
in the end you will lose absolutely everything you'll surrender
everything there will be nothing of you left all self
images will be broken and completely shattered and your entire
notion of reality will collapse and you will die and
then that will be your awakening is your death but
that doesn't compute for the selfish mind and even self-help
even stuff like what Tony Robbins teaches and just you
know lots of self-help is just about giving you career
advice business advice relationship advice this sort of flimsy type
of advice that's all good but ultimately that is also
jihad it's just a very gradual form of jihad such
that most people who are even teaching self-help kind of
basic self-help they don't even realize what they're really teaching
they think they're teaching self-improvement and in the sense they
are but ultimately that self-improvement is leading you up Maslow's
hierarchy ultimately to self transcendence and that's in our current
culture and era that's what most all that most people
can handle they can't he'll an Emer than that now
of course if you can't handle more than that then
go for the direct jihad approach and actualize that or
just kind of somewhere in the middle I don't try
to beat you over the head with jihad too much
because I know that most people aren't gonna aren't gonna
buy into it the more you stress the jihad the
smaller your spiritual audience will grow I mean will shrink
it'll shrink down smaller and smaller and smaller and basically
you're gonna have a very hardcore teaching for a very
small number of people who are extremely serious about this
work that's sort of what happens with Jed McKenna and
then the less you emphasize jihad the more people will
be attracted to you because their egos come flocking to
spirituality because they want to have a spiritual eyes Diigo
now of course the way that the devil works is
that it turns everything backwards and inside-out 180 degrees so
when you hear jihad in the news or in mainstream
culture you hear it as the exact opposite is what
I'm describing you hear it as selfishness you hear it
as people engaging in violence in warfare and in hatred
and in condemnation of other groups and in judging others
and waging jihad against them that's what the devil does
see my video what is the devil to explain the
tricks of the devil but the devil works through illusion
self-deception and so the devil does is he will take
the truth he will take the most potent forms of
spirituality and he will corrupt them inside out which is
exactly what happens with Christianity Islam Judaism Hinduism and all
the other isms that are out there because the greatest
threat to the devil is the truth so he has
to take control over any mechanisms which might reveal the
truth too directly it's too direct so why is there
this corruption and this misunderstanding of what Islam is it's
because there's there's um well when a spiritual teaching is
too direct it gets corrupted the more mainstream it gets
it becomes the enemy of its own success they are
supposed to be like two billion Muslims in the world
right now and it's a quickly growing religion so anything
that appeals to 2 billion people has to be very
very diluted and watered down and actually it has to
be very materialistic which is why the lesser jihad is
a materialistic form of the greater jihad you see materialism
is about fighting in this physical world whereas the greater
jihad is fighting within yourself and attaining the spiritual world
the spiritual realms the word Allah means God of course
but it also means really absolute infinity not God is
a man in the clouds with a beard but Allah
has this thing right here what science calls reality that's
what Islam calls Allah what the atheist calls the Big
Bang or reality this very present moment that's happening right
now objective physical reality that's what the atheist refers to
as Allah but the atheist isn't conscious the scientist isn't
conscious of of the full significance of what the word
reality really means and what it really is it's absolute
infinity that's what I lie is in Islam they have
what's called the 99 names of Allah these are titles
that are given to Allah which describe the various properties
and characteristics of Allah and this can be quite illuminating
you can go to Wikipedia type in 99 names of
Allah and you will get this list I want to
read you some of the names from this list because
this describes exactly what Allah is the king the peace
the holy of the controller the supreme the Creator the
all-knowing the all-seeing the all aware the magnificent the sublime
the vast the wise the witness the truth the reality
the one the perceiver the indivisible the all-powerful the beginning
'less the endless the hidden the good the light the
beautiful the patient the guide the giver of life and
the taker of life and the infinite this is just
a partial listing you can find the full list on
Wikipedia if you're curious so all of these accurately describe
the properties of Allah these are the properties of reality
when you have a direct consciousness of what reality is
as a whole and not just some fragment in the
way that science for example studies it or the way
the atheists understand it when you actually experience Allah and
it's possible to have a direct experience of Allah because
that's exactly what you are you are Allah you will
understand that all of these perfectly describe Allah perfectly when
I was reading this list it actually brought me to
tears because when I was reading it online because I'm
reading it and I it's my direct experience that is
being described here it's a perfect description a perfect description
and the reason I'm telling you this because people think
at all-but but Islam is so corrupt yes it's corrupt
in many ways but don't lose the core that's there
the core there contains some deep truth which is why
Islam is so entrenched which is why people don't give
up Islam see a lot of atheists and scientifically minded
Western people secular people they look at Islamic people and
Islamic countries and say well why don't they just give
all this up it's just it's just silly ideas and
myths and and stories and it's all just nonsense and
it's filled with corruption and it promotes violence and all
of this no that's that's because you're not seeing through
to the truth they're all you're seeing is just the
pure corruption and of course when you're just seeing the
pure corruption then you're gonna have the opinion that all
is just nonsense you should just throw it all away
better to do with it away with it but the
people who see the truth in it and who've had
these direct experiences they're never gonna give it up never
because they know the power of the truth that's there
now of course what a lot of them don't know
is that that truth is equally there in many other
traditions through many of the forms including in Christianity Judaism
Hinduism yoga Zen I mean does this do you name
it there's so many shamanism psychedelics just a plain old-fashioned
contemplation or meditation can get you there there's so many
ways to get there is LOM is certainly not the
way not the best way not the only way another
interesting concept that I love in Islam is this notion
of the 72 virgins have you heard of this you
heard of terrorists expecting 72 virgins after they blow themselves
up in this sort of stuff and I might see
my koalas just some silly nonsense how could anybody believe
that and and and then blow them selves up over
that but actually after you experience Allah directly for yourself
you will understand that the 72 virgins is a very
accurate metaphor for the that magnificence of Allah what you
have to understand it have to understand where Islam came
from its cultural context its historical context this metaphor of
the 72 virgins is perfect for the context in which
Allah was developed when was a lot of elip t'
where was it developed not in America not in the
21st century with the internet and with television and with
video games okay this was developed in 600 AD in
Arabia do you know have you studied the history of
600 AD Arabia do you know the kind of things
that went on there do you know the kind of
mindsets that that culture had what their values were take
a hypothetical Arabian man in 680 a wealthy man he's
probably a Caravan trader let's say and he delivers spices
along the Silk Road and other places through the Middle
East maybe he trades with people in Africa and Europe
and in India and so he's you know he's he's
a business person he's a trader he has a caravan
he has a big family has to take care of
he probably has multiple wives as was the custom of
that time he has to take care of all of
them he has to take care of his his thriving
Caravan trade and he's interested in what what is what
is he interested in he's interested in acquiring more wives
he's interested in beautiful horses he's interested in in finding
new spices and new trade routes and and acquiring gold
and trading you know he's he's he's engaged in the
in the pragmatics of living back then that's how people
lived he's also concerned about tribal warfare because the region
he lived in and at that time tribal warfare was
rampant there were feuds between neighboring tribes and even large
families because Arabian culture is a strongly familial culture family
is very very important it's one of the most important
values but then of course they have family feud's they
have these long ascended families so they're battling with you
to sooth that's what his mind is focused upon now
let's say that I am some Arabian prophet who has
experienced Allah and now I come to this Arabian businessman
this caravan trader and I tell him hey there's this
magnificent thing called Allah you've got to experience this come
come with me start meditating here some practices start to
do this and you will experience Allah the most magnificent
thing and the Arabia man will look at me and
say the caravan trader will say but but but I
mean how is this gonna improve my life how is
this practical this isn't practical at all is this gonna
get me more camels is it gonna get any better
horses is this gonna get me more more women for
my harem is this gonna get me more spices is
this gonna help how's this gonna help me with with
the fuse that I'm fighting with I need warriors for
my for my feuding and that's where I will come
up with a metaphor to help to explain to him
the magnificence of the absolute and I will say ah
you know what it's like Allah is like 72 virgins
it's like having 72 virgins in your harem and now
the caravan trader will get it that's a metaphor he
can relate to in his time in his culture in
the stuff that he's engaged in at the time now
of course today in the West in the 21st century
this doesn't make any sense but back then in that
context it make perfect sense and if you ever happen
to have the the glory of experiencing Allah for yourself
you will actually see that it's more magnificent than having
72 virgins in a harem I'm telling you that's a
dead accurate metaphor and actually it will be way better
than that experience it for yourself and then you will
see how appropriate that metaphor is the mistake that people
make when they are thinking about religion and spiritual mystical
traditions is that they take them out of the historical
and cultural context especially today because we have a global
world and it might seem because our world is global
and and you can watch youtube videos from around the
world and the internet connects us all that oh now
we sort of understand each other globally but no we
don't we really don't because first of all you don't
understand even a fraction not even one percent of the
cultures that exist around the world today in the 21st
century you don't understand you have no experience with them
at all and they would completely blow your mind and
shatter your reality if you were exposed to them but
and that's not even taking into account the historical evolution
of cultures that happened over over centuries and millennia like
we're talking about here so you have to understand where
the tradition is coming from what his origins were and
then it starts to make a lot more sense another
interesting facet of Islam is that there are no images
of Allah or Muhammad within Islam this is very different
from the Christian tradition where we actually have art going
back for centuries and for millennia depictions of Christ and
Mary and and even God you know Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel
where you have David and God or adamant God and
all this and they have depictions of God as the
as the white in the white flowing robes and the
white beard sitting up in the heavens with angels and
all this sort of stuff you don't get that in
Islam and actually Islam is very sensitive to that which
you might have heard of about in the news you
know people fighting with violence over cartoon drawings of Muhammad
and and all this sort of stuff but but what's
the deeper what's the deeper truth there why is Allah
and Muhammad not allowed to be depicted why is there
taboo against imagery in Islam because the map is not
the territory because the mind gets hooked on images and
icons and then starts to worship those images and those
icons but Allah is not any particular image or icon
or form Allah is the formless Allah is nothingness infinity
is nothingness so in a sense to maintain the purity
of the teaching you don't want to corrupt the teaching
by putting pictures of Allah everywhere or Muhammad his people
and start to worship that rather than seeing Allah as
what's here right now in the present moment and that's
been a big problem for Christianity the iconography within Christianity
arguably all the European art that's been done over the
last thousand years around Christianity has done a great disservice
to Christianity because most people today most Christians when you
ask them what is God they have an image of
God as this this man sitting up in the clouds
and that's a delusion and they don't understand that's a
delusion so you can see that actually there's a there's
a good intention behind this idea of not depicting Allah
or Muhammad because all symbols are not the absolute and
we've talked about that a lot before so you can
appreciate that you can appreciate how all these am I
talking about the map is not the tour tour territory
and girdles and completeness theorem and and all this how
it all starts to connect together what they do have
an Islam though for art is they have geometric patterns
these sort of tessellations or these fractals interesting and various
geometric patterns that in a sense is one way to
depict Allah without creating a human image of it without
anthropomorphizing el allah the way that Christians do it it's
actually a pretty ingenious solution to this problem these geometric
patterns actually are aligned very well with what you see
on psychedelics and also they represent infinity because once you
have a checkerboard some of the kind of pattern hexagonal
pattern it just kind of goes on in all directions
infinitely and that's that is a symbol a pointer towards
Allah another feature of Islam is that they pray five
times a day why five times a day why so
much well it's because of this important other concept within
Islam which is called forgetfulness Islam recognizes as basically all
spiritual traditions do the fact that we fall back asleep
so easily the human mind falls back asleep into complacency
and lent to materialism and so what needs to be
happening is you need to be waking up all the
time you don't just have one enlightenment experience and that's
it it's like you got to be awake all the
time five times a day 20 times a day keep
waking yourself up keep being mindful because you forget and
if you had a mystical experience of your maybe take
a psychedelic trip or maybe you've had some awakening experience
during a meditation retreat or something like that great but
then you know what the problem is the problem is
you come back the next day and you've forgotten where
did it go where did my mystical experience go how
come I'm not in Union anymore how come I don't
see out loud right now how come I'm out of
touch with it because you've forgotten not forgotten in the
sense that you can't remember but you've you've you've lost
touch with the awareness right now you've gone from mindfulness
into mindlessness and now you're in mindlessness and so the
point of prayer five times a day is so that
you don't get so wrapped up in your day doing
practical stuff materialistic stuff the way that most Westerners do
think of a typical Western or stockbroker on Wall Street
what's he's doing this whole day he's chasing money and
sex and drugs that's what he's doing all day and
power and political influence so the intention behind Islam is
like well what if we interrupted his day five times
and got him to actually focus on the the more
subtle the more spiritual aspects of life like for example
what if we just took a stockbroker and we forced
him to stop five times a day because we had
a clock that just rang for everybody so all of
Wall Street would just stop five times a day for
ten minutes and every single stock broker on Wall Street
they thought about their own death they thought about the
suffering of humanity they thought about what they're doing with
their life and whether they're their pursuit of of materialistic
goods and pleasures is is leading them towards actual happiness
and they calm their mind down and they step outside
of their cravings and all this stuff they're chasing the
hustle and bustle of everyday life of all the practical
stuff and they just basked in the beingness of the
present moment what would happen then well of course then
all of Wall Street would collapse after a few years
of that so that's no good so we can't have
that on Wall Street but you understand the intention now
a little bit about Mohammed Muhammad is the Prophet he's
supposed to have written the Quran but he didn't write
it himself he's supposed to have channeled it from a
higher source the question is was Muhammad enlightened and I
think almost certainly he was the only question is to
what degree there are various degrees of enlightenment various degrees
of realization various facets of realization that you can that
you can become conscious of I I don't know it's
hard to it's hard to judge but since he spoke
about the absolute so eloquently and since it seems like
he had an understanding of the absolute from direct experience
I don't I don't see otherwise how he could have
spoken it with with such passion and such a commitment
that it seems like he was enlightened he he did
go and meditate in a cave by himself that's part
of his his origin story and it seems like he
had mystical experiences throughout his whole life not just once
or twice but later into his later years he basically
composed the Quran and other writings for like 20 or
30 or 40 years of his life he lived a
pretty long life after his initial awake will I would
consider an awakening he's also supposed to have communicator channeled
the angel Gabriel and you might say well that's surely
nonsense Lee and that's just stories that's just fiction don't
be so sure about that as you get deeper into
these mystical experiences you start to discover that you can
you can channel entities I've got I've got books on
my bookshelf that teach you how to channel if you
want to learn how to channel you can you can
go spend 3060 days doing these practices you can learn
how to channel you can connect with different entities and
this sort of stuff you can take DMT and you
can see alien entities and and they will be more
lifelike than human beings that you see right here right
now and you could find YouTube videos of people who
channel like you got Bashar and and other folks like
that who are into channeling so channeling is a real
phenomenon you can you can go learn it experience it
for yourself it's definitely possible it's common it's a common
ability that gets developed by people who do serious hardcore
spirits practices so totally plausible that that that's how the
quran came about I encourage you to actually go study
the the origin story of Muhammad not per se the
myths of it but like the historical the historical like
what are the historical facts that we know just to
kind of like get inside his head to see where
where he was coming from and also to learn about
the culture in the context that he was dealing with
at that time it's very eye-opening I want to stress
that you don't get lost in the minutia of debating
about the niggly little details about Islam that's very easy
to do it's very easy to do that with almost
anything you can always find fine points to criticize here
and there and different things that are corrupt here and
there all I don't like this I don't like that
is this really true is this an embellishment is this
an elaboration is this a thing a lie yeah there's
probably plenty of that in Islam but you want to
go to the big picture because what happens otherwise is
that you're lost in the minutiae the people most of
the people most of the Westerners who like to debate
and criticize Islam do so without ever having a direct
experience of Allah which is utterly absurd because you can't
criticize this thing you can't really understand what this thing
is about without having a direct experience of Allah first
so first go experience that then start leveling your criticisms
so people like Bill Maher Sam Harris Christopher Hitchens and
others like that they love to criticize and rag on
on Islam but they've never actually experienced Allah so they
don't really understand the depth of what they're criticizing which
is not to say that all their criticisms are invalid
some of their criticism totally valid it's completely correct that
modern-day Islam and countries and people who subscribe to Islam
that those people do all sorts of violations of human
rights and civil rights and and can form dictatorial regimes
and they and they can do all sorts of nasty
stuff of course of course but that's not exclusive just
to them that happens everywhere all around the world there's
corruption all around the world every single government is basically
corrupt especially the US government is extremely corrupt and we
do all sorts of heinous things against all sorts of
people in the name of of American patriotism in the
name of Christianity in the name of Judaism in the
name of anything because that's ego that's how ego functions
that's not that's not a problem of Islam that's the
problem of ego it's a problem of dogma in fundamentalism
now you might ask well leo why is Islam so
corrupt why is it so archaic you have to understand
that every spirit for teaching has to be suited to
the era the culture and the geography from which it
came about this spiritual teaching as I've said is suited
to 600 AD Arabia if Islam was invented today it
would look like actualized org it would not look like
traditional Islam and conversely if actualizado org was invented in
600 AD Arabia for that era for that geography for
that culture it would look something like Islam because if
I try to say the things that I'm trying to
say now there in that era it would completely not
resonate and I would get killed and also because I
would have grown up in that culture so I would
have a totally different set of values than I do
as an American in the 21st century and also of
course because we knew a lot less about the world
than we know now the load lived the world was
a lot less globalized the problem is that people cling
to spiritual tradition they try to take a spiritual tradition
that are that is thousands of years old they try
to maintain it it's worth as an orthodoxy they try
to maintain it and apply it to today but today
is different in a thousand years a lot of stuff
changes we learn more stuff we get new developments in
science we get a globalization happening we get new technologies
we get changes in morality we get changes in values
and culture changes in government radical radical radical changes we
get changes even in our DNA in our genetics in
the functioning of our brains our brain chemistry we get
changes in the food that we eat the air that
we like so many changes almost everything has changed we
also have a much deeper historical context into which to
put these spiritual traditions so in a sense society has
evolved so what really needs to happen is that these
spiritual traditions also need to evolve they need to be
fresh because spirituality is about the present moment the truth
the truth is only happening in the present how do
you connect yourself with the truth to answer that question
you must ask first the question what are the obstacles
that are preventing me from connecting to the truth and
what are the obstacles the obstacles are usually the social
ones the cultural ones it's your social upbringing your culture
your education that gets in the way so the obstacles
that existed a thousand five hundred years ago in Arabia
are different obstacles that exist today in 21st century America
for example where people are jerking off to porn and
watching YouTube videos non-stop and playing video games that [
__ ] those obstacles did not exist back then so
a lot of the corruption stems from the mind being
ideological wanting to cling to tradition and not letting these
traditions evolve as they need to this is a problem
that's not just exclusive to Islam it's also their Christianity
in Judaism it's even there in science you think science
and atheism is immune to this not at all it
suffers from exactly the same problem atheists cling to their
to their dogmas and scientists cling to their paradigms just
as much and a lot of problems get created because
of that you have to understand that 600 AD Arabia
was very conservative very traditional it was extremely tribal it
was very combative there was no unifying element at that
time within Arabia and so Islam was actually a huge
innovation at that time it brought peace and stability to
the region that otherwise was slitting each other's throats over
family feud's that went back hundreds and and maybe thousands
of years that you you were killing and slaughtering your
your family members in these feuds in that era without
even know why you're slaughtering them you're just slaughtering them
just because that's what your culture what's the time and
people were worshipping different deities in that in that region
there was no unifying force and there was no notion
of peace and compassion and love and you might think
well but Islam doesn't teach about peace and compassion love
because today we know Islam is this sort of violent
tradition but back then you have to understand that it's
all relative so back then the violence was so extreme
that what Islam actually brought was a stabilizing and peaceful
influence it actually taught that there's something larger that's connecting
all of these tribes together and so under this banner
Muhammad was actually able to unify the region and that
was a huge technological innovation at the time see we
tend to forget we think of technology as machines and
cars and computers and internet and smartphones that's today's technology
but some of the biggest innovations of technology weren't machines
they were social innovations they were cultural innovations they were
spiritual religious innovations and Islam was one of those at
that time now of course today when you bring that
when you bring that technology into today without adjusting it
without knowing how to read its its intent how to
take the truth out of it but leave behind the
the old antiquated things in the Quran for example which
don't make sense today if you're a literalist if you're
too literal about following the Quran if you're too Orthodox
about it then what's going to happen is you're going
to bring that culture and the problems of 60 of
600 AD Arabia into today's world and that doesn't work
so the problem is that you have to let these
traditions evolve and the mind has a big problem with
evolution because the whole point of the ego is to
prevent evolution what is ego ego is just a structure
that's trying to maintain itself as it is so by
definition any change that comes to this structure the ego
is gonna reject and it's gonna bristle at it's gonna
feel afraid of and it's gonna want to be Orthodox
it so we're gonna want to stay the same but
then of course all of life is always changing so
you don't really have an option to stay the same
everything is gonna change everything is going to evolve you're
not gonna maintain your orthodoxies and the more you try
to maintain your orthodoxies the more it actually backfires on
you which much which is much smarter is to be
proactive about evolving along with the times and also if
you want to maintain the the spirit of your orthodoxies
and your traditions you can do that but to do
that you have to read between the lines and see
what the what the intent of spiritual heart and corn
the intent was of the teaching which is what this
episode is about if you've got the heart of Islam
you don't need to follow the Quran to the letter
it doesn't matter at all you can throw the Quran
away when you've got the heart when you become Allah
it doesn't matter you don't need to read the Quran
anymore ever now to many Muslims that will sound like
like sacrilege like heresy that's because that's what orthodoxy is
that's what happens when you take spiritual scriptures too literally
that's always been the problem Christians have taken spiritual scriptures
too literally Hindus have and Jews and everybody else it's
just a common problem because the egoic mind the selfish
mind it's materialistic it wants to find authority figures that
it can latch on to because that's how it gets
a sense of its reality and stability whereas to awaken
is to realize that there is no stability at all
that Allah is infinitely groundless that there's no beginning or
end to it and that there's no foundation to anything
and therefore you're completely liberated and ironically that's what many
religious people are afraid of because remember how the religion
was sold in the first place it was sold to
billions and millions of people by watering it down by
making it palatable to the ego and in a sense
the devil has co-opted the teaching precisely so that it
leads you in the exact opposite direction of awakening and
that's why you see so much hypocrisy within religion it's
because it's not because the religion is false it's actually
because the religion is true it's precisely because it's so
true it's precisely because the techniques are so powerful that
they need to be corrupted they're too powerful that's the
that's the delicious irony of how the devil works now
you might say but Leo aren't you defending Islamic fundamentalism
here and of course the answer is no what I'm
talking about is developing a higher understanding what we need
is not to start attacking people or attacking traditions what
we need to be more common understanding to see that
all religions and all traditions and even secular foundations and
organizations they all basically have one common goal when you
truly understand that you soften with compassion you no longer
snipe at the other side you no longer play these
tribal ideological games that are played between science and religion
between Christianity and Islam and the West in the east
this is all silly this is all just part of
the problem for example the West will criticize the Middle
East for fighting with each other don't say oh well
there's the Sunnis and the Shiites why are they fighting
and slaughtering each other so silly it's just tribal warfare
stop that why do they do that why don't they
just stop I mean after all they're both Muslims Sunnis
and Shiites are both Muslims they just have slight different
interpretations of the chronology and then the historical developments of
you know whose ancestor was who and who was closer
to Mohammed and all this was it the uncle or
the father the son in law and all this like
yeah there's these technicalities but see when you get lost
in those technicalities then that's what happens you develop this
kind of tribal conflict but then that happens still with
the west and the East that happens the West and
the Middle East same thing happens when you zoom out
you take a larger perspective you wonder but why is
the West in the Middle East fighting they're both they're
both talking about exactly the same thing they're both trying
to realize truth just in different ways they're confused about
what they're doing now you might say Billy oh isn't
Islam dangerous well this question of danger is really interesting
because a lot of people think that the world is
gonna come to an end through terrorism or through religious
radicals and fundamentalists but consider that actually the greatest danger
to the world is not Islamic radicals or religion but
actually it's the opposite it's materialism if the world comes
to an end in next hundred years most likely it
will be because of materialism run amok it will be
because of rampant secularism rampant rationalism rampant corporate greed which
is fueled by those nuclear war which is again fueled
by the technology and the rationalism the corporate greed that
is infecting our government by global warming which is also
fueled by by the same and maybe perhaps by some
new technological development like artificial intelligences which take over and
then all hell breaks loose these will not get developed
or triggered by Islamic radicals these are gonna come from
Western culture not from Middle Eastern culture Middle Eastern culture
is not going to develop an AI is gonna kill
us all but Western culture might Middle Eastern culture doesn't
have that many news Western culture has a lot more
nukes and we look actually especially lately what you see
in the news I mean we look very trigger-happy to
use them much more so than than many Middle Eastern
countries global warming corporate greed the deep irony is that
the thing that the radical Islamic terrorists are concerned about
he's actually legitimate they what are they concerned about they
are concerned about the West's influence over the world and
specifically the Middle East they are concerned about the the
spread of rampant materialism and secularism and how that's having
a corrupting influence on their local culture but also culture
at large and they are seeing that their culture and
their religion is getting swamped over by this by this
toxic form of materialism now of course their reaction to
it is also materialistic and therefore problematic it's contributing to
the problem but they are quite right that materialism is
a problem so in a sense the West is worried
that the Islamics will take over and they will end
the world but the the islamics are worried that it's
the West that's taking over and it's gonna destroy the
world who's more right you might think that well of
course the West what's the problem with the West but
that's because you haven't studied really deeply the the evils
of the West the West is extremely evil this corporate
greed it's not merely greed it's not merely people who
are after making millions and billions of dollars it goes
way deeper than that the evil of the the greed
that we see especially running rampant in America is a
huge huge huge corrupting factor huge it corrupts everything corrupts
education crumbs health care it corrupts marketing it corrupts food
it corrupts your health like I mean there's almost no
end in sight to the corruption that comes with this
we have record numbers of depressed people record numbers of
suicidal people record numbers with PTSD suffering from all these
problems all relationship problems marriage problems all this what's this
coming from it's coming from materialism it's coming from a
lack of self actualization and it seems to only be
getting worse because for example Western society is becoming more
and more secular more and more materialistic so in a
sense these Islamic radicals have a reason to be concerned
because what they're concerned about is that that will come
and take over their region their village their of their
city their country and I didn't even start mentioning all
the ways in which the Western powers metal in Middle
Eastern affairs and geopolitics and screwing and manipulating their elections
and all of that so that's like kicking the hornet's
nest you know adding insult to injury now you might
still say but Leo shouldn't we still fight radical fundamental
what do you want me to do do you want
us to just do nothing sit back and do nothing
and let the terrorists run amok no what we need
is we need a variant L and approach to this
problem we need to understand the roots of the problem
and we to understand that art are superficial solutions our
knee-jerk reactions to go bomb somebody to attack somebody to
criticize somebody that that actually could be backfiring on us
and contributing to the problem what you need to do
is you first need to understand why fundamentalism exists in
the first place at a very deep level this is
a epistemic question this is a question of all the
stuff that I've been talking about concepts like webs of
belief and paradigms and and and dogma and ideology and
how the mind works a self-deceptive characteristics of the mind
and then what you need to see to see that
this fundamentalism actually is it it's a condition of the
egoic mind materialistic egoic minds are fundamentalist we have a
lot of fundamentalism here in the West it just takes
a different form and style for example most the most
prevalent form of fundamentalism in the West is capitalism this
blind belief that capitalism will solve all problems that's fundamentalism
and at least a lot of it'll at least do
a lot of evil you think communism leads to evil
yes it does and I'm not saying communism is a
solution but what we need to see is also the
capitalism eat leads to also a lot of evil a
lot of the evil of capitalism is hidden and buried
under the surface you have to research it to really
see just how much evil there is there the solution
isn't to wage a battle over communism capitalism or Christianity
or Islam or or science versus religion the solutions charged
to start to see that it's the ego-mind that's responsible
and to start to see that it's all happening within
yourself and that it's not separate from you that you
are contributing to the problem you you the American taxpayer
or the European taxpayer you're contributing to the problem the
ideas and opinions you hold how you understand yourself and
how you understand the world this is all contributing to
the problem this corrupting force it's within you it's not
in some other tribe or some other nation it's within
you you are the source of the corruption you are
the source of the evil and that is not gonna
stop no matter what you do externally until you take
care of your ego which is what Islam is trying
to get you to do you must slay the fundamentalism
inside of yourself and fundamentalism is a lot more tricky
of a problem than most people think because a lot
of Westerners secular rational scientifically minded people think that they
are immune to the problem of fundamentalism and of course
that just makes them all the more susceptible because now
there's the additional hurdle of convincing these people who think
they're immune they are believing that fundamentally they think that
they are not fundamentalists but they're fundamental about thinking that
they're not fundamentalist and then I have to convince them
that they actually are fundamentalists and of course they are
gonna be fundamentalists and deny that they're fundamentalists the whole
point of fundamentalism is that you deny that you're fundamentalist
regardless of what the content of your fundamentalism is whether
it's science religion and rationality or capitalism communism or anything
else so again very ironically the West is committing the
very same problem that the Middle East is committing they
are waging a lesser jihad the United States government is
waging a lesser jihad against the jihadis in the Middle
East and the the jihadis in the Middle East are
waging a lesser jihad against Western powers and that's not
going to fly it doesn't work it just create it
just keeps the cycle going that's a feud that's a
family feud is what that's known as that's not gonna
fix it you need to now rise to the higher
level to see the commonalities in the same way that
Mohammad injured used Islam in in 600 AD in Arabia
and that elevated them to see commonality were there was
just in fighting and tribalism the same thing now needs
to happen between Islam in the Middle East and in
the West east and west needs to come together you
need to recognize that all external fighting is really just
a distraction from the greater jihad of turning inwards if
every US president engaged in the greater jihad within himself
there would be no Middle Eastern Wars there would be
no lesser jihad the lesser jihad are precisely because these
people do not engage in the greater jihad and likewise
the same thing with the leaders in the Middle East
leaders who are who are organizing these these campaigns to
fight in to kill people and to blow people up
and all the sorts of stuff it's the same problem
they're fighting the problem externally when really the devil is
inside of you you are the devil so when are
you going to wake up to that and take control
of the real problem I highly encourage you to study
the history of Muhammad and Islam and towards that end
what I would recommend for you is a Teaching Company
lecture series called Confucius Buddha Jesus and Muhammad that's title
go to Google type in the teaching company type in
Confucius Buddha Jesus Muhammad and this thing will pop up
you can buy this course from them it's not very
expensive it's a really good course it's this like 40
40 hour long lecture series covering these these four religious
leaders but specifically I want you to start and to
focus on Muhammad it's especially there's about 10 videos that
they have there which described the origin story of Muhammad
and how he founded Islam his trials and tribulations it's
really fascinating it's very eye-opening and it'll put all of
this into context in a way that will probably blow
your mind if you're like the typical Western person who
is just ignorant of this history it'll really help you
to understand but that's it for now I hope this
has changed your mind a little bit shifted your perspective
on how to view Islam please click like button for
me and come check out actualize that org I got
some exclusive content there for you to check out check
out my blog check out the life purpose scores check
out the book list check out the forum where you
can discuss these topics with like-minded people and lastly just
stay tuned with me because as actualized Audra continues we're
going to be building more bridges between different traditions religious
traditions mystical traditions but also secular traditions what we need
more and more of in today's world as we're becoming
more globalized and we can't stop the globalization from happening
any more than we can stop the internet from happening
or that we can stop driving cars from happening cars
will be driving themselves in the next 20 to 50
years and we all will be here we all need
to get along with each other we all need to
start to understand each other and that comes from building
bridges between these different traditions that's in a sense what
gets me the most excited is shooting topics where we
interconnect stuff that usually people never interconnect like we interconnect
mathematics and non-duality or logic and religion or science and
Islam you know you can interconnect all these things they
are connected everything is connected in some way and what
you'll find actually is that studying all these different religious
traditions it might seem like it's irrelevant it's unnecessary sure
you don't strictly need if you want to go get
it like if you want to go do the great
jihad and you're ready for it and you know you
don't want any distractions by all means go do it
but there's still something valuable that you'll miss from studying
all these different traditions all these different perspectives there's something
of value not everything not everything there's perfect there's a
lot of [ __ ] a lot of nonsense a
lot of corruption you have to learn how to pick
out the gold and leave behind the [ __ ]
you have to get good at that because if if
your criteria is that you're only gonna read a book
if it's pure gold and it's completely factually true and
there's no nonsense in it at all well you're gonna
rob yourself of a lot of a lot of learnings
and lessons it's rare to find a book where you
can agree with everything written in the book and it's
perfectly correct and true under that definition you shouldn't read
most science books alright people like the thing at all
but but science is the gold standard no it's not
it's full of so much dogma and fundamentalism and inaccuracies
that don't even get me started on that [ __
] alright you have to be very careful with how
you read scientific studies how you read scientific textbooks how
you interpret them how you think about the ramifications of
what that means for life and for society and for
government and for technology and for lots of other stuff
just like you have to do with reading spiritual books
you can't be literalist you have to learn how to
read between the lines think for yourself think outside the
box you have to be very creative and very open
you have to be fluid and fresh that's the essence
of spirituality its consciousness you have to be conscious if
you're doing spirituality or you're doing science or you're doing
anything else without consciousness you're gonna create a mess so
if you stick around with me I will help you
to draw more of those interconnections as we go along
you
