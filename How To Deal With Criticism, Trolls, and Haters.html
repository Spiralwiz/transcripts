hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about how to deal with
critics trolls and haters I've had my fair share of
experience being here on YouTube with critics trolls and haters
in the last few years so I think there's some
some ideas I can share with you here that can
help you with this issue I've been called everything from
Voldemort to Yuri the guy from command & Conquer and
everything in between so I'm pretty familiar with various slanderous
criticisms that one can get here's the point the point
basically with critics is the following is that life is
too short for taking critics seriously and you have a
life purpose to accomplish right right you have a life
purpose don't you right right right right right right a
life purpose you know what that is you have a
life purpose you have a a mission you have a
sense of meaningful work that you're doing you have some
sort of work project a business a career something that
you're kicking ass in you have to have that in
life if you don't have that in life you don't
have a life purpose you're not clear what it is
and you're not fully committed to it you're not living
your passion life what's going to happen is that critics
will run you down they'll get to you because here's
the bottom line about critics here's one key and I'm
going to give you a couple of key insights here
that's going to really change how you view critics but
here's the first one a critic is basically a crab
in the bucket have you heard of this before crabs
in the bucket so supposedly what they say I don't
know I've never done this but if you take a
bucket and you throw a bunch of crabs in it
the crabs will never be able to escape because even
as one crab is trying to climb out he can
climb out but the other crabs will pull him down
every time and so because of this phenomenon you can
have a bucket full of crabs and then they all
die in the end all together in that bucket when
they could have been able to escape now I don't
know how true that is but let's just go with
it let's just assume that's true so this is how
I want you to see a critic whenever someone is
criticizing you he is one of those crabs and now
the important thing for you to determine is are you
going to be one of those crabs that lets himself
get pulled down back into the bucket because that's a
choice you have a critic is ultimately a distraction a
distraction to your life purpose if you know what you
need to be doing in life if you have a
sense of trajectory and you've got that dream you're working
on you've got that dream career that dream business whatever
you're trying to do whatever impact you're trying to make
in the world that should be at the top of
your mind to the point where it eclipses everything else
especially critics and let me tell you if you're going
to be accomplishing a meaningful life purpose in your life
and you're going to be having an impact in the
world whether through starting a business or career or some
charity organization that you start or whatever you're gonna have
plenty of critics because as soon as you start rocking
the boat and you start making some splashes in the
water critics are everywhere but let me give you the
next key insight for how to deal with this so
here's something you got to really understand this realization and
it takes a little bit of thinking about this to
get this realization down but I'll help you here so
here's a realization you have to realize that an opinion
does not change anything about reality itself so you have
reality and then you have an opinion and these two
things are totally different this might seem kind of obvious
but let me show you how powerful this realization is
here with some examples so let's take a common case
let's say someone says that they don't like your work
or that your work is crap right common area where
we get criticism is with the work that we do
maybe you're an artist maybe I'm you're a musician maybe
you're a business person maybe you're launching sort of product
or a service and people don't like it for whatever
reasons ok so how do we use this realization well
let's say someone tells me that my work is [
__ ] ok at first I have this instant reaction
of like oh I got to defend myself and oh
now this maybe means that my work actually is [
__ ] and then see then this kind of puts
me into this kind of downward spiral of starting to
doubt myself and getting into this kind of depressive mode
and and all that that's why criticism is painful to
us is that we kind of think like well what
if there's something true about this criticism and then somehow
that now this changes things but see it changes nothing
really why is that if someone tells me that my
work is [ __ ] we've got two options either
my work is [ __ ] or it's not [
__ ] but whatever the case my work did not
change the truth did not change reality did not change
simply because someone told me that my work is [
__ ] now granted it might be the case that
my work actually is [ __ ] maybe all later
come to realize like oh man they were right my
work is bad but notice that that's an opinion too
that's my personal opinion if I start to believe that
and that's fine it might be a valid opinion but
I have a choice about what I choose to have
an opinion on and also notice that even when I
make the decision that my work is bad that still
did not change the work that was originally there so
let's say that I'm feeling great about my work then
all the sudden someone comes and says my work is
crap then I start to maybe doubt myself in sort
of think oh yeah maybe it is crap but look
the work itself didn't change that whole time through when
I was feeling great the work was the same when
someone told me it was crap their works to remain
the same and when I started to believe it was
crap it still remained the same so reality didn't change
this is a very powerful thing you got to start
to see how powerful this is because what you should
be doing as your self actualizing and you should be
learning to align yourself with reality and with truth truth
and reality are your saviors most of the neurotic problems
and emotional issues that we have all the dissatisfaction with
life that we have is not because there's something fundamentally
wrong with reality it's because of how we look at
reality that we have problems so we're we're facing that
right here let me give you another example so let's
say someone says that you're ugly or they criticize your
looks in some way maybe your hair your dress whatever
right a lot of people are very sensitive to personal
appearance criticisms so same thing think about this when someone
says that they hate your hair and it's crappy at
first as I call me and you hate my hair
my hair must be bad and I need to go
get a new haircut or something like this okay maybe
even your hair is bad but look your hair didn't
actually change by them telling you that nor did it
change by you starting to believe it either so you
have to separate what's real the hair is what it
is and then what people believe about and what you
believe about it two totally different things now of course
if you start to believe that it's bad you can
go get a haircut and change it if you want
alright but that's like an option that you have later
on the key here to not be reactive to criticism
is to understand that oh nothing changed I mean it
feels like when someone tells me something negative or bad
it feels like something changed about reality the trick is
to understand that nothing really did change another example let's
say someone says that you're stupid or that you hold
some sort of wrong belief or if you're an argument
then you're espousing a wrong argument so again did your
intelligence change because they told you that no did not
your IQ level change notes stay the same if you
hold a wrong point of view in an argument if
you hold a false belief let's say you hold the
belief that's factually false okay maybe you do if someone
tells you hey your belief is false maybe it is
but that doesn't change the fact that you held that
belief so right now you might feel bad because someone
tells you that hey there's something factually wrong in your
model of the world but if it's true that there's
something factually wrong in your model of the world then
it's true and it's always been true now you could
change that in the future but just because someone else
believes it or you will start to believe it doesn't
change it you see you have to open yourself up
to what what's fascial occur echt what's factually true reality
if you're wrong just be honest that you're wrong that's
fine there's nothing wrong with being wrong per se let's
give another example let's say someone accuses you doing some
sort of immoral or evil act let's say someone calls
you a liar or a cheat or a thief or
something like that and you're and you're innocent and it's
like well no I'm innocent I want to protect my
innocence and so you get all you know your panties
get in a twist because someone wrongly accused you of
lying or cheating or stealing okay and that you know
that's usually emotionally disturbing for us but again you'd have
to realize wait a minute did reality change because someone
called me a cheat or a thief or a liar
no didn't change even if I did cheat or steal
or lie well then that's what's true someone pointing it
out to me doesn't change it it's already been true
it was already true before it was pointed out to
me so if someone points it out to me nothing
changes you see let's say another example your parents hate
your lifestyle choices let's say you pick a career or
you pick a a major at school and your parents
really disagree with you and so they criticize you for
it maybe your dad or your mom criticized you for
it and then that makes you upset because now you're
kind of agitated you're doubtful okay realize that you chose
this career or you chose this major because you enjoyed
her because you had a passion for it or whatever
you had some reason for it because your mom criticizes
you for it doesn't change your passions doesn't change the
decision you made to go into this career into this
major right so just kind of separate that stuff out
very powerful in a nutshell what's so powerful about this
is that you start to realize when you make this
separation between opinions and truth is that opinions only have
power over you when you agree with them let me
repeat that again because this is very important opinions only
have power over you when you agree with them that's
a big thing to realize if you can truly realize
that and be conscious of that throughout your life you're
going to make yourself immune to criticism very powerful the
only way that you can really lose something when you're
being criticized is to take that criticism seriously enough to
slow yourself down in the hard work that you need
to be doing towards your life purpose so let's say
you're like a train and you're on track to go
somewhere far some are good you're pursuing your life purpose
you like a train on train tracks right and you're
going you've built up some momentum and then someone comes
by and stands on the road on the on the
tracks basically and tells you to stop hold on stop
the whole train now if you want you could stop
the train it's gonna slow you down a lot though
if every time there's someone by the tracks trying to
get you to slow down or to stop but that's
totally your choice because you're a freight train if you
want you could keep going and no one could stop
you they could park a car in front of you
just go right through it because you've got that much
momentum and how much power because in the end these
are canyons are like ghosts right it's kind of like
a ghost was on the train tracks you just kind
of like plow right through it and wouldn't even dent
the Train that's the case here except if you start
to believe that these ghosts are real and they're really
solid they can derail your whole train then what's going
to happen is every time you meet a ghost you're
going to stop you're going to pull over you can
start the whole the whole train and then you're going
to stay there right you're gonna stay there that ghost
could haunt you for four years and guess what you're
not going to be working towards your life purpose during
this whole time and this is the case of the
crab letting himself get dragged back into the bucket this
case right here so what's the lesson from this well
the lesson is that you need to be very confident
and clear with yourself about your own values and goals
and dreams in life and your life purpose this is
vital this is vital the reason that most people cannot
follow this advice that I'm giving here is because there's
so unclear they have no sense of purpose they have
no clarity about their values they have no real dreams
or ambitious they're going for so basically because of this
it's like you know there's their train is extremely weak
it's not going anywhere it's already kind of standing still
so when the train is standing still it's very easy
for to get infested with rats and worms and and
ghosts haunted by ghosts and all this kind of stuff
right because it's just standing there's like a haunted train
so the key here is that you're not that person
and if you are right now that's okay admit that
that's just what's true and you can change that though
you can really change that in fact I have a
whole course my life purpose course which deals with how
to find a life purpose how to find your true
values how to set proper goals how to really find
your passions in life I created that course because it's
I think it's it's one of the most important missing
pieces that most people don't have and I spend a
lot of time personally in my life figuring that out
for myself because I saw how important it was right
I saw these dynamics and I told myself it's worth
spending a few years really finding my life purpose and
it's really paid off now at this point you might
have a little Jack you might say something like well
okay leo I kind of get weird going with this
kind of makes sense you know opinions are just opinions
but isn't it also the case that opinions a little
bit more than just opinions what about for example when
my boss uh has an opinion of me you know
he's my boss I depend on him for my salary
you know he has a lot of say on my
on my life so don't I need to garner good
opinions with him isn't that important isn't my boss's opinion
more than just an opinion because he holds the purse
strings so I need to make sure he likes me
so in this case it's kind of like I can't
just ignore him it's not just like a ghost it's
something more serious yeah that could be the case you
could corner yourself in life put yourself in such a
precarious situation in life that your whole life will hinge
and your fulfillment and your your success in life will
hinge on the opinion of one individual person and then
what you'll be doing is you'll be playing this game
where you have to bend over backwards and jump through
hoops for that person and that person will like it
because people like having a sense of power over other
people or maybe for example it's not your boss but
maybe there's some important person like at a networking event
you need to go kiss someone's ass at a networking
event because that person's promised promising you a prospect of
a great job and you want that job so it's
likely oh I need to go impress this person and
I need to you know get a favorable opinion from
him otherwise I'm not going to get my good job
and that might very well be true here's what I'll
tell you about this stop expecting freebies from people the
reason you have this problem is because actually what you've
done is you haven't taken full responsibility for your life
and for your own success you've been kind of a
victim and you've been using other people as crutches and
you've been expecting freebies from people like oh yeah that
person supposed to set me up with some money and
this person here is supposed to set me up with
my girlfriend and this person they're supposed to do a
favor for me and so you've got hundreds of people
around you who all are like occupying these critical positions
in your life and this makes you extremely dependent on
and so what this means is that you're putting yourself
into a really tight spot you're basically making yourself dependent
on opinions when you don't need to be and that's
probably because you've been lazy because you didn't really want
to take responsibility for yourself to go out there and
do all this stuff yourself which you could have done
you know it's kind of comfortable to lean on somebody
here and there so what do you do about this
well you have to start to restructure your life a
little bit you need to take responsibility for the results
and the success you want to get in your life
create your own success you don't want to outsource success
that's something that you should be doing focus your efforts
not on schmoozing with people and making a lot of
fancy high-powered connections to get yourself a bunch of freebies
um that's a that's a real unfulfilling way to go
through life instead focus on self reliance on independence focus
on creating massive value for the world through your life
purpose make yourself independent that way then you're not going
to be really reliant on all these opinions of other
people I mean if you want to really create a
disastrous situation for yourself then put yourself in a position
that a lot of like women will put themselves in
for example uh like a stay-at-home mom who's had a
couple of kids and then she stays at home and
she doesn't really go get a new job she doesn't
reinter the workforce because she's kind of just hoping that
the husband will provide for her now and she's kind
of got comfortable that position but now the husband is
the only one who brings in the money and maybe
the husbands are like a little bit abusive like verbally
abusive emotionally abusive and she just has to put up
with it she has to put up with it and
you know he holds the purse strings because he gets
the paycheck the money's all in his name in his
bank account and it's like the wife has nothing and
he has everything and so now she's really in this
position of like master/slave she's a slave he's the master
right he has the power in this position and what
happened here is that she gave her power away she
didn't have to do that and now she's really painted
herself into a corner because now she needs to curry
favor with him all the time if he now has
a negative opinion of her when he comes home from
work she's going to really be upset about it it's
going to really bother her and now this opinion is
more than just a ghost now it's a lot more
serious because now it very might be the case that
you know if you piss if she pisses off this
some this guy then he won't give her the money
if she was hoping for or he won't you know
give her something else that she was hoping for or
he might exist exert some kind of other external pressure
on her to get her to comply so yeah you
got to be careful about not setting up those kind
of situations this means restructuring your life strategically where necessary
thinking down the road and eliminating these kind of dependencies
doesn't mean you have to be neurotic and completely independent
of everybody with this you can have dependencies in your
life just you know make sure the core dependencies are
handled by you especially stuff like your paycheck your money
right don't be relying on the people to be your
sugar daddies and don't be relying on other people to
make sure that you have work for example if your
boss if the opinion of your boss is the sole
thing that keeps you employed and if your boss ever
stops loving you then all of a sudden your job
is going to be cut if that's how you're earning
a living in your in that situation you got to
sort of change that situation that's a very dangerous situation
to be in you're basically sticking your head under a
gun and you're hoping the other person doesn't pull a
trigger and eventually those triggers usually get pulled if they
don't get triggered just by accident so I have a
little exercise for you here get a piece paper get
a pen and write down the following statement if I
took more responsibility for creating what I want I would
restructure my life as follows so write down this statement
I'm going to repeat it again I took more responsibility
for creating what I want I would restructure my life
as follows and then create a list of five maybe
10 maybe 20 restructures to your life that you could
make so that you are more in control and you're
let less reliant on opinions of other people so for
example if you know if if your boss has you
in a bind and you really feel like you can't
hold down your job unless he loves you then maybe
what you got to do is you say you know
what screw this I don't need this you know I
don't need to be someone's little [ __ ] let
me go find a job where I have a boss
that respects me let me go find a job where
um even if my boss disagrees with me or doesn't
like me for a certain while you know I don't
get fired just because of that that might be one
restructure that you come up with but think deeper think
about not just your career but think about friendships think
about social connections think about your relationships and all that
stuff all right so that's your exercise there but let
me continue because I have a few more important signs
for you here's the next key insight people are critical
because they procrastinate and because they fear their own greatness
and because they fear hardwork key insight the reason that
there are trolls in the world it's it's subtle it's
not obvious at first why there are trolls it looks
on the surface like wow people are just criticizing legitimate
grievances that's not what's really happening what's really happening when
I see a troll is I see someone who has
no life purpose or if they do then they're totally
off track with that life purpose and really what they're
doing is they're doing the easy thing they're criticizing someone
else it's easy to criticize but see when they criticize
what they're actually doing is they're feeding it to their
lower self and they're using that as a form of
procrastination it's very subtle and very sneaky self-deceptive procrastination because
when we procrastinate in our usual way our mind says
all your procrastinating time to stop but when you become
a troll you become a procrastinator without knowing that you're
a procrastinator and that's what all criticism basically boils down
to is that these people who are criticizing you whether
it's your parents or your boss or your wife or
your husband or whoever if they're expending more than just
a few seconds telling you something is wrong if they're
actually putting in motion is that criticism the way a
hater or troll would they're just they're robbing themselves basically
of their own greatness they don't know what their own
greatness is they don't know how to pursue their own
greatness they don't want to go do hard work towards
a life purpose they don't want to go focus the
way that you're trying to focus so they just engage
in it's kind of guilty pleasure of the lower self
it's almost like binge eating on ice cream or on
potato chips it's good that kind of thing you know
they're stuck in that and then that's why a troll
becomes a troll because you know first he starts as
a critic and then you know it gets worse and
worse and worse and worse and the more he procrastinates
with that then the more series of a troll becomes
until you see these kind of people like on the
internet you know or on YouTube these kind of chronic
trolls which just all they do is they just watch
videos and they just leave nasty mean comments about how
everything is wrong the world is screwed up society is
screwed up and everything is wrong everyone is wrong except
them it's not a coincidence that their ego is doing
that right there's something really deep going on there so
how can you use this well you can actually use
this as a reminder of how to improve yourself and
keep yourself on the narrow road so every time you
see a troll out there somewhere just remind yourself like
oh yeah that could be me in fact where am
i acting like a troll Who am I criticizing in
some other aspect of my life how am i procrastinating
on my life purpose by being a troll maybe not
in the same way that this guy is maybe I'm
not so critical at my job but maybe I'm critical
with my with my girlfriend or my boyfriend or maybe
I'm I'm a troll to my children and I nag
them all the time why do I nag my children
oh it's because I'm too big of a [ __
] to actually go and work on my own greatness
so that's a very good reminder because you're gonna forget
this is something that's very unconscious these dynamics are very
unconscious because the fact is that pursuing your life purpose
is very challenging it's scary it demands everything of you
to be able to do it successfully and it's so
much harder to do something constructively than to do something
destructive just like criticism especially criticism not only is it
destructive but it's it's it's it's so lazy it's like
you get to just sit back and get a talk
[ __ ] talk [ __ ] you don't you
have to be responsible for creating results you don't to
get off your ass you have to do anything all
you have to do is you just have to do
that that monkey chatter that- monkey chatter and your mind
you just have to say yes to it that's the
easiest thing in the world and the hardest thing in
the world is to control that monkey chatter and to
turn it from negative to positive and then to apply
it towards some sort of useful purposes in life and
then to shape and improve the entire world with that
drive that's the hardest thing the easiest thing is to
sit back and criticize so that's it in a nutshell
now before I let you go I need to give
you a couple of important warnings here so warning number
one is this is not to be used as an
excuse to reject feedback so I'm not telling you here
that now you don't have to think about feedback feedback
is important you need to distinguish being feedback and between
criticism constructive criticism is otherwise known as feedback feedback is
very important and you're going to fail without it so
for example if let's say you have a business and
you launch a product and then some client of yours
sends you an email saying something like your product is
[ __ ] now what is that is that criticism
is that feedback well the way it which it was
said your product is [ __ ] that tells you
that that part of it is criticism but that same
exact email that same exact sentence also might have some
valid feedback maybe it is the case that this customer
is legitimately disappointed by some aspect of the product that
you launched maybe there could be something improved about your
product in the future now this customer might have said
it in a very crass way because he doesn't know
any better but you still need to be able to
distinguish between feedback and criticism likewise for example if your
parents are telling you the hey you're doing something wrong
you know you made some bad lifestyle choices you chose
a bad major bad career it's very easy to say
well they're just being trolls and critics I'll just ignore
them and I'll just do exactly what I want to
do no that's not what I told you what I
told you is ignore the troll part but it might
be the case that they actually have some legitimate advice
or feedback that they're offering you maybe it's some feedback
that you don't want to hear maybe you did choose
the wrong career choice maybe they have your best interest
at heart maybe they just don't know how to communicate
it you need to be able to take that kind
of feedback right and of course of course if you're
sitting there at work and your boss comes to you
and you guys are working on some pilot project you're
collaborating and he tells you hey you know this change
you made yesterday it's not going to work for our
clients you know they need these kinds of changes made
so go ahead and change what you did before now
you might listen to what I said you might say
well oh so that my bosses opinions you know it's
all [ __ ] it doesn't matter I'll just keep
doing what I wanted to know that's not what I
told you your boss in this case is probably offering
you some valid feedback so you need to take that
into account right there is a difference there is a
difference opening up yourself to feedback that requires you to
actually summon courage that's part of your mission of becoming
great in life is taking in valuable feedback and there's
no real paradox or contradiction here it's just a distinction
you have to make it means that you have to
up the black-and-white thinking and do a little more grayscale
thinking and that's fine that's what's necessary second warning is
this is not an excuse to be a callous [
__ ] so you might think some like well okay
leo you know so I verbally abused my wife and
every time she you know I come home and I
verbally abused her and then now she's critical of me
for verbally abusing her all the time I mean she's
just a troll right I don't need to listen to
[ __ ] criticisms no that's not what I'm telling
you if you're verbally abusive to your wife you're being
callous [ __ ] and so she might be giving
you some valid feedback there about how your behavior needs
to change and how you could grow and how you
could be a better husband that sort of thing so
this is not an excuse to be a callous [
__ ] this is not an excuse to step on
people and to do it you get istic 'el and
selfish things without concerning how you're impacting your environment it's
important that you have some awareness about that and then
the third warning is that this is not an excuse
to be dogmatic so you might say something like well
okay so leo you're telling me to ignore all the
other perspectives in life so you know I have my
I have my faith I have my religion I have
my beliefs I have my convictions and I my political
party and I believe in all this stuff and I'm
just gonna like cling to it even more now and
entrench myself you gave me permission to entrench myself in
my beliefs now too you know [ __ ] everybody
else and [ __ ] all the other perspectives in
life no that's not what I'm telling you I'm kind
of telling actually the exact opposite you need to be
going around and looking at the other perspectives taking in
all the other feedback studying and learning stuff that you
otherwise would be resistant to learn because of your close-minded
ego not taking criticism does not mean that you entrench
yourself in your dogmas so be careful about that as
well all right so that's basically it remember focus on
what's real focus on the truth and also focus on
your creative mission in life focus on your life purpose
speaking of which if you're not sure what your life
purpose is and you've been scratching your head this whole
time as I was talking about it then I think
it would really benefit you to go check out my
ultimate life purpose course I worked really hard on it
it will really set you on the right direction in
life you'll find out your values you'll find out your
top passions you'll find out a lot of practical concepts
that you need to know to start to go and
actually carry that out in your life and as you
put that piece of the puzzle into place and you
combine it with a lot of the insights I gave
you here about criticism you will make yourself immune to
criticism and that will be a huge relief for you
a lot of people you know we we waste most
of our day worrying about what other people think of
us and how they're criticizing us and just like it's
such an unfulfilling way to go through life think about
the opposite think about being impervious to criticism open to
feedback open-minded exploring life exploring different points of view and

your life takes on a charge and an excitement that
probably missing otherwise when you find your life purpose and
then you you get an involve with self helping start
reading books and you start taking some seminars and you
watch more of my videos or other people's videos that's
when you're like it's exciting that's when you're growing one
of the greatest most rewarding experiences life is just growth
and most people lack this because once they get out

stop growing they stop learning and most importantly they're not
learning the practical things they really need to know to
master life and that's what I'm here to help you

big difference in the world and that's going to be
