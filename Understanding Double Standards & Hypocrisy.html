[Music] double standards and hypocrisy that's the topic of the
day this is a powerful and sneaky self-deception mechanism which
i have touched upon in my three-part series called self-deception
part one part two part three i briefly mentioned double
standards and now we're going to go into some depth
on it here basically the way it works like this
the less conscious one is the lower one's stage of
ego development is the more selfish one is the more
biased one is the more double standards one holds the
more of a hypocrite one is so there's a deep
connection between hypocrisy and consciousness or stages of ego development
for more on stages of ego development go check out
my three-part series called the nine stages of ego development
where i explain the susan cook greuter model very powerful
model for ego development which basically shows you all the
stages that you'll be going through along this self-actualization journey
it gives you a really great roadmap so that you
know what to expect but one of the things that
i like to do is just i like to look
at the features of highly developed minds what does that
entail and also the features of less developed selfish minds
and what that looks like and so double standards is
one of these features which is why religious fundamentalists are
some of the biggest hypocrites of all time have you
noticed this this is not an accident have you ever
wondered like why are the most moral people the people
who who cloak themselves in morality and speak the most
fervently about morality why are they some of the biggest
hypocrites the hypocrisy of religious fundamentalists is legendary to a
comical degree why is that well we'll be explaining that
basically it all has to do with your level of
development but see the hypocrisy of religion that's the easy
case all of us pretty much know about that although
actually half the world basically doesn't half the world are
religious fundamentalists pretty much that's their level of development and
um they're complete hypocrites and they hold many many double
standards and it's really those people who make religion look
so bad and so unpalatable to those who are a
little bit more developed who are let's say a spoiler
dynamic stage orange and above who are more rational scientifically
minded more skeptical to those people basically the lower half
of mankind makes religion look like uh like some sort
of farce which it is in the way that they
practice it but then the mistake that is made is
like well then you get the idea that all religion
is like that and all spirituality is like that and
of course that's not the case and we've talked about
that elsewhere so basically double standards are selfishness itself what
does it mean to be selfish it's to have double
standards it's to have one set of standards that you
apply to yourself and your tribe and then a totally
different set of standards that you apply to others the
ego mind always wants to make exceptions and excuses for
itself as part of its self bias i've talked a
lot about bias and self bias go check out my
episodes on bias understanding bias and i have another one
called self bias we'll be covering a lot of that
similar material here but from a different perspective so this
episode will dovetail with those two these are very important
episodes really what we're talking about here is bias when
we're talking about double standards in order to develop yourself
to high levels you must make a commitment to truth
and to intellectual honesty which means you have to hold
yourself to the same standards as you hold others you
have to hold your tribe and your group to the
same standards that you hold other tribes and other groups
and you have to hold your your own group and
yourself to the same standards as you do your opponents
and your enemies that's critical a lot of people don't
understand this here's the definition of hypocrisy from the dictionary
quote the practice of claiming to have moral standards or
beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform the
practice of engaging in the same behavior or activity for
which one criticizes another or the practice of claiming to
have moral standards and a feigning to be what one
is not end quote so what i want you to
see about morality is that morality and all notions of
fairness and equality are commonly weaponized for the purposes of
survival to get a leg up on others in society
that's a lot of what morality is doing and this
is a corruption and a misuse of morality so if
you want to practice true morality then you have to
get rid of all your double standards and all your
biases and that's a lot harder to do than most
of us realize most of us don't even understand how
many double standards we hold these double standards are so
sneaky and subtle sometimes they're kind of crude and gross
but a lot of times they're subtle you probably know
the gross ones you've probably encountered those but what you
haven't understood yet is how many subtle double standards you
hold i want to point some of these out to
you so let's go through a list of examples of
double standards this will be a large list some of
these are going to be obvious some of these are
going to be more subtle a warning as i'm going
through this beware of your own biases because the trick
with pointing out a double standard is that a lot
of times people are so deeply entrenched in their double
standards and biases that they don't even want to admit
that this is a bias or double standard that they
have and then the mind goes into making rationalizations and
excuses so as i point some of these out to
you beware be mindful that you may get triggered and
that your defense mechanisms may get set off so your
job is to not get triggered as i talk about
these and to not accuse me of bias for talking
about your biases let's see that's another common defense mechanism
as soon as i bring up a double standard the
mind automatically goes into a sort of an attack mode
a defense mode counter attack mode maybe you might say
it can start to do all sorts of what about
isms and justifications rationalizations stuff like that so just be
aware of all that so here's a long list i've
been thinking about this list for for months compiling this
list in no particular order so here we go example
number one is psychedelics are dangerous and harmful that's what
society tells us but then what about alcohol what about
tobacco alcohol is actually one of the most deadly drugs
there is and most people don't even consider alcohol to
be a drug what kind of double standard is this
alcohol is way more socially dangerous and damaging than psychedelics
and yet the way that psychedelics are treated and demonized
and alcohol doesn't have any spiritual real you know spiritual
applications whereas i mean it's mostly just for entertainment and
partying and letting loose but psychedelics can be used for
partying and entertainment but then they also have incredible profound
spiritual applications and yet they're demonized more than alcohol so
that's one double standard we find in our current society
another one related to psychedelics is the way that many
spiritual teachers actually uh hold and talk about psychedelics and
this has been really disappointing to me because you would
expect spiritual teachers and gurus you know to be more
conscious and aware more developed and therefore to have less
biases and less double standards but you'd be shocked at
how many double standards these gurus hold for example a
guru can can talk with a straight face about how
psychedelics do not produce genuine enlightenment or genuine permanent awakenings
and and yet when you apply that same standard to
their own workshops retreats books videos do those produce permanent
awakenings and enlightenments no of course not see how come
if if you go to a 10 day vipassana retreat
and you do that you don't go complaining to your
guru like i haven't had my permanent awakening your guru
what will your guru tell you your girl will say
well that's because it takes years and decades of these
apostate retreats to have your you know your radical awakenings
so be patient and keep doing it and that's what
students do and they do it for 10 20 years
and they still don't awaken and yet they keep doing
it but if you go to a guru and talk
about a psychedelic and then the girls say oh well
yeah you took it once and what did it do
for you did it make you enlightened did it make
you all spiritual and wise well maybe it didn't in
this one trip but you know one session of meditation
one meditation retreat is also not going to do much
for you so you got to be comparing apples to
apples here you see this is a gross double standard
if you took as many psychedelics as many hours as
you meditated as your buddhist for example guru suggests that
you meditate you know like for 10 years let's say
one hour a day every day for 10 years that
would be a typical regimen that your buddhist guru might
suggest for you maybe even longer if you did psychedelics
for that long [Laughter] uh where would you be with
your spiritual development see but the guru doesn't think of
it that way the guru says like oh well you
take your psychedelic once yeah but if you meditate for
an hour once what is meditating for an hour once
is gonna do anything for you of course moving on
we have some scientific ones i like to criticize science
and point out the double standards of science there's some
really gross double standards within science and see this is
tricky because uh it's easy to see the double standards
in religion a lot of times it's a lot harder
to admit them within science although they exist almost as
much for example science criticizes religion for all of its
contradictions and getting things wrong and making mistakes you know
factual errors in the bible and so forth and yet
have you noticed that no amount of scientific mistakes of
which there are thousands the history of science has riddled
with thousands of mistakes that scientists have made but yet
why is it that not a single uh that not
none of these mistakes ever are capable of invalidating the
scientific method because he if if an atheist or a
skeptic or rationalist or a scientist finds one single contradiction
in the bible then they say well to hell with
the bible it can't be true that's the standard that
they hold religion to but if you hold science to
that same standard then you should throw out all of
science given how many mistakes science has made how can
you ever be so naive as to trust scientific conclusions
and yet you do and yet no matter how many
mistakes science makes you still trust in science why is
that admit that gross double standard to yourself here's another
one from science science demands proof for everything and yet
where is the proof that everything true in the universe
can be found using the scientific method has that ever
been proven of course not then why do you assume
that that's true why do you take that as a
given why do you take that as scientific we've talked
a lot about these scientific issues in a lot more
depth in my series three-part series called deconstructing the myth
of science part one part two part three so if
you're interested in more detail about that because i won't
go into it here go check out that series i've
talked about science a lot here's another one from science
science criticized religion when religion is defended on utilitarian grounds
and yet when you corner a scientist on this issue
of truth whether science is really true or not the
scientists when backed into this corner will justify science and
defense science based on utilitarian grounds so what does this
mean this means you know like if you're arguing with
a religious person and you know you back him into
a corner with your arguments uh eventually the religious person
might say well yeah you know maybe religion isn't all
you know technically true and accurate maybe it's not really
objective but the impact it has on my life you
know it makes me a moral person it makes me
a better person all these positive impacts that it has
on my life you know like it's it's practical religion
isn't just theory it's you know it's practical it's the
way that i interact with people the way i take
care of my children the way i think about my
enemies and how i regard them it's all this kind
of stuff and that's practical that that makes me feel
good that improves my the quality of my life therefore
we shouldn't throw out religion see that's the kind of
argument that a religious person would make when backed into
a corner now as an atheist or a scientific person
you'd say well but but what about the truth of
the matter you know like who cares whether it's practical
or whether it's useful to you just because it makes
you feel good doesn't mean that it's true and so
you're kind of shifting the goal posts here when backed
into a corner because really the issue was about the
truth of whether you know whether god exists we want
that like we want to know if that's true we
don't care how you feel about how it makes you
feel or if it makes you a better person we
want to know if that's actually true well when you're
arguing with a scientist the same exact situation arises but
the scientists take a blind eye to it because you
take an atheist or a scientist and then you start
to question them about the truth of science and you
can question them deeply enough to eventually to the point
where you back them into a corner and they will
be forced to admit that well leo no but you
know science technically speaking science doesn't say anything about what's
actually true science is just purely utilitarian pragmatic the reason
science is valuable is because it can land a man
on the moon and because it can build a computer
not because it's true in any metaphysical sense so even
if science is not metaphysically true it's still the best
thing we've got because it's so useful for making our
lives more comfortable essentially that's your defense of science you
see but when you do this you're employing the exact
same defense as a religious person and you're skirting this
issue of truth because you can't really defend that issue
of truth if questioned deeply enough but see when a
scientific person or an atheist does this that's considered okay
it's considered okay to justify signs on utilitarian grounds but
it's never going to be acceptable to justify religion on
utilitarian grounds that's a gross double standard become aware of
that the next one is that science criticizes religion for
appeals to authority and yet most of science hinges on
appeals to authority when you argue with scientifically minded people
and atheists and so forth most of these arguments devolve
into appeals to authority they make appeals to authority you
know einstein said this and quantum mechanics says that and
my physics professor said this and this you know big
name professor and intellectual said that these are all appeals
to authority and yet these appeals to authority are considered
okay whereas the religious appeals to authority are not considered
okay another one is signs criticize religion for being circular
but all the fundamental properties of science are also circular
so for example a scientist might criticize religious person for
saying something like well i believe in the bible because
the bible is the word of god and how do
i know that the bible is the word of god
because the bible says so well that's circular reasoning but
if you take a look at all the fundamental properties
of science you know what is energy what is matter
what is mass what is velocity what is distance what
is time all of these are circularly interdefined in terms
of themselves science does not give you any kind of
ground for any of these fundamental properties it doesn't tell
you what anything is it doesn't tell you what energy
is what matter is what time is what distance is
what um you know what charge is none of these
are properly defined or grounded anything it's just an endless
circle you know energy is defined in terms of mass
and acceleration and distance and time and then time is
defined in terms of distances and velocities and then you
know energy is going to be defined in terms of
something else and it's all defined it's just pointers pointing
around to pointers it's a game of telephone and yet
that's perfectly acceptable within science it's just excused away another
one science ridicules the notion of god on the grounds
that it's a magical thing that cannot be explained and
has no cause and yet the universe as a whole
or the big bang is exactly in that same position
so somehow it's okay for a scientist to say that
the entire universe came out of nowhere for no reason
whatsoever 14 billion years ago somehow that's okay but to
say that the entire universe came from god that's not
okay it's pretty ridiculous another one scientists talk about being
rational and objective like that's their ideal you know treat
everything objectively and yet these scientists themselves don't behave objectively
in their own life for example according to science there's
no reason why there's anything wrong with your daughter being
raped according to science because according to science there's no
moral judgment between pain versus not pain between suffering and
happiness science doesn't make any claims about these things there's
no scientific proof or reason for why suffering is wrong
or bad and yet when this scientist behaves and goes
about living his life he's completely consumed by survival and
the avoidance of suffering and pain and he doesn't treat
these things as equivalent to pleasure and other things he
treats them as bad and wrong and evil and his
whole emotional system reacts in that way which is a
complete double standard so how are you being objective for
example as a scientist why do you value your life
above the lives of poor hungry children in africa now
if you were a true scientist if you were truly
rational objective you would not value your life any higher
than theirs but you do because actually you're very biased
you're scared you're run by fear and survival you have
sexual cravings and all these sorts of things you know
as a scientist why would you want to have sex
with a hot woman versus you know a fat ugly
woman as a scientist if you're a male scientist it
shouldn't matter to you if you were truly scientific but
you're not see and in your mind you create this
separation between well i'm doing my science when i'm in
the laboratory then when i walk out of the laboratory
i'm just a normal human yeah uh but you see
your humanity and your science can't be so cleanly separated
as you would like it to be how about the
double standard of positivism positivism says that the only things
that should be admissible within science are strictly empirical truths
no metaphysical mumbo jumbo no philosophy no abstractions just strict
objective facts that's what's true but then what is the
status of positivism itself of that position positive positivism itself
the position that only strictly empirical truths should be admissible
within science that itself is not a strictly empirical truth
how do you know that's true that's not an objective
fact you find out in the world that's something that's
an abstraction it's a philosophical scheme that you have invented
see so you make an exception for your philosophical schemes
and your metaphysics but you denounce all other metaphysical and
epistemic schemes how come see that's a double standard how
about with rationality rationalists love to talk about facts over
feelings yet these very so-called rational people they get very
emotional and triggered by irrationality by religious fundamentalism by new
age people look at some of these debates on youtube
by so-called rationalist people with religious people they get very
very triggered they get very emotional they act in very
irrational ways and yet they claim to be rational and
to be holding facts over feelings when in fact their
entire rationality is grounded in feelings not facts how about
with skeptics skeptics like to take the attitude that everything
should be doubted but if everything should be doubted what
about your skepticism why don't we doubt that except most
skeptics aren't really serious they hold a double standard and
so they excuse their own skepticism from their skepticism and
therefore they never end up doubting their skepticism and then
they get stuck in this kind of shallow false skepticism
which i've talked about in my episode called false versus
true skepticism how about this one with terrorism there's a
lot of double standards when it comes to terrorism first
of all the way that label is used a lot
of times especially like white americans will only use the
word terrorist for a brown muslim or a foreigner they
won't apply that label to a white person who commits
a terrorist attack like a domestic terrorist they don't consider
those people true terrorists see that's a double standard because
really terrorism just means somebody executing a violent attack towards
some sort of political agenda that's really all terrorism is
it has nothing to do with your race or your
religion but people hold a lot of double standards about
that another one you know double standard when it comes
to terrorism is people get very outraged when a few
thousand people die in a terrorist attack you know oh
my god we have to spend trillions of dollars and
decades chasing down these terrorists and preventing this from ever
happening again but then when a few thousand people every
year die from lack of health care nobody raises an
eyebrow over this this is a gross double standard and
this is in fact the biggest problem with the way
that america especially treats terrorism is you know um we
get so outraged and emotional over terrorist attacks and then
we let thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people
die from lack of resources invested into education into drug
rehabilitation into proper prisons and prison reform into health care
and other sorts of safety nets people die from poverty
and disease and all this stuff could could have easily
been fixed you know if we took the couple of
trillion dollars that we invested into the war in iraq
and afghanistan and we threw that into education health care
poverty drug rehab clinics improvement of prisons rehabilitation centers and
so forth we could have saved like probably a million
lives over a period of 10 20 years but we
were so emotionally triggered by 911 which was only like
3 000 deaths or so you know regrettable of course
horrific of course but just from covid in the last
couple of years we've lost like what hundreds of thousands
a million people from just from covid and that could
have easily been prevented if we just invested a little
bit more money into disease prevention pandemic prevention you know
the government had a whole center set up uh whole
programs for you know very rapid um you know contract
tracing and vaccine develop all this kind of stuff and
then this was defunded and it doesn't cost a lot
you know just for like 10 billion dollars is all
it costs to properly have you know preventative pandemic um
preparedness and yet we're so distracted chasing terrorists because of
3 000 people who died on 9 11 that we
completely take our eye off of what's really important if
what's really important is human suffering and death we want
to save lives and improve people's lives then our resources
should be allocated towards totally different areas than chasing down
terrorists uh and then the whole notion of what is
a terrorist is also very relative there's a lot of
double standards there you know one person's terrorist as they
say is another person's freedom fighter also americans for example
never consider their own military attacks as acts of terrorism
so when drone strike kills some civilian casualties in the
middle east to the middle easterners that can look like
a terrorist act it's really indistinguishable from a terrorist act
i mean what's the difference between a suicide bomber walking
into a cafe and blowing up uh you know 20
people versus a drone strike blowing up you know the
wrong building and blowing up the you know a family
of 20 innocent civilians and of course there are differences
there there's a different difference of intention and so forth
but ultimately to the people who are getting killed there's
not that much of a difference you know even if
even if you blow up a civilian building with good
intentions with a drone strike even if your intentions were
good um you're still basically committing an act of terror
on those people you're terrorizing people with those drones and
the civilian casualty rates on drones have been reported to
be as high as 90 percent i mean that's insane
if you think about it uh who knows what the
true number is really you're never going to know because
it's too embarrassing for the pentagon or the military to
release those numbers i mean they probably know or maybe
even they don't know because to them if they actually
knew it would probably be so horrific that they couldn't
even live with them so they couldn't sleep with you
know at night if they knew those numbers so maybe
even they don't know i don't know who really knows
what the numbers are but it's been estimated to be
as bad as 90 civilian casualties from drone strikes that's
pretty awful so who are the real terrorists here see
americans never apply the label terrorism to themselves that's a
gross double standard if we were truly honest intellectually we
would call some of our own terrorists but we don't
because it's too politically incorrect here's another double standard people
love to criticize leaders and politicians for their sexual indiscretions
and scandals but what about your sexual indiscretions and scandals
what about the sexual manipulations that you engage in people
just completely excuse those it's like when a politician loves
sex that's somehow awful and despicable and immoral and yet
we all love sex we all manipulate to get sex
how about the double standard of post-modernism this is called
the performative contradiction so post-modernism insists that all value systems
are relative and therefore none should be privileged over any
other you know one culture is no better than another
culture one set of values is no better than other
set of values and yet then post-modernism likes to impose
itself as sort of the the pinnacle of all value
systems and then it tries to impose relative relativity onto
everybody else which is the performative contradiction that's a double
standard because see if if postmodernism was truly consistent then
it would allow other cultures and peoples who do not
believe in postmodernism their own worldview that is not postmodernist
but that's not usually what postmodernists um that's not usually
how they behave usually post-modernism comes with the sort of
uh a normative expectation that everyone's going to adopt post-modernism
and agree with the truth of post-modernism but the whole
point of post-modernism is that not everybody's going to agree
with the truth of post-modernism because people have their own
truths that's basically what post-modernism says so if i have
my own truth then why can't my truth negate post-modernism
the c-post monitors like that another example is well really
it's a whole class of examples honestly there's no better
source of examples for double standards than right wing media
fox news oan breitbart uh youtubers like ben shapiro stephen
crowder you know like turning points usa charlie kirk the
whole maga movement uh jordan peterson all of this this
this right-wing media is just filled just it's rife with
so many double standards i mean it's it's comical and
it's amazing that these guys don't see their own double
standards because they really believe when they're criticizing the left
or so forth they really believe that you know they're
being intellectually honest they're really not the right wing is
objectively guilty of more bias than hypocrisy than the left
that now be careful here that doesn't mean that the
left is free of double standards the left certainly has
double standards progressives have double standards i'll be pointing some
of those out to you as we keep going but
just if you're honest if you inspect the whole field
on both sides if you're honest you'll see that there's
objectively more double standards and hypocrisy on the right and
that's one of the reasons why i've claimed in the
past and i continue to claim that the right on
the whole is less psychologically developed less morally developed less
spiritually developed than the left now when right-wingers hear that
of course they accuse me of being biased and me
having double standards but um it just is what it
is i don't know how else to convince you of
this i mean i can give you a lot of
examples of of right-wing double standards there's so many of
them for example with jordan peterson jordan peterson complains about
the dangers of marxism and communism he holds this is
one of the greatest dangers right now in modern times
is you know the left spiral dynamic stage green going
overboard and then going you know and committing the atrocities
of communism all over again that's like one of his
greatest fears and he talks about that a lot and
yet the reality over the last few years with the
maga movement is that nationalists neo-nazis and ultra right wingers
were nearly able to pull off a coup of the
united states government and trump and all of his allies
and supporters of which jordan peters peterson is basically one
of them he said he would vote for trump over
hillary given that given that uh and everything we we
know about the coup that the trump administration has you
know tried to pull off like that would have been
the an interruption in democracy the united states has had
250 years pretty much you know of a steady continuation
of democracy that would be the first interruption in 200
years of democracy that's the guy that jordan peterson would
vote for and i don't know i don't know if
he would vote for him again knowing everything he knows
now would he vote for him again i'm sort of
tempted to say he probably would he would find some
excuses for why you know behind his evil or something
but but considering considering this all of the complaining that
jordan peterson does about marxism and communism when the true
honest threat is the coup that actually happened right you
could come up with fantasies about how uh college kids
are gonna become socialists and gonna turn into the us
into some sort of soviet um uh style government you
know a decade from now you can have fantasies about
that kind of danger and maybe there's a small chance
of that but the reality the real danger is that
the right wing in this country having run amok with
the maga movement who peterson would have voted for um
and trump himself tried to stage a coup and are
still in the process of undermining vote counting uh undermining
the integrity of of elections getting people to doubt in
the integrity this is directly corroding democracy if anything is
going to destroy american government realistically it's not going to
be some group of college kid marxists or trans people
these people have no power but the ultra right wing
with you know led by trump and steve bannon and
the demagoguery that comes from that that is a realistic
danger that could truly end democracy and yet nothing from
jordan peterson on this now sure he'll he'll admit that
you know trump isn't so great and trump has his
problems he'll admit that but no no no it's not
that trump has problems that's not the issue here the
issue here is that he executed a [ __ ]
coup and almost ended 200 years of democracy that's not
like a little thing if jordan peterson was truly honest
with himself about his double standards he would realize that
the standard he places on the left for the dangers
of the left versus what he places on the right
are completely dishonest and completely out of balance skewed by
his perspective on reality meaning that he would have to
change his perspective on reality in order to correct that
balance which is exactly what he will not do of
course fox news is a great source of double standards
just gross ridiculous double standards compare fox news's coverage for
example of obama when he was in office you know
they were complaining that obama was dividing the country and
being racial he was racializing the politics in this country
i mean compared to what trump did why aren't they
complaining about trump dividing the country racializing the country the
amount of racial attacks on jewish people on black people
on asian americans skyrocketed under trump the amount of uh
neo-nazi activity has skyrocketed under trump these are well-documented objective
facts reported by the fbi other government agencies none of
this happened under obama if you were intellectually honest you
would actually admit that trump is the one who's dividing
the country and who's being racial they also criticized obama
for being undignified for wearing a tan suit for putting
mustard on his burger i mean compared to trump obama
is a [ __ ] saint in terms of dignity
morality family values i mean it's absurd trump is like
a serial cheater gotten divorced three times remarried three times
has children out of wedlock all those kinds of stuff
obama is a family man loyal family man no signs
of cheating sex scandals see if fox news was truly
honest and fair and balanced and didn't have double standards
then they would be criticizing trump over the stuff not
obama the tan suit fiasco is particularly amusing because actually
there's a video of ronald reagan wearing a tan suit
and ronald reagan you know fox news people love ronald
reagan he's like their hero so why didn't they criticize
ronald reagan for his tan suit but they criticized obama
for wearing a tan suit as if obama was the
first president to wear a [ __ ] tan suit
see just ridiculous double standards and this is why fox
news can't be taken seriously uh conservatives on states rights
issues also gross double standard so when it's an issue
like abortion you know they want to throw that to
states rights you know oh well states should have the
rights to decide for themselves uh but then a lot
of conservatives when the idea comes up like if we
ban abortion i mean like if we if we over
overturn roe v v wade and then we propose um
you know a law that will ban abortion at the
federal level a lot of conservatives will be for that
so they throw away states rights as soon as it's
convenient for them because they just want to ban abortion
everywhere so they don't really care about states rights they
just use that as an excuse gross double standard and
then um you know uh there are a lot of
other issues when it comes to states rights where conservatives
would object for example if we talk about legalizing all
drugs conservatives would usually be against that and then you
know a progressive might say well how about we do
states rights every state whichever states wants you know let's
say california wants to legalize heroin why can't they do
that you know states rights a conservative would say no
they don't have that right no maybe a few conservatives
would would go so you know libertarian might say well
yeah they do have that right but most conservatives would
not go that far they would not say that california
has the right to legalize heroin or psychedelics or whatever
but you believed in states rights why should heroin be
banned at the federal level why should we be banned
at the federal level why should psychedelics be banned at
the federal level if you truly believe in states rights
and there's a lot of other issues like that which
you know conservatives like to say they like states rights
but actually if their agenda is passed at a federal
level the they'll take it and they'll love it and
they won't raise any issue about states rights in the
end what you want is you want your laws passed
across the whole country you don't really care about states
rights you only care about it when you can use
it as a weapon to you know prevent the other
side's laws from being passed at the federal level another
one that conservatives are guilty of is the double standard
of complaining about welfare queens but then if a conservative
loses his job he gets unemployment and then he's going
to complain about his inadequate unemployment check and why is
my unemployment check so low but see when a conservative
is getting an unemployment check he doesn't consider himself a
welfare queen but like when a black person is getting
it or a non-conservative is getting it then all of
a sudden they're welfare queens and they're leeching off the
government but conservatives have no problem leeching off the government
when it benefits them they're not principled about this at
all consider you know conservative business owners will readily apply
for subsidies and tax breaks to leech off the government
to them corporate welfare is totally fine and yet they
complain about welfare queens um also conservatives love to criticize
government handouts but then they take them when they're in
need famously ayn rand the libertarian founder of libertarianism basically
iron rand um you know she was very very critical
of of government handouts and then later in her life
she got government subsidies and support when she couldn't afford
to pay for herself in her retirement see double standard
how about um conservatives on protesting conservatives love to criticize
protesters like they love to criticize for example you know
the colin kaepernick nfl players who are kneeling peacefully so
when a football player kneels peacefully to protest you know
whatever racial injustice that's you know that's very disrespectful that
disrespects the country the flag the nfl and all those
sorts of stuff so they're not allowed to do that
okay but then when those people protest outside the football
stadium on the streets they're also not allowed to do
that they're not allowed to you know conservatives will criticize
people uh protesting racial justice on the streets that's also
bad and then when something like blm you know stages
a riot somewhere and actually does violence or destroys property
well that's outrageous too that's also not allowed so so
how are you allowed to protest you're not allowed to
protest violently you're not allowed to process in the streets
you're not allowed to protest peacefully by taking a knee
on the on the football stadium so in essence you're
not allowed to protest but the constitution guarantees u.s citizens
the right to protest gross double standard and then of
course when conservatives are protesting when they're staging some sort
of rally like unite the right rally charlottesville rally you
know some sort of kkk rally or whatever that's okay
they get permits for those and then they get upset
when they're denied their permits so really they're just for
protesting when it's their side and against protesting when it's
not their side that's the double standard how about um
on fracking uh uh i read a news story some
years ago about um like a wealthy republican advocate for
fracking he was like a business owner and he was
advocating for the safety of fracking and fracking is good
and all that kind of stuff but then when fracking
when some company came to do fracking in his small
town that he lived in in his backyard basically he
filed a lawsuit against them and went through this whole
big court trial uh to stop them from from fracking
in his backyard see it's this kind of double standard
that we're talking about how about with religion like um
most religious fundamentalists take their holy book and their scriptures
on faith as true everything in the quran is true
everything in the bible is true and so on but
if you're going to take your holy book on on
faith why don't you take other holy books on faith
and afford them the same credence and benefit of the
doubt that you afford the bible so a christian will
take the bible on faith but then the quran not
why and you know vice versa a muslim will take
the quran on faith but perhaps not the bible or
not some buddhist text or some hindu text why not
obvious gross double standard here's another example you criticize aggressive
moves by other countries against your country but you don't
criticize the aggressive moves of your country this is a
classic one classic double standards that come especially with nationalism
if you're a nationalist then you're going to be very
guilty of this you're going to see the aggressions of
your country as just defensive maneuvers and then you're going
to see the aggressions of other countries as evil aggressive
you know they're evil aggressors another one is people are
outraged when other countries interfere with their country's election system
and undermine their democracy but not when your country does
the same to other countries so when americans are undermining
democracy all around the world in russia in the middle
east and in latin america no one cares that's all
fine but then when when russia is undermining and meddling
in our elections here now we're all outraged about it
how about when it comes to wars you know like
russia invading ukraine that's an evil war of aggression the
us invading iraq well we're liberators and we're defending the
world from terrorists preposterous double standard and that ruins america's
credibility around the world see if the us did not
evade iraq then now when putin invaded ukraine we would
have a lot more moral standing and credibility but we
don't we sacrificed that by invading iraq how about this
double standard nationalists and evangelicals are outraged when muslims want
sharia law which is just basically they want a theocracy
under the banner of islam but yet these same nationalists
you know like american nationalists and evangelicals they basically want
their own version of theocracy christian law gross double standard
how about this one the constitution is sacred and we
should do everything in the constitution right a lot of
conservatives will say that we got to conserve the constitution
at all costs okay but the constitution considered black people
to not even be fully human do you agree with
that is that what you want to conserve so what
is it should we be conserving the constitution or should
we be modifying and evolving the constitution see it's a
gross double standard because what conservatives do is they cherry
pick the constitution for whatever things they like and the
things they don't like or that don't serve them they
just ignore those i call that cherry picking it's a
very sneaky self-deception mechanism and in general that happens with
uh all religious people who try to follow moral prescriptions
from any holy book like from the bible or from
the quran or whatever what they do is they cherry
pig there's a lot of moral prescriptions in all these
books that they completely ignore and then other ones that
they fixate on and this turns into quite legendary degrees
of hypocrisy how about this example if a radical islamist
kills five people then westerners want to blame all muslims
for that and all muslims have to answer to that
and all muslims now must denounce violence you hear this
on tv it's like why won't all muslims denounce this
radical islamists who killed five people they're not doing it
yeah but when a radical you know christian domestic terrorist
shoots 20 people in a church crickets why aren't there
calls for all good christians to come and to denounce
this radical christian who killed 20 people in a church
why is it that muslims have to answer for all
violence by muslims but christians don't have to answer to
all the violence done by christians for example you know
when george w bush decided to invade iraq back in
the 2000s i remember very vividly he said you know
god told him basically he was talking to god and
god basically convinced him that this was a good move
a good decision so in essence the iraq war was
started by a christian george w bush and his administration
was you know full of christians so you could call
it a christian war but why don't we call it
a christian war and why don't all christians have to
answer for the horrors and evils and blunders of iraq
a lot of christian nationalists in america want odes to
office to be taken on the bible but then they're
outraged when muslims take odes on the quran in the
u.s christians love to complain about leftist politicians and their
sex scandals like bill clinton and so forth and the
lack of the lack of family values but then when
a right-wing politician comes along who's a serial cheater like
trump or newt gingrich they just turn a blind eye
to that i mean of all the presidents we've had
trump was the worst on family values objectively the worst
on family values of probably any president in the last
100 years and yet he has the most evangelical support
in america i mean it's it's preposterous the degrees of
double standard that are happening here uh you know conservatives
also believe that killing a zygote is evil but killing
a grown animal for sport that's good conservatives will you
know support the blue support police until the police come
after you and you know your politicians and the fbi
comes after trump for for uh for running off with
a bunch of classified documents then all of a sudden
you know now we have to defund the fbi it's
ridiculous conservatives got into a whole huge um uh you
know had a whole conniption about hillary clinton and her
classified emails stored on her private server but the degree
of violation of classified information that trump is guilty of
now is way worse than anything hillary clinton was guilty
of i mean it's preposterous trump doesn't give a [
__ ] about protecting classified documents i mean if you
were intellectually honest you would admit this complaints from the
right wing about censorship you know the right wing loves
to talk about freedom of speech and all that but
the reality is that a lot of right wings politicians
and conservatives they pass legislation they ban books from classrooms
um the right wing has been guilty of censorship in
this country you know for since the very beginning censorship
of pornography censorship of of profanity censorship of certain kinds
of books censorship of um socialist ideology you know the
mccarthy era that what was that that was right-wing censorship
so this idea that the right wing doesn't engage in
censorship it's preposterous there's double standards around homosexuality and homophobia
uh a lot of people who object to homosexuality the
most who are the most vocal you know against it
a lot of them are actually homosexual closeted homosexuals there's
actually been science scientific studies that that correlate the like
the degree to which you are anti-homosexual is actually correlated
with um arousal towards photographs of naked men there's a
correlation there i mean it's not a perfect one-to-one but
there is some correlation there how about the double standard
of uh application of laws when it comes to punishing
criminals so a lot of times conservatives want like maximum
punishments for criminals but then when they themselves commit a
crime then all of a sudden they want you know
they come up with excuses and they want lacks lacks
punishments so you want criminals punished but as soon as
you become a criminal now you don't want criminals punished
you want exceptions for yourself how about uh american nationalism
as a whole is a ridiculous double standard where it's
like this is our land you immigrants go home go
back to your country and meanwhile the native americans are
sitting there thinking wait a minute this was our land
you're the immigrants why don't you go back to europe
now i've been [ __ ] on conservatives for a
long time now it's time to [ __ ] a
little bit on progressives the progressives have also double standards
one really ridiculous one that i've noticed lately is with
defunding the police this is such a stupid progressive idea
this idea of defunding the police horrible horrible idea horrible
slogan horrible politics horrible optics all of it is awful
but what what just struck me as the height of
hypocrisy is on january 6th progressive commentators they were outraged
at the lack of police presence around the us capitol
and they were screaming you know where are the police
why weren't there more police was there some sort of
secret plot to you know remove the police the police
weren't properly trained they weren't properly prepared they were incompetent
all this kind of stuff well how can the police
be properly prepared and trained and how can there be
sufficient numbers of them if you if you want to
defund them all this is preposterous also i've noticed some
progressives some like extreme progressives like with this trump fbi
raid stuff that's been happening lately um the conservatives have
been saying yeah let's defund the fbi which is a
[ __ ] stupid idea and then the progressives have
some progressives have been like yeah why don't we yeah
i mean we agree uh finally there's something we agree
on the progressives want to defund the fbi because you
know the fbi has been used historically against black people
and socialists and so forth um so yeah the progressives
want to defund fbi and the conservatives mega movement wants
to defund fbi so between the two of us let's
come together and defund the fbi this is this is
so [ __ ] stupid um do you understand what
this country would devolve into without the fbi the fbi
are those who chase down your drug dealers um and
i don't mean weed i mean like dangerous drug dealers
um you're cyber criminals you're scammers your white collar criminals
cyber crime pedophilia fbi has a whole pedophile division you
want to defund the fbi that basically means you're pro
pedophilia that's how stupid that is the fbi serves a
very important function but anyways um that's a double standard
for you there um and then you know if you
did defund the fbi and then your child was you
know sexually molested by an adult you would be outraged
by this but then of course that's the double standard
because hey you wanted to defund the fbi well who
else is going to police that [ __ ] for
you someone has to police it it's not going to
police itself you know that requires a lot of money
to police that moving on though let's move on to
communism you know in communism there was gross double standards
you know especially like in the soviet era i'm talking
about like party leaders in the soviet union basically professed
this sort of like morality of equality you know all
of us are comrades we're all equal we're almost on
the same field we're all going to earn about the
same amount of money and so forth but actually secretly
all these communists took bribes to get better material goodies
for themselves and to hold on to exclusive positions of
power within the communist party and so actually even though
under communism it's supposed to be like a flat hierarchy
right that was the point of communism remove the hierarchy
all of us are going to be equal we're all
going to earn roughly the same amount of money no
one's going to be some elite lording over us but
then in practice what happened is that the communist party
itself became a very strict hierarchy and the way you
ascend that hierarchy is through bribes and other sorts of
shady deals and the higher your position the hierarchy the
better apartment you would get the better car you would
get the better food you would get and all that
sorts of stuff so in essence communism just even though
in in theory it was supposed to remove the hierarchical
structures of oppression of capitalism in practice it removed them
all and then it recreated them all under the guise
of communism and this is exactly what is the case
right now in china too china pretends to be communist
but in practice they're actually more capitalist and they're extremely
hierarchical and if you wanna you know have any political
power in china you're gonna have to climb that hierarchy
even more so than you have to do in america
it's actually harder it's harder to be a politician in
china than it is in america because in america it's
actually an open system basically anybody can run for office
in china you can only run for office if the
right communist um party leaders approve of you and they're
going to want bribes and all that kind of stuff
how about this one this double standard a few nations
in the world are allowed to have nuclear weapons like
the uk the us china russia a few others that
i'm forgetting who but um france and so forth but
then everybody else is not allowed to what kind of
ridiculous double standard is that why can't iran have nuclear
weapons i mean shouldn't every country have the right to
defend itself where's the justice in that how about this
double standard people love to count the deaths of communism
over the last 100 years you know communism has killed
100 million people they say okay but what about the
deaths under capitalism how many how many people has capitalism
killed in the last hundred years nobody counts that that
would be a very interesting number to count also nobody
really likes to count how many lives have been uplifted
by communism for example take a look at um even
russia but especially china take a look at china and
you know if you consider china to be communist which
is really um silly to consider them that but you
know right-wingers will consider china to be communists so if
you're a right-winger and you consider a child to be
communist take a look at how communism under china in
the last 50 years has improved their um their wealth
their prosperity of the average chinese person it's made life
in china so much better but see that's not counted
towards communism because you know the capitalists love to count
how capitalism has improved the lives of so many people
as if capitalism is the only system that can improve
people's lives if you're going to count the improvements under
capitalism also you should be fair and count the improvements
under communism too communism actually improved the lives of russians
over the last hundred years enormously russia was basically like
a medieval state a hundred years ago under soviet communism
it went through rapid industrialization rapid development now of course
there was enormous problems i'm not denying those but you
should also be fair about its successes because see you
would admit you'd have to admit that there are enormous
problems under capitalism too but just because there's enormous problems
doesn't mean capitalism isn't viable or that it shouldn't exist
or that it's bad there's good size there's bad sides
you gotta you know weigh apples to apples here how
about when the us places missile silos in europe pointed
at russia that's considered okay and non-aggressive the us is
just defending itself nato is just defending itself but if
russia placed nuclear missile silos in mexico there would be
complete outrage on american tv there's no way america would
settle for that how about this one the alternative media
loves to criticize mainstream media for its bias and for
tearing the country apart but the reality is that alternative
media is more biased and tears the country apart even
more or at least as much as mainstream media all
these youtubers these progressive youtubers conservative youtubers and podcasters and
so forth um they're tearing the country apart and they're
way more biased than cnn or msnbc they're way less
professional they're way less accurate if you compare the inaccuracies
on cnn to the inaccuracies that you see from alternative
media on youtube you're going to get way more inaccuracies
on alternative media simply because they don't have the same
budgets they don't have enough fact checkers and personnel to
staff these small little media outlets so there's going to
be more errors and they can't afford to have a
whole team of journalists now does that mean cnn is
never inaccurate no it's it's got inaccuracies does that mean
cnn isn't biased no it's got its biases but you
got to compare apples to apples here you can't just
ignore all the bias that's happening in alternative media it's
pretty bad especially if you take into account twitter facebook
tick tock the amount of bias on these platforms i
mean these platforms are like the bottom of the barrel
when it comes to bias you couldn't get more bias
than that and in general what happens with with this
double standard when it comes to politics is that there's
a criticism of the out groups politicians the ones who
are not on your side your opponents you criticize them
to hell as being corrupt but then those who are
part of your tribe the politicians that represent your tribe
you ignore all of their corruptions so all of trump's
supporters ignore the corruptions of trump they're so blind to
it it's as though trump isn't corrupt in their mind
i mean it's preposterous but also uh the left wing
does this too certainly left-wing politicians can be corrupt and
as a left-winger you can notice yourself kind of like
turning a blind eye to some of the minor corruptions
of your own politicians notice that all right let's start
to move away from politics we kind of got wrapped
up in that because i mean honestly there's religion and
politics are like the two biggest examples or categories of
double standards it's so obvious there let's move on to
some more subtle ones like for example when you are
negotiating the price of something like let's say you're you're
buying a house well when you're buying a house you're
trying to negotiate the price down you want the lowest
price but if you were the seller in that situation
if you were selling the house then you would you
would try to argue the price up and you would
make all sorts of stories and excuses for why you
know well you know in this market i should get
more i should get or i should have to pay
less you know whatever you're gonna whenever you're negotiating for
the price you're always negotiating in your own favor with
a gross double standard also in business you know corporations
and ceos love to argue that unions are unfair they
give you know unfair power excessive power um and they
get in the way of you know honest negotiations between
employees and the corporation this is preposterous a preposterous double
standard because the reality is that the leverage that a
corporation or ceo has over his employees is like you
know it's like a thousand to one leverage so a
union is just equalizing that and even then in most
cases corporations and ceos will still have more leverage even
over a powerful union how about with circumcision female circumcision
is considered obscene and horrific and evil whereas male circumcision
is desirable what's the difference another category where there's an
enormous amount of double standards is just between races especially
between blacks and whites and it's in favor of whites
obviously to the disadvantage of blacks there are so many
examples here many of them are so obvious i won't
even mention them but when it comes to all sorts
of forms of discrimination when buying a house when selling
a house i recently read an article in the news
that said that a black couple listed their house on
the market at one price and then they did something
where then they sort of pretended that they were white
instead of black and then the valuation of their house
like went up by a couple hundred thousand just because
when they first started it looked like they were black
and then and then later it looked like they were
white i mean ridiculous double standards like this um so
of course you know racism itself is basically um double
standard incarnate um this also applies to different cultures you
know treating one culture as above other cultures is sort
of western chauvinism thinking that western culture is the best
culture this kind of stuff but of course you know
like the chinese are guilty of this too you know
basically every culture thinks it's the best the chinese think
their culture is the best indians think their culture is
the best russians think their culture is the best and
japanese think theirs is the best and this is preposterous
of course and um there is no such thing as
the best culture even though also there are many you
know there are many features to culture some cultures have
better features than other cultures you have to like compare
them at sort of a fine-grained level i'm not saying
they're all equally good but the treat one culture is
above the others it's a gross double standard there's also
speaking of culture there's a lot of arbitrariness within cultural
norms and etiquette so just the etiquette of the west
versus japan versus china there's a lot of like arbitrariness
to that and there's a lot of double standards just
like you know how do you hold a fork how
do you talk to your boss or employee how do
you hold a door open for somebody or shouldn't you
you know how do you eat your food do you
you know chew with your mouth open or close like
a lot of like arbitrary standards like this a lot
of double standards when it comes to that uh there's
a lot of double standards that women have towards men
especially when it comes to sexuality and dating for example
you know fat men love to complain about women being
fat but then they ignore the fact that all their
friends are fat and they're fat um men love to
complain about how easy it is for women to get
sex but they don't take into account many of the
problems that women have in getting sex and dating so
there's gross double standards there especially a problem within the
in-cell communities within the ncl community there's so many ridiculous
double standards that these in-cells have towards women and their
expectations about sex and about how they look it's just
it's it's so toxic and ridiculous uh within pickup there's
a lot of double standards you know for example here's
one it's like in in pickup there's a there's a
sort of a common attitude that you know all girls
are disloyal [ __ ] and cheaters um but then
when you're talking to a girl and she doesn't end
up sleeping with you you know she's actually not easy
she's actually you know she's not loose she's not a
[ __ ] she's actually you know loyal she has
a boyfriend or something the pickup guy will get upset
and say oh that [ __ ] why didn't she
sleep with me well which is it are women disloyal
[ __ ] and [ __ ] and they're all
loose and easy or are they actually uh you know
loyal and but then why are you complaining that she
didn't sleep with you if she's a disloyal [ __
] then how come she didn't sleep with you so
easily how come she was loyal to her boyfriend see
but the pickup ideology discounts that because it doesn't care
about the truth of the matter it doesn't care about
being objective it just cares about validating its own you
know self-serving beliefs and for pickup guys they need to
create a story in their mind that all women are
disloyal [ __ ] because in reality the pickup guy
is there to sleep with hundreds of women so he
has to justify to himself that he's cheating on all
these women every night and lying to them and so
forth and being disloyal to them he has to justify
that the only way he can justify that is by
saying that well women are doing the same thing or
are even worse so therefore i'm allowed to do it
because if you realize that women are actually very loyal
you would feel horrible about cheating on them and being
disloyal to them and also most pick up guys take
this attitude that you know well if if a girl
cheats on me that's wrong and evil but if i
sleep around with a bunch of girls that's okay ridiculous
ridiculously self-serving i got a few more scientific ones for
you for example science says that we can't accept god
without proof and yet science accepts the existence of an
external objective world without any proof science also accepts the
existence of other conscious beings without any proof science also
will not accept the paranormal without proof but science readily
accepts logic without proof where's the proof that logic is
absolutely true science complains about the dangers of religion and
mysticism but science completely ignores the dangers of science and
materialism how come religion and science are so dangerous but
nuclear weapons well that's not science's fault or genetic engineering
that's not science's fault or heavy metals in our water
supply and leaded gasoline and pollution that's not science's fault
well whose fault is that compare the amount of people
that have been killed by science and compare the amount
of people have been killed by religion you'll be in
for a very rude awakening and yet that does not
in any way detract the value of science or the
legitimacy of science in the mind of a scientist because
they create all sorts of excuses but when a religious
person creates excuses or a mystic creates excuses for the
dangers of religion and mysticism well those are not accepted
those are unacceptable excuses that's called [ __ ] but
when a scientist does it it's not called [ __
] and in general we've talked about this before but
just to touch on it lightly there's a lot of
double standards when it comes to the way that you're
using the labels of logical and rational so basically what
people do is that their pet theories and beliefs no
matter whether they're true or not or rational or not
those are called rational and logical and those with other
people's who you disagree with they're called illogical and irrational
not because they actually are but simply because that's how
you use those labels in a very double standard way
another double standard that i see commonly especially given my
position is people love to accuse anything they disagree with
anything that's kind of like non-mainstream any kind of ideology
or worldview that's a little bit off the beaten path
and talks about non-material things they always call that oh
that's a cult but they never apply that same label
to for example fields of science or academia or what's
going on in universities they don't call that a cult
they don't call mainstream delusions occult they don't call materialism
a cult why not if you were honest you would
so the label cult is is weaponized in this way
here's an interesting double standard that i noticed when i
was young that always just puzzled me a lot of
these double standards are actually easier to notice when you're
young when your mind hasn't yet been programmed with them
when you're first interacting with society because once you've been
deeply ingrained in society and brainwashed with it you start
to become just um like a fish and water and
you you can't see the double standards anymore but like
for example what always puzzled me is the death of
celebrities when a celebrity dies there's all this mourning and
people come out and they're they're so thankful to the
celebrity how amazing the celebrity was and all this how
you know oh my god it's so sad we lost
this amazing celebrity this actor this musician whatever but then
on the news every day you read people dying getting
stabbed shot killed run over by cars all this sort
of stuff you know children elderly whatever and nobody gives
a [ __ ] about these people they're not mourned
nobody cries over them nobody tells them how beautiful or
important they were how much they were loved but what's
the difference what's the difference between kobe bryant dying and
some random nobody dying which happens every there's no [
__ ] difference if you were truly objective about it
it's just that you have an emotional attachment to kobe
bryant but why should that dictate how sad or how
heartbroken we should feel why i mean honestly why do
you feel more heartbroken for the death of kobe bryant
than you do for any other person in the world
like it makes no sense at all if you were
truly objective about it uh here's a case cutting in
line have you ever stood in line and had somebody
cut in front of you and then how that makes
you pissed off right and yet what about when you
try to do that yourself there's a long line to
the club and then you sneak in front i've done
that um it's very interesting to observe when i do
that sometimes i do cut in line like vegas club
lines can can be awful sometimes i have ways of
cutting through vegas club lines um sometimes i would even
bribe my way through i can pay the bouncer slip
them 20 or i have i have other means that
i've you know sneaky sneaky ways of cutting through lines
because some of these lines are awful um i don't
do it all the time just occasionally but i noticed
myself doing this and also i noticed myself like usually
i don't do that that's actually something i started doing
just recently um my whole life i would i basically
never do it i was very like integris in the
sense that i would refuse to cut in line because
i don't like people cutting in line in front of
me but actually as part of my development i've sort
of been like exploring my shadow side my evil side
a little bit so you know i allow myself little
evil maneuvers like this now and then just to kind
of test myself because i know that i'm going to
let this go right i'm going through this as part
of like getting the immaturity out of my system burning
through my karma basically um so i've been practicing that
and just seeing kind of like how it [ __
] with my mind because i do break integrity when
i cut in line i do break integrity when i
bribe somebody even though vegas nightclubs like bouncers there are
like bright i mean it's it's like standard practice to
bribe bouncers basically at vegas nightclubs um it happens like
hundreds of times every night uh but still interesting to
observe that interesting to observe what it does to your
psyche how you feel about your own self whether you
feel guilty about it or not see most people who
cut in line or pay a bribe they don't even
think about it they don't even think about what they're
doing and how this is hurting their development or another
related point to this is trying to get special treatment
i know a lot of a lot of people try
to get special treatment like they get they try to
like haggle their way to some sort of special discount
you know they go to a store maybe they're they're
doing something like they're buying something and you know they
try to get a better deal here they try to
go freebie there this kind of stuff special treatment i
call this um but really when you're trying to get
special treatment you're you're creating double standards and this is
something that i've developed a habit of not doing there
are situations in which i could get special treatment if
i kind of like skillfully my new maneuver myself you
know with with my speech craft skills and so forth
so to speak but um but i tend not to
want to do it because i don't i don't want
special treatment but a lot of people they i notice
that they try to get special treatment in fact they
have developed a habit of expecting special treatment and they
see nothing wrong with this they don't they don't see
how this hurts them in their development and in their
consciousness so i'm pointing that out to you just in
case you're one of those people uh there's a whole
set of double standards that come with being rich and
being upper class a lot of upper class people sort
of just expect certain doors to be open to them
and they're very entitled in certain ways for example upper
class people will expect to be able to lobby government
and they're totally fine with having disproportional influence on the
government you know our government system in america our democracy
is fundamentally predicated upon the idea of one person one
vote everyone should have equal power in electing somebody basically
but then millionaires and billionaires you know they have no
qualms about donating a billion dollars here or million dollars
there or exerting various kinds of pressure to basically essentially
what they're doing is they're buying votes they're not literally
buying votes but basically it's the equivalent of buying votes
such that a person with a billion dollars who donates
that billion dollars towards some sort of lobbying firm basically
that company that person has the equivalent power of enacting
their legislation or their agenda or having their favorite politician
elected they're increasing their power by like a thousand-fold so
in essence they're having a thousand votes or a million
votes more than the average person which is corrupting our
entire system and um this is a gross double standard
because i'm sure if you ask one of these rich
people do you believe in one person one vote they
would say yes but then in fact behind the scenes
they're lobbying they're donating all this kind of stuff and
they don't hold it in their mind as corrupting the
voting system and in general you know the rich tend
to feel entitled and justified to their upper class status
and wealth and therefore they support the status quo and
the capitalist system because they're at the top of it
so of course they're benefiting so to them it seems
like everything is great but here's a double standard is
that if they happen to be born in a slightly
different position slightly different part of the country slightly different
part of the world slightly lower in the in the
hierarchy um then they would be stuck in poverty and
then they would curse the system and this this is
a this is a profound double standard that almost all
rich and upper class people hold and they've held this
um since the dawn of civilization because when you're rich
it does not serve you to see the double standard
that is resulting in your wealth and power and there
almost always is a double standard that is responsible for
that even though you tell yourself otherwise how about with
the new age and alternative medicine fields in these fields
there's a lot of double standards for example you might
go to some new age healer like with some sort
of pain in your stomach or something you go to
this you know reiki healer the reiki ladies you know
she moves her hands around your stomach and then if
you're feeling better the next day then she's gonna take
credit for it and she's going to say oh well
it was it was the spirit of reiki that healed
you but if you're not feeling better she's not going
to take credit for not fixing you she's not going
to say to yourself oh well the spirit of reiki
didn't work on you she's gonna find some excuse to
say well that's because you know you did something wrong
you weren't receptive enough to the energy you need to
have more faith your faith wasn't strong enough i've noticed
this kind of logic and these kind of double standards
with alternative medicine healers and new agers reiki people they're
so full of [ __ ] they're so full of
[ __ ] basically when it happens to work they
take credit for it and if it doesn't work they
don't even acknowledge that it didn't work they turned a
blind eye to it same thing with shaktipat i've had
shaktipat done it's so preposterous you go to these shaktipot
people and they they promise you that they can awaken
you they can awaken your kundalini they can enlighten you
through their you know through an energy transmission then you
know you're skeptical of it but you say okay fine
do it on me let's just practice and see you
know what the hell let's take a gamble you do
it a few times um if it works they're going
to take credit for it and they're going to use
you as an example of one of their you know
one of their testimonials one of their good clients and
they're going to count that towards how effective they are
at their shaktipat but when it doesn't work what do
they do well they blame you of course they say
oh you're not ripe enough you're just not spiritually ripe
enough yet you're not ready you're resisting it there's something
within you that's holding you back you're not open enough
or like you know you're one of those people you
know we all have different karma and you just have
more karma therefore for you it's going to take longer
so just keep coming longer they take no responsibility for
the fact that um that it's not working not because
of the client but because you know their their shakti
pot fantasies aren't as reliable as they think they are
another one from science you know errors in religion prove
that religion is [ __ ] but errors in science
are just evidence that science is real and honest and
willing to correct itself it's such a ridiculous double standard
how about science is attitude towards psychedelics like a scientist
will say oh well leo all the insights you get
from psychedelics are just hallucinations okay fine but if we
adopt that standard then all the insights of science are
generated through neurotransmitters through serotonin a psychedelic is basically a
neurotransmitter so therefore if all psychedelics are just a hallucination
then all of science is also hallucination are you willing
to bite that bullet no a general double standard goes
like this is that you know humans are very tribal
and we want to say that our tribe is right
and the other tribe is wrong and our tribe has
good intentions whereas the other side the other tribe has
bad intentions so this ascribing of intentionality is done in
a selfish and a biased way such that like you
know conservatives thinks that think that progressives have bad intentions
and progressives think that conservatives have bad intentions well what
is the actual truth well the truth is that everybody
has good intentions see my episode about that everyone has
good intentions but they're at different levels of consciousness they
have different corruptions from the ego mind and so forth
different levels of self-esteem through this your good intentions get
corrupted and turned into what looks like bad intentions but
this is a double standard that is commonly seen another
one is complaining about the evils of capitalism on the
one hand but then when it comes to how you
earn your own money using capitalism that gets ignored that's
okay because you need that to live yeah well everybody
within capitalism needs what they're doing in order to survive
that's capitalism for you the reality and this is why
communism failed the reality is that if you eliminate capitalism
what's going to happen is that and then you enact
socialism or communism is socialism and communism most the people
are so underdeveloped that they are going to resort to
all the same exploitative tactics that existed under capitalism except
now it's going to be under the umbrella of socialist
and communist ideology which is exactly what you see in
modern china and also you saw it in soviet um
soviet communist russia and you see it basically in any
socialist country cuba and elsewhere you the the it turns
out the structures of capitalism are so uh profoundly important
to survival that you can't eliminate them now i'm not
saying that we shouldn't try to you know find some
sort of post-capitalist solution we should but this sort of
naive idea that socialists and communists have that oh if
we could just get rid of capitalism and then enact
socialism everything's gonna be great it's like no you don't
understand how deep of a problem this is um just
because you eliminate capitalism in name and in theory doesn't
mean that you'll be able to eliminate it in practice
for example in north korea where supposedly they have eliminated
capitalism because it's a communist state um in reality the
only way that country functions uh you know there'd be
so much there'd be so many people dying of hunger
in that country if there didn't exist capitalist black markets
so when it comes to like buying your groceries in
north korea you know you can kind of go to
a normal store and try to get some food and
stuff but it's not enough it's not enough for you
to survive so in practice the north koreans are resorted
to having secret black markets where they trade goods you
know it could be food could be just household items
and stuff like that just the basic necessities of life
they have to trade that outside of their sort of
like standard store system government run system because the government
system run system is not providing them sufficient resources for
basic living so um they're forced to do this black
market trading stuff and basically they have to do it
as a market capitalism style and the government what's even
what's even more perverse is that the north korean government
knows about all these black markets it's not like these
black markets are like inaccessible to the police and so
forth no the police themselves are engaged in these black
markets because the police couldn't function without the black markets
so everybody knows about the black markets but it's sort
of like a you know it's like an open secret
everybody knows about it and the government doesn't even bother
cracking down on them because they know that if they
did it would [ __ ] collapse the whole system
so the communist system depends on the capitalist black markets
and that's exactly how communism has always been and how
it would be if if it was enacted today uh
how about this double standard people love to complain when
spiritual teachers charge money for their teachings it's like oh
well leo you are so spiritual you don't need money
you're god you don't need money why are you charging
me for a course but then when it comes to
how you behave in your life how you pay your
bills you know i got to pay my bills but
the question is how do you pay your bills you
have no problem you know if you work at starbucks
you have no problem charging your customers money and if
a customer came into your starbucks and said well why
aren't you uh giving me free coffee you would you
would never i mean you would laugh them out of
the store of course i'm charging you for coffee of
course i'm charging you for being here you know like
for example um why do you expect your boss to
pay you a salary why aren't you working for free
at starbucks you expect a salary why but leo you're
so spiritual you shouldn't need a salary but i'm also
material i still when i go to the store i
have to pay the money like when i go to
starbucks to get a coffee which i don't but if
i did um i would have to give them cash
right i couldn't say that i couldn't go to a
starbucks and say oh you know i'm leo i'm the
spiritual guy therefore give me a free a coffee they
would laugh me out of the store therefore i need
money i can't do that with you know the electric
company my cable company that provides me internet you know
like um they're not going to accept my spiritual teachings
as payment they need cash and therefore be careful with
your double standards when it comes to spiritual teachers spiritual
teachers need to eat too just like everybody else gotta
pay our mortgage and gotta pay the electric bill gotta
go shopping gotta you know health care bills to pay
all that [ __ ] you don't escape that by
being spiritual i wish it worked that way but it
doesn't um how about complaining about big oil companies and
the evils of pollution and oil but then you use
those companies and their oil for your road trips to
get to work to drive to the club you fuel
up at the chevron station at the exxon mobil station
at the shell station these are the same companies that
you are you know railing against for being evil and
yet you need these companies to get about your life
how about this one this one has always struck me
as such a crazy preposterous double standard it's considered completely
unacceptable to show sex in a children's cartoon this would
be perceived almost equivalent to pedophilia and yet showing murder
to children in a cartoon is considered not only acceptable
but a legitimate form of fun and entertainment why is
it okay to show murder but not okay to show
sex we have our priorities backwards also for example parents
are outraged when children make stupid mistakes in their youth
and yet those parents made the same stupid mistakes in
their youth so what are you outraged about you know
when your daughter sneaks off to go making out with
some boy from middle school as the parent you might
get pissed off but then you did the same [
__ ] when you were in middle school or like
when your daughter smokes some weed in middle school you
get pissed off as the parent but then you did
the same [ __ ] and probably even worse when
you were in middle school also parents love to scold
their children for cursing you know they don't want their
children to curse say [ __ ] and so on
and yet parents themselves curse more than children how about
most people believe that stealing is wrong and yet for
example if a store clerks makes a checkout mistake in
your favor which is essentially you stealing something from the
store that you turn a blind eye to that that's
acceptable that's not wrong because you know they made the
mistake how about this one butchering a cow is okay
but butchering a human is evil why this double standard
beating a horse is okay but beating an employee is
wrong why another scientific one you know deepak chopra um
he's ridiculous because he doesn't understand quantum mechanics and he's
just using it to justify some sort of woo ideas
and yet how about the fact that the fathers of
quantum mechanics like niels bohr and schrodinger einstein others they
were all into mysticism how do you square that go
check out my episode called quantum mechanics deconstructs materialism part
2 where i read you quotes of all these fathers
of quantum mechanics and their passion for mysticism how about
this double standard something like as much as 50 of
all scientific studies these days fail to get replicated and
validated that means they're done once the result is published
and then 10 years later somebody does the study again
and then they fail to replicate the results which means
that the original result was basically bad science so even
though we know that something like up to 50 of
scientific studies failed replication yet we still demand scientific studies
as proof before we accept a thing why it's basically
a coin flip whether the scientific study that you're citing
as proof is going to actually prove the thing you
think it proves it's pretty bad odds it's a coin
flip why even do the studies at that point another
general double standard that i see is application of spiritual
logic misapplication of spiritual logic in a sort of a
double standard way like um well i already sort of
gave you one example with you know expecting spiritual teachers
not to charge money but there's a lot of examples
of this like for example you might say something like
well you know i know that god exists because i've
had some awakenings let's say and so since god exists
um you know i don't have to i don't have
to worry about doing my taxes because god will take
care of it for me like this kind of logic
um there's a lot of like weird ways in which
you can apply spiritual logic sort of like unevenly like
you expect god to do this thing for you but
not that thing and um this gets you into all
sorts of all sorts of problems and trouble so be
very careful with how you're applying spiritual logic and a
lot of times when you're when you're you know talking
with some other spiritual person there's conflations of relative and
absolute truths that can happen and you can use relative
and absolute critiques in sort of selective ways i've talked
about this in the past um as one of the
traps of of this spiritual work is conflating the relative
and the absolute so what would be an example of
this like maybe your girlfriend comes to you and you
know she's crying because something bad happened at work and
then you tell her something like well but you know
you know baby um um you know that's it's all
just you know work it's just an illusion your boss
he yeah your boss is an [ __ ] but
that's just it's just an illusion in this case you're
kind of speaking from the absolute point of view right
and technically what you're saying is true so you're not
saying anything wrong there the problem is that you're you're
having a double standard in how you apply this because
you see then when something happens to you and you
come crying to her you know you'd be very upset
if she used that same logic back on you for
example let's say um [Music] let's say your neighbor ran
over your dog and your dog died and then you
would come crying to her about how you know my
neighbor's an [ __ ] he ran over my dog
and then she would tell you like oh baby don't
worry your dog was just an illusion see if she
told you that that would also be true but you
would be pissed off about it and in your own
mind you don't think of your dog as an illusion
it's much easier to think of your girlfriend's boss who
you've never met who's just some sort of nuisance that
she's telling you about it's much easier to think of
him as as just an illusion than it is to
think of your you know your beloved dog is an
illusion so you have to be very careful about you
know casting things as illusions or dismissing things as illusions
because even you know everything is an illusion in the
end but if you're gonna go that route well then
you have to apply that logic equally you can't just
cherry pick things and say well that thing is an
illusion and that thing's an illusion because i don't want
to deal with it but then the things that you
know are close to me well those things aren't illusions
so be careful about that another common double standard i
see is accusations of grifting and criticizing people for making
money now of course sometimes you can make a legit
criticism of somebody who's a grifter but a lot of
times look everybody has to make money somehow i don't
care who you are you have to make money a
lot of times i'll see like progressive youtubers criticizing some
conservatives for being grifters and making money but then these
same progressive youtubers they have sponsors they run advertisements they
pitch you stuff too they have to make money so
be careful about accusing someone of being a grifter just
because they make money we all have to make money
uh generally speaking within argumentation and debate a lot of
double standards get employed anytime you're arguing and debating with
somebody just watch out whether you're debating science religion atheism
theism left or right wing politics philosophy whatever it is
just watch really carefully how the other side uses double
standards and you use double standards too you have to
hold yourself accountable to that um a lot of double
standards happen with cherry-picking data lying with data facts and
statistics you can always cherry pick the data to basically
fit your own narrative you have to be very careful
against doing that reductionism can be used in a double
standard way where you can reduce an issue that you
don't really care about you can take a reductionistic approach
to it but then an issue that you do care
about you don't think of reductionistically um what would be
an example of this for example you you can take
a very reductionistic approach towards sex you can say well
what's the big deal why is sex so important it
doesn't matter like for example let's say let's say you
cheat you're a guy you cheat on your girlfriend right
and then um your girlfriend comes she's angry at you
and she says you [ __ ] you [ __
] cheated on me blah blah blah blah and then
you you take a reductionistic approach and you say well
but baby you know what is sex really all it
is is it's just like it's like just a vagina
and a and a dick and it's just like it's
this it's just like a physical emotion it's just material
like there's nothing spiritual about it doesn't matter baby it's
just like it's just like a physical it's like a
physical act it doesn't matter it's just like an animalistic
act it doesn't it doesn't mean anything see like this
like you reduce it in order to justify it but
then but you see but you see how that's a
double standard because if it was just such a physical
act it didn't mean anything then why did you end
up cheating if it was so unimportant then surely it
would have been easy for you not to cheat so
obviously it's not so unimportant to you it's very important
to you you're just you just cast it and frame
it as unimportant when it serves you to do so
so this sort of form of reductionism is um i'll
give you an example of a reduction as of a
reductionist double standard that i caught myself on uh when
kobe bryant died on the forum people were like mourning
for him and i i made a mistake uh i
fell into this trap where um i reduce i'm like
i'm like what's the big deal of mourning kobe bryant's
death because after all all he did was just like
shoot balls into baskets this is so reductionistic basically i
boiled down all of kobe bryant to a guy shooting
balls into a basket and it's like well what's the
big deal about that there's nothing special about that right
but then see if i'm gonna reduce kobe bryant to
just a guy who throws balls into baskets i mean
that's technically true but like i have to do that
now with everything right it's like well what am i
then you know if i if i take that approach
to me what am i i'm just a guy who
sits and yaps his mouth right like what makes me
so special i'm just the guy who yaps his mouth
um or you know what makes what makes anyone special
like basically you can reduce the specialness of anybody with
this kind of reductionistic take and just like boil it
down you know like well what's a scientist a scientist
is like what is albert einstein well albert einstein was
just a guy who sat around thinking all day and
scribbling stuff on a piece of paper like you could
reduce albert einstein you're just a guy who made some
scratch chicken scratches on a piece of paper or um
you can reduce down you know a brilliant scientist who
you know types on a keyboard you can just say
well all he did his whole life was just punch
punch plastic keys but you see um how unfair that
would be i mean you can do that if you
want to do that we have to do that across
the board don't just do it with things that you're
trying to criticize or argue against here's another very general
double standard pattern which is selectively pointing out the hypocrisy
of your enemies or your out group while excusing your
in-group so it's like you know if i'm progressive i'm
going to point out the hypocrisy of all of the
right-wingers but none of the hypocrisy of the left-wingers like
that also an example of a pattern of double standard
is also like straw manning arguments because see what you're
doing when you're straw manning someone's argument is you're taking
their weakest argument and pitting it against your strongest argument
but if you're going to straw me on somebody you
should also then straw man your own position as well
like if you're going to straw man um theism you
also have to now align that with a straw man
of atheism too if you're going to straw man christianity
you also have to straw man science and usually that's
exactly what is not happening when straw manning is happening
because the whole point of a straw man is to
compare apples to oranges to compare the strongest of your
you know position to the weakest of some other position
uh here's another example complaining when somebody is late but
then creating excuses for when you're late here's one complaining
when somebody is doing a bad job at their work
but then letting yourself slide and do bad work at
your job so for example you go to the airport
and let's say the cashier there the flight attendant or
whatever they're not doing their job they're and you're upset
about that but then when you're at work you also
slack off and do don't do a good job but
you don't criticize yourself for that and you don't get
angry at that you don't get outraged over that same
way that you would do when you're at the airport
and you're waiting in line or something like that uh
here's another very general one complaining when somebody makes a
mistake just in general criticizing people for making mistakes mistakes
but then you make mistakes all the time in your
life and you don't beat yourself over the head for
that you don't get outraged when you make a mistake
we all make mistakes how about this double standard criticizing
and judging others for their ignorance or lack of knowledge
but at one point in your life you were also
ignorant and also lacked knowledge and you wouldn't like being
criticized and judged for that you would want some respect
and some understanding and some compassion and finally we've come
to the last double standard this is the mother of
all double standards which is this all double standards basically
boil down to this one you criticize complain and get
outraged when others behave selfishly but you behave selfishly all
the time and you're okay with that so essentially this
is the demonization of survival the double standard is that
you demonize the survival functions of other people and organizations
but not your own and not your own organization or
tribe that's what it all boils down to this is
the crux of selfishness selfishness is literally bias inequality unfairness
hypocrisy that's what selfishness is that's its function the function
of selfishness is to skew reality in your favor selfishness
is the unequal application of standards in order to benefit
your own survival selfishness and survival pressures the mind to
tailor moral principles to its own advantage this is the
weaponization of morality this is the weaponization of ideology it's
a biasing of morality and ideology in service of survival
at the cost of truth now we've discussed a lot
of societal double standards we might say they're culturally um
these double standards that we've been talking about a lot
of them are just like baked into our culture and
while it's important to be aware of some of those
that's not really the most important lessons from this episode
the most important lesson is i want you to notice
your own double standards the double standards within your own
mind that you create never mind what culture and society
creates what does your own mind create what kind of
excuses are you creating so here's an example of a
societal double standard society our culture western culture generally considers
that men who sleep around with women are cool chads
and women who sleep around with men are [ __
] now this is unfair and you can argue about
how to correct this and all that but in the
end that's not important here's an example of one that's
a lot more important here's a double standard that your
own mind creates your own mind can create the double
standard of like capitalism is evil and bad you hate
capitalism but in your own life the way that you're
earning money as soon as you get an opportunity to
make a quick but buck exploiting other people you jump
and seize on it without thinking about it twice and
yet still in your mind you believe capitalism is evil
this is a double standard that your own mind created
this is really what the problem is this is what
you got to work on because you're not going to
fix society's double standards they are what they are culture
changes at its own rate it's not really in your
control what you can control is the double standards that
your own mind holds and how those are applied for
example when you're doing philosophy when you're debating when you're
arguing with people this is where it really matters now
the topic of double standards is easily misused and weaponized
the danger here is that now that i've taught you
about double standards you're like ah okay leo i see
double standards and now you go around and you go
um complaining about all the double standards that exist within
society that's not the point of this episode that's not
what i'm trying to teach you i'm not trying to
make you into a whiner or a victim this can
be badly misused and weaponized for example if you want
you could use this information to go out there and
start to complain about something like you know in school
you might complain like well why don't we teach both
sides of the evolution creationism debate in schools it's such
a double standard that for example we only teach evolution
but not creationism we don't have equal time to both
this would be a weaponization of this topic or for
example with climate change you might say well it's a
double standard that people are talking about climate change then
we're not hearing the opposite side of climate change so
let's hear more about how climate change is fake that's
a mistake and that's a weaponization of double standards for
example white people who cry about white genocide and reverse
racism this is a this is a misuse of double
standard there is no white genocide and reverse racism is
not the same thing as racism conservatives sometimes like to
cry about you know why if there's a gay pride
parade why isn't there a straight pride parade that's a
double standard leo no you're misusing this lesson of double
standard look what you have to understand is that not
everything is equal i'm not trying to teach you some
naive notion of equality here sometimes things deserve to be
treated differently not everything is the same not everything deserves
equal treatment so this is not as simple as it
seems you have to really ask yourself in this case
where there's a double standard where i you know i
suspect there's a double standard is it a genuine double
standard or not or are these two things actually different
and deserve to be treated differently for example when it
comes to many of the double standards between men and
women a lot of these actually are not strictly speaking
double standards they're legitimate in the sense that men and
women are different they have different mindsets different needs different
weaknesses and strengths and psychologies and therefore it is different
for example there is a difference between a man walking
around topless shirtless on the street at the beach whatever
versus a woman there is a difference it's not the
same thing so be careful not to fall into this
simplistic trap like oh well men can go topless why
can't women go topless there's good reasons why women can't
go topless because men are sexually attracted to female breasts
in a very different way than women are attracted to
male breasts that's different that's an important difference a man
easily gets sexually aroused by female breasts a woman not
the same looking at a guy's chest i mean she
can get a little bit turned on but like not
nearly the same thing as what happens when a guy
is looking that's an important difference so that's not strictly
speaking a double standard you know there's cries for example
about affirmative action you know conservatives love to cry about
affirmative action or you know how wrong reparations are um
this is a misuse of this notion of double standard
again this is a weaponization there's actually validity to affirmative
action and reparations this is not simply a double standard
for example people like to cry about oh leo you're
criticizing the right wing so much more than the left
wing that's a double standard no because what you have
to consider is maybe actually the right wing deserves more
criticism than the left see you can't just assume that
they're equal maybe they are but maybe they aren't that's
an empirical question that's not something you could just take
a priority as a given it's possible that the right
wing deserves more criticism it's possible that they're less developed
at least at this point in time maybe in the
future that'll change um you know men love to complain
about double standards with women like they'll say oh women
have it so easy to have sex but again you're
not seeing the asymmetry some dating and sexuality for men
and women are is very asymmetrical for a woman the
challenge of dating is not getting laid yes she can
get laid easily but that doesn't serve her reproductive needs
her reproductive needs are not to get laid her reproductive
needs are to find a guy who's going to stick
around and not run away not pump and dump her
and that is a challenge for many women a serious
challenge it might be even a bigger challenge than it
is for you in cells to get late so um
be careful saying that there's a double standard between how
easy it is for women to get laid and for
men to get laid there's there's there's many asymmetrical trade-offs
that women pay for being women you have to honestly
take a look at that what i see people get
really confused about is when they're trying to compare two
asymmetrical things like the sexuality of a man versus a
woman they're so bad at handling asymmetry because they just
usually people can can be fairly decent and intellectually honest
about um adjudicating a situation where two things are sort
of like two equal sides of the coin they can
kind of be unbiased and a little bit objective in
that sense although even there they can screw that up
easily but where they really struggle is when they're trying
to judge or adjudicate an asymmetrical situation like for example
left wing versus right wing because most people assume that
left wing and right wing are just two polar opposites
and equal things and they try to adjudicate it that
way but that's not how it is left and right
are asymmetrical and people get so confused by that same
thing with you know dating when it comes to men
and women they get really confused by that as well
trick tripped up by that so you have to be
very careful and watch for your justifications and rationalizations of
your double standards another misuse of double standards would be
starting to debate about who's the bigger victim of double
standards you might be tempted to say well okay so
leo taught me about this concept double standards now let
me go out there and you know write blog posts
and shoot videos and podcasts about how big of a
victim my tribe is and i am because i'm part
of this you know group um for the double standards
you know double standards against gay people against black people
against asian people against women against whatever and then you
you turn that into an identity this victim identity and
you start to debate people about how big of a
victim you know who's the bigger victim are black people
the bigger victim or are asian people the bigger victim
or jews the bigger victim or are trans people the
bigger victim this is a mistake that's not what i'm
trying to teach you you're going to waste a lot
of your mental energy doing this and you're not going
to develop yourself in doing this we're not primarily interested
in the double standards that other people are doing to
us we are mostly interested in the double standards that
our own mind is doing to the world you are
guilty of double standards i don't care how big of
a victim you are you're guilty of doing it so
as part of developing yourself what we're interested in is
eliminating double standards within you and that does not mean
treating everything equally men and women should not be treated
equally for example you might say oh well leo you
know men get drafted you know men have to sign
up for the draft if there's a war men get
drafted but women don't and that's unfair that's a double
standard that's not a double standard that's how it should
be there's good reasons for that now maybe we can
tweak some things here and there but just understand that
it's not the same thing to draft men as is
to draft women and there's legitimate reasons for that and
this this apply you can extrapolate this issue to many
other situations not just with men and women but just
across the board in life right so be careful not
to call things double standards when there's a legitimate difference
between them and they need to be treated differently so
this requires intelligence on your part now you might be
wondering ultimately like leo why are you harping on these
double standards why is it so important and here's why
it's actually very important it's more important than almost anybody
realizes here's why because god love and truth is lack
of bias so my mission here is to guide you
towards the highest realizations of god love and truth that's
what i teach i can't do that if you develop
a habit of hypocrisy and holding and arguing with these
kind of gross double standards that most people hold and
being as biased as you are this issue of hypocrisy
is much deeper than most people realize here's what i
want you to understand take this away from this episode
that you are literally too biased to realize god and
to understand what reality is the deepest levels if you
want to really understand god the obstacle to that is
all of your biases and your double standards your mind
is so corrupted by bias and double standards that you
actually don't have and you don't have a clear enough
perception to be able to cognize god because god is
the total absence of bias in order to see god
clearly you have to cleanse your mind of all your
biases and so that's ultimately what the point of this
whole episode is it's actually much more significant than you
would think this episode you might have thought that oh
this is this is about leo criticizing conservatives or leo
you know talking about some problems within society no this
was not i'm not talking about problems i don't care
about who has easier sex or who's more oppressed black
people or trans i don't give a [ __ ]
about that it doesn't matter that's all [ __ ]
i mean it does matter of course i do care
about that on a certain you know human relative level
it matters but in the larger context of what we're
doing here it doesn't matter at all what we really
care about is purifying your mind of your own biases
so that you can access the deepest wisdom and the
highest insights that's what we care about that's why i
talk about bias so much go see my episodes see
my episode called understanding bias see my episode about called
self bias see my other episode called understanding relativism part
one i'm gonna have a part two and a part
three coming up in the future very important episodes it's
this which is preventing you from accessing god not just
you but the majority of mankind 99 of mankind is
so biased they will never understand god and this includes
scientists and academics and progressives you're not appreciating how how
problematic bias is this is not a small thing that
this bias problem is it goes to the very metaphysics
of of reality low conscious people have blatant double standards
now you understand this and you're starting to get a
sense of why that is because selfishness is bias and
god is selflessness so if you want to access god
you have to become selfless which means you have to
give up all your biases and this is why nobody
accesses god very frequently because they don't want to give
up all their biases they're too attached to them the
fundamental problem is that people don't care about truth they
don't see what they're missing by giving up truth they
sacrifice truth as soon as as it's intellectually convenient for
their survival for example the bible says it's easier for
a camel to pass through the eye of a needle
than it is for a rich man to get into
heaven but that's a very inconvenient truth therefore what most
christians do is they pursue wealth and they cherry-pick the
bible for you know those um moral prescriptions which are
convenient for them and then the ones that are not
convenient they ignore those for example jordan peterson he knows
that the bible says it's easier for a camel to
pass through the eye of an eel than this for
rich man to get into heaven and yet he's raking
in millions of dollars doing what he's doing now i
am not i'm not naive enough to think that jordan
peterson is doing what he's doing simply for the money
but still like um you know if i was talking
to jordan peterson i would really press him on this
i would say you know you're you speak about the
bible a lot you talk about all sorts of bible
stories and various kinds of prescriptions moral prescriptions from the
bible and what you should do and what you shouldn't
do but what about this one from the bible you
know if you truly believe in the bible and you
think it's so important you think it's it's the cornerstone
of all of western civilization um how can you ignore
this this most um uh crucial passage that it's easier
for for a camel to pass through the eye of
a needle than for rich man to get into heaven
so i would ask him i mean you're a rich
man you have millions of dollars so are you going
to get into heaven how come and then i would
ask him how come when you're you know when you're
talking against marxism and communism and socialism and progressivism and
all this sort of stuff how come um and you
know you quote the bible a lot as you do
that and you talk about bible stories how come you
never bring up this this problem with capitalism you know
isn't it shouldn't you like re really be troubled by
capitalism because capitalism encourages people to become wealthier and wealthier
doesn't that mean that they're not going to be getting
into heaven and isn't the whole point of what you're
teaching to help people get into heaven how do you
square that isn't that a double standard that you hold
see you might think that this is just some sort
of like debate point or some sort of like minor
equivalent but it's not a minor quibble like literally what
i'm saying is that jordan peterson is unable to realize
god because of the double standards he holds in his
mind that's how serious this is and most likely he
will die not realizing god himself as god because of
the double standards he holds and the money he earns
for holding those double standards because he earns a lot
of money for holding those double standards and look i
don't i don't begrudge him any of that um i
have nothing against money if he wants to make millions
of dollars that's fine i don't have a problem making
millions of dollars myself right and i can do that
you might say well leo aren't you rich too though
um i'm i'm pretty wealthy i'm i'm not as wealthy
as jordan peterson i don't rake in that kind of
money but i'm i'm not i'm not doing bad for
myself um however here's the difference the difference is that
i'm i'm i'm very aware of my biases i've cleansed
my mind of enough by like you don't have to
be perfect at this i'm not claiming to have cleansed
all of my biases i've cleansed enough of my bias
to the point where i realize that i'm god right
so i've already achieved that so whether i earn money
now or not it's irrelevant at this point although still
i would say that i still have more growth to
do and i still notice that my desire to chase
for success and fame and money i have to hold
myself back from that i could do more of what
jordan peterson like is doing like i could go on
hundreds of podcasts i could orchestrate that um i could
do a bunch of interviews i could get my name
out there i could start taking very uh kind of
like controversial um hot button political positions just you know
to get more viral exposure i could reduce my video
duration you know from like three hour long videos to
10 minute long videos i could do that i could
restructure all my content to make millions more dollars and
if i do that that will [ __ ] my
development i will also ultimately have to sell myself out
um i could appeal to a lot more people by
playing up to their biases i would have a lot
more money and by doing that i would prevent myself
from accessing the deepest aspects of of spirituality that i
still have yet more work to do to access so
i'm very cognizant of that and i've sacrificed a lot
of money what most people don't realize is how many
millions i've sacrificed um to get to where i'm at
right now in my consciousness like literally i've put my
business on i've crippled my own business in order to
become more conscious of god i had to do that
so there's a lot of wisdom in this saying i
don't know was it jesus who said this that it's
easier for a camel to pass through the eye of
a needle than for a rich man to get into
heaven there's a lot of truth to that now that's
not an absolute statement that doesn't mean that a rich
man can't become enlightened it's possible but there's also it
also presents some serious challenges there's a good reason he
said that because the chasing of mon it's not really
the money itself that's the problem it's everything you're doing
to procure the money and secure the money and then
the money becomes an addiction you want to chase more
of it it becomes a never-ending cycle and then you
end up chasing money your whole life and you get
so busy doing that that you have no time to
actually meditate to do psychedelics to contemplate to reflect on
your self biases which is exactly jordan peterson's problem like
if jordan peterson wants to realize he's god he has
to stop what he's doing for a couple of years
and just like sit down and [ __ ] contemplate
and do psychedelics do meditation do all that stuff read
books and then he can do that but but to
do that he he'd have to surrender probably 10 million
dollars is he going to do that i don't know
that's hard that's very hard to do because you know
it's tempting i if somebody handed me a suitcase with
10 million dollars and said hey look for the next
three years don't meditate and don't do any spiritual work
here's 10 million dollars i would be tempted you know
that's that's good money i mean like i can live
off that for the rest of my life i'd be
tempted to do that now hopefully i would i would
say no but you know i don't even know luckily
i don't have that problem uh so fundamentally you have
to understand that your mind does not want fairness it
doesn't like fairness you think you like fairness you actually
don't if you got an actual taste of fairness you
probably cry what you really want is you want things
skewed in your favor notice that you only complain with
things are skewed against you when things are skewed towards
you you don't complain about that that itself is a
major double standard that you hold most people hold people
without double standards are quite rare you should notice this
people with high intellectual integrity these these are rare people
mostly what you find out there in the intellect in
the intellectual uh space on youtube on social media on
mainstream tv all this kind of stuff these so-called intellectuals
and thinkers and speakers um they're deeply deeply biased finding
a human being who is truly unbiased is so rare
it's such a gift if you find such a person
it's such a gift if you find such a teacher
such a mentor such a friend such a lover such
a parent so rare so rare this is so precious
and people don't appreciate it i hope this episode convinces
you to appreciate this more to look for these kinds
of people and when you find them to to befriend
them and to make the best use of them it
requires so much consciousness and commitment to truth and enormous
levels of self-reflection and integrity and lots of admitting your
own biases to let go of all your double standards
so what i suggest to you if you really want
to develop yourself and reach the highest potential that you
have as a human being is and within spirituality especially
is i want you to commit to this project over
the next few decades of your life to eliminate as
many of your double standards from your mind as possible
understanding that the payoff at the end of all that
will that will be that you'll be able to um
to reach levels of truth and awakening that are superhuman
that no other human has reached because they haven't gone
through this process and understanding that there is a serious
cost to lack of intellectual integrity which is that you
have a divided mind all these double standards these are
boundaries that you're drawing within your own mind and you
have to reinforce these boundaries these boundaries are fragmenting and
dividing your mind and god is unity god is a
united mind and in the end everything you're working towards
in this spiritual work is the unification of a divided
mind all of the bad intellectual habits that you picked
up from society from media from culture from friends from
family and others from school from business from the pursuit
of sex and money and fame all of these have
divided your mind fragmented your mind and now the rest
of your life if you're interested in actualizing yourself is
a process of stitching your mind back together again unifying
all the fragments until eventually you reach absolute unity which
is god that's what i suggest you attempt you'd have
to be pretty wise to see the importance of doing
this most people won't see the importance of it because
it doesn't give you an immediate you know easy quick
return on investment it's a long term process it's only
going to pay off years later if you wish to
do this then start looking for and systematically weeding out
all of your double standards catch yourself in the very
act of committing a double standard holding a double standard
arguing from a double standard catch yourself in the act
this is going to require introspection i have an older
episode called developing introspection go watch that it'll help you
to do this now you might say but leo what
about your double standards in hypocrisy aren't you guilty of
double standards i i've seen some of your episodes and
it seems like you've been guilty of this stuff in
the past and certainly i am guilty of holding double
standards and i am guilty of hypocrisy for sure you'll
find some of that in my work my work is
not spotless i'm doing the best i can with what
i got and i got i got some ego mine
i got corruptions i got bad habits that i picked
up in my youth and so forth um and all
of this is really just a part of the topic
of self-deception and remember in my self-deception series at the
end of that in part three i very much deliberately
stressed that i am not immune to self-deception i do
the best i can i'm better than most people but
i'm not immune to it and in the end that's
all you can do is you can you know you
can strive to do your best i can give you
a whole list of examples of of my own hypocrisies
and how i caught myself in double standards for example
i've caught myself in double standards and hypocrisy when it
comes to leftist politics and progressivism definitely part of that
is there my mind got infected with that as i
was you know learning progressive politics it's hard to avoid
that because there's so much so many so much bias
within all the progressive media sources um i've caught myself
holding double standards when it comes to doing philosophy having
certain biases against certain philosophies and towards other ones arguing
about a philosophy you know for for my my favorite
philosophy and against some other philosophy and using double standards
in my arguments i've done that in the past not
so much on camera but like i mean in the
past when i was like studying philosophy back in university
also um when it comes to science atheism skepticism again
i'm not talking about what i do on camera i'm
talking about stuff that i did in the past when
i was you know back in university and and so
forth you know really thinking deeply about science atheism skepticism
going through that phase of my life you know i
had i had a lot of double standards there that
i had to catch which ultimately allowed me to deconstruct
science atheism and skepticism because those are built on double
standards i had to deconstruct all those you have to
understand that you might think oh leo is so unscientific
and anti-scientific and anti-atheist and anti-skeptic and all that no
i was the biggest most scientific most rational um atheistic
and skeptical person uh before i you know did a
lot of work to deconstruct all that i jailbroke my
mind from science i had to do that to reach
higher levels of consciousness i had a lot of double
standards i had to correct there and i had to
identify which allowed me to do that which i help
you to do like in my deconstructing the myth of
science part 1 2 3 series a lot of that
is just pointing out the double standards of science and
then deconstructing those we did a little bit of that
even here today um when i got into pickup again
this is a long time ago before i even begin
actually.org i got into pickup and i noticed that some
of the attitudes towards women and sex that i adopted
there uh were also hypocritical and i had double standards
there i had to correct those maybe i still have
i i do still have maybe a little bit of
lingering hypocrisy there that i'm going to correct going forward
some bias there um but uh it used to be
a lot worse i corrected uh plenty of that in
doing this work with actualize.org um i notice and catch
myself sometimes when i'm moderating on the forum giving out
warning points to people for bad behavior i sometimes notice
myself giving out warning points to somebody and then i
realize wait a minute last week i just did the
same thing myself and here i am giving out warning
points shouldn't i be giving warning points to myself i
notice that i'm very cognizant of that and then i
use that to try to correct my behavior in the
future to make myself more integrated more consistent um again
i'm not i'm not perfect at that i still make
mistakes in that respect um it's a it's an evolutionary
process uh i've caught myself in double double standards when
it comes to criticizing other people's selfishness a lot of
times i'll judge somebody for being selfish and i realize
but wait a minute i'm [ __ ] selfish too
also um i've caught myself criticizing other people for being
hypocrites but then i noticed wait a minute i'm hypocritical
too that's sort of a meta hypocrisy is criticizing hypocrites
for being hypocrites even though you're a hypocrite paradox of
hypocrisy um i noticed myself having double standards and criticisms
of public intellectuals and spiritual teachers i'm very careful about
that these days and i'm going to eliminate all that
going forward i noticed double standards in terms of my
criticism of ignorant people and of the lower stages of
spiral dynamics so a lot of times i can tend
to kind of like look down and be dismissive of
the lower stages and then i have to remind myself
wait a minute but i had to go through those
lower stages too i had to go through a blue
stage i had to go through an orange stage i
had to go through a green stage and you know
who am i to criticize these stages when i had
to go through that myself a lot of times i
criticized people for selling out for being grifters for chasing
after money for you know various kinds of shady marketing
tactics but i went through a phase of that too
before i started actualizing i went through a phase of
that myself so who am i to criticize um so
i can be hypocritical on that point um sometimes i
have a double standard in that i'm you know i
take a sort of shot and freuda or uh sort
of a glee and seeing the cancellation of other people
but then when i think about it like well would
i be happy if i got cancelled so i'm very
careful about cancellations um i'm very careful not to call
for the cancellation of people generally speaking although some some
scoundrels do deserve it um but like i'm very careful
about that because i want to make sure that i
don't have a double standard when it comes to cancellation
um other double standards sometimes i've noticed that my criticisms
of vegans have had double standards within them and bias
something i'm going to eliminate i notice when it comes
to environmentalism like theoretically i'm very pro-environmentalist but then when
it comes to actually my own personal life i noticed
that i'm not as green as i could be like
i could reduce my carbon footprint more um and i've
been kind of neglectful in that respect because i've just
been focusing on other more important things and in that
sense i have double standards that i'm kind of a
hypocrite you know i love to criticize big oil companies
but then i still fuel up my car and so
forth so in that sense i'm guilty um yeah so
just and more examples along these lines for example in
relationships i noticed double standards for example i might expect
a girlfriend of mine to accommodate my needs and think
of her as being selfish when she's not doing that
but then i might not be as accommodating to her
needs and yet i don't think of myself as selfish
for doing that so relationships is sort of a category
that um i haven't talked about yet but it's actually
very important like if you want to have smooth relationships
you have to be very careful that you don't hold
a lot of bias or double standards with respect to
your spouse girlfriend boyfriend or family members because that's going
to create a imbalance and then it's going to create
unnecessary drama intentions and battle and it's going to corrupt
your relationships so that's sort of a it's actually a
very important topic that i sort of like didn't mention
until now so make sure you realize the importance of
double standards in relationships so in conclusion be vigilant when
you're making justifications and rationalizations introspective for double standards you'll
often be shocked at how often you have a sneaky
double standard lurking in there the general principle is this
whatever bar you set for yourself you have to cl
or i mean whatever bar you set for some other
person to clear you have to be able to clear
that bar too for example if if you don't want
other people cursing you have to be able to clear
that bar yourself if you don't want other people um
like if you're gonna criticize people for sexual scandals you
have to have your own sexual cravings under control if
you're gonna be um you know expecting and demanding other
people to be on time you have to be on
time if you demand and expect other people to put
out stellar work exceptional work flawless work with no mistakes
you have to be able to do it too and
if you can't then you have to ease up and
lower your bar for others if you want others to
be non-partisan you have to be nonpartisan if you want
others to be non-biased you have to be non-biased if
you want others to be selfless you have to be
selfless if you want others to not be dramatic and
emotional you have to have your emotions under control see
this is intellectual honesty the cultivation of intellectual honesty is
something that really isn't taught in school but it's so
important so important this is one of the things that's
destroying our culture and our politics right now is that
there's so little intellectual honesty with many of the actors
who are talking about politics and culture and this means
that it's impossible to have a genuine dialogue instead what
we have is just people barking at each other and
demonizing each other it's tribal warfare the culture wars uh
here's a tip for you make a distinction in your
mind of bad faith actors bad faith actors or people
who have no intellectual integrity and who do not care
about integrity or truth these would be people like sean
hannity tucker carlson uh ben shapiro these are bad faith
actors alex jones now i mean i mentioned some of
the very obvious cases of people on the on the
right you can also find maybe some bad faith actors
on people on the left um but in general you
should not listen to people who are bad faith actors
you should not communicate with them you should not try
to debate with them stop debating with bad faith actors
it's a complete waste of your time only engage in
dialogue with people who have a relatively high level of
intellectual integrity this will save you a lot of hassle
and just spinning your wheels intellectually spinning your wheels that's
that's mostly what the public intellectual discourse is that we
see whether it's about politics or god or religion or
science most of it is just intellectual spinning of the
wheels so be very careful that like you don't waste
decades and yeah years and decades of your life just
intellectually spinning your wheels getting nowhere it's very easy to
get caught in these sorts of traps certain youtube channels
you can subscribe to certain podcasts you listen to the
people you listen to all they're doing is just intellectually
spinning their wheels they're not actually making progress intellectually towards
anything they're not actually developing their mind they're not ever
going to reach awakening ever they're not ever going to
understand what god is or spirituality is or what truth
is or what sign they're never going to understand what
religion is what healthy politics is they're never going to
understand these things because they're just intellectually spitting their wheels
mentally masturbating going over the same [ __ ] over
and over and over again just debating it endlessly if
you're going to be investing in intellectual development make sure
that you're getting some payoff for it that there's progress
and evolution in your mind every year your mind should
be evolving to new stages and levels of development so
to wrap this up here's a homework assignment for you
if you want to take this seriously the homework assignment
is to start catching yourself in these double standards especially
when you're criticizing judging or complaining about others that's when
you catch yourself the most and to help along with
this i have two questions for you right this write
these down this is your homework assignment number one what
are all the ways in which i am a hypocrite
make a long list number two what are all of
my double standards make a list add these to your
commonplace book if you don't know what a commonplace book
is go check out my episode called how to keep
a commonplace book very practical one there add this to
your commonplace book and keep adding to this list so
brainstorm some stuff right now to get this list started
but then you're not going to be able to brainstorm
all of them just sitting on your couch you have
to actually in the act while you're online leaving comments
criticizing arguing complaining debating with people as you're complaining and
debating with your family members your spouse your girlfriend your
boyfriend your friends whatever your co-workers as you're doing all
that catch yourself in the double standards and then add
them to the list and keep growing it keep growing
the list of all the ways in which you're hypocrite
and then you're gonna have to surrender all those and
as you do that your mind will purify the divisions
in your mind will heal and you will be able
to gain access to higher states of consciousness and deeper
insights into the nature of reality in god ultimately i
hope you can see the important role of becoming more
principled just more principled period the role this plays towards
your overall development and towards that end go make sure
