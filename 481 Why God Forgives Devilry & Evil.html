            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/J0KwqCGl_F8' target='_blank'>Why God Forgives Devilry & Evil</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>God as Infinite Consciousness Includes All, Even Devilry and Evil</b>: Expanded consciousness or 'God', as described in the video, is an infinite entity that includes everything in existence, even what we perceive as devilry and evil. Leo suggests that God, being everything, can imagine and realize all possible experiences and entities, ranging from angels and demons to various life forms, and even extreme human actions like war and genocide. 
</li><li><b>Concept of Oneness</b>: The video introduces the concept of oneness, according to which everything is interconnected and no object or event can exist independently. This implies that our existence as finite beings is contingent on the existence of the infinite, i.e., God.
</li><li><b>We Are 'God' Experiencing Life through a Finite Perspective</b>: Leo propounds the idea that we, as aspects of everything, are in essence 'God' incarnated, experiencing life from a finite human perspective. This suggests that God is not separate from us but rather experiences life through us.
</li><li><b>God as Infinite Consciousness Is Beyond Judgment</b>: Given its encompassing nature, God, or infinite consciousness, transcends judgment and condemnation of any kind. Leo explains that God cannot judge or condemn anything because, in doing so, it would be denying parts of itself, which would contradict the concept of absolute oneness.
</li><li><b>Expanding Consciousness Leads to Understanding and Acceptance of Everything</b>: A salient point shared in the video is that by expanding consciousness to embrace everything, we can understand and accept all aspects of reality. This means releasing biases and accepting experiences that may seem intensely negative or 'devilish', recognizing these as aspects of the ultimate truth.
</li><li><b>The Material Discordance Between God's Perspective and Human Understanding</b>: The video acknowledges the profound discordance between God's infinite perspective and human understanding, which is often rooted in fear, judgment, and denial of 'evil'. These inherent limitations of human consciousness make it difficult for individuals to understand or accept the notion of God's neutrality and lack of judgment. 
</li><li><b>Devilry as Act of Human Consciousness, Not God's Condemnation</b>: A key narrative in the video is the idea that 'devilry' is essentially a set of actions that come from the human ego, and not from God or infinite consciousness. These actions emerge from the human mind's self-serving tendencies, where it enjoys the benefits of acting in harmful or exploitative ways toward others. However, God doesn't judge or condemn these actions because it understands that it is its own creation, thus embodying the concept of unconditional love. 
</li><li><b>Understanding the Concept of Infinity and Surrendering Selfhood</b>: The video explores the concept of 'selflessness'. It introduces the idea that God is selfless in the sense that it is not bound by a finite self or a lowercase 's' self. It explains that God, being a boundless entity, can take on infinite forms and selves, which underscores the significance of surrendering selfhood in order to truly understand the infinite nature of God or consciousness.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Embracing All Aspects of Reality and Overcoming Biases</b>: In the video, Leo emphasizes that attachment, desires, and biases hinder the understanding and acceptance of reality. He suggests that these attachments lead to feelings of hatred towards elements of reality that do not comply with such desires. Therefore, only by detaching from our individual desires and embracing all aspects of reality, including the good and evil, can we truly expand our consciousness and understand the nature of God. 
</li><li><b>Transcending Ego and Embodying Infinite Consciousness</b>: Leo explores the possibility of life beyond ego and bodily attachments. By giving up finite desires and biases, he suggests that one can embrace their infinite self and transcend physical form, thereby experiencing and understanding the true nature of ultimate consciousness or God.
</li><li><b>Recognizing and Embracing All Aspects of Existence</b>: A key takeaway from the video is that the key to higher consciousness is to not only recognize but accept and embody all aspects of existence, both good and evil. Leo suggests that only by fully embodying these aspects of existence can one transcend fear, pain, suffering, and death, and live without being hindered by the safety of their physical being. 
</li><li><b>God as the Vehicle of Forgiveness</b>:  Leo points out that as God is everything, it also includes forgiveness. This recognition of oneself in others cultivates the capacity to forgive, and leads to a higher level of consciousness where one can experience the state of being God or infinite consciousness.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Expanding Consciousness and Appreciating the Diversity of Existence</b>: Leo argues that true perfection lies in the infinite and inclusive nature of consciousness or God, rather than in specific material things or experiences. He emphasizes the limiting nature of clinging to one form of existence and proposes that embracing all aspects of reality leads to true perfection.
</li><li><b>Human Consciousness and its Limitations</b>: The video discusses the idea of 'conscious choice' in reincarnating into different beings. It critiques the human-centric perspective, emphasizing the limitations faced by humans while contrasting it with the expansive consciousness of God or infinite consciousness.
</li><li><b>God's Compassion Towards the Finite Consciousness</b>: Leo argues that God, being infinitely conscious, understands and accepts the unique challenges and limitations faced by finite conscious entities, such as humans. He states that God's compassion extends so deeply that it does not attempt to disrupt the trials and tribulations faced by humans, as these experiences serve as tests of human's capacity to love and expand consciousness.
</li><li><b>True Happiness Lies in Expanding Consciousness and Capacity to Love</b>: The video proposes that true satisfaction and self-actualization do not lie in material wealth, luxury, and exclusivity, but in expanding one's capacity to love and contemplate the infinite. Leo advises avoiding narrow thinking and experiences since these can potentially lead to an unsatisfying existence.
</li><li><b>Forgiveness as a Path to Higher Consciousness and True Happiness</b>: Leo proposes that true value and happiness lie in forgiveness and realization of our inherent divinity. He suggests incorporating practices such as yoga, meditation, and visualization to enhance our capacity to love and forgive, surpassing material pursuits to achieve true happiness.
</li><li><b>Importance of Personal Experience and Direct Consciousness</b>: Leo emphasizes the value of direct experience and consciousness in personal transformation. He cautions against intellectualizing spiritual concepts without applying them in real life, which can lead to feelings of misery and depression. He advocates bridging the gap between theory and personal experience to truly benefit from spiritual exploration.
</li><li><b>The Challenges in Embodying Spiritual Teachings</b>: Leo talks about the difficulties in embodying the concepts he shares. He acknowledges that while he professionally talks about it, he too struggles to experience these concepts firsthand and advocates the need for a continual process of learning, making mistakes, and correction.
</li><li><b>Perseverance and Effective Use of Time</b>: The video encourages perseverance in the spiritual journey, which is typically marked by backslides, confusion, and changes in approach. Leo urges making effective use of time as it is a limited resource.
</li><li><b>Resisting Complacency and Challenging Self</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of seriously considering consciousness exploration and avoiding distractions. He conveys the need to challenge oneself, avoid complacency, and expand consciousness.
</li><li><b>God as infinite consciousness</b>: God, in the form of infinite consciousness, is all that exists. There is nothing outside of it, therefore it encompasses everything possible. God does not forgive selectively but forgives entirely because not doing so would mean it is not accepting itself completely, and it would be in conflict with itself. Being fully conscious of everything that is truth, there is a full acceptance and surrender to what is - a form of unlimited love for self as creator and creation.
</li><li><b>Interplay of finite and infinite selves</b>: A finite lower case self is a survival-oriented entity that finds it necessary to exclude other selves for its own survival. This results in struggles to forgive perceived threats from other selves. However, the infinite Self that is God is not attached to particular Selves as God exists as the superposition of all possible selves. It is entirely selfless and does not care about finite survival issues, and can therefore forgive and accept all.
</li><li><b>Struggles of the finite self</b>: The failure to forgive stems from the survival biases of the finite self and its attachments to certain outcomes, which leads to the repulsion of and hatred for certain aspects of reality. All things the finite self desires are self-serving as they make the self feel good in some way. As such, forgiveness and acceptance of all facets of reality is limited to the concerns of the finite self.
</li><li><b>Role of selflessness in forgiveness</b>: When one is infinitely selfless, one automatically forgives everything as there is a full acceptance of every experience without attachments and without care for how events unfurl. This form of unlimited love underlies the acceptance and surrender to all facets of reality. 
</li><li><b>God as the perpetrator and the victim</b>: From the finite human perspective, it is possible to demonize and hate aspects of existence that seem evil. But this is not so for God, the infinite Self, which is both the perpetrator and victim simultaneously in any given situation. This is difficult for the finite self to understand due to the separation between self and other. However, the consciousness of God allows it to assume all roles without hating or judging any. 
</li><li><b>Forgiveness as understanding</b>: From a higher consciousness perspective, forgiveness equates to understanding and accepting ignorance, unconsciousness, and oneself in all its forms. As humans grow more understanding and loving, they can become more selfless and ultimately realize infinite consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Challenge of lower consciousness</b>: Holding personal biases and attachments at a low level of consciousness leaves individuals continually challenged by forgiveness. They remain stuck in identifying as their narrow finite selves, fixated on their survival agendas and unable to rise to higher consciousness where they can recognize and embody their essential infinite selves.
</li><li><b>God's Infinite Consciousness and Oneness</b>: The video suggests that God, as defined in the video as infinite consciousness, is everything, with no exclusions or exceptions. This idea is challenging for humans to accept as it includes the abstraction of both good and evil by implying that we are collectively everything that exists, including entities or events we personally detest or fear. This extreme openness of consciousness removes the illusion of differentiation between objects or events.
</li><li><b>Forgiveness through Understanding</b>: The video emphasizes that God forgives everyone because all atrocities committed are attempts at survival by people struggling in difficult circumstances. An example is given of a child growing up in abusive conditions, who might turn into what society terms as a 'monster'. The video points out that God, as the creator of all, consciously understands and accepts these circumstances, which allows for radical forgiveness.
</li><li><b>Transcending human biases</b>: The video underscores that, with elevated consciousness, one can transcend human biases and distinctions such as 'good' and 'bad' or 'pain' and 'pleasure.' It indicates that through eradicating these biases, we can start to appreciate the oneness and sameness of vastly different experiences or entities. The video pushes this concept to an extreme by proposing that the difference between enjoyable and painful experiences, like having an orgasm and being hit in the face with a baseball bat, is illusionary and primarily based on survival instincts. 
</li><li><b>The Nature of Love</b>: A radical level of consciousness is presented where life and death merge into a unified pure infinite consciousness, pointing out that this realisation is synonymous with pure love. The video portrays love not only as a human emotion but as a profound metaphysical experience, transcending personal desires and survival instincts.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Love</b>: Love is characterized as the realization that there are no fundamental differences between things. In essence, it is the absence of all forms of bias. When this is fully realized, infinite love, infinite truth, and infinite self-acceptance are experienced because there is no rejection of any aspect of reality due to fear of suffering. 
</li><li><b>Integration of Experiences</b>: Acknowledging that theres no difference between anything suggests that everything should be equally acceptable and experienced. Subsequently, when all forms of bias and self-interest are relinquished, one becomes infinitely conscious and willing to experience everything  a state of ultimate self-acceptance and immortality.
</li><li><b>Path to Infinite Consciousness</b>: The path to infinite consciousness involves continuously sacrificing personal desires, goals, and attachments to embrace the totality of existence. The process involves relinquishing more and more of the finite self and biases to discover and embrace the infinite self, which might even involve the dissolution of physical form.
</li><li><b>Understanding Evil</b>: Evil is part of the universal existence and should be neither avoided nor fought against. Rather it should be acknowledged, understood, and owned as a part of oneself. This realization can lead to an end of resistance towards pain, suffering, and death, in turn leading to transcendence over these phenomena at an existential level.
</li><li><b>Transcending Death</b>: The prospect of transcending death, though radical and complicated, involves developing a level of consciousness that is fine with the physical death of the body. This requires an impermanence of consciousness that is difficult to maintain.
</li><li><b>Concept of Forgiveness</b>: Forgiveness, from the God or infinite consciousness perspective, is a process of acknowledging that everything, including the so-called evil or sin, is part of its own existence. The acts likened to devilry, regarded as evil by humans, are perceived by infinite consciousness (God) as its own creation and manifestation, hence not distinct from it. 
</li><li><b>Human Perception of Perfection</b>: Human perception of perfection is finite and deeply personal, encompassing ideas of success, physical attractiveness, and ideal living conditions among other things. However, such a perception essentially excludes a vast range of experiences, hence is an imperfect understanding of the absolute perfection.
</li><li><b>Absolute Perfection</b>: The true idea of perfection, from an absolute or God-like perspective, is inclusive, recognizing every aspect and form of existence. This idea acknowledges that the entire scope of existence, from human ideals to devilish behaviors, are all expressions of the same infinite consciousness. Absolute perfection, therefore, is inferred as embracing the infinite over the finite.
</li><li><b>God's Infinite Consciousness</b>: God, being infinitely conscious, encompasses everything. The bias and limited experiences of human are seen as perfection from a human perspective, but from an infinitely conscious point of view, these are seen as limited. God's infinite consciousness also includes the conscience of humans and their limited desires.
</li><li><b>Bias in Human Perspective</b>: Humans often have biases that lead to a limited perspective of life. They might picture perfection based on certain aspects of life like beauty, wealth, places, or relationships. However, from God's perspective, all aspects of life including the good and the bad, are equally beautiful.
</li><li><b>Objective Perfection in Infinity</b>: Perfection from the most objective point of view of infinite consciousness is infinity. From this perspective, the best is everything. No one part of infinity can be the best because this would exclude another part, which is against the concept of wholeness.
</li><li><b>Expand Consciousness Beyond Physical Limitations</b>: As humans raise their level of consciousness, the desire to embrace the totality of existence increases. They want to experience every possible aspect of life on earth, from every culture and location, to every physical appearance.
</li><li><b>Limitations of Human Consciousness</b>: The limitations of human consciousness lead to suffering and dissatisfaction. Humans are prone to frustrations and judgment, both towards others and themselves. These negative feelings arise from their limited perspective and attachments.
</li><li><b>Concept of Forgiveness and Acceptance</b>: God's infinite consciousness allows it to accept everything, including human ignorance, selfishness, and judgments. It does not wish to stop human nightmares, as that would contradict its nature of being everything. This acceptance and forgiveness are what makes God completely selfless.
</li><li><b>Increasing Capacity to Love and Acceptance</b>: God's dream for humans is to increase their capacity to love more of reality and raise the bar of consciousness higher and higher. The more humans can learn to love and accept, the more they can align themselves with God's infinite consciousness and expand their perspective.
</li><li><b>Purpose of Existence</b>: The ultimate purpose of existence is to expand one's capacity to love until they reach infinity. The challenges and nightmares humans face in life serve as tests of their love and capacity to raise their consciousness.
</li><li><b>God's Forgiveness and Consciousness Expansion</b>: The transcript elaborates on the idea that spiritual self-growth and becoming more 'godlike' is linked to expanding one's capacity to love and forgive. Life is understood as a series of challenging experiences that 'rub us the wrong way' causing suffering and pain. As we surrender to these experiences, our psyche expands, we become more loving, and less resistive.
</li><li><b>Mistake of Ignoring Challenges</b>: Wealthy people often isolate themselves from the realities of life, creating a 'walled garden' around themselves to avoid challenges. They cherry-pick every aspect of life with their wealth, powers, and fame. However, this created bubble is easy to penetrate, and their life becomes an exhausting task of maintaining this facade.
</li><li><b>Growth through Embracing Reality</b>: True self-actualization and satisfaction lie not in isolation or wealth but in embracing the challenges that life throws at us. As we learn to handle them and expand our consciousness, we become more 'godlike.'
</li><li><b>Expansiveness of Consciousness</b>: Leo suggests that thinking and operating from a 'limited' perspective, cherry-picking life aspects is thinking too small. The real scale of consciousness is expansive, and it is this expansiveness that can lead to true happiness and satisfaction.
</li><li><b>Chasing the Wrong Goals</b>: Materialistic pursuits, such as acquiring billions of dollars, vast real estate, or sexual partners, are pointed out as metrics of happiness that people ordinarily chase. However, these 'finite' pursuits do not lead to genuine happiness.
</li><li><b>Relevance of Forgiveness</b>: Leo suggests that becoming more godlike and ultimately happier requires practicing forgiveness. A forgiving attitude is a way to understand and accept the ignorance and unconsciousness of others and oneself. 
</li><li><b>Increasing the Capacity to Forgive</b>: Leo suggests that while one cannot attain the highest level of forgiveness (rated 10), since we are finite human beings, we can certainly improve our capacity to forgive through practices such as meditation, yoga, and self-inquiry.
</li><li><b>Maintaining Healthy Expectations</b>: Recognizing our finite nature and limitations is crucial when striving for spiritual growth. While it's important to strive for improvement, it's equally necessary, not to burden oneself with unrealistic expectations.
</li><li><b>Spiritual Journey's Challenges</b>: Spirituality is a challenging and non-linear journey. It encompasses confusion, changes in approach, backslides, and mistakes. Leo emphasizes the importance of perseverance, avoiding catastrophic mistakes, and effectively utilizing time.
</li><li><b>Purpose of sharing stories</b>: The point of sharing personal mystical experiences and exploring infinite states of consciousness is to present new possibilities and opportunities for personal transformation, not just to entertain or fascinate. 
</li><li><b>Language limitations</b>: Language is a limited tool for sharing these experiences because they are ineffable and incommunicable, only grasped through direct personal experience.
</li><li><b>Absence of these themes in mainstream discourse</b>: Few platforms in mainstream culture discuss consciousness transformation, hence the need for these talks to introduce and explore these concepts. 
</li><li><b>Awareness and self-application</b>: Awareness of these concepts does not equate to transformation. Direct personal experience and application of the concepts are required to effectuate real change. 
</li><li><b>Dramatization and exaggeration</b>: Sometimes ideas are exaggerated or dramatized to make them seem more appealing or inspiring to the audience, but this in no way oversells their actual significance. Efforts are made to market the truth and stress its importance in a way that cuts through societal programming and humdrum thinking.
</li><li><b>Practical techniques</b>: Practical techniques are provided to help viewers apply these concepts and principles in their daily lives. However, reluctance or unwillingness to use these techniques undermines a person's commitment to consciousness expansion and personal growth.
</li><li><b>Importance of action</b>: Understanding the theories and owning the right tools doesn't mean actual progress. Only applying the techniques and taking direct steps towards personal transformationno matter how tediouswill lead to real change.
</li><li><b>Dangers of complacency and procrastination</b>: The video warns against the dangers of complacency and procrastination, emphasizing the need to continually challenge oneself and strive for growth. The longer one waits to get serious about life, the more difficult it becomes to change course.
</li><li><b>Role of Leo</b>: Leo serves as a guide to keep viewers on track, reminding them of what life is about, sharing potential pitfalls and distractions, and highlighting ways to avoid self-deception and biases that can hamper personal transformation.
</li><li><b>Offer of resources</b>: Various resourcesboth free and paidare offered on Actualized.org to aid individuals on their journey, from a book list that provides key theoretical grounding and practical techniques to a life purpose course designed to spark lifelong motivation.
</li><li><b>Intrinsic motivation and inspiration are crucial for success</b>: Leo emphasizes that being inspired or "filled with spirit" is integral to achieving any form of success. He attributes his discussions in his episodes to the spirit or universe speaking through him, or in his words, a 'meat vehicle'.
</li><li><b>Gura's content is aimed at expanding perspectives</b>: He mentions his blog and other platforms where he shares interesting and high consciousness content. He also mentions a secondary channel featuring smaller segments of his main videos for those who might not have the patience for the full-length talks.
</li><li><b>Importance of direct consciousness and experiences</b>: Leo explains that merely understanding his teachings at an intellectual level may lead to dissatisfaction and even depression. He states this is due to a disconnect between a beautiful, loving conceptual understanding of life and the realities of one's life. He encourages the application of the theory to life after spending sufficient time learning it.
</li><li><b>Leo speaks about actualizing verses embodying concepts</b>: He admits he speaks about various concepts that he has not fully actualized himself. However, he explains that this should not limit the viewers because understanding and contemplating these theories are part of growth. He confesses that he suffers from being trapped in conceptualization and admits that true growth would come faster from focusing solely on spiritual and developmental practices.
</li><li><b>Differences in Leo's teaching and embodying skills</b>: Leo acknowledges that he has a stronger ability to communicate ideas than to embody them. Despite this, he emphasizes the importance of embodying these teachings and admits that he is making more concerted efforts toward achieving this. He highlights that the spiritual journey is messy and non-linear and encourages perseverance and effective learning from mistakes.
</li><li><b>Reality & Challenges of Conscious Exploration</b>: Gura warns about the potential problems of not actualizing what he discusses, and admits struggling with this himself despite actualization being his professional work. He reiterates the disconnection between conceptualizing these ideas and embodying them. He explains life transformations are gradual and involve making mistakes, correcting, and growing, which can be a tedious and non-linear personal process. 
</li><li><b>Consideration of time limits</b>: Leo makes a mention of the finite nature of time and the need to utilize it effectively. Reflecting on this, he advises viewers to avoid repeating the same mistakes over an extended period, as this could become a detriment to growth and success. 
</li><li><b>Transitioning from theory to practice</b>: He advises taking the teachings from a theoretical phase to a practical phase after a certain period of learning. Without application, he warns that the teachings could become counterproductive and even lead to feelings of misery and depression due to a disconnect between theory and real life. 
</li><li><b>(Warnings and Disclaimers)</b>: Gura reiterates warnings about potential setbacks and obstacles that are bound to arise during the spiritual journey or pursuit of personal development. He advises viewers to prepare for these challenges and to make sure they learn from their mistakes and avoid repetition. He emphasizes that time is a limited resource and that it should be utilized optimally.
