            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/sPug0GxWQNg' target='_blank'>How To Shop For Healthy Food</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Importance of mastering basics</b>: Drawing analogy from legendary basketball coach John Wooden's emphasis on learning the basics, Leo mentioned that mastering the fundamentals of healthy eating is important. Wooden would teach his athletes even the silliest tasks like tying shoelaces and putting on socks properly, instilling in them the belief that attention to detail is crucial. Similarly, Leo asserted that shopping for healthy food, which is often dismissed as basic knowledge, sets the foundation for health and affects overall life's aspects.
</li><li><b>Misleading marketing tactics by food companies</b>: Highlighting the societal influence, Leo noted that most people lack knowledge on shopping for healthy food due to wrong teachings instilled by society. He criticized food manufacturers and advertisers who invest billions in marketing campaigns that peddle unhealthy food items as appealing and nutritious. According to him, these marketing tactics have led to widespread health issues like depression and ADHD. 
</li><li><b>Unhealthy food and autoimmune diseases</b>: Leo argued that certain food groups like wheat, dairy, sugar, corn, and soy, along with artificial chemicals and sweeteners, could cause allergic reactions and trigger autoimmune diseases. Over 50 million Americans suffer from these conditions, many of whom remain undiagnosed due to lack of knowledge and proper treatment options. Correcting the diet can cure many of these diseases.
</li><li><b>Flaws in the medical system</b>: Discussing the medical system's shortcomings, Leo maintained that taking medication doesn't address the root cause of autoimmune diseases. He asserted that doctors often profit from patients who need lifelong medication without addressing the underlying issues.
</li><li><b>Importance of reading ingredient lists on food labels</b>: Advicing on grocery shopping, Leo suggested ignoring calorie and fat labels and instead focusing on the ingredient list. He noted that companies can't manipulate this list much. Looking for foods with five ingredients or less, preferably natural and whole ingredients, and avoiding artificial chemicals and complicated names can lead to healthier choices.
</li><li><b>Misleading food labels</b>: Leo brought out the fact that food companies use misleading labels that create an illusion of healthiness. Labels like "cage-free", "vegetarian-fed", "antibiotic-free", "hormone-free", "all-natural", "no trans fats", "fat-free", "low-fat", "low calorie", and "sugar-free" can be manipulated by companies, making it important to check the ingredient list for unhealthy additives.
</li><li><b>Eliminating harmful food groups for better health</b>: Leo cautioned against bread and wheat-containing products, which can harm health due to their indigestibility. He also advocated eliminating dairy, as it contains proteins that many people are sensitive to. Cutting out both these food groups can lead to remarkable improvements in health.
</li><li><b>Choosing healthy food options</b>: By providing a comprehensive list of beneficial food options, Leo suggested prioritizing fresh, low-sugar or no-sugar canned fruits, fresh or frozen meat, pure nuts, nut butters, organic pasture-raised eggs, and organic olive oil, among others.
</li><li><b>Adhering to a restrictive diet</b>: Leo clarified that following a restrictive diet eliminates most restaurant options and adds the need to consciously cook healthy meals at home. He supports gradual transition and allowing some flexibility for social situations and travel.
</li><li><b>Making dietary changes</b>: Leo recommends starting slow but strict with dietary changes by focusing on eliminating certain items like wheat and dairy. He advises dividing and conquering the process over months or years to avoid falling victims to cravings.
</li><li><b>Choosing organic and reframing expenses as an investment</b>: Leo recommended trading up for organic food options and gradually making cost-effective healthy choices. He proposed to view the expense of healthier food options as an investment in personal health.
</li><li><b>Transforming diet for self-actualization</b>: Discussing the fear of taking risks that poses a major obstacle in self-actualization, Leo shared his personal experience of sacrificing certain food groups for years. He advocated not letting small temptations hinder the process of self-improvement and achieving larger visions.
</li><li><b>Common diseases linked to improper diet</b>: Numerous diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's disease, celiac disease, cancer, chronic fatigue, leaky gut, and ADHD are significantly impacted by nutrition. Unfortunately, this connection between diet and disease is often downplayed by doctors. 
</li><li><b>Principles for selecting food at the grocery store</b>: The key to choosing healthier food options is focusing on the list of ingredients rather than the calorie and fat labels. Companies are required to list all ingredients in the order of greatest to smallest quantity. Looking for products with five or fewer ingredients that are mainly composed of natural, whole ingredients is recommended. 
</li><li><b>Avoiding misleading labels</b>: One must not assume the healthiness of a product based on labels such as "cage-free", "vegetarian-fed", "antibiotic-free" and "hormone-free". These labels are often employed to mislead consumers into believing the product is organic or superior. To ascertain the quality of a product, one must examine the ingredient list.
</li><li><b>Avoidance of certain foods and ingredients</b>: Hydrogenated fats and oils, sugar, corn syrup, boxed and processed foods, complex preservatives and coloring agents, cheap meat and eggs should be avoided. Additionally, any food that can remain consumable for several years due to being packed with preservatives is not recommended. 
</li><li><b>Quality food selection guidelines</b>: Favoring fresh and alive foods that can deteriorate quickly, such as raw fresh plant-based items with lots of pigments. Whenever possible, organic and minimally cooked food should be chosen. Products with single ingredients are preferred. 
</li><li><b>Misuse of healthy food labels by companies</b>: Within the rising health food trend, food manufacturers often use misleading labels to make consumers think their products are healthy. Labels like "cage-free", "vegetarian fed", "antibiotic free", and "hormone free" are often meaningless and do not automatically make the product healthy or organic.
</li><li><b>Misleading food labels</b>: Labels such as "all-natural", "no trans fats", "fat-free", "low-fat", "low calorie", and "sugar-free" are largely unregulated and may be misleading. They often contain other harmful ingredients despite what the label implies. 
</li><li><b>Transferable labels</b>: Labels such as "organic", "vegan", "dairy free", "gluten free", "soy free", and "non-GMO" are more reliable as they adhere to stricter regulations.  
</li><li><b>Avoidance of certain food groups</b>: Foods and drinks such as soda, vitamin water, pasteurized fruit juice, bread, wheat-containing products, bakery items, pasta, cereal, and dairy should be avoided due to their potential adverse effects on health.
</li><li><b>Autoimmune diseases and wheat</b>: Modern wheat, which is engineered and artificially bred to be pest-resistant, can be hard for the human stomach to digest, potentially leading to autoimmune diseases. Cutting wheat from your diet can help manage these conditions.
</li><li><b>Cutting out dairy from your diet</b>: Dairy contains proteins that many people may be sensitive or allergic to. Cutting out dairy from your diet can lead to significant improvements in your health and nutrition. 
</li><li><b>Other food to avoid</b>: Sweetened yogurts, corn products, and soy products pose similar risks and should be avoided. Pre-made meals, and frozen meals are also discouraged due to their high level of preservatives and low-quality ingredients.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Harmful Food Types</b>: Avoid frozen items like TV dinners, pot pies, pizzas and other frozen foods. Stay away from chips, deli and canned meats like salami, ham, bacon and sausages. Do not consume frozen desserts such as ice cream, pies, cakes, store-made sandwiches and wraps, and pasta salads as they contain low-quality ingredients. Pre-made salad dressings, dried soups and noodles, ketchup, barbecue sauces, whey protein, protein bars and shakes should also be avoided due to excess preservatives, sugars, proteins and sugars that are difficult to digest. Certain fish like Atlantic salmon, tuna, swordfish and mackerel should be avoided due to contamination with heavy metals such as mercury. Likewise, farmed fish should be avoided since they are mostly corn-fed. Caffeinated drinks like coffee and alcoholic beverages should be stayed away from. Avoid using safflower oil, canola oil, oil sprays, butter substitutes, and artificial sweeteners like Splenda and aspartame. Lastly, meat and eggs that are corn-fed or vegetarian-fed should also be avoided.  
</li><li><b>Avoiding Certain Aisles in Grocery Store</b>:Stay clear of aisles in the grocery store that carry candy, deli meat, cheese, soda and juice, bread and bakery items, cereals, chips, alcohol, and protein bars.  
</li><li><b>Consumption of Healthy Foods</b>: Prefer fresh fruits and vegetables, especially if they are organic. Frozen fruits and veggies, pre-wash salad mixes, 100% pure canned fruits and vegetables with low or no sugar, fresh cold juices, fresh or frozen meat (preferably organic and grass-fed), pure nuts, nut butters, organic pasture-raised eggs, spices, vinegar, mustard, real ketchup with less sugar, organic oils like olive oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, flax oil and sesame oil, seaweed, olives, pickles, sauerkraut, hummus, kombucha, almond milk, coconut milk, gluten-free oatmeal, quinoa, rice, beans, canned meat and vegetable stocks, certain versions of sardines, coconut yogurt, dark chocolate (over 80%), raw honey, spring water, sparkling water, unsweetened tea, pre-made sushi, and whole roasted chicken.  
</li><li><b>Impact of Dietary Choices on Restaurant Options and Social Life</b>: Implementing a strict and healthy diet can limit the options for dining out as these usually include dairy, gluten, corn, or sugar. So, cooking at home is advisable. The transition should be slow, and for circumstances like travel and social gatherings, a 20% deviation from the diet could be considered. 
</li><li><b>Long-Term Commitments and Adjustment Period</b>: Making dietary changes like these should be considered a long-term commitment and should be approached slowly. This could be challenging initially considering the restrictions mentioned, but they impart significant health benefits in the long run. It is crucial to aim for sustainability rather than abrupt adjustments and harsh conditions. 
</li><li><b>Healthy Foods and Cooking at Home</b>: Investing in a diet that focuses on well-being has positive impacts on job performance, promotions, overall quality of life and prevents future health issues. It's essential to find simple and healthy recipes that can be prepared quickly and store well.
</li><li><b>Transition to a Healthier Diet</b>: Leo Gura shares his personal journey and insists on a gradual and ten-year-long transition. He advises on emphasizing the quality of food over its quantity and ensuring an 80% adherence to suggested diets. 
</li><li><b>Avoiding Certain Foods</b>: Gura strictly avoids wheat and dairy, having committed to never consume them again, despite the initial seeming deprivation.
</li><li><b>Gradual Eliminations and Additions</b>: Gura recommends starting with eliminating the worst offenders, such as wheat, dairy, soda, desserts, coffee, sugar, and boxed foods. Then gradually switch to organic vegetables and meats, dividing and conquering this process over months or even years.
</li><li><b>Approach to Eating Out</b>: Restaurant food, regardless of how upmarket the restaurant is, will not serve high-quality ingredients or stick to the dietary guidelines Gura suggests. He recommends bringing personal snacks when travelling to avoid choosing from low-quality food options.
</li><li><b>Maintaining Weight without Gym</b>: Leo shares that he has managed to maintain his weight by just adhering to his diet and has not required gym workouts. Eliminating sugar, dairy, and wheat from his diet and focusing on fruits and meats has helped him maintain a healthy weight.
</li><li><b>Freedom from Weight Consciousness</b>: Changing his diet has freed him from constantly worrying about gaining weight or his body image.
</li><li><b>Overall Approach</b>: Gura emphasizes that changes should be made not for negative reasons but for positive reasons, such as improved health, energy levels, and consciousness.
</li><li><b>Implications of Unhealthy Diet</b>: Consuming unhealthy food such as pizzas regularly can result in weight gain leading to constant body dissatisfaction and self-esteem issues. This cycle can continue through life if changes are not made to the diet.
</li><li><b>Cost of Healthy Diet</b>: Shifting to a healthier diet could result in a 50% to 100% rise in food expenses. However, this change should be viewed as a long-term investment in personal health. This adjustment to diet saves individuals from future health issues, reduces the expenditure on medicines, and enhances energy levels and motivation.
</li><li><b>Spending on Nutrition</b>: People generally spend their money on unnecessary items, ignoring the crucial aspect of investing in good nutrition. Our ancestors consumed organic food which provided ample nutrition to them, a practice that today's humans lack due to the rising food industry focusing on cost-cutting and mass production.
</li><li><b>Choosing Quality Over Price</b>: Cheap and convenient food might seem appealing, but it has detrimental long-term impacts on health and overall success. By paying slightly more for healthy and nutritional food, one can avoid future health issues, thereby ensuring job success and overall quality of life.
</li><li><b>Healthy Eating for Young People</b>: Young individuals, especially high school and college students, should prioritize a healthy diet to avoid health issues later in life. A healthy diet can significantly enhance one's ability to self-actualize, pursue a career or business, and follow a life purpose.
</li><li><b>Overcoming Cravings</b>: At the start, giving up on favorite unhealthy foods can seem challenging, yet with time, one can get used to healthier alternatives and easy-to-cook recipes. Overcoming cravings and temptations becomes effortless once motivated by a larger vision of long-term health benefits and future success.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org as a Resource for Healthy Eating</b>: Leo Gura promotes his website, Actualized.org, as a resource for healthy living. The site has a blog, forum, life-purpose course and recommended nutrition books that can offer further support and advice to those seeking to improve their diets and overall health.
