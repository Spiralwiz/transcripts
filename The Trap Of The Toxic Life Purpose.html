[Music] sometimes people ask me leo what's the point of
having a life purpose or working towards a life purpose
if everything is meaningless ultimately in the big picture sense
and isn't life purpose itself just a construct of the
ego mind so how do you square the spiritual pursuits
of awakening and so forth that you talk about with
this very materialistic sort of approach of life purpose isn't
life purpose just something the ego is up to but
what you don't take into account when you think this
way is that you're still going to be living a
life in some way no matter what no matter how
awakened you are and no matter whether you want to
pursue a life purpose or you don't what you have
to understand is that if you don't adopt a life
purpose oftentimes what happens is that the default position basically
what would be the case if you don't consciously build
a life on purpose and pursue work on purpose is
that you will fall into a toxic life purpose and
that's what i want to elaborate upon today uh i
see this more and more uh we we see this
all out throughout history throughout the media with celebrities and
other people who've fall into toxic life purposes because they
make the mistake of not consciously working on their purpose
people who just get a job for the sake of
having a job just to pay the bills you might
wonder what's wrong with that i have to eat don't
i have to pay my bills yes of course we
all have to eat and we have to pay our
bills but uh the problem with doing work just for
the sake of earning money is that then you become
very persuadable to do any kind of work that will
earn you money and usually what that means is the
work that pays the most money a lot of times
is the work that causes the most harm to society
you see there's no there's no there's no mechanism within
our current social system which aligns high-paying jobs with the
maximum benefit for mankind these two things aren't aligned in
fact oftentimes they are polar opposites some of the highest
paying jobs that exist in our society are the ones
that screw other people over the most think about these
kinds of industries like the uh healthcare industry the pharmaceutical
industry the financial services industry various kinds of insurance and
banking services credit services payday loans annuities military defense contractor
type of jobs and careers the oil and gas industry
energy extraction industries mining industries many of these industries that
i just mentioned and this is just the tip of
the iceberg these are some of the highest paying industries
and jobs that you can get now of course there's
exceptions there's always exceptions but generally speaking why do they
pay so much money because where is the value coming
from in these industries it's literally you're stealing that value
from somebody else but you're masquerading it as not stealing
see our notion of theft and stealing is quite limited
usually if you're working at one of these jobs you're
not going to ever consider that what you're doing that
your job is is stealing resources from somebody else exploiting
somebody else scamming somebody else but that's in effect what
you're doing oftentimes when you're working in the insurance industry
the financial services industry the oil and gas industry the
military defense contractor industries uh even healthcare industries literally the
entire healthcare industry in america is built upon scamming and
fleecing people for money overcharging people you've heard these stories
of these you know insurance companies or uh hospitals and
so forth that will charge you a thousand dollars for
a bottle of aspirin when you're in the hospital or
some nonsense like this and and yeah they do that's
how doctors earn so much money um but of course
the doctors are totally in denial about it but anyways
my point here though is that this problem goes even
far worse than just a matter of scamming somebody out
of a few thousand dollars if you don't consciously put
effort into thinking about what kind of impact you want
your work your life's work your career to have because
all of us need to eat and pay our bills
this is not optional unless maybe you were born a
billionaire and you inherited a giant trust fund in the
tens of millions of dollars then maybe you don't need
to worry about this but for the other 99 of
us we have to worry about this right we all
have to pay our bills so paying the bills is
not optional that means you're going to be paying your
bills somehow the question is how are you going to
be paying them are you going to be paying them
consciously or unconsciously what are you going to be doing
to pay your bills see most people don't think about
this and then when i talk about life purpose they
say oh well life purpose is just this sort of
fluffy new agey type of thing it's kind of not
not very grounded not down to earth doesn't really track
with the numbers but the reality is is that having
a sense of purpose and meaning in your life even
though meaning and purpose are completely constructed completely imaginary you're
making it up even though purpose and meaning are completely
imaginary and made up if you don't have that in
your life you're not just gonna sit back and just
relax and chill out and enjoy life the way you
might imagine what's gonna happen is that your mind has
a deep need for meaning and purpose and you're going
to go look for it in places where you shouldn't
be looking for it which is going to lead you
down a dark road and create a lot of harm
and chaos in your own life and in the lives
of others and is going to contribute negatively to society
to your community and we see this all all over
the place these days you know uh i read a
biography of hitler there's this great biography by uh i
forget the author's last name tolland i think it is
it's a thick thousand page biography i didn't read the
whole thing i read about maybe a fifth of it
it's very very dense very detailed but it talks about
hitler's early life like it basically tracks him from his
birth uh through world war one he participated in world
war one he was like a male carrier a male
courier in world war one sort of uh he he
carried messages through the actual um in the trenches like
he was actually in the trenches he almost got killed
got very close to being killed so this was like
he was almost like a teenager doing this um and
then so it attracts his early life and you know
how did he come to power and how did he
develop his ideology and so forth and what was so
fascinating in reading about hitler is uh hitler is a
great example of what i would call someone who falls
into the trap of the toxic life purpose so he
wanted to become an artist of course as is commonly
known he went to to vienna or wherever i forget
exactly where he went to art school it was kind
of rigorous they didn't accept him he wasn't good enough
in certain areas he wasn't skilled enough but rather than
rededicating himself to his purpose or maybe finding a a
better purpose or an alternative purpose that maybe he would
have been more skilled at instead what he did he
was sort of living homeless in vienna or i don't
know exactly the city i might be misremembering the city
but he was living in one of these sort of
germanic cities and uh he was out of work he
didn't have anything to do he had he was just
completely aimless because his initial idea was that okay i'm
going to become this great artist but that didn't pan
out and so what does he do he he sits
around uh and you know he he listens to recordings
of uh popular radio programs and anti-communist propaganda that was
popular in those cities at the time and he reads
these pamphlets these anti-communist pamphlets and he just gets sucked
into this rabbit hole in a sense really it was
the original like this was the original youtube rabbit hole
before there was youtube uh you've heard of this you
know right-wing uh alt-right youtube rabbit hole that exists yeah
you watch a few sort of right-leaning videos on youtube
and then that recommends you some more the algorithm recommends
some more and some more and some more then you
get down this you know eventually you're watching like race
iq propaganda and uh you know anti-sjw stuff and then
that ultimately leads you like into down some neo-nazi rabbit
hole well that's exactly how hitler became a nazi in
the first place he was looking for somebody to blame
for the fact that he was poor and he was
struggling in his own mission in life and so he
needed a scapegoat and there was a ready-made mechanism back
then in those cities in those germanic cities there was
there was a mechanism there were pamphlets and it was
very politically active at the time and you know communism
was was big at that time in russia and even
in germany other places and so um hitler started to
buy into this conspiracy theory that it was the jews
the globalist jews and communists uh and these these crazy
liberals who were trying to you know undo the old
germanic traditions that were lost and have made germany weak
and now germany has become the laughingstock uh and the
cuck so to speak of the other european nations and
the world and so germany has lost its its original
sense of of pride and germanic power all these sorts
of ideals these right-wing ideals um which are common not
just to nazism but to all forms of of right-wing
fascism and just in general right-wing conservative ideology they value
that stuff you know good old-fashioned traditional values whether it's
america or japan or china or or hungary or germany
it's all the same stuff just you know with different
flavors different spins on the same basic structure so uh
he went down this rabbit hole and then he he
literally turned his life his life's mission became to eradicate
these jews and then we all know what happened from
that so that's a an amazing example of how dangerous
it can be to not have a consciously developed life
purpose because like i said the mind the ego mind
unless you've transcended it completely which 99.999 of you never
will that ego mind wants a sense of meaning and
purpose to its life it's not just gonna sit around
and be aimless and enjoy itself it's gonna feel empty
it's gonna feel miserable and then you're gonna have to
pay your bills somehow and then your ego is gonna
be looking for ways to pay the bills but since
it's not doing it consciously it's just going to go
to what's the most convenient the most convenient being in
terms of the easiest the highest paying or the most
ideologically convenient in terms of what kind of ideology can
you find out there that will reinforce your existing worldview
and all of your existing grudges and all of your
biases reinforce all of that because that's going to feel
good to your ego to reinforce that you know if
you are doing bad in your own life the conscious
thing to do is to look inwards and to ask
yourself okay where did i go wrong how am i
screwing up where do i need to take more responsibility
but that requires some some you know some conscious thinking
uh the most likely scenario is that you're gonna you're
gonna not turn inwards but you're gonna turn outwards and
you'll look for like who should i blame for this
situation who can i blame who can i scapegoat who's
the enemy that's causing this because it's not me right
it's hard to admit that it's you uh and so
you're gonna go look for it whether it's communists or
whether it's the west or whether it's the east or
whether it's china or whether it's women this is very
common these days with the men's very various kinds of
toxic men's rights movements which um are also kind of
creating sort of rabbit hole where guys in cells and
other folks who are struggling with attracting women rather than
taking responsibility for the fact that hey you know there's
something about me that's that i'm i have a the
kind of lifestyle that i set up for myself isn't
going to allow me to attract the kind of women
that i want so how can i change that rather
than that what they do is they create an ideology
a toxic ideology that justifies why women would never sleep
with them and then of course they have to once
they create that ideology they have to go deeper and
deeper with it and of course you can then earn
lots of money creating and peddling this ideology see the
reason these ideologies are so attractive and you can earn
so much money you can literally earn millions of dollars
with these toxic life purpose ideologies is because they give
people who are stuck in a sort of a a
negative victim mindset and people who don't want to take
responsibility for themselves people who are living their life unconsciously
what they do is they give them a sort of
a false solution a false way out of that problem
see here with actualize.org you come to me and i
i give you the hard solutions i tell you all
the things your mind and your ego doesn't want to
hear and probably because of that 90 of you quit
and don't continue with the work or don't even begin
the work but i could easily start a channel that
would cater to all of your deepest fears and insecurities
and prejudices and biases and paranoias and just amp those
up and play those up create a ideology out of
it i would earn millions of dollars doing that and
you would feel so good every day you would tune
in you would watch my videos would get millions of
views more than they already do and you would watch
and you'd be like yeah yeah that's exactly what i
want to hear that subconsciously that's what your ego mind
would be saying and all we would be doing then
is we'd be creating some sort of external enemy and
see the reason that that's so appealing is because it
gives you an instant quick purpose now your purpose is
to be anti-women anti-feminist or your purpose now is to
be anti-sjw or your purpose now is to be anti-globalist
elites or your purpose now is to be against the
jews or against the blacks or against china or against
the democrats or against the republicans or whatever don't think
that i'm just that this criticism only applies to right
wingers a lot of right-wing politics is tied in with
this but it's not just right wingers you can be
guilty of this as a left-winger and in other ways
as well see this is uh the problem of the
lesser jihad and of course we see this problem in
the middle east as well why is radical islam so
virulently popular in certain underdeveloped parts of the middle east
like saudi arabia and afghanistan and syria and elsewhere why
is it so popular there because in these areas generally
the living conditions are very modest basically crippling poverty there's
not a lot of hope economically for people they can't
go to college there's no good colleges or they don't
have the money for it or there's not enough spaces
there's not a lot of good job prospects there's not
a sense of conscious life purpose that they can build
for themselves nobody even puts this idea in their mind
that this is what they should be doing is constructing
a conscious life purpose their own meaning creating their own
meaning right they're not taking responsibility for creating their own
meaning and purpose in their life so instead what do
they do well everyone in the middle east is basically
indoctrinated with islam from birth so that's the most convenient
ideology they've got and then of course now you can
use that ideology to create a purpose out of it
and it's very easy to twist that ideology around into
something hateful prejudicial uh very biased very twisted very uh
demonic almost basically because again it most people in the
middle east feel like victims and that's understandable i mean
i'm not saying the west is not responsible for victimizing
the middle east it is america has done many things
to victimize the middle east that it shouldn't have done
uh so it's not unwarranted but still you get into
that that kind of toxic victim mindset and then you
start blaming others and then you know that leads down
to a very dark rabbit hole and then eventually you
become a suicide bomber or something like that or get
involved with terrorist activities thinking that what you're doing is
that you're saving the world from some great evil when
in fact it's you who is the greatest evil in
this in this lesser jihad that you've undertaken see and
that's much harder than consciously growing your spirit such that
you live up to the true ideals of islam you
see it's much easier to distort islam to feed the
ego mind the deepest most perverse aspects and fears and
cravings of the ego mind versus surrendering the ego and
then like becoming a sufi for example you could become
a sufi but it's a lot harder to become a
sufi than it is to become a terrorist psychologically so
i'm speaking sort of psychologically emotionally for most people it
takes a very advanced mind to see the appeal of
becoming a sufi and uh opening your heart to the
world and blah blah blah working on yourself surrendering your
ego and questioning yourself introspecting that would be the greater
jihad you see that would be a conscious life purpose
if you were in the middle east and you said
well you know i'm living in this maybe [ __
] country as trump likes to say like maybe you're
stuck in syria or iraq someplace and you don't have
a lot of good prospects well you could join some
sort of criminal gang or if you're more conscious you
could say well i'm going to become like a sufi
type mystic sure i'll be maybe poor i won't have
a lot of money i'm not going to get hot
girls i'm not going to get all that material stuff
but i can be very powerful mystic even in in
a in a poor area like that uh and i
can transform the world now of course that comes with
its own dangers of course people will want to hunt
you down if you try to be a mystic a
loving mystic in syria people will try to hunt you
down and kill you um just for the fact that
you are they're going to perceive you as someone who
is uh not true to islam of course that's because
they're just projecting but but anyways i mean i mean
that's basically what jesus did and many other mystics have
done that um and you know you can see how
much more of a difficult path that is that's the
path least walked by people most people would go down
the sort of criminal route and that's that's how it
works so you can find many examples like this a
lot of people who get involved with if you watch
some videos and there's a lot of good videos you
can find on youtube about why people get sucked into
for example white supremacists or neo-nazi movements or the kkk
like i've watched a few interviews of kkk members like
the guy is sitting there in front of a camera
literally with his ku klux klan outfit on while he's
being interviewed and he talks about how he thinks the
white race is the best and you know other races
should go home back to africa and so forth uh
he's sitting here with a straight face doing this and
he thinks that he's you know he's found his life
purpose this this kkk you know they have these meetings
like they will have these meetings every week where they
they sit down in some bar you know some back
room uh bar they will sit down uh and and
sit there and have serious discussions about like yeah how
do we get all the black people out of america
or something like this uh why is that so appealing
because think about it these people are usually working lame
jobs lame nine-to-five jobs that give them no creative outlet
that have no sense of meaning or purpose beyond just
paying their bills and feeding their children so what do
they really have to live for they don't have their
career or their job to live for and they're not
taking responsibility for improving that and creating a conscious life
purpose so instead what they do is they they just
accept that job they become a victim to it uh
they adopt a sort of mind mindset of learned helplessness
in that domain but then when they come home on
the weekends you know just to get a little kick
to get a little bit of sense of of of
meaning to life what they do is they join this
kkk group or a neo-nazi group or some islamic you
know uh terrorist cell or whatever they're doing and that
gives them a sense of purpose now they feel like
they they belong to something larger than themselves you see
the human spirit requires somehow fitting you into a larger
hole you're not going to feel whole as just an
individual by yourself for you to feel whole you need
to be part of some larger community and some larger
purpose of that community this is a critical component to
human happiness is to have this and if you're lacking
it your mind is gonna want it just like with
sex if you repress sex if you think that well
just don't have sex you know this is the kind
of naive advice that a lot of times like fundamentalist
christian parents will give to their children like oh just
abstain from sex but what you don't understand is when
you do that when you when you deny sex and
try to repress it that drive and need in the
psyche is so strong that it's going to come out
and get fulfilled in some other way usually a more
toxic way which is why many many children of these
fundamentalist christians rather than having vaginal sex they'll have anal
sex because to them that doesn't count as sex you
see but in a sense this is worse than them
just having normal vaginal sex um so see it gets
perverted stuff gets perverted when it gets denied well likewise
you have a need in you for a sense of
community and a sense of purpose and if this is
not consciously honored and cultivated with deliberation and planning and
with selflessness and love and consciousness then what's going to
happen is that it's just going to happen unconsciously selfishly
your ego is going to just take control of that
thing and you're going to do the most expedient thing
that comes by you so if if some kkk group
or some anti-feminist group um some nationalist group some militia
group uh comes within your you know into your life
basically in the periphery of your life you're going to
see it and you're going to find it appealing and
you're going to get recruited and this is how a
lot of people fall into cults this is one of
the huge appeals of cults is that the cult offers
you a community a sense of belonging a sense of
a larger family beyond your little family that you grew
up in and that you feel stifled in this is
like a new larger family and they provide you with
meaning and purpose that you can't otherwise just easily get
off the shelf of a store somewhere you see life
purpose a high quality like a conscious life purpose is
is not something that you can just like walk into
a walmart and buy it's one of those things that
you can't buy you have to develop it yourself but
many of these cults and other sorts of groups will
surely because this is a need and the need in
a marketplace in a capitalist marketplace every need basically gets
catered to and the lower the need and the more
strong the craving for the need is the stronger it's
going to get catered to and so there's going to
be ample businesses and groups out there and cults who
are going to be catered catering to your most basic
uh devilish cravings and fears because it earns them money
and it gives them power and it gives them a
sense of success and when they do that and they
become successful they think that they're doing something good in
the world because they conflate their own private success personal
success material success with with some sort of goodness or
some sort of consciousness which is is is not automatically
the case see it's very much like with drugs the
whole appeal you know why people do drugs it's very
simple the way people do hard drugs like heroin or
meth or something like that crack is usually their life
is so bad because of childhood abuse because they're growing
in a dysfunctional family uh they were sexually molested or
they were physically abused by their father or their stepfather
or they were bullied at school or their parents died
and they grew up in a foster environ foster home
environment where they didn't receive love that they should have
gotten from their parents or because of you know very
bad financial situations with their parents like you know living
and crippling poverty in some inner city slum or whatever
um your prospects for the future are so bleak that
you really have nothing to live for at that point
your view of the world is that the world is
[ __ ] the world is hell there's nothing good
from my family there's nothing good for my friends there's
nothing good for my community because they're all garbage if
you happen to be raised in that kind of environment
there's no good job prospects maybe i have a job
but like it's it's a dead end job that just
pays minimum wage and there's no way forward and i
have so much debt that i can't even afford to
go to community college or something like that and it's
like what do i do what do i have to
live for at that point the only thing i have
to live for is a shot of heroin or meth
or crack that's the thing that gets me through the
day that that's what keeps me from killing myself in
that situation uh and it in a sense what the
drug does the drug simulates spiritual development i'm not just
talking about psychedelics here i'm talking about heroin and meth
and crack alcohol even cigarettes pot whatever it it simulates
an artificial spiritual high it basically gets your mind to
a level where a yogi or an enlightened master lives
effortlessly in a sober state all the time it gets
you to that for an hour or two or for
a day while you're high on that drug and you
can buy it so in a sense you're buying happiness
but really you're not buying happiness you're buying consciousness or
you're buying spirituality in a sense so drug abuse in
a sense is a form of materialistic spirituality likewise joining
a cult is the same thing so rather than working
on meditation and developing yourself and so forth that for
example a drug addict might do in order to overcome
his need for drugs and if you want a great
example of that look at russell brand he's a great
example of a ex-heroin user and probably many other drugs
he used i don't know what else he used he
was also like a sex addict and so forth um
so he's very very stuck in that stage red slash
spider-man stage orange mentality um and now he's broken through
out of that and now he does yoga and he
meditates and he you know he he studies spiritual non-dual
type of stuff and he teaches it and now he
has a purpose now his purpose is to teach that
stuff so he in a sense his role is to
help addicts get out of addiction and to show people
a path towards consciousness and love and selflessness that's what
he's doing and that's giving him more pleasure than a
hit of heroin used to give him you see so
that's how you overcome that kind of hardcore addiction is
that you must develop yourself go through that long painful
painful process of developing yourself and then ultimately coming up
with a conscious life purpose some meaning beyond just raw
pleasure in the moment some higher form of pleasure or
satisfaction which will come from uh from your spiritual work
or from your life purpose the kind of work you
do with your career if you're doing some kind of
good work like you're helping people which is why a
lot of times the way that addicts become ex-addicts is
by overcoming their addiction and then their life purpose becomes
to help other addicts do the same thing in a
sense it's sort of a pyramid scheme um but uh
but it it works it's sort of a a good
pyramid scheme in the sense that there are so many
addicts out there that if if you want if you're
an addict you're one of your major purposes in life
can be simply overcoming your addiction just for the sake
of showing others that it's possible and then helping others
to do the same becoming sort of a a lighthouse
for others through your own example that's totally valid and
high quality conscious life purpose um but see that takes
an enormous amount of work that takes an enormous amount
of soul searching responsibility taking book reading um facing your
own shadows and inner demons and transcending them and overcoming
them and admitting how wrong and stupid you were and
opening your mind to new perspectives and all the stuff
that i talk about with my work uh that that's
a lot that's a lot to ask most people don't
want to do that instead most people just want to
go to walmart and buy a pill off the shelf
that will do that for them and so in this
case that's going to be heroin you can't buy heroin
at walmart but you this is just an analogy right
this is what we're looking for like we wish all
of us just wish that we can go to walmart
right now and pay ten dollars for a cure to
our problems and that eventually essentially when we want that
cure what we're really asking for is we're asking for
spiritual growth we want to pay ten dollars for spiritual
growth without actually doing any of the work so that
we feel love that's all any of us wants is
to feel love that's it and so when you're not
given the kind of love that you crave especially when
you're young this creates trauma and then that is what
leads you down these dark dark paths and dark rabbit
holes um you see and if you're not getting the
sex that you crave you're gonna go down the the
dark you know men's rights toxic men's rights rabbit holes
like the mgtow movements and the black pill and red
pill and all this garbage um maybe you'll get into
pick up some toxic form of pickup that's also possible
i've seen that happen um and then you know if
you don't get the kind of love you want with
money then you'll go into some criminal activities uh you'll
become a thief or a scammer or con artist or
a fraudster or whatever and if you don't get the
kind of love or sense of community a healthy sense
of community that again is just you getting the love
that you want then you're gonna get involved with some
sort of a fascist neo-nazi white supremacist nationalist movement in
in your country whatever that is and don't think that
you know this sort of white supremacy is just a
problem in in america or in the west i mean
you you have fascist nationalist movements in every country in
india in china all over europe in south america in
africa in parts of asia everywhere every country is it
has these nationalist uh you know ultra right-wing nationalist fascist
groups in japan they have it as well uh and
all of them offer you that sort of cheap walmart
solution but of course the solution is not sustainable and
it can very easily destroy your life and it will
cause harm and great damage to your community in the
end see and in a sense this is what we're
seeing with the trumpism phenomenon the reason that trumpism is
so appealing is because uh right now we're in late
stage capitalism with late stage capitalism here in america at
least a lot of people are not earning the kind
of wages they used to earn with globalization that's right
wages have been equalizing across the world that means the
high wages that used to exist in america can no
longer be sustained because america used to be this isolated
bubble but now all those barriers have broken down because
of telecommunication and internet satellites fiber optics airplane travel and
all these sorts of things um tourism globalism and so
the jobs and the the money is basically spread more
around the world it's equalizing so whereas before america was
up here and like uh china was down here we're
starting to equalize now now of course this is great
for china from its perspective but it's bad for america
from america's perspective because it feels like america is losing
um in fact this is an overall good trend because
it's actually creating more fairness and justice around the world
but it doesn't feel like that from america's from any
american's point of view so uh their salaries are dropping
and of course they're looking for somebody to blame into
scapegoat so who are they going to scapegoat they're going
to scapegoat the globalist jew social justice warrior hillary clinton
joe biden uh pedophiles and the hollywood elites and the
wall street elites and this justice notion of elites let's
let's just blame all of our problems on the elites
this is this is very popular this idea is becoming
very popular uh not just on the right but even
on the left there's there's uh there's a sort of
almost a cult of blaming everything on the elites on
the left as well amongst progressives now of course elites
do bear some responsibility but overall this is way overblown
and uh it's just a it's a game that the
ego is playing you see and so now you come
home from a dead end job you're tired but what
you do is you log into youtube and you watch
your favorite youtuber rant against the elites and this gives
you a sense of purpose and you're like yeah those
elites they're pedophiles and they're jews and they're evil and
they're from hollywood and all of this and they're not
like me they're not like us and we got to
get them we got to get our guns and we
got to fight them tooth and nail otherwise this is
going to destroy america this is just going to destroy
the land of my ancestors and i'll be damned if
i let that happen i'll be damned if i let
some liberal uh you know transgender pedophiles [Laughter] uh take
over america uh you know over my dead body and
so then you go to the gun store and you
buy yourself some guns you buy a case of ammunition
and you know you stock up on supplies for the
coming apocalypse and civil war and then you listen to
talk radio that talks about the upcoming civil war that's
going to be happening and you go to the shooting
range and you pay the money you know for target
practice because you really start to believe that there's a
civil war coming and you start to do target practice
on you know on targets and maybe you put a
face of hillary clinton on the target that you're shooting
at and this and then you hang out see but
you're not doing it alone you're also you got a
group of buddies at your shooting range who you are
are also doing this with you and then you form
a militia group and now every weekend or twice a
month you're going out into the wilderness and you're shooting
guns and you're you know you're preparing explosives and you're
and you're you're preparing for the upcoming civil war and
this paranoia now becomes your entire life and this is
this is the the toxic life purpose that i'm talking
about but as all of this is happening it's happening
so slowly and gradually and the ego feels so validated
by this it has now a sense of belonging now
you found your your calling in life this feels so
good it feels better than a shot of heroin and
there's nobody in society telling you that this is more
dangerous than heroin because culturally we all know heroin is
bad and even then still many of us will fall
into that trap with opioids or something like that um
but nobody ever teaches you the dangers of this toxic
life purpose that you could unconsciously be developing in your
life you're not aware that you're developing it you didn't
have the intention at the outset five years ago to
say oh yeah you know what i'm gonna do i'm
gonna join this militia group and we're gonna be training
every every weekend against the coming civil war against the
the crazy pedophile liberals um it didn't start that way
you gradually slowly were brainwashed into it by the news
that you watched by the youtubers that you follow by
the ways you think about the world by your failure
take responsibility for yourself and so forth and by ultimately
not consciously working on developing a healthy loving life purpose
see that vacuum in your heart and in your soul
that was created ultimately by your lack of responsibility that
vacuum was now filled by the lesser jihad and so
the irony is of course is that these right wingers
are committing exactly the same mistake that the radical islamists
in the middle east are committing they found an enemy
and they're going all in against that enemy damn the
costs to society or to themselves or even to their
family and so on because it feels good to have
that sense of meaning and purpose in one's life and
developing that on your own is extremely difficult most people
don't even know that this is a possibility that you
can develop a life of a conscious loving selfless purpose
on your own but see that's difficult that's a difficult
road to walk because you're usually walking it alone there's
nobody there helping you you're trying to figure it out
on your by yourself your family and friends won't really
be supportive they won't really understand what you're doing because
they themselves don't know how it works school doesn't teach
you how to do it college university doesn't teach you
how to develop a life purpose businesses and corporations they
don't care about whether you have a life purpose or
not whether it's conscious or not in fact they're going
to try to seduce you off the path with jobs
and careers that are toxic and that just pay really
well but involve you doing some kind of devil's work
in order to get that big paycheck see but you
do have a choice the choice here now that i'm
presenting to you that you can what's going on you
can zoom out and see sort of from a meta
perspective what's really going on you can start to notice
that maybe you're sliding into a toxic sense of life
purpose or maybe you just notice that there's a a
void in your heart and in your soul uh a
lack of meaning that needs to be filled and it's
gonna get filled one way or another so that being
the case you might as well take conscious control of
it and decide how you want to fill it so
that you're living the kind of life that has the
kind of impact on the world that you want it
to have so rather than starting your your thought process
like this like well what kind of job would earn
me the most money and get me the most sex
and get me a bigger house rather than thinking that
way or thinking like this i guess this is this
would be a more modern way the way people think
these days like what kind of what kind of videos
could i post on youtube that would get the most
clicks the most subscribers or what kind what kind of
video or content could i produce for tick tock or
something or facebook that would get the most views and
the most fans to like me rather than thinking that
way think the opposite way which is what kind of
impact do i want my life to have on others
in the world regardless of money or material stuff or
anything what kind of impact do i want my life
to have what do i want to help people to
do to understand to realize to feel how do i
want to make people feel do i want to make
them feel loving or fearful do i want to make
them feel abundant or scarce do i want to make
them feel unlimited or limited do i want to make
them feel big or small do i want to inspire
them with art and music or do i want to
drive them down some sort of negative depressing toxic ideological
rabbit hole see and then from that you decide what
that should be what kind of impact you want to
have and then you kind of reverse engineer your entire
life and adjust every aspect of your life to fit
with that now of course this is not easy at
all to do you might say well yeah that sounds
great in theory but how do you actually do it
that's very hard to do it's easy for you to
say leo you have a lot of money and you're
successful and popular so yeah you can do that but
how do i do that well but what you don't
understand is that the reason that i'm successful and popular
right now is because when i first began this whole
process 10 years ago of constructing a life according to
the kind of conscious purpose that i want i had
nothing i had very little money i had no success
per se and no fame and no prospects of it
and i didn't even know exactly what my purpose is
or what it should be i had various multiple purposes
and i wasn't sure how to select them and i
wasn't sure how to accomplish it how to actualize it
how to make it tangible and so i went through
a process of years years of of trial and error
experimentation research and reading and that's ultimately what got me
into personal development um and and then that led me
to spirituality and so forth so the whole my entire
life basically my adult life um my sort of actualized
life uh started from from that point of of just
that i knew deep down in my heart i knew
that i needed to make my life count i wanted
my life to be meaningful i knew that if i
was working some dead end job that that would be
a recipe for disaster in my life that would be
a huge strategic blunder and i see that this is
perhaps one of the most common strategic blunders that ordinary
people make all throughout their life is that they don't
consciously develop a life purpose because our culture doesn't tell
us that this is something that's important and yet it
is so important so that's why i developed a life
purpose course over 25 hours of exclusive new material that's
different from my normal free content that takes you through
a step-by-step process that i have developed that i used
basically to develop my life purpose um this process is
universal it's generic in the sense that the course doesn't
tell you how to create a copy of my life
purpose for yourself it doesn't tell you how to be
a youtuber the course just teaches you the principles in
general of what a human being needs to do if
they're serious about having a positive impact on the world
with their career and how to start to align that
it's not easy to do it's it's difficult it's a
challenging course um and even if once you complete the
course that's really only where the work begins so i'm
not promising you any magic pill solution here it might
sound like oh just take the course and that's it
your life is fixed no no no you take my
course and then you're gonna work for five or ten
years you're gonna work your ass off trying to actualize
your life purpose see that's one of the challenges with
this life purpose stuff is that it's not a quick
fix it's not something like i can sit here and
like some other self-help teachers or whatever you know that
they will they try they'll try to sell you uh
like quick results like oh yeah you can quit your
smoking addiction in three months or yeah you can lose
50 pounds of weight in in in two months or
something like that and then you think about that like
oh yeah a couple of months yeah i can do
this program in a couple of months i'll get my
result and here i'm telling you that no you won't
get your result here in a couple of months and
not even in a couple of years it'll take you
longer than that to truly uh actualize your life purpose
because you're gonna like what we're doing here is like
think of yourself as a giant oil tanker with momentum
heading a certain direction towards an iceberg and now we
need to turn this oil tanker around 180 degrees that
can be difficult to do because you're massive you've got
a lot of inertia going in a certain direction and
turning that around takes time but it's one of the
most worthwhile things you can do in your life see
what you have to weigh wisely is the amount of
effort and energy and time that you put into something
is going to be usually proportional to the amount of
benefit that it pays back to you the dividends it
gives you so if you want something to pay you
a lot of dividends for the rest of your life
you can't be foolish enough to expect to get that
after a few months of work if only it was
that easy you have to prepare yourself to work for
multiple years your your vision should be like well maybe
in five years if i work really hard i can
get there and you might say well five years damn
that's that's so long is that really going to be
worth it but think about what it means to really
have a life on purpose to be working every single
day rather than working on some dead-end job for some
boss that you don't care about who doesn't care about
you and the kind of work you do is completely
meaningless and you're just you're dreading going into work every
monday because you're not spiritually connected with your work that's
basically it you're doing soulless work so think about doing
that for the next 50 years of your life because
you're going to have to to pay your bills you're
going to pay your bills no matter what so either
that or think about 50 years of going into your
office doing the kind of work you're passionate about and
the kind of work that you really truly believe helps
mankind helps to elevate the consciousness and love of mankind
in whatever way is unique to you there's many ways
to do this uh that's what's so great about life
purpose is that it's not limited to a select number
of people every single human on this planet can have
a life purpose and it can be totally unique and
suited just for their personality type so a lot of
life purpose work is just about discovering who you are
and what you really want at a very deep level
once you figure that out then you can start to
align your life with that and then imagine living your
life in alignment with that imagine how much satisfaction that
gives you but also imagine how much suffering and misery
it removes see you have to consider both it'll give
you a lot of satisfaction but perhaps even more so
it'll it'll remove 50 years of misery from your life
this misery it drips on your brain drip drip drip
drip drip drip every single day that misery is dripping
on you on your on your mind and it's making
you more depressed and miserable and angry and bitter with
the world it's making you hate people it's making you
hate the customers you're dealing with it's making you hate
your boss and your co-workers and your clients it's making
you hate men or women it's making you hate your
wife or your husband or your children you see because
when you're when you're going to work for eight hours
five days a week and many people have to even
do more than that but if you're if you're doing
40 hours a week of that kind of monotonous soul-draining
labor and then you come home what do you think
is going to happen you're going to take that out
on your wife on your husband on your children on
your friends you're going to be in a shitty mood
you're going to be a miserable human being and then
you're going to be weak and vulnerable and then you
will get preyed upon by various kinds of toxic ideologies
and cults and fascist movements and nationalist movements and false
toxic life purposes because you will have that gaping hole
in your heart but it won't just be a gaping
hole now there will also be 10 20 30 years
of misery and deep-seated resentment and bitterness and anger seething
inside of you because you can't express that at work
because you'll get fired and you can't get fired because
you've got to pay you know your kids bill uh
electric bills and so forth so you got to go
to work and put on a you know a nice
face and be professional but then when you come home
you know you're going to be prone to alcohol abuse
drug abuse physically abusing others being you know a nasty
bitter person and then you're going to want to find
somebody to blame for that because there's no way in
hell your own ego is going to take responsibility for
this it's going to be way too painful for you
to admit that you were the cause and the unconscious
architect of this cancerous lifestyle so rather than doing that
what you're going to do is you're going to find
somebody out there to blame at the scapegoat whether it's
the social justice warriors the communists the feminists or whatever
so you have a choice you have a choice remember
that in life many of the most important choices you
get for most people they're chosen unconsciously which means that
people fool themselves thinking like well there's no there's not
even a reason to make this choice there's no choice
to be made here but by by saying that you've
made that choice that's the choice you've made is you've
made the choice not to do anything you've made the
choice of being lazy of just going with the default
position and if you're always going with a default position
in life what you end up with is a is
a mediocre cancerous life which then and now now you
see how this connects with the broader social picture that
we're seeing today when we have tens of millions of
people all having these kinds of toxic cancerous lives that
have no meaning and no purpose we have record numbers
of depression we have record numbers of opioid overdose over
doses and deaths and addictions we also then have political
turmoil and toxic political ideologies that's how nazism came about
basically historians agree that the reason nazism became so popular
in the 1920s and 30s in germany is because of
the sort of uh shameful embarrassing treatment that germany received
after the end of world war one basically after germany
lost world war one the allied powers imposed uh crippling
reparations on germany that they had to you know would
have to pay for for decades into the future this
put a huge strain on the german economy and so
basically people were ordinary germans were very frustrated and miserable
from that situation and so under that pressure of course
uh they felt so victimized that then they were ripe
for a kind of a toxic cult-like ideology that could
be peddled by some um carnival barker like hitler or
like trump uh that becomes very appealing as a quick
fix solution thinking that this will fix the problem just
getting this guy elected and he he will you know
he'll just um he'll just sort of strong arm his
way out of this problem and then of course from
that you know disaster and catastrophe occurs that's how it
happens so this is what's happening in america right now
the vast majority of americans do not have any sense
of life purpose and in fact many of them are
working jobs that either are so soulless and grinding and
monotonous uh that is its soul-sucking work or uh others
are working something that they believe is meaningful but is
actually has a toxic meaning so it's easy to fool
yourself thinking that oh yeah i'm doing something good for
the world like i'm sure for example the the anchors
at fox news like tucker carlson or sean hannity or
you know somebody like glenn beck or alex jones uh
these sorts of people actually genuinely honestly believe that they
are saving america from destruction they genuinely believe this because
they bought their own [ __ ] because the [
__ ] pays so well and the reason the [
__ ] pays so well is because there's tens of
millions of people out there who are in such dire
straits they've been so victimized and they have not consciously
taken control of their life that now they want just
they need some sort of immediate quick solution and what
that turns out to be is something like fox news
propaganda and the reason that fox news is the most
highly watched news program or news organization in america is
not because they have great journalists or because they do
the best reporting and it's not because conservativism is is
more popular than liberalism or something like that it's it's
simply because they're serving the lowest common denominator they're the
most shameless in the way that they're willing to go
after views it would be sort of like if i
wanted to create a youtube the most popular youtube channel
if that was my my aim to maximize my views
and my subscribers and my revenue from ads i would
create the most low brow low consciousness toxic virulent cancerous
most ideological most closed-minded grotesque most fear-based most paranoid uh
and most hateful content that i possibly could the most
racist all of it now of course the you can
take it so far um that it'll actually backfire you
so if you start to create obviously blatantly racist content
youtube will just ban you because you're going to violate
their terms of service uh so of course there's limits
to how far you can push this especially on certain
platforms uh but uh but if there were no limits
and i could create any kind of content i want
uh that's what i would do and i would become
i would become a mega millionaire doing that and that's
what some people have set their life purpose to be
and many people see many people on youtube who are
just going purely after money or views or clicks they're
basically doing that but they don't know that they're doing
that so they didn't they didn't set out to to
create the most virulent cancerous content they just said set
out to become successful for themselves and because the ego
mind is so opportunistic it's just looking for the opportunities
but if it's looking for opportunities where's it going to
look it's going to look for the for the most
you know ripe places in society and where are the
most right places right now in social media spreading propaganda
and lies uh and conspiracy theories this is extremely lucrative
you can make millions of dollars doing this and you
can even justify to yourself that you're doing something good
because your intention is not to brainwash people your intention
is just to get clicks and so when someone accuses
you of of hey you know you're brainwashing your business
is brainwashing people through facebook ads or whatever you're going
to say no of course we're not we're just running
a business yeah you're just running a business unconsciously and
and of course we didn't we barely even started to
talk about now the giant corporations how giant corporations are
falling into this trap because all the giant corporations who
are trying to police their stockholders many of them publicly
traded what are they doing they're they're legal obligations to
maximize profits for their shareholders and so these corporations also
don't have a sense of life purpose we might say
that a life purpose applies to an individual but also
to a corporation a corporation believe it or not is
not inherently soulless a corporation can have a soul like
a human can have a soul it can have a
spirit a corporation can also be loving and selfless if
it's developed enough now most corporations aren't that way so
we tend to portray corporations as these evil soulless robotic
robotic-like structures which are inherently just profit-seeking and nothing else
this actually isn't true this is actually a common mistake
that many progressives and liberals make is i hear this
common criticism that all corporations they're just these heartless and
soulless entities no there's different gradations of corporations some are
more conscious than others just like humans are some humans
are more conscious than others and the more conscious the
corporation is the more sense of a life purpose it'll
have the more sense of responsibility it'll have for its
impact on the world and on society and the more
it will try to promote things like consciousness love and
selflessness rather than devilry and selfishness and fear and trying
to exploit the most common um denominator negative emotions uh
the reptile mind of its customers you see many of
the world's richest corporations are so rich because they're extremely
exploitative and they prey upon and they manipulate the reptile
mind of hundreds and hundreds of millions and billions of
people that's how they become so rich how do you
think facebook is so rich facebook is so rich you
know mark zuckerberg i was looking at his net worth
the other day i think it's close to 100 billion
dollars is mark zuckerberg is done with how did he
where did that net worth come from that net worth
is directly proportional to the fact that advertising is so
lucrative on facebook because you can go on facebook and
you can advertise the most low brow low consciousness [
__ ] possible and people will just slop it up
like pigs at the trough and and there's no moral
qualms no company has moral qualms about doing this i
had a friend who who was actually into pickup he
was a pickup buddy of mine a long time ago
and then i had a uh i kind of lost
touch with him for a few years then uh he
called me and we reconnected over the phone a few
years ago this was and we were just talking i
was kind of like asking him what he does now
he used to work for he used to work for
a for a big online company he was like one
of their sales people and then he quit that job
though he wanted to go into business for himself i'm
like hey what are you doing he's like oh yeah
i'm uh yeah i'm doing great leo i'm doing great
i've got my business i'm earning six figures now you
know i've only been doing this business for a year
but i'm already making six figures you know life is
going awesome i'm building this business up i'm like oh
yeah what what are you doing he's like oh yeah
i'm selling boner pills on on facebook yeah see that's
what happens when you don't have a conscious life purpose
now you might say well leo having a conscious life
purpose this is a luxury this is only something you
can afford once you have lots of money in a
certain sense yes but in a certain sense no the
problem is that i mean yes if you're so strapped
for money that you like you need money tomorrow to
pay your electric bill otherwise your kids are going to
be sitting there in the dark yeah this life purpose
is not going to work for you because you can't
create a life purpose in a day or an or
even in a year so you need do need to
have enough savings and backup capital to to kind of
hold yourself over for a while while you build out
your life purpose this is a long-term plan but that's
also why it's valuable you see if you could do
it so quickly then it wouldn't really be valuable so
just take that into account but but also if you
if you have this mentality that life purpose is just
this luxury that only the rich people can afford uh
you're not really you're not really understanding this this is
not about this is this is really sort of a
spiritual stance that you take this is not about uh
a luxury like oh yeah i just want to have
some it's a luxury to have work that i enjoy
doing don't think of this as a luxury this is
not a luxury the proper mindset here is to think
that this is this is why i'm alive why am
i alive i'm not alive to be a tool to
earn money to pay my electric bills that's not why
i'm alive i'm alive for some deeper reason and that
reason i can't allow myself to sell myself out i
can't sell that reason i can't just say oh okay
well oh you're gonna pay me a hundred thousand dollars
to to sell uh penis pills on facebook okay yeah
i'll forget all about my you know the purpose of
my life and i'll just go sell penis pills on
facebook see if you do that you've sold your soul
to the devil now i'm not even saying there's anything
inherently wrong with selling penis pills on facebook especially if
that's part of your way of ultimately reaching towards a
life purpose there's nothing wrong with that so for example
in the way that i started my life purpose is
i knew that i couldn't just immediately jump into it
i had to bootstrap it so i actually went and
i i worked in a business the first business that
i started was not a business that i really enjoyed
and you might say aha leo that makes you a
hypocrite no it doesn't make me hypocrite that was strategic
i told myself from the beginning that i'm going to
do this work that i don't enjoy for the next
three or four years i'm going to build up capital
then i'm going to use that to quit that that
work that i don't enjoy and then for the rest
of my life then i will be doing my life
purpose and that's exactly what i did and that can
be necessary sometimes it's not so easy that it's like
oh well i'll just take leo's course and then i'll
find my life purpose and then i'll just go i'll
go and i'll become a a famous music producer or
a successful artist or whatever no if only it was
that easy you might have to do work that you
don't like for a certain number of years just to
earn just to earn the right to live a life
of purpose you see unfortunately today the way our society
is structured under capitalism we live under wage slavery the
majority of us do not me personally i've been i've
been a non-wage slave for for 10 years now but
uh you know i have worked as a wage slave
for one year i hated it so much that i
was so motivated to to quit that job and to
become a non-wage slave that it didn't take me very
long to do it it took me about six months
to do it um it'll probably take most you longer
and i was lucky in certain respects and i had
certain privileges that that many people don't have frankly but
um but nevertheless i think it's it's worth it's worth
working towards even look at this if you're feeling bad
in your life right now and you feel like you're
stuck in a dead-end job and you feel like you
don't even have a prospect you don't even know how
you might become that artist or that musician or whoever
you want to become doing something that you're passionate about
and i feel so hopeless to you here's the hope
the hope is that you can spend the next five
years working towards getting yourself out of wage slavery and
then by that point you'll have a clear picture of
exactly what your passion is because right now you're probably
not even clear what you would do if i gave
you 100 million dollars right now and told you go
do your passion you probably wouldn't be able to do
it simply because you don't have the skills you don't
even have the clarity of vision of what it is
that you would be doing with 100 million dollars you'd
probably just waste it on drugs and hookers and whatever
else uh some expensive house uh so the hope is
that you can spend the next five years consciously breaking
free of wage slavery for the purpose of so that
in the future for the next 30 40 50 years
of your life you can live as a non-wage slave
and have the freedom to create the kind of meaningful
life that you want so in that sense money is
important i am not one of these spiritual people that
says that all money is unimportant and it's irrelevant and
it's the root of all evil no money is a
resource it's important how money is distributed one of the
problems we have in society right now is the way
money is distributed it's so skewed towards the top the
majority of people don't have enough breathing room and they're
stuck as wage slaves see my episode how to escape
wage slavery by the way which will dovetail nicely with
this conversation and so because of this capitalist system basically
the majority of mankind's potential is pissed down the toilet
because they don't have enough money even to give them
the freedom to take a year off for example from
their work to figure out their life purpose and have
a little bit of starting capital to get it off
the ground see most people are under so much debt
credit card debt and other sorts of debt that they
have no hope of doing this it'll take them five
or ten years just to work their way out of
wage slavery but you know what that's better than being
a wage slave for the next 40 years so rather
than just accepting it i recommend that you make one
final push to break free set the goal to not
be a wage slave and that in five or ten
years you're going to achieve that goal and then also
you're going to find your life purpose and then you're
going to create a life aligned with that life purpose
and you will never sell out to anybody again from
that point on and that will have been your arc
your growth curve is that the next 10 years will
be you outgrowing wage slavery learning how to do that
taking a little by taking a lot of responsibility to
begin with for your life developing the skills the vision
the reading the right books going to the right courses
and seminars and trainings to develop all that developing some
expertise so you can actually offer value to the world
and then so what you have to look forward here
is that in 10 years time you can be working
on something that you find deeply meaningful and passionate that
you're passionate about and in this way you will escape
the dangers of a toxic life purpose and if you
want to more assistance for how to do that if
you're serious only if you're very serious do i recommend
that you check out my life purpose course in which
case you'll find a link down below go check out
there's some free sample videos you can watch there to
get a taste of whether the course is right for
you or not and it's going to be 25 hours
of content along these lines so if you liked what
i talked about in this video the life purpose course
is just a very extended version of this but with
exercises and it's uh it's very practical i want you
to understand that any time that i publish a course
and i'll be publishing new courses in the future on
various topics the courses are always designed to be extremely
practical with techniques and methods and so forth for people
who are actually serious about implementing stuff my normal content
is more philosophical it's more theoretical uh it's not built
like a training or a workshop whereas the courses are
because in a course we need we need that 25
hours or something like that an extended period of time
where we can go through it um you know step
by step by step which doesn't just it doesn't really
work in these short little videos all right that's it
i'm done here please click click that like button for
me and come check out actualize.org this is where you'll
find the live purpose course you will find my book
list you will find my blog you will find the
forum where you can go um get advice from others
who are also trying to live a life of purpose
we have a section there a sub forum called life
purpose and entrepreneurship where you can talk about this sorts
of stuff if you'd like you can support me on
patreon at patreon.com actualize and that's it yeah i mean
i don't know i i'm trying to imagine where i
would be today if i didn't consciously decide to live
a life of purpose like that was a super conscious
decision for me it was a very difficult decision i
remember i remember like it was yesterday where i was
and what my thought process was for deciding to go
through with it because i had to quit my job
and i had a pretty good job it was hard
to quit that job uh that job was better than
most people's jobs i had to quit that um but
the way i was reasoning i'm thinking back the way
that i reasoned about it back then was that i
was so young back then i was like 24 years
old i said to myself something along the lines of
like what is even the point of living if i'm
not gonna go say yes to this idea of living
a life fully on purpose like i don't even see
the point of living anymore i can't be passionate about
life that way and so for me in a sense
it was a huge choice but it wasn't almost it
almost wasn't even a choice and the reason it wasn't
even a choice was because there was no possibility of
me sticking around in that dead end job and really
it wasn't a dead-end job i mean i had good
career prospect i could have made a career out of
that job but um but compared to the potential that
i saw that i had of what i was capable
of that job was keeping me down here compared to
where i knew i wanted to be right so a
lot of this is about building a very powerful vision
of who you can become most people have such a
weak vision of their potential and that's one of my
biggest functions here with this work in this this channel
is that i cover so much material and in a
subtle implicit way i'm always trying to show you how
much potential you have as a human being and even
beyond a human being you have you have no clue
how much potential you have and the only way you're
going to know how much potential you have is by
spending the next 10 or 20 years working your ass
off to actualize that potential doing this by doing all
the work that i talk about and then looking back
retrospectively only then will you appreciate how much potential you
were able to actualize that you wouldn't have otherwise and
then you will be so thankful you will be so
thankful that you decided to do this work and that
you took it seriously when everybody around you was naysaying
you and telling you that it wasn't important and they
weren't doing it themselves like your family and your colleagues
and your friends because they're not going to be doing
this work but uh yeah the the the payoffs of
this work really come 10 years down the road like
the really heavy payoffs now that doesn't mean you can't
get immediate payoffs you can get some great payoffs even
in six months even in a year you'll get payoffs
so don't think that you have to wait for 10
years to get the payoffs but you know i want
to really prime your mind to have a long-term vision
and to work towards that every day and in a
sense this is what grounds you it gives your life
an anchor and of course this anchor is artificial you
might say well leo but isn't all this just more
ego you're just driving people deeper into ego again there's
many degrees and qualities of ego so yes it is
ego yes the mind is constructing this meaning and in
the end it's all meaningless and in the end it
doesn't matter what kind of work you do if you
don't do any work at all nothing matters but uh
you're not you're not nearly conscious and developed enough to
live your life in accordance with the nothing matters idea
to you that's just an idea that doesn't function in
your life it might take you 50 years of spiritual
work to actually get to a stage where you can
truly live from a place where nothing matters and yet
you're living a good life from that place for the
average person that's not how it's going to work for
the average person life matters very much and if if
you don't consciously create the kind of life that you
want then you're going to be living a shitty life
and you're going to be suffering that shittiness and you're
gonna be taking the whole world down with you so
i recommend that you don't be that guy you
