[Music] how to fall in love with reality or life
i see far too many people disillusioned with reality or
life even amongst supposed spiritual people uh i see people
doing spirituality getting involved with psychedelics or meditation or whatever
going on the spiritual path and they just actually rather
than gaining a zest for life they lose the zest
for life and this episode is about getting you to
reconnect with the magic of life again see zest in
life is not optional this is not just a luxury
this is essential for living a good life and these
days there's so much depression nihilism cynicism inaction going around
so much feeling sorry for yourself so much complaining and
whining and trolling and you have to discipline yourself to
cut through all of this [ __ ] this is
human [ __ ] you have to understand this is
not how you create a great life for yourself and
if you're not increasing your zest for life as you're
doing this work and by this work i mean self-help
personal development spirituality whatever you want to call it whatever
you're doing if it's not increasing your zest for life
then you have to change you're doing it wrong it's
a bit tricky and counter-intuitive because we get on this
self-development treadmill of trying to improve ourselves whether you're improving
your financial situation or your relationships or your self-esteem or
whatever your ability to meditate you're trying to improve that
but you get so caught up in getting into this
self-development rat race that it actually robs you of the
zest for life that you had when you were younger
when you weren't consciously thinking about all this stuff and
there's a certain pressure that personal development puts upon you
and spiritual development a lot of pressure is put upon
you to you know to act in a saintly way
to be loving towards people to not get angry to
not be sad to not have suffering all this sorts
of stuff right um and then especially as you're you
know the first let's say five years of of this
work that you're going to do maybe even 10 years
of this work it's going to place a burden on
you that normal people normies as we call them that
normies don't have people who are not doing spiritual development
who are not doing personal development who are not trying
to actualize their full potential in life in a sense
they have a much easier life and in a certain
sense there's a sort of a naive ignorance and almost
zest for life that can just come from living life
mindlessly well you're robbing yourself of that if you're on
this journey with me towards self-actualization right but um look
uh if you could just immediately start improving your life
everybody would be into personal development and spirituality yes there's
going to be an initial upfront cost a sort of
a hump you have to go through before most of
the payoffs come it's a long-term investment that you're making
in yourself but also what can happen is you can
start to do personal development and spirituality in such a
way where you get like the wrong idea of what
personal development is about or what spirituality is about and
you turn into such a grind that it becomes its
own source of depression nihilism cynicism inaction feeling sorry for
yourself complaining about life this kind of stuff and i
want you to recognize that when whenever this happens to
you whether it's going to happen to you now or
it's going to happen to you in 10 years you
have to catch yourself and realize ah this doesn't feel
right and the reason it doesn't feel right something's like
something's not quite aligning in the way that i'm pursuing
personal development or spirituality yeah it's because you got some
bad ideas you have fantasies about how to do personal
development spirituality and you have to adjust those right your
initial ways of doing personal development and spirituality are going
to be rather naive and misguided and maybe even 180
degrees the opposite of the way you will be ultimately
doing it to get that kind of zest from life
that you want that's ultimately what this is about if
this work is not improving your life why are you
doing it but you see there's some tricks here because
you have to kind of upgrade your entire approach towards
life because if you enter personal development and spirituality with
this attitude of like well so this is going to
be as fun as playing video games right or it's
going to be as fun as watching netflix all day
or this is going to be as fun as smoking
weed with my friends and doing nothing or pigging out
on junk food it's going to be as great right
except i'm going to be improving my life too no
it's going to be a different kind of satisfaction fulfillment
that you get from doing personal development and spirituality and
you have to retrain your mental palate so to speak
you have to retrain it in a more mature sophisticated
manner to be able to appreciate what personal development and
spirituality will do for you in your life because if
all you're chasing after his dopamine hits and raw pleasure
personal development and spirituality is not going to give you
too much of that you're going to be disappointed but
that's actually okay because what you'll realize as part of
this personal development and spiritual growth process is that these
dopamine hits that you've been addicted to your whole life
and that you have called happiness that this is not
what true happiness is really about and it's not really
what you want out of life this is not how
you create a great life so this fantasy you have
of the great life being a constant never-ending dopamine you
know treadmill of ever greater spikes of dopamine this this
this itself is a fantasy you have to drop and
you're going to be very glad that you outgrow that
fantasy because that fantasy itself is what's keeping you stuck
and it's going to create the depression the niles and
the cynicism the disillusionment with life feeling sorry for yourself
complaining right because that's an unsustainable strategy it's not going
to really work so here's what will work here's what
mature living really is like and this is really what
you want to do in your life if you're young
if you're like in your teens or your early 20s
uh what you want to do is you want to
transition yourself away from the paradigm of living life the
way that most of your friends and people you know
or what is shown to you in social media and
in advertisements all that approach to happiness and to living
to this totally new paradigm of living and i'm going
to give you a couple of like core pillars here
that you can use for the rest of your life
right and the quicker you can get to this mature
way of living this mature attitude uh the more fulfillment
you'll get out of life and the more success you'll
have in life and the more you will love life
and the longer you wait the more disillusioned you will
become with life okay so here's the first pillar the
first pillar for how to fall in love with life
or reality is falling in love with consciousness itself this
is the ultimate pillar so i'm just gonna lead with
this falling in love with consciousness itself what is consciousness
consciousness is everything it's everything you see around you it's
this the colors the sounds the sensations it's your entire
field of experience it's everything you can interact with in
life it is life itself right so if you're gonna
fall in love with life or with reality but you're
not falling in love with consciousness then how is that
ever going to work because life and reality are consciousness
so first it's going to help for you to realize
that life and reality are conscious that's something you have
to awaken to you know have some awakenings in the
nature of consciousness i've talked about that elsewhere but but
really look this is a practice this is a practice
that you cultivate it's a mature attitude towards life where
like you can just sit there and look at your
hand recognizing it as consciousness a figment of consciousness see
my episode called everything is states of consciousness states of
consciousness is everything that's what i titled it but like
the ability like one of the greatest things that i've
gotten from all of my personal development and spiritual work
is that i can sit here and just observe consciousness
whatever i'm looking at my hand or even a computer
like i could be looking at a laptop and just
appreciate that my laptop is made out of consciousness and
just sit there and marvel at that fact or i
can marvel at the fact that my hand is mad
at consciousness i can appreciate the beauty and magic of
consciousness and this sort of appreciation you know it gets
overlooked as we're going about our daily tasks but if
you're overlooking the the magic of consciousness in a sense
you're overlooking the magic of life this is one of
the reasons you've lost the zest for life you're disillusioned
with life because you're disconnected with spirit this is spirit
spirit is is not some sort of thing you find
in some sort of other dimension spirit is here you
have to recontextualize mundane life as spirit and appreciate it
as such and this gives you a subtle joy and
fulfillment that you won't get in any other way you
can't get it from any kind of pleasure hi now
i'm going to keep talking about how to fall in
love with consciousness here in a moment but let's also
introduce the other pillars that are going to be a
little more down to earth for you guys the other
that's the core pillar the other sub-pillars here that's going
to help create a great life for you is you
want to fall in love with health write this down
with health with growth with learning with investing in yourself
with execution consistent execution and with creativity those are the
other pillars so we'll talk about those in a second
let's get back to what does it mean to fall
in love with consciousness to fall in love and consciousness
is to be connected to the beauty and wonder of
consciousness if you're able to do that the power of
that do you see since everything is consciousness if you're
able to see the beauty and wonder of any fragment
of consciousness or figment of consciousness then you're basically that's
going to enable you to then see the beauty and
wonder of everything around you of every person of everything
of every idea and this is an attitude you cultivate
where you really spend time in your day just looking
at figments of consciousness and appreciating them for what they
are in and of themselves not for how you can
use them to make money or whatever or to get
yourself the next dopamine hit but just appreciate them appreciate
the beauty of it and then there's actions you can
take in order to deliver on your appreciation to deepen
your appreciation of consciousness right i mean the most basic
action you could just sit there and sort of meditate
or just marvel at it see something beautiful and appreciate
it for what it is but you can take that
deeper you can study consciousness you can study how it
works you can explore consciousness you can marvel at it
in deeper ways you can also use it to be
creative you can use it to inspire you have you
ever been inspired by something like a work of art
so let me speak to you artists out there right
now artists designers creative types of people um one of
the things that fuels you because i'm a very creative
sort of person um one of the things that i
know fuels us artists is that we have that ability
to see something beautiful and then be inspired by that
thing to then create our own copies of it or
to create variations upon that that's how it works for
us artists so you know we see something beautiful like
oh i wanna that's so cool that's a cool piece
of reality i wanna be able to replicate that or
i wanna take that and recreate it and then take
it to the next level whether it's a piece of
music a video game a movie that you see a
graphic design on a t-shirt or a painting whether a
modern one or a classical one right and what's happening
there is that the artist has the ability more so
than like the business person or some or like a
factory worker to to to see to see the the
beauty and wonder the artistry of consciousness now this isn't
just limited to artists i mean like intellectuals can do
this too you can do this in an intellectual manner
um and i resonate of course you know being both
very artistic myself very creative and also very intellectual um
i can kind of see it from multiple perspectives but
it's like for the intellectual there's a sort of a
a mental appreciation that we partake in like if you're
doing mathematics you can see the beauty of mathematics this
is what like really drives great mathematicians is the beauty
of numbers the beauty of patterns that they find in
numbers in geometry for example or with fractals or with
algebraic equations whatever it might be for you and you
know with scientists like biologists and chemists you know they
see beauty in molecular biology or looking at a cell
under a microscope and seeing you know its design and
all the little you know particles and molecules floating around
there all the different organelles of the cell and how
they work and studying that stuff it's like you're studying
god that's really what drives the scientist or when you're
looking up at the stars you're seeing the stars and
then you know if you become an astronomer um or
an astrophysicist you know it's because you look up at
the night sky you wonder at that and you think
about you know how many stars are out there how
many billions and trillions of different stars and galaxies and
what kind of alien life can live out there you
know it it captures your imagination inspires you and if
you're an engineer then you're inspired by the beauty of
uh of mechanics mechanics itself can be beautiful just you
can look at some gears or some cogs you can
look at a beautifully designed screw or a null nut
or a bolt or a circuit board and that can
you know fill you with wonder and awe and then
you want to create your own and you want to
take it to the next level you see so you
can pursue engineering or science or academia or even art
in a very shallow materialistic way where it's like you
know yeah i'm just gonna i'm gonna just engineer some
gadget i'm gonna engineer a car i'm gonna engineer a
computer because it needs to fulfill some function and meet
my boss's deadline right so that i can get my
bills paid you can approach engineering in that way you
can approach academia in the same way or say yeah
i got to show up to class and teach a
bunch of stupid kids you know some rudimentary stuff about
math or science and then i go home and do
my own thing right you could treat it that way
um or you can just treat art that way too
it's like you can show up to a you know
to some employer's office and then the employer tells you
what to draw for for their advertising campaign you draw
it because they need it um they make a bunch
of money they give you some of that and then
and then you're done with your day's work but see
you're not gonna ever fall in love with reality that
way you're just going through the motions you've made life
mechanical material you robbed it of its soul because you're
not connected in any deep way to the consciousness that
it's running all of life all these things are consciousness
the the screws and gears in your mechanical inventions this
is consciousness the computer that you're programming that's consciousness the
advertisement that you're making and the minds that it is
influencing the millions of minds that it's influencing across the
internet or on television that's consciousness interacting with consciousness when
you're looking up at the stars and you're studying astrophysics
that's consciousness when you're studying mathematics and logic that's consciousness
but when you're not aware of that then you're not
really able to fall in love with it as effectively
as you could and the more you become aware of
how all of it is conscious and how all that
interconnects the more odd you will be by it and
the more you will appreciate and fall in love with
reality because reality is just consciousness in different ways and
you can choose to fall in love with different aspects
of consciousness you know some things will excite you more
than others not everything will be equal in your eyes
because you're biased and that's fine so what you can
do is you can use creativity as a sort of
a medium and a leverage like a lever in order
to deepen your appreciation and connection to consciousness so like
for me for example i used to be a video
game designer um and the thing that inspired i wanted
to be a video game designer when i was seven
years old when i placed my played my first game
boy game um you know the shitty old game boy
that used to exist it was like this green mono
mono colored screen it was you know by today's standards
it was awful but back then just seeing the pixels
moving across the screen that captured something in me and
what i recognize now you know in retrospect what that
captured in me is like the motion graphics aspect of
video games to me i just as a child i
intuited the beauty and wonder of that and really what
i was connecting with was the the motion graphic potential
of consciousness and it's a and and the potential there
to use these pixels to create new worlds that's in
a sense what you know video game development is you're
creating new worlds that couldn't exist otherwise you're literally playing
god creating worlds within consciousness using you know very specific
you know medium of pixels on a screen um but
that's fundamentally what you're doing and so i fell in
love with that um to me that wasn't just like
oh i'm just going to create a video game as
it's like a distraction from being bored in life it's
like no no no no it was something very profound
for me like for many people when they think about
video games like oh it's just a toy leo why
you're so seriously why would you be interested in video
games they're just toys for children it's like yeah you
could see it that way if you choose to that's
a shallow way to see it i never saw it
that way and other people like a business person might
look at a video game say oh that's a great
way to make a lot of money like you could
make a billion dollar video game and i never saw
it that way either to me video games were never
about making money um to me video games were about
connecting to the deepest aspect of reality being able to
to literally manifest my own dreams and you know worlds
that i imagined and then and then making it look
beautiful with with with motion graphics that's to me what
was amazing is like you're able to create this interactive
reality like a dream like a virtual dream matter of
pixels and you're able to make it you know as
beautiful as you want basically unlimited especially these days you
know graphic potential is almost unlimited these days you can
create almost any kind of world you want you can
pack it with whatever kind of creatures and people and
plants and environments and vehicles that you want and then
and then like any literally like i mean like your
imagination is the limit when it comes to that you
get to play god that to me is what inspired
me to to be so passionate about about games you
see that's it it was always spiritual for me even
though back then i didn't i didn't know the word
spiritual i didn't know what it meant i didn't know
how all this connected now in retrospect it's obvious right
but how great would it have been if i was
conscious and explicit about this you know back then it
would really help me to kind of see where i'm
going and why why i see things differently than other
people do and also why i'm so passionate about these
things and also how do you develop passion for something
right so you can kind of like i can kind
of reverse engineer how i became passionate about life when
i was young i can reverse engineer that i can
see the principles behind it and now i'm teaching you
those principles this doesn't have anything to do with video
games you could do this with like i said engineering
computers anything art whatever you want right so one of
the deepest joys you can get out of life is
being creative because you are god and god is creativity
there's a almost metaphysical joy that comes from being creative
when you learn how to be creative in the right
ways and a lot of people are missing out on
this creativity i think most humans on this planet are
not tapping into like even one percent of their creative
potential this is a a gross insult to your nature
as god and i think that honestly i think that
an enormous amount of people simply end up killing themselves
or being stuck in depression or nihilism or cynicism or
just wasting their entire life simply because nobody ever shows
them their full creative potential and how to actualize it
we don't really teach our children how to be creative
if they become creative it's only through their own sort
of intuitive efforts that they do it we don't have
a rigorous process for teaching people how to be creative
how to find their creative niche what they want to
be creative in all the different ways that creativity can
manifest itself because like when you say creative to the
average person they think like oh art or painting it's
like but i'm not a painter i'm not good at
drawing therefore i'm not creative it's like no there are
so many different ways to be creative you can be
creative in business in science and mathematics and in programming
in communicating with people in public speaking there's an infinite
number of ways to be creative and then and then
to develop your capacity to be creative in some niche
this is not just a way to earn money this
is not just a way to doodle on a you
know on a notebook and to entertain yourself when you're
bored in class you have to see it for something
much deeper this is your way of connecting to consciousness
and falling in love with consciousness this is your way
of honoring and appreciating consciousness when you really appreciate it
it's not enough just to marvel at it with your
eyes you want to participate in it you want to
participate in the creative process and so the more you
you start to appreciate your life as this work of
consciousness this work of art you start to see the
miracle of your life the miracle being able to participate
in this beautiful wondrous thing called consciousness this mysterious thing
called consciousness and then as you get in touch with
the magic of it the divinity of it you start
to respect and appreciate it and then you want to
devote and sacrifice your life working on its behalf and
that's when your life becomes meaningful that's when you connect
to life and then when you start to sacrifice and
work towards it every single day that's when each of
your days becomes precious and it come becomes meaningful in
that it's a it's a sacrifice you're making towards the
miracle of life now i want you to consider this
this attitude that i'm i'm giving you right here versus
the sort of typical attitude you have towards your life
the typical attitude that your parents or your your friends
or your coworkers have towards your life where they just
wake up and then they're just running around doing the
rat race stuff they got to do like doing their
chores paying their bills doing what the boss told them
to do that kind of stuff right very notice how
different these attitudes are like very very disconnected from the
beauty the wonder the divinity the mirror the the miraculous
nature the mystery of consciousness like conscious has nothing to
do with the with with the sort of attitude of
just kind of like going through your day paying your
bills earning some money doing your chores and yeah that's
why you become disillusioned with life that's why you become
depressed because what joy can there be how can you
love life when you live that way you're just jumping
through hoops basically utilitarian hoops avoiding suffering and pain trying
to minimize your suffering trying to minimize people yelling at
you for failing to do your job failing to show
up on time this is this is not a positive
constructive way to live this is a this is sort
of like you're just living along the path of least
resistance like you're going to school to do your homework
so that your parents don't yell at you kind of
thing or you're just doing the bare minimum at your
job so your boss doesn't fire you sort of thing
so that you can pay your bills come home at
night and just eat some junk food and watch some
netflix and then do it all over again the next
day this is this is if you're gonna live a
life like that you might as well not live at
all you're wasting your life and deep down in your
soul in your spirit so to speak you feel that
you know that you're living way below your full potential
and you should be unsatisfied with that kind of lifestyle
that's a signal that your spirit is sending to you
that you have to be able to decode and realize
like ah yeah okay i'm not living in alignment with
my highest values i'm not living at my edge i'm
not in touch with the miracle of life in existence
and then yeah and then you start to wonder like
well what is the meaning of all this leo why
was i even born why why is god god such
a bastard you know put me here what kind of
god would create something like this look the amazing thing
about life is that you get to construct your own
life that's what makes life so amazing like if you
don't participate in the construction of your life consciously then
it's like you're not living at all and then it
can't be wonderful but if you take conscious control and
you realize that like you're in a sandbox you're in
an infinite sandbox here you can play around you can
be creative you can you can build whatever you want
now it doesn't really matter what you build and see
if you're nihilistic you're going to say well leo what
does it matter if i build this or if i
build that all of it in the end you know
in the end i'm going to die everyone's going to
die the human race is going to die the sun
is going to engulf the earth and the whole universe
will go into a heat death and in the end
what does it really matter what i create that's exactly
right it doesn't matter at all what you create but
what matters is how you live the principles by which
you live how consciously you live how much you appreciate
the process the honor with which you live so to
speak like are you gonna live with deliberate intention are
you gonna have a vision for yourself are you gonna
create something out of your life from scratch that's really
the opportunity that life is affording you that's challenging taking
that on is a huge challenge is difficult it's a
struggle it's not just pure positivity and and pleasure that
you get when you undertake this process it requires serious
work so the question is why would you ever do
this work why not just coast through life and the
answer is very simple is that if you decide to
coast through life and not deliberately challenge yourself to work
to honor the miracle of consciousness of which you are
apart then what's going to happen is by default you're
going to get disillusioned you're going to be compassive you're
going to go with a status quo of whatever everyone
else is doing around you you're going to join the
herd of sheep walking off a cliff around you which
is what society is you're going to engage in dumb
petty shallow animalistic behaviors you're going to pursue dopamine hits
just to hold you off you're going to be addicted
to all sorts of things from sex to food to
porn to um to trolling people online to watching hours
and hours of tv and social media and perhaps even
worse things like hard drugs and alcohol and you're going
to slowly go down this gradual downward spiral to the
point where eventually you're gonna get so stuck that you're
gonna start to seriously consider killing yourself because this is
no way to live life but but see the the
the problem is gonna be you're gonna you're gonna you're
gonna dig yourself in such a deep hole because you're
gonna fail to invest in yourself and to build up
and to work you know investing building up is working
it involves work you're going to miss so many decades
of work that you could have done to really build
up a beautiful life you're going to piss away 20
30 40 years of your life not doing that that
by the time you get to the point where you
realize oh [ __ ] i should have been doing
that what if what did i do it's gonna be
too late and your soul is gonna be so crushed
by the fact that you've wasted so much of your
life already not having done that that it's gonna be
easier for you to decide to kill yourself in many
cases than it will be to put yourself back on
track and to use the remainder of your life to
actually build yourself up and to invest in yourself every
decade that goes by that you don't invest in yourself
that you piss away is going to be that it's
going to be an order magnitude harder for you to
begin investing in yourself go see my episode about um
the importance of investing in yourself what was it what
did i title it i have so many episodes it's
hard for me to recall all their titles um yeah
like the importance of investing in yourself i'm going to
have the reason it's hard for me to call because
i have like multiple episodes about investing that i have
planned and a few i already released and a few
more that i want to release because it's such an
important topic this is probably the greatest danger that exists
in society today is just to become so complacent take
your survival and your life so for granted that you're
just going to do the bare minimum to survive and
that's it you're not going to really live to thrive
you're not going to challenge yourself you're not going to
take on deliberate challenges and to work extra hard to
build something beautiful because there's really nothing forcing you to
do it no one in society is is really beating
down your door telling you you have to do this
this is something again one of those things i've talked
about in the past where it's like this is one
of those subtle things you have to like cultivate within
yourself you have to you have to have the vision
to want to cultivate it within yourself because almost nobody
else out there is going to tell you to do
this and to watch you every single day doing it
right this requires consistent really daily life a lifelong commitment
to doing this on a daily basis now let's talk
about the some of the other pillars here what does
it mean to fall in love with some of this
other stuff like with health with growth and investing in
yourself with learning with execution with creativity well let's talk
about health for a second you could actually reprogram your
mind and shift your attitude such that for example when
you go to the office and all the co-workers there
are passing around uh you know a giant box of
free donuts that the boss has brought in and picking
out on those you might want to pig out on
one of those donuts too but you also know in
the back of your mind this is not healthy for
you it's not good for you it's gonna you're probably
gonna feel bad after you eat it in an hour
and you're probably gonna regret it the next day so
forth you can feel better relinquishing that donut then all
your co-workers combined will feel eating that donut there's a
certain mature joy that comes from renouncing something unhealthy and
conversely there's a certain joy that comes from consuming something
healthy health as a value and and by health i
don't just mean your physical body or like to not
be fat i mean health in like in a spiritual
way really i mean it in in the deepest possible
sense of health we've talked about health before in my
episode about holism and holistic thinking part one and part
two i gave you an equation part of that equation
remember i talked about holism health healing oneness unity love
number all that all that kind of stuff we made
this master equation i told you to write it down
as an important equation well we'll bring back that concept
here that equation plays into what i'm talking about here
because like health is really about holism and oneness it's
about wanting to be whole and this is a this
is a function of consciousness when when conscious functions in
a holistic intelligent manner its nature is to be healthy
and when consciousness is unhealthy like a if you have
a dysfunctional mind it's a fragmented mind it's a conflicted
mind that is fighting with itself that's what selfishness ultimately
is it's a conflict within consciousness it's distorted it's corrupted
right so when we're talking about the value of health
the principle of health here to have an attitude of
falling of with health is not just to not eat
the donut because you're not going to look like how
you look in the mirror because you're going to be
too fat it goes way deeper than that it's like
no if i'm not healthy in all the dimensions that
health pertains to then in a certain sense i'm disrespecting
life i'm disrespecting consciousness i'm disrespecting myself and i'm disrespecting
god that's the level you want to take it to
and we're talking about not just the food you put
in your body not just the way that you exercise
but also the way you communicate with other people is
that healthy are your relationships healthy is your mind healthy
is the information you're putting into your mind on a
daily basis is that healthy or is that toxic and
dysfunctional and corrupt are the systems you're participating in are
they healthy like the company you work for is a
healthy company or a dysfunctional company that is a predatory
company that is producing a net negative impact on the
world or society you see this matters because if you're
working for a company that you don't believe in its
mission its purpose and doesn't align with your values then
that misalignment already is going to make you disillusioned and
depressed about life in subtle ways that you may not
fully appreciate for 10 20 years and see so when
you cultivate this attitude and like the joy that comes
from doing healthy things this is this is a sort
of a more holistic approach to the problem like for
example losing weight because see when most people want to
lose weight they're like leo give me three quick steps
for how to lose weight for my wedding that's coming
up it's like this is this is completely the wrong
approach the right approach is to develop this attitude of
reverence towards life and consciousness and to yourself and your
mind to the point where you don't want to poison
yourself with bad food because you see how this is
gonna damage not just your body in the short term
it's gonna damage your mind your brain your ability to
think your ability to be creative your ability to ultimately
honor god and consciousness you see it's gonna reduce your
ability to be mindful and to concentrate and to maintain
focus and that's not and you're so conscious of that
that it's easy for you to say no to the
donut in that case you're not even tempted in that
case because you would be losing your very connection to
life if you did that that's the depth of the
attitude you need to have to build an amazing life
to fall in love with life to really see see
how much you're respecting yourself in this case and how
much you're respecting consciousness you have too much respect for
yourself and for consciousness and for the miracle of reality
to live it in such an artless way of just
stuffing yourself like a pig with donuts just because your
boss brought them in it's like yeah leo but they're
free yeah but like how little respect must you have
for yourself to to stuff your mouth with poison that's
going to disrespect the entire universe just because it's free
or conversely you could go to your you know your
local market and buy some you know organic fruit drink
healthy fruit drink or some you know fresh fruits or
some vegetables or whatever or go do some juicing at
home you know yeah that's going to cost you a
bit more it's going to take more effort it's not
going to be as popular as eating the donuts with
the friends at work but see when you go and
you say order the donuts and you go to the
grocery store instead and you drink a healthy you know
celery juice or something like that instead you can there's
a higher level joy you can get out of that
and but that's not something that comes straight from the
celery juice it's not like you're gonna drink that celery
juice and it's gonna be like oh yeah it's like
oh it's as good as a donut no it's not
as good as a donut if all you're doing is
just you're comparing like the raw pleasure of a donut
versus a celery juice but what you can do is
you can program your mind with this attitude this this
this larger respect and purpose that you have in life
that by fulfilling on your purpose and by sacrificing and
honoring on behalf of this larger purpose that connects with
your spirituality you can get a deeper high sort of
a mental high a spiritual high from executing on those
healthy activities that you know you need to execute on
versus eating that donut the pleasure in eating that one
donut but that's something you have to create for yourself
using your mind deliberately consciously see because the thing with
the donut is that the donut you can give it
a donut to an idiot and the idiot will still
enjoy its taste because it just it's like a direct
hit on your you know pleasure tongue receptors so to
speak whereas with the celery juice it doesn't work that
way it's not that same in fact when you're drinking
a celery juice it tastes a little bit gross so
why would anyone ever drink it well because there's a
higher overriding value of health and what you're really getting
pleasure from is not from the celery juice but from
the health that you know the celery juice is providing
to you but that requires extra mental construction you see
you have to know what you're living for you have
to have a vision of health because health is a
long-term thing it's also a much broader thing than just
the food you eat and see when you have a
very high level abstract and proper understanding of health that
isn't just based on particular foods but it's just a
whole attitude towards life then what you can do is
you can create a sort of a synergy like the
celery juice you drink here instead of the donut that
you could have eaten and then you know the exercise
you do the yoga exercise maybe you do instead of
just sitting on the couch all day or at the
computer and then maybe the healthy corporations that you apply
with your resume to versus the unhealthy ones that you
avoid and so forth this all interconnects together and then
when you're executing all on all of that successfully this
gives you the deepest fulfillment you can get in life
this is real happiness it's sustained you feel great about
yourself you feel great about your life you have high
self-esteem you feel strong you're living up to your own
values you're not sabotaging yourself you're in alignment you're holistic
right to be holistic means that all the parts of
you are working together in a synergistic manner towards some
higher ultimate purpose which let's say is in this case
consciousness or love this is what makes your life worthwhile
this is what makes it meaningful this is what gives
you integrity you know integrity is deeply related to the
concept of holism integrity is wholeness a lack of integrity
is a fragmentation of your mind and your life when
you're saying one thing but doing another thing lack of
integrity lack of consistency this actually robs you of mental
energy makes you feel bad about yourself because you're not
living up to your own ideals what does it mean
to fall in love with growth and investing in yourself
to me this is one of the greatest joys of
my life is when i am growing i'm doing something
to grow myself when i'm investing in myself it can
be big things maybe little things like just picking up
a book and reading a book that i know is
going to be good for me is going to give
me the right kind of information that i need to
later go on and you know do something like record
a video that will help many people thousands of people
to me that's an investment in myself when i'm doing
that i'm not getting particularly like high levels of you
know peak pleasure from reading a book but that that
sense that i'm investing into myself this becomes very fulfilling
especially after you've built up over years this kind of
habit and you've really built up a whole reservoir right
when you just read one book it's not a it's
not a huge investment in yourself you don't really feel
it but what's amazing is that the vision for me
like the vision of of reading 500 books and the
kind of neural network that that's going to develop in
my mind of information all the interconnections that i make
between those 500 books that i'm going to ultimately read
to me that is really fulfilling and really meaningful and
worthwhile and it might take a couple of decades to
read 500 books and interconnect them all in that way
but if i do that that is going to make
me so fulfilled and that's going to provide so much
value to my life and allow me to then provide
that value and share with others and it's going to
synergize with other aspects of of my life you know
those 500 books i'm going to read they're going to
help me to organize my own mind in a more
holistic integrated way and i'm going to also read about
health and that's going to make me better at nutrition
it's going to be better at fitness and exercise it's
going to make me better at the kind of work
that i do my work is going to be more
healthy my communications with people can be more healthy right
so it all synergizes together and this is what creates
profound meaning in your life and then after you execute
on that for decades that's when your life becomes amazing
how about so we talked about investing yourself growth so
anything you do in life that grows you even a
little bit you should get excited by that that should
be what you're doing like every morning you're waking up
what's the thing that's getting you excited is it just
to go to work to punch the clock no it
should be how are you going to grow today in
whatever you're doing whether it's your your business your your
craft your skill your art uh in your relationships in
your friendships in your social skills like lately i've been
motivated a lot to be going out and socializing a
lot and but i'm not just doing that just like
for fun every night that i go out and i
socialize like i have intentions of how i want to
grow how long i want to get better and i
have a vision in my mind of like where i'm
going to be in a few years or in five
years if i keep doing this keep investing my social
skills where that's going to put me how fulfilling that's
going to be for me and i'm simultaneously seeing the
fulfillment five years down the road that i'll be getting
when i achieve all this stuff and build up you
know a massive amount of momentum um and invest in
myself a lot but also i'm getting i'm also getting
fulfillment from executing that every single day now even though
if i just go out tonight i'm not going to
get all the benefit i'll get five years from now
but i'm gonna like i'm gonna be excited just to
do that because i can connect all those dots together
i see how just like one step leads to the
next in my mind but i have to create that
in my mind you see this is the kind of
living that like animals don't do animals can't do this
humans are capable of this but the way most humans
live most humans live like animals where they're not doing
this because this has to be done deliberately consciously you
have to plan it out and then you have to
execute on it the next pillar is learning we sort
of talked about it with the book example but that
was also like overlapping with the example of investing in
yourself but like learning um i have like three episodes
that i release that talk about learning learning is behavior
change learning equals making distinctions i have another one about
learning i even forgot what it was called but like
why do i focus so much on learning because basically
life your the quality of your life all hinges upon
your ability to learn every single day you should be
learning in your life and and i don't just mean
through books and i don't just mean through audio or
podcasts or something i mean these are sort of obvious
ways of learning but they're not even the highest forms
of learning the highest forms of learning is when you
put yourself face to face with a problem that you
have to solve an experiential problem where you're facing and
exposing yourself to new experiences of some kind that's when
you really learn if you undertake a difficult project and
you commit to accomplishing it no matter what that's when
your biggest learning will happen whether that's with your social
skills with your dating life with your sex life with
your business with your art skills with your speaking skills
with your relationship skills whatever that is you can be
learning on all these fronts every single day and you
can be doing it just sort of haphazardly by accident
the way most people do or you can do it
deliberately when you undertake the process deliberately that's when things
become exciting you're not just going to work just to
earn a paycheck or to accomplish some project you're going
to work primarily to learn how to get better at
whatever work you're doing and likewise in your relationships your
relationship is not just about extracting sex from somebody anymore
and it's not just about being comfortable with them and
having a good time uh you know vegging out on
the on the couch and watching netflix now it's about
learning together learning how to be better in relationships together
such that even if this particular relationship ends and collapses
which most of them do let's be honest um you're
still left with something you're left with the lessons that
you learned about how to be better in relationship and
then the next relationship you enter into you're going to
be a little bit better in and then you're going
to keep doing that and doing that and doing that
until eventually you learn how to do really good conscious
relationships so fall in love with learning an enormous chunk
of my life's meaning comes simply from simply from my
love of learning i love learning i love learning about
how the world works how consciousness works all learning you're
ultimately doing is an exploration of consciousness you're learning about
various aspects of consciousness even when you're learning about relationships
you're fundamentally learning about consciousness you're learning about different points
of view for example in relationships but even if you're
learning to draw you're learning about consciousness if you're learning
to make music you're learning about consciousness you're just not
really aware of that yet so if your life lacks
meaning how about you undertake a deliberate learning process every
single day for the rest of your life that will
quickly add a lot of meaning to your life the
next pillar is execution and this is a big one
and i think a lot of you guys are lacking
this honestly uh because i i've been talking about a
lot of advanced metaphysical epistemological philosophical sorts of topics spiritual
topics and the biggest problem here is that you guys
love to mentally masturbate about this stuff philosophize about it
in your armchair and then don't actually execute anything and
then you actually will use this as a way to
spiritually bypass becoming an executor in life and i've been
a bit guilty of this myself i think this is
sort of natural with with learning spirituality especially in the
first maybe five years that you're getting into spirituality a
lot of teachers and traditions they'll tell you to like
stop pursuing materialistic goals and stop caring about work so
much stop caring about results so much just you know
sit there and meditate that kind of thing and then
you become bad at execution but and then and then
and then like you you could actually tell yourself you're
becoming more spiritual but then your execution is waning your
capacity to execute is waning and then actually your self-esteem
is dropping at the same time and the reason that's
happening is because half of self-esteem is called self-worth the
other half of self-esteem is called self-efficacy self-efficacy is your
ability to go out there and execute and do the
things you want to do that you know you need
to do that are healthy for you that are aligned
with your values and so it can be easy to
to kind of trick yourself to fall off track with
that and so one of the things that i've really
realized lately is that like you can do all the
spiritual stuff but you have to maintain your ability to
execute otherwise your self-esteem is going to tank your self-efficacy
will tank you're going to feel weak you're going to
be afraid to go out into the world and just
do basic things because you've been sitting on the cushion
for so long you've gotten comfortable with that and now
you're not even comfortable going out there and like tackling
some material challenge your ability to execute is huge and
there's a joy that comes from simply executing consistently every
single day execute execute execute execute what i mean execute
you do the tasks that you know you need to
do to create the kind of life that you envision
yourself having that's what execution means whether it's reading a
book every day that you want to read or whether
it's going to work on time or whether it's meditating
every day on time or it's going out and socializing
or it's developing your sense of humor it's going to
the gym whatever it is execute on that as you
do that you become stronger and you feel more powerful
you feel more capable you don't feel like a weakling
you don't feel like life is this giant thing that
is oppressing you a lot of people who are stuck
in depression and nihilism they've been very poor executors to
the point where it's like they're in a state of
learned helplessness they're a victim they can't even do the
basic things of like picking up a book and reading
it for 30 minutes for a month straight they can't
do that what awakening will there be what spirituality would
there be what what love for life will there be
if you can't even pick up a book and read
it for 30 minutes for 30 days straight and be
consistent with that you see there's a joy that comes
from building this kind of discipline and again this is
not the kind of joy that just kind of like
it's not like eating a donut kind of joy it's
a joy you have to create in your own mind
it's a it's a more abstract kind of joy that
needs to be constructed where it's like the first week
that you execute consistently you're not going to feel that
great because like you're building a new habit but then
after like a month of executing consistently consistently consistently you
feel great every new day that comes you're like yeah
i want to i want to maintain my streak of
execution and then you see how that execution is investing
slowly in your life building you up growing you making
you more healthy helping you to learn honoring consciousness your
highest commitment in this life paying respect to your own
self into your life into the miracle of existence um
over time that snowballs and then you can build that
up in your mind where you get a deep satisfaction
out of that the alternative is don't do that and
then be be lazy be a slob be depressed and
also have nothing in your life to show for it
you're not going to have the money you're not going
to have the sex you're not going to have the
intimacy you're not going to have the friendships you're not
going to have the social connections you're not going to
have the skills the work skills you're not going to
have a good career and then your life truly isn't
worth living anymore at that point if that goes on
for too long you see the other pillar is creativity
i sort of tackled this when i was talking about
the first pillar of honoring consciousness but i think for
you to practically be fulfilled in life you got to
be creative in some capacity and this really we're talking
about your work here you're going to be living on
purpose for that see my life purpose course where i
talk about how to find your life purpose how to
find your values and all that sort of stuff and
then how to stay on track with that and how
to be creative with that these are the meat and
potatoes that make for a fulfilling beautiful meaningful life and
everything else is basically just distraction and petty human [
__ ] be very careful with this petty human [
__ ] i want you to get very good at
identifying it when it's happening around you and when you're
engaging in it what do i mean by petty human
[ __ ] i mean pop culture stuff i mean
gossip i mean celebrity news i mean all the social
games that humans play i mean status i mean money
i mean sex addiction i mean escapism i mean video
games politics chasing after luxury items and food this is
all petty human [ __ ] none of it produces
genuine fulfillment of any kind it's all temporary it all
comes and goes it's very inconsistent even if you do
get it it doesn't the happiness from it doesn't last
very long at all and in fact oftentimes it comes
with a sort of depression and disappointment that comes afterwards
even if you win at these things if you're engaging
in this petty human [ __ ] you're playing a
game that you cannot win however if you are engaged
in pursuing the the pillars i gave you above of
falling in love with consciousness and honoring it of pursuing
health and growth and investing in yourself and learning and
execution and creativity it's almost impossible to lose that game
do you see but you have to play this game
consistently and you have to motivate yourself to play that
game because others won't do it for you in fact
what they'll do is they'll distract you with the game
of petty human [ __ ] instead every time you're
trying to be healthy somebody's going to come along and
try to entice you with some petty human [ __
] like hey let's go to this restaurant and and
pig out on on our favorite pizza and you have
to say no that's petty human [ __ ] and
i respect my own life too much to go do
that with you and every time that you sit down
to read a book one of your friends is blowing
up your phone with celebrities latest like celebrity gossip that
they're sharing with you on social media or whatever or
some crypto coin get rich quick schemes like hey come
let's let's do this together some nft [ __ ]
you have to say no that's petty human [ __
] i'm gonna sit here and read this [ __
] book for for an hour instead of engaging with
you in your petty human [ __ ] while you're
doing all that petty human [ __ ] i'm gonna
build myself up into one of the most intelligent people
on this planet over the next 10 or 20 years
and meanwhile in 10 20 years you're just gonna be
engaged in the same [ __ ] you've been engaged
in with all your friends this is how you have
to think you have to be kind of ruthless here
about this the reason you have to be a bit
ruthless and strict with others and with yourself you have
to set these boundaries is because people will otherwise drag
you down into their petty human [ __ ] they're
really good at creating drama and distractions at enticing you
with with you know cheap thrills and things like this
you have to be disciplined enough you have to have
enough vision to say no to all of that and
just keep going with your vision your you know your
positive creative vision of the spiritual profound life you're going
to build for yourself over the next few decades slowly
day by day inch by inch this is about seeing
value long term you see where the true value in
life is and you see through the shallow stuff that
seems like it has value but is actually fool's gold
the petty human [ __ ] all that is fool's
gold you want to be going for the real gold
and the real gold is going to be the stuff
you have to sacrifice for and work for yourself consciously
deliberately intrinsically motivated to do not because somebody outside is
telling you to do something not because you saw something
on tv in some advertisement or because your friends are
doing it so i want you to notice that you
are addicted to low consciousness petty human [ __ ]
and this robs life of its beauty for you you
are literally selling off your future and your connection to
spirit and to god into love and to beauty you're
selling all of that off for a cheap quick hit
of dopamine and you've been doing this for years and
if you're depressed if you're stuck in life if you
hate life you're miserable this is why fundamentally this is
why so what needs to happen is you need to
start to develop an attitude of investing into shoring up
your fundamentals you need to change your attitude about the
things you're doing in your life you want to connect
with the joy of saying no to junk food and
eating healthy for example you want to connect with the
joy of being disciplined and doing your daily tasks you
want to connect with the joy of a productive creative
work day working on your life purpose the thing that's
most meaningful to you to create in life you want
to create joy around meditating rigorously you want to create
joy out of doing a 10-day solo meditation retreat connect
with the joy of hitting the gym consistently connect with
the joy of learning reading books listening to podcasts and
consuming high quality information how about connecting with the joy
of contemplation and solitude sitting there for hours contemplating your
life integrating deep insights you've had maybe from your spiritual
experiences how about the joy of sitting with with a
notebook and just journaling or planning out the next phase
of your life in your development like where are you
growing where are you going to be in a few
years sit down spend the next few hours just contemplating
that and enjoy that process and that is the fulfilling
life life is not going to get any more fulfilling
than that that process itself i'm not telling you that
you know when you're planning out your life that the
joy will come five years from now after your plan
is executed no no no the joy is in the
planning of your life right now and then of course
when you do execute it let's say in five years
there will also be some joy that comes from that
too but you're not going to be waiting five years
to get that joy you have to connect with the
joy of doing these healthy activities right now the joy
isn't the reward you get for being a good boy
or good girl for being healthy and not eating the
donut that's not that's not the reward the reward is
the healthy activity itself the reward is the rejection of
the donut you see the reward is drinking the glass
of celery juice that is the reward and you might
say well leo but that's not much of a reward
you have to rewire your entire mind and its reward
system that in and of itself is the reward see
to be able to rewire your whole mind and its
reward system that in itself can be a joy and
can be rewarding do you see that but only if
you make it so it's not just going to be
you know super thrilling automatically you have to construct a
compelling vision of that and then be inspired by that
and then as you're executing on that that will give
you your reward connecting with the joy of deliberate practice
and training up skills i have a few videos in
the past i've talked about this also in the life
purpose course about deliberate practice we talk about that a
lot there i have a video called um no success
is possible without training training training training you guys are
missing training i guarantee you if you're depressed then you
suck at training and you haven't been investing in your
training of your skills that's one of the reasons you're
depressed how about there's a joy that comes from doing
that from training but again this is a subtle joy
a mature joy that has to be built up you
have to build momentum up in this over over years
and decades how about the joy of daily visualization practice
you can get a lot of joy from visualizing effectively
which you guys aren't doing i guarantee you if you're
depressed you're not using visualization techniques at all i guarantee
you i mean actually i guarantee you are using them
but you're using them in sort of a unconscious negative
manner in other words you're just visualizing all the bad
stuff in your life and you're doing this completely unconsciously
what i mean by visualization training or practice is like
you're doing positive visualization very deliberately consciously every day you're
not doing that if you're depressed the joy of going
out to the club talking to girls if you're a
guy you're missing out on this joy there's there's a
joy that can be had there just not i'm not
talking about the joy of having sex i'm not talking
about the joy of making out with a hot girl
i'm talking about the joy of getting your ass off
your couch into your [ __ ] car driving to
the club and then doing your first approach that you
really don't want to do like jumping into a cold
pool the joy of doing that see that's a subtle
joy that's not the same kind of joy of having
sex most people are so stuck on the joy of
having sex that they just want that that they can't
see the joy of every day consistently going to the
club and doing an approach doing your first hard approach
they miss that joy and the only reason maybe they
do the approach is because they're telling themselves well maybe
i'll get me some sex but actually the funny thing
is is that you can get more joy out of
doing a month of consistent approaching than you will from
having sex but you have to program your mind in
the right way for that joy to happen for you
how about connecting with the joy of being on your
edge of being strong of facing your challenges and fears
of not avoiding them of not running away of not
procrastinating on them this is huge there's a huge joy
there's a sense of power you get when you execute
consistently and you're on your edge and you're facing challenges
and fears and you're doing it on a regular basis
and even if sometimes you fail at those challenges still
you don't give up and that gives you joy too
the joy of perseverance in the face of failure see
most of you who are depressed and nihilistic and disillusioned
with life you're the opposite of this you get a
little bit of challenging a little bit of failure and
immediately you go into into this catastrophizing negative thinking about
oh it's not going to work and i failed and
oh my god what am i going to do and
all this is [ __ ] it's all these advices
it doesn't work you need to be the exact opposite
of that see you get challenged you face your fears
you fail and then you get even more excited because
now it's like i failed that means there's a learning
lesson here for me that i could improve upon what
books can i go read what coaches can i go
hire who can i talk to what advice can i
get that will help me to face this particular challenge
and overcome it and to learn the lesson i need
to learn to be good at this challenge for the
rest of my life to extinguish this fear forever see
this is the attitude of a winner versus a loser
how about connecting with the joy of difficult trips by
which i mean your psychedelic excursions you know a lot
of people are like well leo am i gonna have
a bad trip here on this chemical or on that
chemical or on this dose or on that dose it's
like the bigger question is why are you avoiding these
difficult trips why can't you be strong enough to handle
a difficult trip why can't you even learn to enjoy
difficult trips because after all what is a difficult trip
when you're tripping you're just exploring consciousness you're exploring your
own mind now of course some trips can be so
difficult they can traumatize you so you don't want to
go that far but but you know a difficult trip
just on the edge of traumatizing you but not totally
um you know shattering your mind and your ego again
if you're on your if you're living on your edge
and you have high self-efficacy you build you know building
up momentum you've been executing then like lately i've been
almost like enjoying difficult trips like wanting to challenge myself
with difficult trips just to see how you know how
deep can i go with consciousness what can i handle
what am i really mad what's my full potential and
that gives me a kind of joy sort of a
high level joy that most people are missing out on
so these days when i go into a trip i
can go into it with like a lot of excitement
which is not to say i don't i don't respect
the power of these chemicals i respect it very much
and lately i've had i've had a really difficult trip
one of my most difficult trips ever but also one
of the ones that grew me the most and um
and when i came back from that trip i'm like
i feel i feel like juiced up i feel like
i'm on you know i feel like i'm i'm more
powerful than ever when you go through challenges like that
you're more powerful than ever and see one of the
keys to life is to take on deliberate challenges because
here's the thing you have to understand is that life
will challenge you no matter what life is [ __
] difficult and life gets really [ __ ] difficult
you know when life gets the most difficult is when
you don't have the intrinsic motivation anymore to get out
of bed in the morning that's when life becomes actually
the most difficult as long as you have your heart
your soul your spirit as long as you're motivated intrinsically
when you're following your values and you're doing things that
are meaningful to you in life that you really care
about and you're connected with life you're connected with its
beauty and its majesty then the difficulty will still be
there you will still face some really hard knocks but
you will have the inner resources the morale to deal
with them but when you lose your morale and you
get depressed and you go into learned helplessness and you
you become a victim and a complainer and a loser
really nothing can nothing can go well in your life
you can't feel good about your life in that situation
that's an inner game problem that needs to be fixed
so whether you undertake challenge or you don't you're going
to be challenged but when you undertake challenge consciously the
challenge is meaningful for you whereas when the challenge is
not something you constantly choose but it is forced it
upon you just by external circumstances then you you're not
going to be really motivated to deal with the challenge
and you're just going to be kind of like avoiding
the challenge and you're going to be begrudging the challenge
the challenge will come your way you're gonna be like
oh why did god put this challenge in front of
me and you're gonna feel resentful about it whereas if
you undertake a challenge consciously like you wake up tomorrow
morning you say you know what i'm gonna run a
mile today i'm going to run a mile in 10
minutes that's the challenge i set for myself now is
there any reason i have to no am i going
to die if i don't do it no is am
i going to lose my job if i don't do
it no am i going to look really awesome and
ripped if i do it no am i lose 10
pounds no so why would i do it well fundamentally
because what else is there to do in life what
is there to do why are you here are you
here just to stay alive physically if that's all you're
here for then like you've set the bar so low
that you see you can't get inspired by anything and
we're not inspired you're literally disconnected from the spirit of
life and then yeah by definition you're depressed everything is
meaningless to you because guess what survival is meaningless if
all you're doing is you're just putting in cal or
empty calories into your body to keep it going for
one day and then you repeat that the next day
and the next day and the next day and that's
all you're doing your whole life then yeah and then
where does that end it ends in your death and
then eventually all of that was you you asked the
question like on your deathbed well what was it all
about why did i eat all this empty calories well
just to just to get to the point where i'm
dead well that was kind of pointless yeah exactly so
but then you're like well what's the point of life
what leo so is the point of life to build
something up to like build up a billion dollars and
but then on my beth bed i could wonder like
well but if i have a billion dollars my account
and i can't take it with me i'm going to
die and i can't use it all then that was
pointless too yes exactly but then you're like well so
then leo everything is pointless so then i should do
nothing no that's wrong what isn't pointless is to construct
your own point by setting challenges for yourself and being
creative and using that creativity to connect with the beauty
of consciousness in the present moment that that kind of
conscious living is meaningful and it has a point it
is its own point it's not something you do to
get some reward in the afterlife it is its own
reward when you're doing art for art's sake the joy
the art gives you and the connection the spiritual connection
it creates between you and reality is such that you
don't even need to sell the art the selling of
it is irrelevant you've already got your reward by doing
it it doesn't even matter if anybody buys it or
not at that point that point the only purpose of
selling it would be either one to share the beauty
with others which could be meaningful to you of course
as well or to get enough money back from it
resources back from it such that you could funnel that
back in so you can keep doing your art the
next day you know pay your electric bill and so
forth so you're going to be challenged either way uh
it would be a lot better if you chose your
challenges rather than having them choose you so the secret
to fulfilling life is choose challenges that are aligned with
your top values that are going to create for meaningful
challenges that you accept willingly see there's there's a difference
understand there's a difference between like walking down a dark
alley at night and getting mugged by some hoodlums and
getting into a street fight with them you didn't choose
that right you were just walking you didn't want to
fight and they just kind of like sucker punched you
from behind in a dark alley that doesn't feel so
good that's not that's not fulfilling you're just surviving there
like an animal in that situation versus for example telling
yourself you know what i'm going to become the world's
best martial artist or boxer and i'm going to enter
a boxing ring now do i have to enter a
boxing ring no am i going to die if i
don't enter a boxing ring no is it even gonna
make me like rich to enter boxing ring maybe it
won't you know most boxers aren't very rich um but
i'm gonna i'm gonna choose that kind of life anyway
i'm gonna challenge myself to just to be the best
boxer i can be and you do that and as
you do that you enter the ring deliberately you don't
have to but you do it do it do it
you're doing it consciously right and when you're boxing in
the ring consciously of your own choice no one's holding
a gun to your head forcing you to be there
that's when you can fall in love with boxing as
an art see you're not doing it because you have
to you're doing it because you want to and that's
in a sense the definition of a fulfilling life imagine
a life in which everything you're doing is something you
want to be doing not something you have to be
doing isn't that the kind of life you would want
but see you have to earn that kind of life
that kind of life takes work you would think that
that kind of life would be easy it's like you
can just sit around and wish for for like things
to be magically manifested to you but that's not really
that what that kind of life entails that kind of
life means like if you really want something you have
to work for it so you have to sacrifice for
it for years to get it that's the reality of
living a life where you're doing everything you want it's
not the life that you imagine of like oh i
win the lottery i can just buy whatever i want
no how about connecting with the joy of building up
the infrastructure for your success i have an episode called
building up the infrastructure for your success go check that
out to me that's one of the joys of life
that i've been noticing i get a lot of fulfillment
from is is like and what do i mean by
infrastructure i mean i mean like little things like for
example if i find a great new alarm clock on
amazon i get excited by that because in my mind
i'm not just buying a single alarm clock i'm buying
an alarm clock that i'll be using like for the
rest of my life that will help me to stay
on track with all my goals to wake up on
time to show up to meetings on time to meditate
on time to do all these things that i you
know need to do that are related to alarm clocks
and timers you know cook my food on time and
if i find an alarm clock that like optimizes all
that and works really beautifully and perfectly it also looks
nice if i find something like that i might buy
10 i might buy 10 of those things and put
them all over my house right and to me that's
like a little piece of infrastructure that i've installed into
my life that's going to help me to stay on
track and do the things i need to do you
know for the rest of my life that's how i
frame it in my own mind that gives me a
lot of meaning and fulfillment just something as simple and
stupid as that and then you know it also makes
my life a little bit more productive like 0.01 more
productive because i found you know a little better alarm
clock or something how about connecting with the joy of
saying no saying no to toxic unhealthy stuff saying no
to toxic food saying no to toxic dysfunctional activities with
friends saying no to being in unhealthy environments saying no
to unhealthy chemicals and products and additives saying no to
toxic work or business stuff toxic marketing stuff saying no
to toxic dysfunctional relationships just like no there's a power
you get from that right it can be hard to
say no but it can also be easy to say
no once you build up that muscle you want to
get to the point where you respect yourself and your
own consciousness so much you respect reality so much that
you're not going to compromise yourself for some quick little
bit of pleasure with some toxic unhealthy thing you just
say no and then you get pleasure from saying no
you get more pleasure from saying no then you would
from consuming that toxic thing lately i've been practicing this
with girls because you know i go out to the
nightclubs uh flirt around with girls practice my social skills
uh sometimes in the night club you know i'll meet
like a really drunk girl um and it's interesting because
it presents a sort of a you might say ethical
moral dilemma it really it's really a test of integrity
because it's like okay she's into me she's attracted if
i keep pushing this it could this could lead to
sex um some you know some easy sex um should
i capitalize on that or should i say no i
could say no because of just you know like sort
of like i don't want to i don't want to
be you know i don't want it to like boomerang
on me you know she might regret it then she
might accuse me of rape or something like of course
that's an obvious reason not to do something like that
but but lately you know um i found like an
even deeper reason to say no and the even deeper
reason is like i'm just disgusted you know like when
i see when i see a girl in a club
that's too drunk when i see people who just drink
and don't respect their own health and their own bodies
like i don't mind if somebody has a drink or
two to let loose at a club that's fine but
like if i see that the person is like a
habitual drinker drinks way too much gets way too wasted
just it becomes very sloppy um and just doesn't really
respect their own health their own consciousness or the consciousness
of reality when i see that in a girl it
just makes me disgusted with her i don't even want
to have sex with her at that point and so
the reason to say no is really because not because
i'm worried of like well what will happen if i
sleep with her no the reason to say no is
because it just violates my own respect for consciousness and
when i say no in that case it makes me
feel so good even though i don't get the sex
i mean i'm not going to say it's as pleasurable
as sex saying no is not going to be as
pleasurable as sex but you can kind of trick your
own mind you know again it's like reprogramming your mental
palate such that the saying no the integrity maintaining your
integrity in that case um it gets it gets to
the point where it's more fulfilling to say no than
it is to engage in this kind of like low
integrity stuff that's the kind of place you want to
train yourself to get to that's not easy to do
but you can work on it you can practice it
there's a joy that you can get from staying on
purpose and on track with your life purpose but for
that first you gotta discover what your life purpose is
for which you should see my life purpose course you
can connect with the joy of optimizing your health your
health just like sit down like there's a joy that
can come if you just sit down for the next
hour with a with a notebook and you start asking
yourself the question at the top of the page right
you know how can i optimize my health in every
possible little way and then make a list of all
the possible ways you can optimize your health just by
generating that list already you'll experience some level of joy
but then when you start executing all those you know
week after week you know it could be little things
you know one way i could optimize my health is
you know buy better shampoo the more expensive organic kind
rather than like the the cheap toxic chemical kind that's
one way another way is that i could you know
do more juicing rather than just eating processed foods that's
another way another way might be to optimize my health
is to um you know do a little jog in
the morning or just go for a walk in the
evening after my my work is done that could be
a little extra you know optimization for my health an
another way might be to um get more purified water
like maybe the water i'm drinking right now isn't the
highest quality maybe i can install some you know better
water filters that will optimize my long-term health because you
know you're drinking that water every day you know gallons
of it every day for years for decades so it
all adds up maybe other way to optimize your health
is do some chelation heavy metal detox i have an
episode about how to do heavy metal detox go check
that out maybe another way to optimize your health is
to read some books about nutrition or about fitness or
maybe install a home gym or something like that invest
in a home gym that might be a way to
do it um join a yoga class that might be
another way to do right so you you make a
list and then as you do each one of those
you're not going to do them all at once this
could take you years to do them all but as
you check each one off and do it this gives
you joy see if you were living a fulfilling life
this is the kind of [ __ ] you would
be doing this is healthy living and you would get
to such a point imagine doing this for 10 20
years so consistently that eventually you reach a point where
you're not even lured in by things like donuts and
pizza and beer and alcohol and other kind of stupid
[ __ ] like this you're too busy optimizing your
life and your health and honoring consciousness and connecting with
you're too busy doing that to care about this shallow
petty [ __ ] right so what you're doing is
you're replacing the shallow pleasures of life with the jeep
the deep joys of life and you're gonna at first
when you start doing this you're going to be sort
of underwater in the sense that you're going to feel
like you're sacrificing a lot of pleasure and you're not
getting a lot back in return immediately because you're going
to be saying no to some amazing pizza and beer
but you're going to be saying yes to like some
celery juice and some jogging it's like oh that's that's
not a really good trade i feel like i'm losing
in this trade i would have won if i selected
the pizza and the beer rather than the jogging and
the celery juice right but then as you keep you
know building up these these more subtle you know spiritual
joys um the the depth the depth builds on itself
and it reaches to the point where you reach the
tipping point and the shallow stuff now all of a
sudden it doesn't fulfill you as much as the as
the deep stuff and that that inflection point is crucial
to reach in your life and then you keep pumping
into it pumping into it more and this equation completely
you know it completely seesaws in the other direction and
to the point where this stuff is just like it's
like like if you tell me right now leo um
hey you want to go shoot up some heroin um
we got some amazing heroin you know in the back
alley let's go do some like um it if i
hadn't spent 20 years investing in my life every single
day really building myself up building up my mind my
brain my body all that like building everything in my
knowledge with my life probably building all this up then
and i had like nothing to do i had nothing
to lose right then yeah maybe i would take you
up on going up shooting up some heroin but when
i have built up so much of this other amazing
stuff going on in my life the appeal of going
shooting up heroin in some back alley like there's zero
appeal to that zero actually it's a little bit funny
actually there is some appeal of that because like at
this point i would be willing to shoot up heroin
just to experience its effect on my consciousness just purely
from an exploration of consciousness perspective and i bet you
i could do it and not get addicted to it
um uh because the people who do get addicted to
heroin it's not actually so much because the heroin is
so addicting it's because they have nothing else going on
in their life that's really that's that's one of the
key discoveries about addiction that we've discovered in the last
50 years is that addiction is not really about the
chemical itself you can addict yourself on almost any chemical
uh including sugar caffeine and fat and other salt and
other things like that um the the real thing that
makes you an addict is a lack of these other
deeper fulfillments in life that you've cultivated over a long
period of time if you're missing those and you've got
nothing else going for you then it's extremely easy for
you to become an addict and in that case you
probably already are one you don't need heroin for that
how about connecting with the joy of exposing yourself to
new experiences by the way uh i don't i don't
recommend you do heroin even even for the consciousness exploration
aspects i don't recommend you do it [Music] you'll get
a lot more out of psychedelics than you will add
heroin it'll be a lot safer the problem with heroin
is that a lot of it these days is cut
with fentanyl so you just easily kill yourself through a
unknown fentanyl overdose by consuming cut heroin so a very
very bad idea that's the other reason why i wouldn't
do heroin is because if like if i knew it
was pure pure pure heroin which you can't really know
these days but if i knew it was pure for
sure like from a lab i would be i'd be
fine to do it but like um but if you're
just buying heroin online or off the street somewhere uh
chances are very high it's laced with fentanyl or cut
with fentanyl and so um yeah it's like you're playing
russian roulette at that point and the only reason you'd
be stupid enough to play with that is because you
have nothing else you've built up in your life so
you don't actually respect your life if you respected your
life you would never play russian roulette with with yourself
in that way and in many other ways all right
so the next point is the connecting with the joy
of exposing yourself to new experiences i have a whole
episode called expose yourself to more experience that's huge this
is how you learn this is how you grow challenging
experiences things that take you out of your comfort zone
a lot of you guys just don't have a sense
of direction in your life because you have you don't
have enough experience base go actually do some [ __
] travel around go to night clubs talk to interesting
people talk to some homeless people you know work in
different jobs expose yourself to different kinds of experiences this
will grow you this will create sort of a grist
for the meal you can use that experience base to
then build your whole life from that you need some
grist for the mill to get the milk going a
lot of you youngsters who are like in your early
20s or even lower than that um the reason it's
difficult for you to get going with personal development you
just lack experience so just go expose yourself to more
experience how about connecting with the joy of adding massive
value to the world this is something i talk about
inside the life purpose course if you're interested in a
deeper discussion of that but for me adding massive value
to the world is a big thing that creates a
lot of meaning for me in my life seeing myself
as a value adder that's that's something i'm going to
talk about in the future is what exactly is value
how do you identify what value is i'm not going
to go into that here but um but yeah once
you know what value is and how to find it
how to generate it how to create it with your
life purpose and how to share with others this is
huge it's hugely rewarding you know i said well leo
isn't all value relative in the ultimate sense yes but
still practically speaking even if you're a relativist you still
have values you're living by certain values and certain values
are gonna lead to a more fulfilling life than other
values and so values are huge and i talk a
lot about values in my life purpose scores a big
chunk of the first part of the like the first
third of the life purpose course is all about just
helping you find your top 10 values so if you're
confused about that check out the course it's very practical
in that respect it's probably one of the most in-depth
value finding processes that you'll find out there in any
self-help material like i spent a lot of time developing
this process of how to find your top values it's
pretty rigorous and comprehensive how about connecting with the joy
of looking at beautiful things just just that this will
make you fall in love with life like it's hard
for me to communicate how much joy i get out
of beauty the beauty of conju like when i walk
out of my house i look at trees cars the
sun the clouds the desert where i live even my
own body when i look at my own body i
just get joy out of looking at the beauty of
my own body and i don't i'm not a particularly
like handsome chad here by you know by human standards
but by but by you know absolute standards my body
is a work of art i can connect with that
um just that that alone is enough to create an
amazingly fulfilling life if you keep doing that how about
connecting with the joy of human connection of conscious relationships
how about you set a intention for yourself not to
just do these shallow comfortable toxic relationships that you've been
doing just for you know your own selfish pleasure but
how about you do conscious relationship how about you master
conscious relationship in your life how's that for for a
purpose to pursue that would be really fulfilling and meaningful
now as to how to actually do that well that's
it's a deep topic i'll have a video on conscious
relationships coming soon but um but hey i mean you
can start you can start on that with all these
points do not get stuck with this common objection of
like leo yeah but how do i do that how
do i optimize my health how do i find the
joy of looking at beautiful things how do i add
massive value to the world how do i do conscious
relation i don't know how leo tell me the one
two three four five step process i've mentioned elsewhere that
it doesn't matter if you don't know how what matters
is that you know what you want if any of
these things that i'm talking about is sounding appealing to
you and it gets you inspired and it lights a
fire under your ass and it wakes you up in
the morning thinking about it and it makes you giddy
inside and excited and you're fascinated by this subject or
whatever that's enough that's that's all you need that will
automatically generate all the action steps coming in the future
you don't need to know all the action steps to
begin you don't need to know how to do conscious
relationship just the idea of conscious relationship if you're like
oh yeah that sounds cool to me great that that's
enough you can wake up tomorrow and go to google
and type in conscious relationship and look for [ __
] books on that [ __ ] or you can
just sit down even more fundamental than that sit down
with a piece of paper and say you know rather
than waiting for leo to tell you how to do
a conscious relationship how about you sit down for the
next hour with a notebook and you at the top
of the page you write how do i practice conscious
relationships and then you make a list of 100 things
you could do the answers are inside of you you're
just too lazy to sit down and extract them you're
waiting for me to just like spoon feed you this
[ __ ] which is really in itself not healthy
how about the joy of conscious leadership that's another topic
i'll be covering soon is conscious leadership but there's a
lot of joy and meaning you can get out of
that and what's cool about these topics like conscious relationship
or conscious leadership for example is that there's so much
depth to these things you could spend the next 20
years learning about conscious relationships mastering that learning about conscious
leadership and mastering that think about how fulfilling that would
be how meaningful that would be how about the joy
of simply becoming more selfless and loving we've talked about
that as basically being the purpose of life i've said
that many times already throughout my videos why don't you
make that your life purpose to become more selfless and
more loving i mean that right there is enough to
create deep meaning and um a deep love for your
own life and in general just how about the joy
of a life well lived in the end that's what
we're really talking about and look um there's no right
or wrong here in the sense of like i'm telling
you what to do or i'm trying to impose some
of my definitions of a good life on you it's
just like whatever you yourself decide is necessary to consider
your life well lived is what you should be doing
whatever that is now there's more wise ways and more
foolish ways to go about that you know if you
think that a life well lived means a billion dollars
in your bank account on your deathbed i mean by
all means pursue that if you must but uh also
recognize that that's pretty foolish pretty limited if you don't
recognize that now at some point you will maybe on
your deathbed you'll realize why i say that's limited the
things that i've generally outlined for you here these things
are rather unlimited these are things you can pursue they're
healthy things they're things you can spend years and decades
trying to master and they will pay dividends in your
life and you will get a lot of fulfillment out
of pursuing them but also notice that these are these
are subtle mature joys these are not peak raw pleasure
states in a sense you have to brainwash yourself into
these joys principles values and ideals until your mind is
rewired enough that it sticks and no one will do
this work for you no one will tell you to
do this except me and maybe a few other people
out there who are teaching this kind of stuff but
generally speaking nobody in society or in culture is going
to tell you to do this so now is the
time for you to make a commitment to unhook yourself
from dopamine and from chasing petty human [ __ ]
now is the time for you to con to commit
to living a sober life and really everything i've been
talking about here we could summarize as the joy of
sober living imagine being so sober that you're hyper sober
your conscious the soberness breaks out into a sort of
transcendent consciousness that's in a sense what spirituality is and
that's what the the best life possible is the hindus
might call this the satwik life sat means truth means
like sober in a certain sense whereas you know as
opposed to um rogers they have rajas which is sort
of like the over excited overstimulated life and then they
have what's the other one they have the other one
where it's i'm blanking on it they have the hindus
have the third term which is the kind of like
the torporous life the life where you're you're sleepy and
lazy and you're you're depressed and you're gorging yourself on
food um these are like the three these are known
as like the three gunas so um yeah you want
the saatva kind of life now you might say well
leo but um but you're talking about like what do
you mean sober you're you're talking about psychedelics and stuff
that's not so that's not a sober life actually the
use of psychedelics that i'm talking about in the way
that i use them it is a sober life so
the notion of sobriety here our cultural idea of sobriety
is is kind of messed up uh it's not quite
right um sober means that you're you're really what is
sober mean sober means truthful really sat truth uh saatva
um sober means you're living in truth and you are
saying no to all the petty human [ __ ]
you're saying no to all the addictions to all the
unhealthy all the toxic stuff uh all the stimulation the
kind of like cheap shallow stimulation you're saying no to
that kind of stuff you know to the cheap shallow
entertainment the cheap shallow sex the cheap sallow food you're
saying no to all that stuff and you're basically building
up a healthy kind of like very solid life based
on principles based on holistic integrity based on health that's
really what is meant by sober here and then psychedelics
actually amplify that right so it's not about never putting
a chemical into your into your brain that's not the
thing um and if you know you can use psychedelics
in an addicted way a lot of people use weed
this way so that would not be a sober life
like if you're costly high on weed and stoned all
the time and you know um lazy on the couch
that would not be a sober life but if you
trip occasionally like once a week once a month you
do a deep trip and you discover you know deep
spiritual truths and that and have awakenings and god realizations
and so forth and you're using this as a you
know as a spiritual modality in addition to all the
other stuff you're still doing right you're not just tripping
and then being an addict and sitting at home and
watching cartoons that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking
about executing on all the other [ __ ] you
got to execute on top of doing your trips and
handling your hard trips and integrating those and then still
doing manual spiritual practices and then just beyond spiritual practices
you're just executing on your life purpose and all that
that to me is sober in fact that's beyond sober
and that you know when you're doing five meow dmt
or dmt on top of all the executing [ __
] that you're supposed to be doing and living according
to these principles and eating healthy and doing all that
stuff that is beyond sober hyper sober life that's what
that is and uh that's what i recommend for you
now again to build up this hyper sober life you
have to really change your palate it's not going to
really compete head-to-head with just raw pleasure and it requires
building momentum months and years of building momentum you must
reject mediocrity laziness weakness wasting your life just in principle
the idea of wasting your life this should be like
the greatest sin in your mind this i i don't
know of a higher sin of a greater sin that
you can do to god than to like i mean
basically when you're wasting your life by being lazy weak
complaining bitching moaning trolling living in mediocrity just kind of
going with the path of least resistance doing what everybody
else is doing watching a bunch of tv and wasting
a bunch of your time on social media chasing pleasure
getting drunk this is like you're spitting in the face
of god that's essentially what you're doing when you're living
that way you're completely wasting the potential that you've been
given you're completely disrespecting the miracle of consciousness around you
it's not that you can offend god you can't offend
god but what you can do that in a certain
sense it's like stabbing god in the heart is to
overlook the miracle that is your life and to take
it for granted there's so much beauty in that there's
so much profundity in your life there's there's infinite infinite
beauty infinite variety infinite creativity infinite intelligence went into constructing
this life for you and what do you do with
it you sit around and you watch [ __ ]
netflix and dick around online with your friends and you
sit back and you complain and you [ __ ]
and you moan and you criticize and you come up
with [ __ ] conspiracy theories and you get lost
in those and you pretend like you're doing spirituality but
you don't actually [ __ ] execute and you don't
actually you're not willing to work for anything in your
life this this is the greatest sin and you're gonna
pay for that not because god is gonna punish you
but see you are god and when you overlook your
own spirit that is the punishment it's not that god
is punishing you for being bad it's that you are
punishing yourself for being blind to the infinite love and
beauty that is all around you you get that so
instead choose to face challenges consciously in your life head
on choose your challenges choose your sacrifice what are you
willing to sacrifice to construct a beautiful life ask yourself
that what kind of life is worth sacrificing for if
you're saying leo i don't i don't want to sacrifice
anything that's because you don't have a vision of a
grand enough life that is worth any kind of sacrifice
this also means no more sloppy living this means living
according to what's called the principle of right action this
is something i learned from owen cook i like this
concept of principle of right action look you know what
the right action is in most situations most days you
know what you need to be doing and if you
don't know it's not that hard to sit down to
figure it out with a notebook you can figure it
out in a couple of days what the right actions
are for you for the next year or two or
five but then the problem is that you don't you
don't do the right actions you're not principled enough to
do them you're not disciplined enough to do them you
haven't built up the momentum or the consistency and you
haven't programmed your mind with enough of a compelling vision
and reason for why you should be living according to
the principle of right action so you got to get
all those pieces together and then when you're living on
and executing on the principle of right action that's when
you're going to feel at your best now you might
say well but leo how do i begin doing all
this let's say i'm stuck in a rut what do
i do step number one is you decide that you
want to do this decide that you do not want
to be disillusioned with life and that whatever it takes
you will do whatever it takes to build up your
zest for life and that disillusionment is not acceptable to
you a lot of this is just about what standards
do you set for yourself do you respect yourself and
your life enough to set a clear standard and boundary
that you will not allow your life to go to
waste with disillusionment with nihilism with cynicism with you know
victimhood that's step number one you can decide to do
that and then step number two is to start taking
action every single day and again here you're gonna say
but leo i don't know what actions to take i
don't know how to i don't know how to how
to do this again it doesn't really matter you can
sit down with a notebook at the top of page
of the notebook you can you know write something like
what actions do i take that make me disillusioned with
life and write down a list and then write down
another question like what would i have to do to
convince myself to never take these kinds of actions again
and write down a list of what you'd have to
do and already look you've got your action list and
then start just doing it at some point in this
work you have to stop thinking about it just keep
it simple figure out what actions you got to take
figure out what actions you don't got to take the
ones that are the wrong actions and then just execute
do the right ones don't do the wrong ones it's
that simple right you there's times when you have to
sit and contemplate and think and then once you're done
with that then you have to act and more thinking
about how to avoid acting or to shortcut acting that's
not gonna help you that's just gonna hurt you right
don't try to get too clever with your thinking where
you you think you can think yourself out of action
no you do some thinking and then that thinking leads
to certain actions and you got to go take that
[ __ ] action not think some more about how
you should avoid it or how to make it easier
don't worry about how to make it easier sometimes there's
only the difficult way of doing something do it the
difficult way later if you find some easier more efficient
way fine you can you can switch but usually when
you begin something you just start doing it in an
inefficient difficult way but you do it it doesn't have
to be perfect you just do it like don't underestimate
the power of just vision of just knowing what you
want like if you know deep enough that you do
not want to be disillusioned by life that's enough for
you to to break yourself out of this rut but
like you have to really latch on to that it's
not enough for you just to sit there and think
about it for 10 minutes and then to forget about
it and go back to watching tv the next day
that's not going to work like you gotta you gotta
like really latch on to what you want you have
to get very clear about it and very serious about
it in your mind when you say you want something
i want you to stop just wanting things just like
wishing for things like when a mature person wants something
what it means to want something if you want something
you're gonna sacrifice and work for it that's what it
means to want something if you're not going to sacrifice
and work for it that means you don't actually want
it for example you guys a lot of you guys
like do you want sex do you want a girlfriend
every guy will say yes but then it's like are
you willing to work for six months going out three
nights a week for four hours a night approaching 20
girls a night flirting getting better at social skills going
on dates are you willing to do that and are
you willing to fail for six months straight until eventually
you get your girlfriend and get your sex do you
want that that's the real question the real question is
whether you want sex or not the real question is
do you want to go through the process to get
it that's the real question and if you don't want
that then you're not going to get your sex nor
do you deserve it and if you were really wise
and mature you would say yes i want that i
don't mind investing the next six months doing that because
not only am i going to get the sex and
the girlfriend from that but i'm going to get something
even better which is all of the growth the learning
all of the challenge all of the self-reflection that i
will have to do all of the facing of my
own fears and overcoming my own weaknesses all of that
i'm gonna make myself a strong man in the next
six months through this process in fact what i want
is the process more than the sex or the girl
and even more than that i want to enjoy that
process and in fact that's what the joy of life
is the joy of life is not getting the girl
or getting the sex the joy of life is that
process of me undertaking some challenge exposing myself to a
lot of experience going through this adventure this roller coaster
ride getting pummeled some to some nights you know getting
pummeled um doubting myself struggling through it but figuring it
out finding friends and resources along the way you know
learning and enjoying that and being conscious of it and
seeing it as my own evolution and growth that is
in fact what life is supposed to be not just
people handing you goodies on a silver platter like here's
some [ __ ] on a silver platter for you
no that's not doesn't that doesn't make a fulfilling life
if you were handed [ __ ] on a silver
flower you would take it for granted in fact plenty
of guys get handed [ __ ] on a silver
platter these guys do not appreciate [ __ ] they
don't appreciate women they don't become good lovers they don't
become good at sex they have no idea how to
have amazing sex they don't know how to please a
woman nor do they know how to please themselves so
don't be jealous or envious of people who get it
easy people who get it easy people get things handed
to them whether it's money a business sex maybe they're
just born with great genetics great health great physical appearance
great hair whatever it is pretty eyes like you know
don't be too jealous of these people people who have
life too easy they come out weak in the end
they're not really tested they're not really challenged and they're
they're not going to be deep people for example a
lot of the most attractive women they're they're not they're
not known for being the deepest people in the world
why is that because when you're a very physically attractive
woman all of your value is sort of on the
outside people judge you by what's on the outside what's
on the inside doesn't matter so much because men and
other women even they just appreciate you just for the
outside and then you know um imagine growing up that
way since you're like a teenage girl you grow up
that way like pretty girl everybody kind of like kisses
your ass is extra nice to you gives you things
you know guys will give you things they'll buy you
drinks they'll take you on vacations and they'll fly you
around and in their fancy cars all this sorts of
stuff this will spoil you imagine how this spoils these
girls and then like these girls i've spoken to something
they're so [ __ ] shallow like there's nothing there's
nothing spiritual going on it's just like a empty husk
and you think oh well wouldn't it be nice to
be this girl you know everybody is kissing her ass
on instagram and then everybody at the clubs wants to
get with her and she gets easily like leo but
girls have it so easy to get you know she
gets sex whatever she wants she has so easy and
us as guys we have to struggle you know leo
me as a short guy as a bald guy as
a fat guy as an ugly guy as an insult
i gotta struggle so hard to get sex yeah but
you see she doesn't appreciate the sex you appreciate the
sex because of how hard you have to work for
it and then who you become in the process is
really the gold so don't be envious of these kinds
of people who have it too easy they don't appreciate
what they got you will only appreciate things in life
that you work your ass off for that you bleed
for that you cry for that you sacrifice for that
you kill parts of your ego for that's what you're
going to appreciate in life and that's what other people
will appreciate the most about you people who are deep
now people who are shallow they'll appreciate of course some
of the shallow goodies like the sex you can offer
them the money and whatever else you know the social
status but the deep people what they'll really appreciate in
you is is really the challenge you went through to
become who you became and they will have no idea
the kind of [ __ ] you struggle through to
get to where you got to they'll just assume you
were born that way but what will really tickle you
inside is when they just assume that you're this amazing
person you were just born lucky and then you know
deep down inside how hard you had to [ __
] work to become that way like when i go
out to the club a lot of times you know
i meet random people um sometimes you know i'm just
just the other day i was i was out um
a lot of times i meet people who know me
from actualize.org um you know fans will meet me out
there shaking my hands stuff like that and a lot
of times they'll say oh my god you're so extroverted
and in my mind i'm thinking like you have no
[ __ ] idea what i had to go through
to make myself seem this extroverted right this is like
years of [ __ ] grinding through going out doing
[ __ ] that i [ __ ] hated doing
to make myself seem this kind of extroverted and charismatic
it's like you had no [ __ ] idea how
shy i was the most fulfilling aspect of life is
who you're going to become by working your ass off
to evolve and to grow yourself and the deepest challenges
you're gonna have to face your own deepest inner demons
you're gonna have to face to actualize your full potential
that's what makes life meaningful and fulfilling taking on that
challenge willingly and joyfully that's like a noble warrior going
into battle that's the hero's journey i've talked about that
in my episode called the truest heroes or no the
highest hero's journey go check that out i also talk
about in my life purpose course life is like a
game life is like a simulator right and a game
only works when there's challenge games that are too easy
are not rewarding you notice if you know this if
you're a serious gamer that's how to treat life it's
a game but you have to play it seriously it
has no point but you play it seriously nonetheless so
if you're sick of being stuck in a rut of
being addicted of being miserable of being depressed and nihilistic
and cynical then here's your new vision your new vision
is living a sober disciplined on purpose life building a
life that you're proud of whatever that is you get
to define it that's part of the beauty here you're
defining what life you want and then you're constructing it
and that's where the joy comes from you're creating a
life according to your unique values and strengths in a
sense you're carving out your own destiny and you're fighting
for it and you're struggling for it and you're going
through all the challenge of that and imagine this as
your ultimate vision of what you're working towards is eventually
you're going to work through all of this [ __
] and you're gonna develop an infectious love for life
and for consciousness that's what you ultimately want what is
stopping you from doing that what is stopping you from
creating that you might say oh leo but i don't
know you know yeah i would like to have an
infectious love for life and consciousness but i i just
don't know what to do it doesn't [ __ ]
matter that you don't know what to do what matters
is what do you want if you want something bad
enough you will figure out how to create it not
in one day or in one week this is a
long process and there's a lot of research that you'll
be doing right when you say i don't know how
to do something all that means is you just got
to do some research and today in the internet age
with all the access to books and to podcasts and
videos and this and that like courses that are available
online figuring out how to do something is trivial in
many cases you can google how to do anything and
you'll find leads that will point you in the right
direction you can find people you can ask the problem
is that you is the problem isn't that you don't
know how to develop an infectious love for life and
consciousness the problem is that you're not taking that goal
seriously again what it means to say that you want
an infectious like let me let me just ask you
do you want right like serious do you want an
infectious love for life and consciousness do you want that
yes or no now if you answer yes realize what
you're saying what you're saying is that you're willing to
do whatever it takes and to work as long as
it takes to develop that that's what you're saying yes
to you're not just assuming it's gonna fall on your
lap i'm not just going to hand it to you
so really what you got to do is you got
to like get leverage on yourself and really commit to
doing the work and seeing the value in something like
developing an infectious love for life and consciousness and then
as long as your mind gets fully bought into that
and you program yourself with that vision the rest the
rest is i mean you're you're almost half done at
that point the rest is just follow through you'll figure
out the rest trust that you'll figure out the rest
you don't need you don't need me to give you
a you know a 10-step formula for how to do
it although of course that is what i'm doing through
all of my videos it's a large project so a
lot of times i'll talk about some topic in a
video and it's not explicitly clear that what this topic
is about is really helping you to develop an infectious
love for life and consciousness but that is what i'm
trying to teach you just indirectly that's what the whole
channel is about here but we have to break it
down you know little pieces sometimes it's broken down so
much that you lose sight of the forest for the
trees so now we're showing you the forest look you're
going to be dead soon life goes by very fast
start now stop waiting there's nothing to wait for start
now you can start now even if you're stuck in
a rut you can start now you start with baby
steps and the beauty of it is that as soon
as you start even with baby steps you start to
feel better you don't need the end result to feel
better you will feel better as you start taking action
and the more consistently you take the action the more
momentum you build the less you slack off the more
engaged and excited you're going to get and the better
you're going to start to feel and it's going to
start to snowball for you and then you're living life
on purpose you're living life consciously now a lot of
what i talk about with actualize.org is deconstructing your reality
i've mentioned that concept quite a lot in past episodes
and that is what we're doing at sort of the
deep metaphysical epistemological level but always keep in mind that
this deconstruction of reality project there's a lot of ways
it can go sideways there's a lot of traps involved
with it i've talked about that as well there's a
lot of ways you can kind of like the ego
can weaponize it and distort it and use it for
spiritual bypassing other sorts of you know tricks like this
and so just as a simple rule of thumb how
do you know you're doing it properly if you're deconstructing
reality you're gonna deconstruct your reality yes but you're always
going to maintain that zest and joy for consciousness and
living on purpose with passion you're not going to deconstruct
that now of course you can you can try to
deconstruct that and at some point if you get deep
enough you will have to deconstruct your life purpose and
even your passions and so forth but the purpose of
the deconstruction when the deconstruction is really done successfully in
the end what it leaves you with is a appreciation
it leaves you in a state of profound not knowing
and a deep appreciation a recognition of the mystery of
consciousness of reality and the miracle that it is the
divinity of of consciousness and that is an exciting thing
right like your eyes should be glowing when you're [
__ ] awake you're so awake your eyes are glowing
at the wonder around you like what the [ __
] is this thing that we're in and like you
should be falling in love with it not moping around
and being lazy and watching tv but like you should
be getting sucked and absorbed into the the radiant beauty
of everything you see around you what you're deconstructing a
lot of what you're deconstructing is like the mental baggage
the concepts the social conditioning you got from society the
religion science all this sort of craft political ideologies even
new age ideas like you're gonna in the end you're
trying to clear you're trying to clear everything so that
you're just left with like raw consciousness right as raw
as you can get it and then it's just gonna
be raw consciousness plus it's it's just natural radiant beauty
and then your passion for it your love for it
and then just whatever naturally spontaneously wherever that leads you
whether that leads you towards art or towards socializing or
towards relationships or marriage or family or a big business
you want to start or some organization you want to
start or a calm you and you want us whatever
you want to do wherever you know your passion draws
you towards your passion for consciousness all right that's it
hope that inspired you a little bit a bit of
a motivational speech for you um the problem i see
is that a lot of the things that i've been
teaching over the last few years have been very advanced
they're very abstract very metaphysical existential philosophical and a lot
of you guys just need to work on your basic
execution and basic self-help i want to remind you that
you make sure to handle the basics i don't cover
as much of the basics in technical detail as many
of you need so go and find those channels books
courses resources podcasts whatever which will cover some of the
basics here um my focus is on the very like
the deepest aspects right like what i can help you
with with my my forte is to help you to
literally understand reality at levels that no human being understands
reality at i can help you with that that's my
specialty um but for me to be able to do
that you got to be ready like you got to
have the basics [ __ ] down right like before
we can launch you into outer space you got to
like learn how to just like live on earth on
planet earth and a lot of you guys just haven't
you're first of all you're just too young a lot
of you guys are very very young or plenty of
you have mental disorders mental dysfunctions stuff like that or
traumas from your childhood whatever lack of education lack of
development you know what whatever happened for you you gotta
handle that [ __ ] and i'm not gonna cover
don't expect me to cover every topic you need to
help you to cover all those basics i'm teaching advanced
stuff i say advanced not just to make myself you
know put myself up on a pedestal it truly is
advanced and if you don't handle the basics your life
is going to be kind of like inverted and upside
down you're gonna have a lot of advanced theory and
maybe even some advanced awakenings and you know you have
some mystical experience and so forth you're gonna do some
of the advanced stuff but then you're gonna be missing
all like the basic stuff which is necessary for just
a functional life you're going to be especially missing on
like that that execution and a lot of like the
basic joys some of the the healthy habits like you
got to install those um so make sure you do
that and you utilize other other sources i i have
books on my book list that will help you to
do that um but you know reach out find those
sources there are there are many sources out there that
are better than i am at teaching you you know
the little the sort of like simple basics uh because
like my mental energies i don't want to waste my
mental energies on that because there's plenty of that already
out there i want to put my mental energies towards
like the very tricky very subtle very advanced stuff that
you're really not going to find anywhere else because that's
just what my greatest strength is also what my passion
my interest is in and i gotta follow my passions
so um make sure you don't skip on that because
you will regret that and in fact you will then
start to blame me for it because you'll say oh
leo leo didn't teach me the basics that i needed
to leave didn't teach me to tie my shoes and
leo didn't teach me to cross my t's and dot
my eyes yeah because that's not what i'm here for
so make sure you're clear about that you don't you're
not fooling yourself some of you guys fall into the
trap of just like listening to me and only to
me thinking that you're gonna get everything you need from
me and i'm telling you that that's not correct so
be careful with that trap and also one final thing
i want to point out is that i am working
on some new courses in addition to the life purpose
course the new course i'm working on it's going to
be even more practical and life-changing than the life purpose
course which already gets a lot of very positive um
sort of like practical life-changing testimonials and reviews but it's
gonna it's gonna even top that one um i've been
struggling to finish it it's maybe like i have it
outlined maybe half of it i need to finish the
outline and then start recording videos on that i mean
i'm hoping to get that done like by the end
of the year um stay tuned like when that course
is released that's gonna be like a game changer that's
gonna take all of the free actualized content it's gonna
like it's gonna it's just gonna like take all that
and like [ __ ] double it it's gonna it's
gonna show you how to take all the abstract like
really obstruct difficult concepts that you don't know how to
implement it's gonna show you how to implement all of
them so it's gonna be a technique that shows you
how to implement all of the all of the like
all of the abstract stuff that you have no methods
for how to implement it'll show you how to do
that so if you're interested in that make sure you
subscribe stay tuned and i'll i'll notify everyone when when
the course is available but i'm not going to rush
it i'm only going to release it when i'm happy
with its quality and that it you know fulfills on
this kind of objective that i have for like providing
a lot of value and it's going to be like
a very practical course it's not just going to be
focused on the woo new age stuff it's going to
be focused on like very very practical stuff that's going
to help you just to to get i wouldn't say
the very basics but sort of like the intermediate basics
because like the super super basic stuff you can get
that elsewhere but like it'll show you how to get
like a lot of like the intermediate basics down and
then from that point on like a lot of stuff
that i'll be teaching after that is just like very
very uh deep profound existential stuff and so in this
way we're going to kind of like bridge the gap
but make sure before we get to like the mid
basics get like the very low basics down like um
[Music] it's almost like getting you know like a basic
education you need a basic education before you can start
to read advanced books and stuff like that in college
like what i teach basically is like college level material
stuff and i sort of expect that you did good
in high school so make sure you go back and
finish your high school classes all the stuff you missed
in high school that you kind of were lazy about
get that handled get your survival needs handled get your
shelter your work your money this basic stuff get that
handled the sooner you can get that handled the sooner
you can move on to like the intermediate and advanced
stuff that's where things get really interesting but again like
like with much of life like before you can have
your dessert you got to like eat your vegetables that's
kind of how it has to work here right the
dessert here is like the advanced enlightenment stuff that's like
the dessert and the problem is that if all you
eat is dessert with no vegetables you're gonna see how
that's gonna backfire on you so just watch out for
that trap and otherwise stay tuned i have a lot
of exciting both advanced and practical topics coming over the
next year i've planned out like over 30 different videos
and topics that i'm going to try to make them
more practical than they have been over the last couple
of years so you guys are going to be interested
in sticking around for those you
