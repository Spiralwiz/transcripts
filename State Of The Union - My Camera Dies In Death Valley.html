hey this is leo coming at you from actualized org
and in this video i'm doing a bit of a
State of the Union address so I just wanted to
catch you guys up on what I've been up to
and what I did is I decided to shoot more
outdoor scenes so I decided I would go and drive
around some of the beautiful national parks and cool areas
that I've got around here from from Las Vegas which
is where I'm stationed and I did that the other
weekend except the only problem is that when I got
out there on the first day of shooting and I
plan to shoot all across Death Valley this is what
that's where I went is to Death Valley National Park
and I wanted to shoot a full camera full so
about six hours of footage and on the first day
that I got there started shooting and my camera got
knocked down off the tripod by a really strong gust
of wind up on a mountaintop and so I wasn't
able to really shoot that scene the way I wanted
to and not only that but my camera got busted
the LCD screen broke and so I literally didn't know
if it was recording for that whole trip and I
decided that I was gonna make the best of that
trip I was really bummed out but I said you
know since I'm already there I'm gonna be there for
a few days I decided to shoot anyways and I
thought what I would do is just record six hours
of footage and hope hopefully just hoping that it would
record and that it would come out fine in the
end and actually I recorded all that footage and I
didn't even realize that there was no way to get
the footage out of the camera when the screen was
broken because the camera is all touchscreen so there's no
even any there's no way for me to even plug
it into a USB port and to offload all that
data because it's it's broken so right now I sent
that camera off for repairs it's gonna cost me about
five hundred bucks to repair it so maybe I'll get
that footage back maybe I won't it's not even clear
if it's usable footage but what I'm shooting on right
now is a temporary camera that I have so it's
a little lower quality than my usual videos and I
hope to replace this within a few weeks with something
better at least the same level that I had before
maybe better but the point being that I'm going to
be shooting more videos for you guys a lot more
here in the studio but also more outdoor stuff I
want to really show you some of the beautiful stuff
that we have around Las Vegas here and some of
the beautiful parks in California and Utah and elsewhere that
are nearby that I'm going to be driving to and
shooting cool footage in and coming at you with the
same material but basically in nicer environments so you can
not be so tired of this black backdrop all the
time so that's the point the other point that I'm
gonna make is that this was kind of a lesson
for me because it was really trying to get out
there and to shoot this footage and to see it
crumble before me I literally dedicated myself to drive out
for the whole weekend to shoot this footage and I
ended up driving around inside of Death Valley for 300
miles so once I was inside the park I was
driving for 300 miles inside the park scoping out all
the nice spots where I can be shooting video and
I got some really awesome when I got video out
of a waterfall I got a video in front of
the Salt Lake bed I've got videos with sunrises and
sunsets I had videos on the sand dunes with wind
blowing so a lot of really cool areas and a
really powerful topics too so I had to prepare for
the topics and the fryer for now those are lost
but I'll get more to you and if need be
I'll drive out there second time in a couple of
weekends and redo the whole shoot because some of the
stuff I got there was so amazing I don't want
to let that not get published so the point there
though was that you know I was really faced with
the choice I was faced with a choice of do
I do I Drive back home after my camera breaks
because the camera literally broke on the first shoot that
I was doing at 5 o'clock in the morning on
a sunrise and I I stayed up and I got
up just to the butt crack of dawn to shoot
this scene and I was shooting it the Sun was
coming up and just as I was about to click
the record button the wind blew the whole camera down
and it broke and that's when I really you know
that that really put me to the test because I
tell you guys to remain positive and I tell you
guys to cut out the negative thinking and to be
peaceful minded and Buddha like you know but it's hard
to do that when you actually have something come in
there and really disrupt your expectations and that's kind of
what happened on that trip is that my expectations were
really disrupted and right there immediately I knew that I
had a choice kind of inside right I had an
internal choice to make was I going to make the
best of it and just kind of suck it up
and go along with the flow of life or some
was I gonna resist it was I gonna deny that
it really happened was I got a kid myself wasn't
gonna start complaining and bitching and moaning and to be
honest I I made the decision right off the bat
that I still have to keep going so I did
make that decision I'll give myself points for that but
even after I did that I was still kind of
bitching and moaning I mean you kind of expect it
because I knew that this camera was pretty much dead
it was thousand dollar camera so there was just that
you know a thousand dollars down the gutter but also
more importantly was the fact that I wanted to make
the most of this trip and I was already excited
by all the stuff that I saw and all the
opportunities that were gonna be there for me to shoot
so I I was really distracted by that and honestly
all the footage that I shot afterwards I was still
distracted by it first of all because I was shooting
speaking to a camera that I didn't even know if
it was working so it's hard you know it's hard
to muster that kind of that kind of willpower because
to come up here and to speak on a topic
I don't just speak on a topic but I try
to create deep topics insightful topics so I'm literally taking
and trying to cram the best of the best that
I know into like a 10 or 20 minute segment
and that puts a lot of pressure on me so
that can be challenging it's one thing to do it
in a studio nice and comfortable it's totally another thing
to be doing it outdoors when you have the Hot
Desert Sun baking your skin and you've got the Sun
in your eyes and you've got five hundred miles that
you've just been driving and you've been sitting in your
car and you're feeling kind of lazy and not really
in the mood to shoot a video and you just
have to walk thousands of feet to come out here
on this specific location I literally spent the whole weekend
there scouting out these locations driving back and forth to
make sure the shots we're just aligned right and to
do that and then to to make this you know
part of your vacation so I had a dovetail de
with my vacation my weekend and to and then to
then have to come out here and then to like
speak on the spot when the wind is blowing in
your face and you don't even know if the cameras
are recording that and to tell yourself that you're gonna
have to do this for six hours worth of footage
so that's like six hours with the footage that's that's
probably at least ten separate videos ten separate topics that
have to gear myself up for and these topics I
don't rehearse them ahead of time they're done impromptu they're
done on the fly I tend to find that that's
necessary in order to get the insights to come out
because if I just come out here and read off
a bunch of notes to you then you're not going
to be engaged with it and the frankly the insights
are not going to be as sharp because the best
insights come on the spur of the moment and they
need to be caught right there I have a lot
of insights throughout the day that I don't really get
to capture on film simply because they're they're fleeting right
there's something they need to be caught in the moment
so I do the best I can to come out
here and try to get the best insights right now
right here and I'm working on my own psychology to
allow me to do that that's actually kind of like
a mental game I have to play and train myself
to be able to generate insights on the fly and
make sure that they're the best insights of the day
right here for the camera well imagine trying to do
that when you don't even know the cameras working it's
very demoralizing and for me is a really big challenge
because I kept I kept saying to myself well just
like stay positive stay positive right stay positive even though
the cameras broken what's I mean what's bitching and moaning
about it what's that going to do and on some
level it worked but on some level it didn't work
because that's hard to do right your mind naturally doesn't
want to do that it doesn't want to buy into
that because it's construct coming with all sorts of excuses
such as well okay yes maybe it's not even so
bad that the camera broke let's say I lost some
money there but then do I really have to go
out and now shoot all this footage with this broken
camera wouldn't it be nicer just to like why don't
I just rejoice the next few days and just like
take it in and not shoot any videos and maybe
I'll come back some other time and shoot some videos
so see my mind was making up that kind of
argument and I knew that that that wasn't you know
that wasn't the higher-value thing to do that was the
comfortable thing to do that was the easy thing to
do it was easy to call off the trip and
and moan about and come go home crying it was
easy to even keep the trip on but then just
use it as an excuse and say well the camera's
broken so now I have to do any work I'll
just kind of go enjoy the sights I mean that
would have been nice but I kind of I really
push myself and I said no I got a I
got a take advantage of this opportunity I don't know
when I'm gonna be back in Death Valley again maybe
I'll never be able to get out there and some
of the scenes that I'm seeing here and some of
the ideas that are percolating in my mind and you
get those out there's gonna be good potential videos but
of course then my mind tells me well what if
the camera is not working what if it's not working
you're gonna waste your your all that time you're gonna
waste six hours shooting a video just to find out
from the repair center later on whether the camera is
gonna work or not and I still don't know even
though I said it for repairs even they don't know
so how do you how do you deal with that
well I have I have other videos that tell you
to talk about how to be persistent how not to
quit how to keep a positive attitude and really I
had to start eating my own advice right I just
started eating my own dog food here and I try
to do that anyways but especially on this trip I
had to do it because if I didn't then how
could I come up here with a straight face and
give you guys advice if I don't follow it myself
so that's one of the ways that I reframed it
one of the ways I reframed it is I have
to say to myself well I have to walk my
talk and for me that's really really big whenever I
see myself not walking my talk that's an instant like
damn I have to there's something wrong here I have
to rethink what I'm doing and sometimes I fall off
track I don't always follow all my own advice it's
very difficult to do that so I always have to
first and foremost look at what I'm doing I make
sure that it's aligning and keep aligning myself and realigning
myself and realign myself that's difficult right but that's kind
of a challenge that I took on so for me
that was a motivator another motivator for me was that
I had to see the longer picture right I had
to look deeper into what these videos really mean for
me and why I'm shooting them and what I'm doing
with my work here and what that meant was I
had to look beyond just the fact that I'm gonna
maybe shoot six hours of footage and then not actually
ever be able to see it or be able to
post it I had to reframe it in my mind
said to myself well what am I really doing with
these videos part of the thing that I'm doing is
I'm trying to develop myself as I'm shooting each video
and that means developing myself as a speaker and that
means being able to deliver insights on the spot even
if I don't feel like it even if I feel
lazy even if I feel tired even if I feel
sunburned even if I feel like what I'm gonna say
is not going to be recorded and the cameras gonna
break or my microphones not working or anything like that
so part of the challenge that I saw in this
in this really the opportunity that I saw in this
challenge was that you know I'm gonna shoot six hours
of footage and I'm not gonna know what about what
I shot at least right now hopefully it'll work out
but even if it doesn't work out I still would
have gained something from it right so this is a
way to salvage a bad situation is to see and
you can probably find moments in your own life where
this has happened to you is you have a really
bad situation something just didn't go out and come out
the way you want it to right you got some
some bad luck well you can look at that and
say well I'll just keep pushing through anyways and have
faith first of all a little bit of faith that
the camera will work but even beyond that just faith
that what I'm doing here is going to advance me
anyways and right now even though I'm still very much
anxious about getting the footage back and I want it
back but even if I don't get it back at
this point what I said to myself is this well
I shot six hours of footage under very harsh conditions
those conditions shooting that valley were some of the harshest
that I've ever shot in like wind sand in my
face like literally all sorts of nasty stuff I'm sunburned
and I said to myself well I survived all that
and I just learned some valuable lessons about perseverance from
that trip and I feel like next time I go
out somewhere and I have a shoot on location and
some kind of harsh conditions like that then I will
already be toughened up right my skin will be tougher
literally my skin will be tougher but my mind will
be tougher too because I'm gonna go out there and
I'm already have some experience about problems with wind problems
with sand problems with locations all that kind of stuff
I did learn from that the other thing I would
have learned is I learned how to be on the
spot and how to push myself through because honestly sometimes
after a long two-mile hike to some sort of mountaintop
once you get there and you admire the view and
then you tell yourself well now I have to shoot
a video on this and have to come up with
some sort of topic right on the fly that's gonna
be insightful and and is gonna match the beauty of
this sunset or the sunrise that's that's a little bit
of putting pressure on yourself right so so here I
said you know what I'm gonna just learn to take
the pressure and I'm gonna I'm gonna advance my skills
with talking and I'm just gonna talk and talk at
the talk at the camera and just hope that these
six hours even if they never get posted on YouTube
or somewhere else on my website then I still would
have gotten the experience of shooting that and that means
that next time I come out here to Death Valley
which I will do if that footage doesn't come out
I'm gonna come out there again in a few weeks
and I'm gonna rerecord all that footage except now it's
gonna be even better because now I have a little
bit more experience about some of the challenges and hazards
out there and I've also even talked about all those
topics so the second time that I talk about all
those topics even though I never really liked to talk
about a topic twice because it just gets boring for
me I also find that when I do have to
rerecord a video what happens is that the second video
many times will come out better because I've already talked
about the topic and I feel more comfortable comfortable about
it in my mind and now even though I'm not
going down specific bullet points I still have kind of
an unconscious record of what I've talked about in the
past and the second time I'm line goes down that
that same track it tends to come out pretty damn
good and so that is basically what I learned from
that trip this is kind of what I've been up
to in the last few weeks and what I'm going
to be up to in the next few months ahead
is I plan to be shooting a lot more this
kind of footage and I thought I would use this
as an example of how to build perseverance and how
to how to puff it out sometimes and I think
that you know if you're starting a new business or
you're in the middle of a business or you're starting
your career or you're in the middle of a career
and you're trying to do something powerful with that the
way that I like to do with my businesses in
my career then you're gonna run unto these kinds of
problems where even when you're totally committed and you know
what your life purpose is and you're very motivated something
will come and literally knock you down will lock your
camera down will knock your bank account down will knock
you know will knock your health down will knock some
part of the project that you're working on down and
what you got to do is that this is where
that life purpose comes in right when you are very
conscious about your life purpose and you know what it
is that it's almost like you have no other options
no other options it's that idea of complete commitment complete
commitment to what you're doing believing that it's going to
work out believing that things will align for you even
if something at the moment is not aligned believing that
in the long run things will align and in the
long run everything you're doing is building up more and
more momentum and every time you get knocked down you
just stand back up and if you get knocked down
again you just stand back up and if you get
knocked down again you just stand back up because you
know that that's what it's gonna take to really get
you to your goals to your dream and that dream
is important to you you're gonna fight for it right
you're gonna bleed for it and I feel like I
did a little bit of bleeding the other weekend for
my dream and I know that I'm a lot more
bleeding to do in the future but I also feel
like every time I bleed a little bit I get
stronger I get more motivated I get more driven I
feel like I set myself apart from the competition even
more and now even though my cameras busted and I
went through some anxiety and trauma with that now I'm
back on my feet I got myself a temporary new
camera shooting more video for you right now and I
just see things as doing even better for me and
going even better as I push through and I already
feel more confident even right now standing in the studio
it's the first time I've shot since coming back from
Death Valley I already feel more confident more at ease
because shooting in the studio is so much nicer so
much easier now than doors I mean here it's like
easy I thought this was hard I got a month
back I thought it was hard to shoot at the
studio now I'm standing here and this is like a
cakewalk cakewalk compared to the the trials and tribulations that
I went through last weekend alright so hopefully maybe that's
this video encourages you to keep chugging along with whatever
it is that you're doing keep plugging away at it
and if you're encountering some obstacles right now don't despair
push through them you gotta keep pushing through if it's
something that is your dream you can never let go
you have to be like a pitbull like you clamp
down on whatever it is that you want and you
just never let go once your once your jaws are
clamped down on it you stay with it till the
very very bitter end all right this is Leo I'm
signing off go ahead post me your comments down below
please like this and share this click the like button
right now please and of course check out my newsletter
signup at actualise that'll work for a free newsletter where
I release free videos free articles I plan to have
other downloads and other cool things for you guys coming
out shortly sign up to that it's all for free
but really the reason that you want to sign up
is because I'm trying to deliver information to you about
how to master your own mind in your own psychology
how to master all those obstacles that are holding you
back in your life and when most people will say
is that the obstacles are external right it's the lack
of money or the lack of relationships or not having
the right job or something like that and while I'm
all about getting externals into place really we all understand
that the external stem from the internals so we're going
a little bit deeper here we're going kind of at
the root and we're sharing information with you wisdom about
how to master you to the internals how to master
yourself how to master your own motivation how to master
your own feelings and emotions in your own thoughts and
how to for example be very very persistent you know
how do you develop that kind of character and that
kind of skill set because once you do then you
can literally accomplish anything you want in your life and
until you don't no matter what you accomplish out there
in your life externally you're never really going to be
fulfilled on the inside because you - filled with fears
and anxieties and anger and all sorts of bitterness and
pettiness that just comes from not having a mastery of
your own mind so go ahead and sign up and
be on track with all the stuff that I'm throwing
at you guys because this stuff takes some exposure -
it doesn't take just one video it takes video after
video after video you really think about these things go
out there and implement them test them out and stay
on track stay on track with developing yourself and growing
yourself on a personal inner level that's what actualize that
work is all about sign up right now you
