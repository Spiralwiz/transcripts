            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/SpnP07-SLRI' target='_blank'>The Number One Reason Why You're Not Succeeding</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Importance of Taking Consistent Action</b>: Leo emphasizes that the main reason for lack of success is insufficient action. People often invest too much time in planning, theorizing, and discussing their goals without actually taking the necessary steps to achieve them. 
</li><li><b>The Illusion of Productivity</b>: Leo points out that individuals mistakenly believe they are making progress because they are busy with preparations and theoretical discussions. 
</li><li><b>Consistency in Action for Tangible Results</b>: Using the example of weight loss, Leo underlines the need for continuous commitment to either a diet or exercise regimen for a significant amount of time to see results. This principle applies universally, such as in overcoming bad habits like smoking, finishing books, and integrating self-help advice.
</li><li><b>Practical Approach to Measure Action Taken</b>: Leo proposes creating a visual grid to track actions taken consistently towards achieving a goal.
</li><li><b>Redirection of Expectations from Quick fixes to Consistent Effort</b>: Leo criticizes the tendency of people to prematurely expect results from quick-fix solutions, like the Law of Attraction. Although such concepts seem appealing, they require consistent effort and discipline to yield tangible results.
</li><li><b>Renew Rules for Complaints about Lack of Results</b>: Being frustrated about the status quo or a lack of results is only justifiable if coupled with a record of consistent action towards the desired changes. 
</li><li><b>Identity is shaped by Consistent Actions</b>: Leo reinforces Aristotle's quote "you are what you repeatedly do," suggesting one's identity is formed by their consistent actions. Therefore, to transform one's identity, consistent action towards the desired change is mandatory.
</li><li><b>Consistency in adopting Law of Attraction</b>: Leo emphasizes that people often become disillusioned with the Law of Attraction due to inconsistent application and failure to continuously focus on positives. It's stressed, that for it to work, it requires consistent application over a prolonged period, preferably for a few weeks.
</li><li><b>Criticisms of Self-help Industry</b>: Leo acknowledges that the self-help industry can sometimes offer quick-fix solutions; however, they assert that these teachings can still be valuable if applied consistently. They argue the problem lays not in the teachings themselves but in individuals' failure to persistently put lessons into practice.
</li><li><b>Importance of Tracking Consistent Action</b>: Leo proposes a novel system of tracking consistent action by marking your participation in desired actions or goals on a daily basis on a physical calendar or grid. This allows for practical visualization of your consistency or lack thereof.
</li><li><b>Consistency translates into Identity</b>: Citing Aristotle's quote "you are what you repeatedly do", Leo accentuates that one's identity is the sum of their daily actions. In order to truly become something (e.g., a person who regularly goes to the gym), you must consistently incorporate that action into your daily life.
</li><li><b>Self-deception and inconsistent action</b>: Leo points out the common tendency for people to deceive themselves about the true consistency of their actions. They advise against giving yourself undue credit for minor or half-hearted efforts and instead emphasize the necessity of true, consistent action.
</li><li><b>Solution for lack of Success</b>: Leo concludes by encouraging individuals to analyze their life and identify areas where inconsistent action might be limiting their success. By increasing the consistency of action, individuals can experience transformation and progress towards their goals.
