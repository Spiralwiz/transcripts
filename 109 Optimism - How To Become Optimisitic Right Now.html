            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/xZmnhdw3uuc' target='_blank'>Optimism - How To Become Optimisitic Right Now</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Importance of Optimism</b>: Leo Gura discusses the vital role of optimism, based on Dr. Martin Seligman's research, in overcoming obstacles, seeing more opportunities, and trying out new things for success in personal and professional life. 
</li><li><b>Correlation between Optimism and Success</b>: He links optimistic people's high level of success to their persistence, resourcefulness, and hopeful outlook, even amid rejection, using successful corporations' preference for hiring optimistic employees as an example. 
</li><li><b>Understanding the Meaning of Optimism</b>: Gura emphasizes the definition of optimism being a hopeful outlook for the future, while highlighting the role of an individual's explanatory style - the manner in which they assign meaning to life events - in cultivating optimism. 
</li><li><b>Three Types of Explanatory Styles that Influence Optimism</b>: He details the three forms of explanatory style  permanence, victimhood, and personalization  discussing how optimistic individuals view problems as temporary (permanence) and forward to positive outcomes (victimhood), whereas pessimists presume problems to be permanent and expect negative outcomes.
</li><li><b>Impact of Perception on Action</b>: Drawing a contrast between optimists and pessimists, Leo explains that pessimists, thinking problems are permanent, feel powerless and refrain from taking action for change, while optimists perceive problems as transitory, spurring them to act for improving their circumstances.
</li><li><b>Importance of explanatory styles in optimism</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the roles of specific explanatory styles in shaping optimism. He identifies three such styles- victimhood, pervasiveness, and personalization.
</li><li><b>Victimhood</b>: Optimists tend to view negative situations or obstacles as temporary and manageable problems, unlike pessimists, who perceive them as insurmountable and long-lasting issues.
</li><li><b>Pervasiveness</b>: Optimists confine problems within specific aspects of their life. For instance, a flat tire may affect their regular work schedule but wouldn't necessarily extend into their personal life. Pessimists, contrastingly, allow minor issues to spread into larger domains of their life, magnifying them into global problems.
</li><li><b>Personalization</b>: Optimists attribute external factors to negative outcomes, reducing personal blame. In positive scenarios, they credit their success to their own actions, fostering a sense of self-worth. Pessimists, on the other hand, blame themselves for negative events, diminish their role in positive occurrences, often leading to feelings of guilt and insignificance.
</li><li><b>Improving explanatory styles</b>: Leo provides a method to bolster optimism by noting down thirty things that you're excited to do in the coming year. Repeating this exercise frequently keeps one connected to their goals and aspirations, boosting optimism.
</li><li><b>Promotion of active optimism practice</b>: Encouraging viewers to write down even daily excitements, Leo suggests this habit to make one more hopeful and enthusiastic about each new day. He concludes with a reminder about the power of optimism and how its cycles can be accessed and utilized for personal growth.
</li><li><b>The value offered by subscriptions</b>: Subscribing to Leo Gura provides numerous benefits including regular insightful articles, a 19-part exclusive video-series on creating an extraordinary life, and the opportunity to win two hours of free monthly coaching.
