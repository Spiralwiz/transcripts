hey this is Leo for actualised org in this video
what I want to talk about is bad relationships all
right let's talk about bad relationships why do you keep
getting into a bad relationship and how can you prevent
that cycle from continuing so we want to dig deep
into what causes bad relationships and why you seem to
keep stumbling into them now what I'm talking about here
is specifically bad intimate relationships right dysfunctional intimate relationships whether
it's a marriage or long-term girlfriend boyfriend situation or even
a short term girlfriend boyfriend situation so let's take a
look at some of the distinctions that are necessary to
really get your head around this and to prevent this
from happening again the most important distinction and I believe
this is coming from Stephen Covey I can't quite remember
is the distinction between codependent independent and interdependent relationships see
codependency is the problem here this is where you are
at if you have problems with your relationship and you
keep getting bad relationships is that you're probably in this
codependency frame now let's go through and talk about each
one of them and show you how they how they
evolve one is the next so first what you've got
is you've got codependency codependency means that you have two
people that are coming together and they're leaning on each
other for support and what they're doing here is they're
using each other as emotional crutches now they'll justify it
to themselves as love or as companionship or something good
but in fact what's happening there is that each one
has a void that they're trying to fill in each
other's lives and so they're trying to prop each other
up and that creates a dysfunctional dynamic the next level
up from that and it's a pretty big level up
is independent independent means that you have one confident grounded
individual and then a second one who's also confident grounded
and they come together and they have an independent relationship
they don't really synergize it's simply just in and you
know they're sharing some stuff together but it's not really
the synergistic relationship and then you have the interdependent relationship
this is the next level up and this is the
highest level that you get to this is where to
come together and then they perform almost like a choreographed
ballet where they start moving in sync and a synergy
effect happens and really something awesome flourishes that's greater than
the sum of its parts so of course everyone wants
this right we all want this but most of us
in our relationships are here we're in the codependency frame
and we don't like to admit it as well in
fact right now I'm saying codependency and what I'm telling
you that you might think Oh codependency that means like
what I'm enabling my partner or my spouse or my
girlfriend or my boyfriend to be involved with crime or
drugs or something like that that's like a very extreme
example of codependency codependency simply means like I said that
you two are dependent on each other that's all it
means you're dependent that means that you cannot stand and
be happy by yourself and so is that is the
case with the other person so you guys can't be
independently happy but you can be happy together so what
this does is creates a temporary stability and it seems
like the stability is nice because you get into a
relationship and it's like yes it's going pretty well because
that person is providing you with something you're providing that
person with something and you both seem to be sort
of fulfilled but it's a deceptive stability and it never
really lasts and also leads to a lot of toxic
and bad stuff and I really see this with people
is that they get themselves involved with these toxic relationships
and then they can't get out of them it's like
this giant pit this giant like sand pit that they
get trapped in and they can't get out and they're
stuck in quicksand and then this leads to just like
horrible things I mean it leads to verbal abuse it
can lead to physical abuse arguments leads to all sorts
of a needy behavior just all sorts of dysfunction and
when you are stuck in a relationship like that it's
almost impossible to you to thrive in life it's impossible
for you to become self actualized because that other person
is holding you back and really you are holding yourself
back because you are choosing to be in this relation
now let's take a look at why this is going
on the reason this is happening is because there are
deep personality flaws within both individuals in this relationship and
that these individuals are not willing to address these flaws
so the solution here is ultimately as with most things
in life is to look within not without the problem
is in you now this is especially tricky with relationships
because when you have a dysfunctional relationship our mind will
trick us and it will point the finger at the
other person and we will blame the other person we
will say that we are being victimized and the other
person is doing something wrong now it doesn't mean that
the other person isn't doing something wrong all I'm saying
to you is that you have to take responsibility for
your own relationship in the fact that you're allowing this
to continue and that you're in there in the first
place right this is the only way that it can
work you have to take full responsibility for your bad
relationship otherwise you're going to get stuck you're going to
get stuck and the pattern is going to keep repeating
again why because there's this flaw in you your psyche
has a gap in it a void and you need
to fill that void with something and that other person
is doing it for you that's why you're hooked you're
addicted to that other person and so you keep coming
back even though you know that this relationship is not
healthy see most couples in a codependent relationship I mean
they're not stupid they're not totally blind they they understand
their higher self knows that this is a dysfunctional situation
but they keep going and going and going just like
a drug addict would with a drug addiction he also
knows it's not healthy but he keeps doing it simply
because he's stuck in a rut and now he has
his chemical dependency right he needs something that that drug
is giving him some sort of hit hit of stimulation
it's hard to break free of that well that's literally
what's going on with this codependency in your relationship now
let's take a look at what are some of these
gaps that you could have in your own psyche see
once you get honest with yourself once you really get
fed up with this procuring pattern of bad relationships then
you're going to tell yourself okay what can I really
do to take responsibility once you're at that point then
you have to ask yourself okay what is the real
void that I'm trying to fill why am I so
needy and that usually comes down to one of these
five things I would say it's this one is money
two is six three is love four is companionship and
five is support emotional support or other forms of support
so one of these things generally is going to be
the cause of your neediness and your codependency so you
need something from the other person it might be love
it might be sexy might be money it doesn't really
matter what it is you might think that what you
want and what you need is very noble you might
say well love love is a very noble quality love
is maybe the highest value of my life I really
need love that's very important to me that's fine except
what you're doing is you are desperate desperately seeking love
and you're so desperate for love that you're literally willing
to endure anything to get it and that's exactly what
happens is that you endure anything and you endure a
bad relationship and you endure a person abusing you in
some way and you endure arguments and you endure all
sorts of turmoil and you endure all sorts of things
that you really shouldn't be enduring because you don't have
a boundary set and you're not independent see you can
still want love when you're independent it's just that when
you're independent you don't really need love you want it
but if you don't get it it's okay you're willing
to like wait until a good opportunity arises when you're
desperate you'll do anything for love including really stupid things
and that can lead to a very disastrous situation in
your own life so if you see that you have
this kind of gap where you really need something then
you have to start to address this because I can
guarantee that this gap it's not going to go away
just because you change relationships so even if you're thinking
of getting out of this current relationship that you're in
and you're saying yourself well this guy or this girl
he's an she's a and this is never going to
work out with them but you know what it's all
their fault so I'm just going to go I'm going
to find somebody nice I'm going to have this dream
life with my dream partner we're going to get married
or whatever our situations going to be and we can
have a family everything's know beautifully well newsflash that's not
going to happen to you because you are the cause
of your own relationship problems not the other person so
you have to also bite this bullet in a minute
right it can get it can take it can take
some real serious pain and a history of bad relationships
to finally come to the point where saying to yourself
okay fine it really must be me now it really
must be me it can't be there's a person that
that's a trick that my brain is playing on me
so once you go through that and you come out
and you say okay fine it's me then it's like
okay what are the real sticking points that I have
and it's one of these gaps so once you identify
one of these gaps let's say that your gap is
love if to look back and see where is this
gap really coming from usually what you'll find is that
this gap is coming from the past from childhood childhood
or early adulthood and the reason that is is that
when you were growing up probably what happened is that
you weren't maybe getting enough love maybe your parents got
divorced when you were young maybe some sort of traumatic
situations happened or for some reason you have some sort
of self-esteem issues or insecurities and you feel now that
you're deficient in some way and you need something to
come in there and fill in that void and what
you've been doing your whole life especially in your dating
life and your intimate relationships is that you've been looking
for the man or the woman who's going to fill
that void and really what you were looking for is
an external solution to an internal problem and you never
really want to turn around and take a look inside
yourself to see okay what is the internal problem see
the problem is that when you find an external solution
to an internal problem then you're even more dependent on
it because what happens when that person goes away what
happens when that person leaves on a trip what happens
that person decides to leave you what happens if that
person stays late for work and can't join you for
dinner see what you what's going to happen is you're
going to get resentful you're gonna get mad you're going
to feel like that person is taking away that thing
that you're propping yourself up on right you're let you're
leaning on that person the person might move away and
now you need to chase so this is creating this
this needy dynamic and it's really not good and the
the point here is that you have to look back
and kind of trace trace from the past where this
came up the nice thing about doing that trace is
that it gets you more awareness more consciousness so that
you're not acting as unconsciously in the future in your
in your relationship that'll get a little bit more distance
so that you could do whatever needs to be done
to start to correct this situation see the problem is
that if you are this needy person you're codependent and
you go and you think that you're going to go
into some other relationship and things going to be better
there then actually you're really kidding yourself and in fact
here's the dynamic it's going to happen you have really
three people that you could run into you can run
into another codependent person so let's say you're codependent and
you run into another codependent person well that's going to
be the same type of relationship that you already got
right a codepen a person can only really stay in
a relationship with another codependent person here's why you might
think like well what if I go find myself a
nice independent guy or nice and dependent girl wouldn't that
solve my problem no because here it's going to happen
the independent person is going to be here you're going
to come in as the dependent needy person and you're
going to want something from that person from the independent
one and what's going to happen is you're going to
like start leaning and leaning and leaning and you're going
to be putting this independent person into a codependent frame
but this independent person really will only have two choices
either he or she can choose to fall into codependency
which is a lower state of consciousness and most independent
people will never want to do this so what happens
is if you do that he'll just leave you or
she will leave you or something will happen there'd be
a lot of tension there or the other thing that
might happen is that that person actually does you end
up successfully converting him in to a codependent frame and
now that person is in a codependent frame with you
and basically you're back to where you started from and
there's a lot of tension and turmoil going on there
so in either of those cases it's a it's a
lose-lose it's not going to work a codependent person is
never going to be able to stay in a relationship
with an independent person there's going to be too much
clashing going on so that's the case there and you
might be asking what about the interdependent well interdependence is
really just independence of two people and then then deciding
to do a really nice choreography together there's no way
in hell there's gonna be any kind of choreography going
on with you because you're codependent you're too needy to
think about that you just need your needs desperately met
and the independent person he doesn't wanna be with you
so this is going to happen is that there's not
going to be a choreography there's may be a lot
of tension and then it's going to break up so
no interdependence will happen as well so I hope you
can like understand the severity of this problem now this
is not meant to depress you this is meant to
be real right this is meant to be a sobering
truth because once you realize this it's actually empowering now
you can say okay I am pretty low I'm kind
of at Ground Zero but now I do see that
there's a way to work my way up it'll take
some time it'll take some work inner work outer work
maybe breaking up a relationship but then you can see
that there is a path forward you can move out
of codependency into in dependency once you're independent then you
would start to have nice relationships okay so how do
you know now if your relationship is actually codependent or
not and how do you know if it's time to
break it off or not because ultimately my solution to
you is if you're in a codependent relationship then you've
got to break it off I know you don't want
to that's not what you want to hear because you
love that other person you're addicted to that other person
you don't want to really admit that and it can
be hard to actually follow through on that you might
even admit it to yourself logically but then you won't
actually have the courage to break it off with another
person or maybe you break it off but then you
get back together well you need to make a clean
cut when you see that codependency is there if you
don't then you're just going to be slowing yourself down
in life and the toxicity is gonna be building up
more and more and more and there's nothing that's going
to come in there and magically fix it for you
so the solution there is to break it off how
do you know when this is right to do well
here's a little guideline I'm going to give you actually
a researcher dr. John Gottman he has a very amazing
book called the seven principles that make marriage work and
there he talks about some of the research that he's
done on couples and what he did is he's one
of the foremost researchers on couples and successful relationships and
what he does is he gets people couples to come
into his lab and he literally observes them through a
two-way mirror and as he's doing this he'll look and
he'll see he'll take notes and he'll try to find
patterns and he'll ask himself you know what are the
successful relationships and what are the dysfunctional relationships and what
are the different factors that are involved there and he
actually distilled everything down to a very simple little guideline
that you can use to evaluate a relationship and what
he found is the following is that a happy successful
relationship that has a chance of actually continuing on the
long run that is a relationship that has a ratio
of five to one of positive to negative interactions five
to one ratio that means for every five good things
that happen in a relationship one bad thing happens now
with dysfunctional relationships relationships that will never stay together there
the ratio is lower than five to one it's either
four to one or three to one or two to
one or even one to one so imagine this one
that one good thing happens and then one bad thing
happens for every one good thing one bad thing if
your relationship like that it's severely severely dysfunctional in fact
this little this little metric works so well this rule
of thumb that John Gottman will use it in his
lab and he says that he has a 95% accuracy
rate of predicting whether a couple will stay together not
successfully just by observing them for five or ten minutes
because he can already see in the way they're interacting
the looks they're giving each other the smiles or frowns
the things they say to each other he can already
detect from within that where are the positives and where
are the negatives so it's very easy when a couple
is standing there talking to each other for 10 minutes
you'll see how many negative looks do they give each
other how many positive looks how many like loving looks
how much how much positive conversation is hat is going
on versus negative how many fights are there relative to
all the good stuff that's supposed to be happening in
a relationship well you calculate that you tally it up
and then you can clearly see so you use this
on yourself now ask yourself really how many positive to
negative interactions that are in your relationship and if it's
lower than five to one then you need to really
consider cutting it off and if it's something really low
like I would say a three or a two or
a one to one then you definitely need to cut
that off that's going to be the solution for you
now you don't really want to hear that of course
but you know what sometimes you gotta endure a little
bit of pain to grow yourself and to move on
to the next stage so when you break it off
you have to break it off cold make sure you
don't come back to that person and then you have
to be by yourself now this period we're going to
be by yourself it might seem that you're going to
be lonely going to be depressed you're going to be
sad actually it's going to happen is that you're going
to you're going to get over that person and you're
going to grow to a new level and when you
exert that sort of decisiveness and we have the courage
to leave somebody like that who you know is not
right for you then that actually builds a lot of
strength within you then when you're gonna be off on
your own you're gonna have time to reflect to ruminate
to really introspect to do this tracing back activity to
find out what are the real codependency problems within you
that's causing this that's causing this pattern this is probably
not the first time that this happened right so you're
gonna you're going to find those out you're going to
really work on those maybe through therapy through coaching or
through your own journaling or whatever process you want to
use you're going to work that out and then once
you work that out then you can get into a
new relationship and there you have a chance now because
when you become independent then you can find other independent
person and together you have a chance to do something
either independent together or either even interdependent together and really
make a nice beautiful relationships the way it's supposed to
be right loving happy that's the way a relationship should
be there should not be toxicity and negativity and fighting
and certainly no any no form of abuse so if
you've got any of that stuff then those are clear
signs that you need to start to change stuff up
