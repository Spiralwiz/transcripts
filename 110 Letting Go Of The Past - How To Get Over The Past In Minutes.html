            <ul>
    <li><b>Concept of the Past and Future</b>: Leo highlights that the past and future are not real, but rather, conceptualizations. What's real is the present reality. One should not attribute emotional weight or reality to what isn't actually real. Also, he emphasizes that the future is unpredictable, underlining the fact that predictions or expectations are just thoughts, not certainties. 
</li><li><b>Traumatic Memories and Emotions</b>: Gura acknowledges that past traumatic events can have deep roots in one's mind, reinforcing the idea that these are merely memories, not the current reality. He encourages his audience to move forward by letting go of these past events. 
</li><li><b>Meditation Exercise</b>: Leo presents a guided meditation exercise aimed at helping his audience let go of the past. He invites them to focus on the present, guiding them to acknowledge bodily sensations and their own breath patterns. He promotes the acceptance and acknowledgement of past traumas and painful experiences without resistance. 
</li><li><b>The Importance of Letting Go of the Past</b>: He emphasizes that holding onto negative past experiences only hinders one's performance. Leo encourages viewers to let go of these experiences for their overall happiness and wellbeing. He adds that he too battles with his past but recognizes that it hampers his performance. 
</li><li><b>The Possibility of Letting Go of Past Trauma</b>: Leo asserts that it is entirely possible to let go of severe past trauma, irrespective of the gravity of the experience, be it a death in the family, a breakup, a business failure, abuse, or health issues. This decision to let go solely depends on the individual. 
</li><li><b>Action vs. Conceptualization</b>: Leo presents the idea that action can only occur in the present and that thoughts of what could transpire in the future are merely conceptualizations, not set realities.
</li><li><b>Reality of the Past and Future</b>: Leo Gura points out that both past and future are not real and only the present moment is. Similar to memories and traumatic events, the past and future are conceptualizations that, while they can be emotionally charged and seem real, they are not present, tangible realities. 
</li><li><b>Present Moment Awareness Exercise</b>: Gura guides the viewer through a meditative exercise to experience the present moment. The viewer is instructed to close their eyes, relax, and focus on their sensations. They are asked to imagine there is no future or past, and only this present moment exists. The exercise is aimed at helping the viewer realize that the attention given to the past and future is a choice and it is fully possible to stay in the now.
</li><li><b>Letting Go of the Past</b>: Confronting a common belief that the past cannot be let go, Leo Gura suggests that holding on to the past is a choice. The past stays alive because we continually recall it. He maintains that letting go involves making a clear decision to stop thinking about past events. He advises seeking professional help, such as therapy or coaching, for further introspection and processing of the past. 
</li><li><b>Creating a Positive Distraction</b>: The key to not falling back into ruminating about the past, according to Leo, is to have a positive project or goal to focus on. Whether it's setting a goal for a new relationship or envisioning personal growth and transformation, having something to look forward to can prevent dwelling on the past. 
</li><li><b>Promotion of Actualized.org newsletter</b>: Leo wraps up by inviting his audience to sign up for Actualized.org's newsletter that provides weekly videos on mastering oneÂ’s psychology and introspection. Subscribers gain access to a 19-part video series on eliminating limiting beliefs and have the chance to win two hours of free coaching with Leo.
