hey Leo here for actual eyes dorg and in this
episode I'm going to talk about how to get started
with self actualization a [Music] while back I released an
episode called the big picture of self actualization where I
talk about the high level components of what self actualization
looks like and what you're actually doing when you're growing
one of the biggest problems that newbies face when they
get into personal development or self actualization is that you
read and hear about various techniques and then you get
so engrossed in those techniques that you don't have a
big picture understanding of really what you're doing and really
why the techniques are working and so you can't really
judge which techniques are very powerful ones which ones are
weak or shallow ones and so that's why the big
picture is very important so if you're new to this
go watch that episode first but also at the end
of that episode I promised that I would talk about
the practical level the low level so that was the
high level this here is the continuation of that but
now the low level so what does it actually look
like when you're taking action on the high level what
techniques and methods are you using to actually make it
real to embody it that's what I'm going to talk
about here I'm going to give you over 40 different
self actualization techniques before I do that though let me
tell you this because the reason that I'm even shooting
this episode is because more and more I keep hearing
from people this problem of Leo you have so much
content you have hundreds of episodes which one should I
watch tell me what order I should watch them in
should i watch that video first then this one or
this one and then that one tell me how to
do it I want a simple 1 2 3 step
formula for how to develop myself well when I hear
this I chuckle because it's rather silly you are supposed
to be the architect of your life how the [
__ ] am I supposed to know what's right for
you and what order you're supposed to read books in
and watch videos in I don't know what's wrong with
your life I don't know what your goals are I
don't know what your vision is I know virtually nothing
about you and neither do you that's the problem you
see you have to be the architect of your life
you have to plan it out and design it for
yourself that's in essence why you're alive at all and
why you have any brain or sense of consciousness so
that you can do that do not shirk your responsibilities
and try to get other teachers or people to do
this for you to live your life for you you
might as well ask me to have sex with your
spouse for you leo if you have sex with my
wife that's basically what you're asking me when you're asking
me leo which video should I watch in which order
that's your job it's not my job that's where life
is delicious is it in the in the designing and
architecting of it you come up with the vision because
you have total freedom of what you want to do
with your life you come up with the vision you
then research all the material all the tools at your
disposal all the techniques that are out there and they're
very easy to research these days with the internet and
all that and and then you go out and you
come up with a plan for which tools and techniques
you're going to be using to realize your vision you
see that's what a hero is doing on the hero's
journey you're supposed to be carving out your own path
nobody can tell you what your path should be because
you have unique problems unique challenges unique genetics a unique
family history you had a unique childhood all that stuff
shapes your desires values challenges limitations and obstacles and some
techniques will work for you what others won't there's a
massive amount of techniques when it comes to self actualizing
on overabundance more then you will ever have time in
your entire life to explore but nevertheless for a newbie
it's good to get a broad overview of what all
these techniques could be or a good chunk of them
so that you know what your options are because when
you're first starting off your options are very limited just
because you know nothing you haven't studied anything so that's
what we're going to correct here let's start sharing some
of these techniques with you and then because there's no
overabundance don't think that you need to use all these
just a handful of them just five out of these
forty can transform your life completely so don't think you
need to go super broad although it is helpful to
go broad just so you get a better sense of
the options because frankly you don't know which of these
techniques will resonate with you or not one of these
techniques might work really well for me but then for
you it falls flat and then vice versa something works
great for you but then for me it doesn't work
because it doesn't fit my personality type you see so
what I'm getting here are like Lego blocks building blocks
that you're going to use to construct your own creation
so let's begin the list firstly we have life purpose
and this list is in no particular order although life
purpose I think is one very very important component of
self actualized life purpose is about taking your career and
turning it into your greatest passion and your work of
art life purpose is about finding something really meaningful for
you to be doing with your work not just a
nine-to-five job but the most meaningful thing you could be
doing the biggest and most important impact for you that
you could be having on the world how you could
be contributing to humanity in whatever way you want that
to be whether it's business art or whatever and then
working to master that field that domain and getting a
really good sense of what mastery is the process of
mastery then applying that to your career so that you're
making a living in this world and you're waking up
every morning and you're excited in your passion about what
you're doing with your life compare that to the way
most people work which is that they hate their job
they grind through it and then their emotions and their
their level of passion excitement for growth and for development
reflects that and it's very poor life's purpose is very
important because it gives you a sense of fuel or
motivation which is really high-quality and long-lasting because one of
the biggest problems you're going to face with self-actualization is
that you're going to really struggle with motivating yourself you
can a yo-yo up and down you're going to fall
off track a lot the way I found to fix
that is through life purpose and I have a whole
course on that so at over 25 hours of videos
that explain how to find your life purpose the next
technique is reprogramming your subconscious mind I'm developing about a
course about this as well because it's also a pretty
deep topic there are various techniques you can use affirmations
visualizations and so on to get at the root of
the subconscious beliefs you hold about lies and many of
the patterns that keep fueling many of those behaviors that
you want to stop your subconscious mind is responsible for
most of what you think and most of what you
do learning how to reprogram it how to reprogram various
fears insecurities that you have this is such a deep
topic that I need to create a whole course on
it but a very important one another technique is meditation
which I've covered a lot with various episodes go check
out all my episodes about meditation start a meditation habit
I think it's one of the most important habits that
you can install in your life when you start to
self-actualize daily meditation without ever skipping and making a commitment
to meditate for the rest of your life without missing
a single day that's personally a commitment that I've made
knife stuck to it for about 3 or 4 years
now without missing a single day so it can be
done and it's completely life transforming another method all point
out which is kind of a maybe a sub section
under meditation is specifically mindfulness meditation with labeling I have
an episode called mindful meditation which I think that very
few people have really capitalized on where I described a
very formal specific technique of meditating with using these labels
see here feel so that you can deconstruct your entire
sensory field into sights sounds and feelings both inner ones
and outer ones and this is absolutely fundamental if you
want to get to the advanced levels of this work
because you need to start to break down all the
concepts and fantasies that your mind is creating and one
of the most effective ways I found to do that
is through this mindfulness with labeling method because your mind
is just too tricky and it'll completely delude you if
you think that you're just going to rationalize your way
through some of these things you're not you need to
actually deconstruct your very experience of reality so that's a
super powerful one I've also talked about concentration practice in
the past I have a whole episode on that where
I distinguish concentration from meditation there are subtle differences their
concentration is very important especially for most people these days
because our concentration is so shitty because of the way
that modern technology affects our brain cell phones internet YouTube
and all the sort of stuff so your concentration is
so bad that you cannot even sit down and self
inquire for five or ten minutes it's terrible it's terrible
you cannot focus on anything you can't contemplate you can't
self inquire you can't meditate you can't think about anything
for even five minutes straight you don't have any focus
and so that robs you of a lot of avenues
to self actualize so build a concentration practice speaking of
self inquiry that's another one self inquiry is like the
ultimate method for how to arrive to truth both deep
levels of relative truth and then also absolute truth self
enquiry is a method for enlightenment and I have talked
about it in the past I have episodes about it
I have even guided self inquiry for you so go
check out some of those another method is contemplation which
is yet different from meditation and concentration and self inquiry
and I talked about contemplation in my contemplation episode so
go check that out contemplation is hugely important if you
want to get to the deepest levels of this work
because what needs to happen is that you need to
contemplate all of the stuff that I'm talking about for
yourself and derive the answers for yourself and not just
believe me or anybody else you need to see why
these things are true for yourself that creates a lot
of growth that's not something you want to outsource another
method is journaling journaling i think is actually a awesome
method for newbies you can start with just five to
ten minutes of journaling every single day it's very easy
just get a notebook get a pen a paper whatever
sit down and just start to write about what do
you want for your life what is bugging you what's
frustrating you what's keeping you stuck what are your greatest
fears what are your biggest frustrations in life what's your
vision for life what do you want out of life
and that's where you can start with journaling and then
if you want you can take journaling much deeper and
you can do it for hours at a time you
can really introspect you can contemplate and self inquire while
you're journaling on paper that can be a powerful method
you can also do self coaching you can do self
therapy in your journaling you can go back into your
past you can analyze your own childhood your history problems
you've had in the past you know goals and desires
for the future so that's a really great technique another
technique for you is learning the theory I mean this
is just so fundamental that you wouldn't even think of
it as a technique but learning the theory means reading
listening and watching reading books listening to audio programs courses
watching courses audio or video programs DVD programs and so
forth and this is critical for newbies because when you
start you don't know what your options are you don't
know what's right what's wrong or how to do anything
imagine if you try to do surgery on a human
being without having any theory about the human body it
would be a catastrophe it would be fatal and that's
basically what happens with most people when they try to
do personal development is that they they lack the sufficient
theoretical foundation for being able to guide themselves and see
their own blind spots and so they fall into a
lot of traps and they make a lot of mistakes
how do you correct that reading listening watching a lot
of it hundreds of hours thousands of hours of it
I've been reading listening and watching every single day for
many years now and I still don't feel like I
have sufficient theory to know everything that I feel like
I need to know in order to guide myself to
the kind of life that I want to have so
that's how much theory we're talking about we're talking about
at least a college bachelor's degree worth of theory at
least four years of hardcore studying at least and maybe
even a master's degree worth or maybe even a doctorate
that's what we're talking about if you really care about
living to your full potential in life it takes a
lot of theory because uh in a sense you are
you not only do you need the right theory but
also you need to fix a lot of the bad
theory that you've been stuck in programmed with from childhood
and from school and from society see so you've got
you got twice the challenge ahead of you with theory
because a lot of the fear you're going to be
reading is not even going to be able to stick
in your head because you have so much negative opposite
theory which is you know leaving your cup so full
that you can't fill it with the right theory another
method is taking notes so as you're learning the theory
I hope you're taking lots of notes because you're going
to be developing a repository over the years of hundreds
of pages of notes of all the juiciest wisdom and
insights and techniques that you find through your studying in
your theory the note-taking is very important you can't assemble
all this information in your head there's too much of
it it's too nuanced and complex it's not going to
work you need to be taking notes reading notes studying
your notes over and over again really you know the
way that you would if you were going to be
an A student in college another technique for you is
buying and doing courses there are an amazing amount of
really high quality courses that are available these days online
and in DVD form in CD form and audiobook form
and so forth these courses will transform your life but
you have to find them and then actually do them
and of course you have to buy them a lot
of newbies are so cheap that they're afraid to buy
a hundred dollar course a 200 dollar course a thousand
dollar course we are really in a magical era right
now the era of the internet and a lot of
information available and a lot of incredible courses you can
find courses for how to fix your relationships nutrition or
exercise for yoga for meditation for enlightenment for building your
career building your business for marketing I mean it doesn't
stop there are at least a hundred courses available right
there on the internet for any one of these facets
of your life that you want to master and they
contain very valuable wisdom that would take you decades to
discover on your own so they're really worth it another
method is researching books courses and seminars so not only
do you need to be doing research into the theory
but you need to be doing research into the research
which things do you need to be researching which books
should you be reading which courses should you be looking
at which seminars should you be attending all that takes
time to research that stuff to plan it out if
we're talking about courses or seminars these usually take a
week or more to complete that's a solid week you
need to plan out put on your calendar you got
a budget yourself some of these can cost a thousand
dollars or more you got a plan your air travel
Hotels all this sort of stuff needs to be plan
an advanced purchase and so forth that requires lots of
research another method for you is studying various spiritual traditions
Buddhism yoga Tantra Hinduism Christianity Islam Judaism what I mean
there's there's so many spiritual traditions out there ones that
you've never even heard of which contain a lot of
juicy wisdom of course they also contain a lot of
[ __ ] and Dogma which can easily lead you
astray so this point is tricky which is why I
spend a lot of time in my content talking about
epistemology because I don't want to tell you something like
oh yeah Buddhism is all true just go with Buddhism
because it doesn't work that way it's a lot more
nuanced and complex there is no one true teaching out
there most of the teachings are 90% [ __ ]
and delusion with 10% of some good wisdom in there
and you got to know how to figure out and
distinguish the wheat from the chaff which is why I
talk a lot about epistemology because that's what you need
to understand to be able to distinguish the wheat from
the chaff another method for you is seeking out masterful
teachers we again are alive an incredible time right now
where the world is interconnected like never before and there
are incredibly competent expert teachers available in any domain that
you want to learn anything from whether it's business relationships
sexuality diet nutrition enlightenment consciousness work whatever there's a teacher
for it and some of the most masterful teachers are
the most unknown and if you just bother to do
a little bit of research and you have the desired
initiative you can go find these masterful teachers and you
can meet them face-to-face you can get inspired by them
you can take their courses in seminars you can buy
their books you can take their programs you can sit
down with them face-to-face you can get coaching from them
you can pick their brain you can even come there
apprentice or a volunteer for them or even an employee
and learn all their secrets you could also find very
popular teachers but also take the time to find the
rare teachers the ones that are not very popular because
someone like Eckhart Tolle you're probably not going to get
face to face time with them but you can find
a teacher just as masterful as that car totally or
even more so and you can actually get face to
face time with it and a lot of times those
teachers aren't even that expensive and they exist all around
the world and they fly around all around the world
doing workshops and stuff so seek them out there's nothing
quite like getting the deepest wisdom directly from a master
face to face it's totally different than just hearing it
from a video another method is to attend workshops retreats
and seminars this is life-changing stuff just one workshop one
good retreat one good seminar will change your whole thinking
on a subject whether it's business enlightenment or whatever and
there's a again hundreds if not thousands of these available
you got to research them plan it out pay money
for them yes they do usually cost a couple thousand
dollars for high-quality workshop or retreat or seminar but then
again they can save you years of going down the
road the wrong road the pasta retreats are amazing this
another technique I have for you here they're specifically powerful
for developing your mindfulness and your body awareness and also
fixing reading problems that you might have solo retreats is
another technique I have for you I release an episode
recently about my solo retreat in Arizona solar retreat is
just basically you for a week or for 10 days
sitting by yourself isolated in a cat on a couch
somewhere for 12 hours a day doing nothing or meditating
or self inquiring maybe journaling but basically doing nothing without
any distractions without any social media without any internet for
a whole week this is life transforming stuff just one
or two of these retreats will give you several years
worth of grow in one week that's how powerful they
are also psychedelic retreats are available you can go to
Peru and you ayahuasca retreats there are various psychedelic retreats
in Mexico in Canada even in the United States there's
a Santo dime a church where you can drink DMT
legally there's all sorts of Native American Indian traditions peyote
ceremonies and so forth so there's a lot of stuff
like that available and a lot of it is totally
legal so go check that out do the research pay
the money go travel do this stuff it'll be life
transforming stuff for you or you can do psychedelics by
yourself which is the second technique I have for you
here under psychedelics trip by yourself in a responsible manner
specifically for personal development reasons for spiritual growth reasons learn
how to use psychedelics properly and man um over the
last year I've had just some of the most incredible
life-changing experiences on psychedelics absolutely incredible and my growth has
has skyrocketed ways that I can't even explain to you
from these psychedelics so that's a hugely powerful tool of
course psychedelics are not for stupid people psychedelics or for
very responsible careful wise people you have to know how
to do them properly I have episodes that I released
in the past that talk about specifically how to do
psychedelics for personal development so check that out another method
I have for you is ending unconscious relationships a lot
of newbies cannot even begin to grow themselves properly and
to start to live out their life purpose or do
any of this kind of other work because they are
mired in very negative toxic dysfunctional relationships specifically family relationships
and intimate relationships and bad old friendships some of these
relationships can be salvaged and some of them cannot you
need to be able to distinguish which is which and
after a certain point cut out the toxic ones because
they are robbing you of all your potential in life
you do not deserve to stay in any kind of
relationship which is robbing you of your highest potential of
your consciousness and of your ability to self-actualize even if
it's someone very close to you that that's just completely
wrong and all that's going to do is going to
turn you into a bitter dysfunctional person yourself and you're
not going to do the world any favors by becoming
that way so watch out cut those out of your
life and then the second method I have for you
regarding relationships is that some of your relationships are salvageable
and in those what you can do is you can
learn how to communicate properly and you can learn how
to let go of your ego in relationships what that
means is that you start to identify all the ways
in your relationships that you're using your relationship for selfish
needs for your selfish sexual needs for your emotional needs
for your need to be loved for your financial needs
you know for your physical comfort needs all of this
is a lot of selfish egoic [ __ ] which
is toxifying your relationships and it's not doing you or
the other person any real service so letting go of
your ego means identifying where you're being dishonest where you're
being manipulative where you're scheming where you're doing all this
stuff in your relationship just to satisfy your own ego
and letting that stuff go that's a huge Avenue for
growth right there which also leads me to the next
technique which is radical honesty there's a book by Brad
Blanton I think yeah Brad Blanton called radical honesty worth
the whole technique that he describes is a is just
being radically honest with yourself and with other people and
just by doing this and by being more honest a
lot of the stress and neuroses and dysfunction in your
life starts to melt away even physical ailments like depression
and anxiety and so forth heart disease even can melt
away when you start to be honest because you keep
so many lies and secrets you hide so much stuff
from everybody in your life including yourself that it produces
a heavy toll on your body and on your mind
another method I have for you is making new friends
and I don't just mean friends to have fun with
I mean making conscious friends who are into higher class
and stuff like self-actualization most of your friends were made
unconsciously by accident in school in college maybe at your
workplace now what you need to realize is that now
you actually need to make conscious friends which takes a
lot more work and research but the upside of it
is that now you have friends who are actually aligned
with your values aren't holding you back and these are
friends who are maybe building businesses they're entrepreneurs friends who
are into proper nutrition friends into yoga into meditation into
enlightenment surround yourself with at least a couple of these
friends you don't need tons of them you don't need
a dozen friends just one or two high consciousness friends
is all you really need to start and you'll experience
a big boost in your own motivation to to grow
and then of course the flip side of that is
cut out any friends who are being lazy drunk going
partying every night dance or should cut those friends out
because you don't need those friends anymore you're gonna know
you're going to lose them anyways because the things you're
going to be thinking about and doing they're not going
to have any interest in and good riddance another method
for you is NLP NLP means neuro linguistic programming I
haven't really talked about that much in the past but
it's a pretty deep field there's a lot of NLP
techniques which are basically various kinds of visualization techniques and
sort of pseudo hypnosis techniques where you which you can
use to reprogram your subconscious mind you can use it
to instill better beliefs to rewire old beliefs old patterns
to boost your emotional state and so forth so you
can research that and structures use some of those another
method is shadow work and what shadow work is is
basically identifying the repressed aspects of your psyche how you
judge people why you come angry your deepest fears your
deepest neuroses stuff that you've repressed so this is basically
therapy in a nutshell but shadow work to me sort
of implies that you're doing it yourself rather than just
going to a therapist you're actually sitting down and you're
working through your own stuff you're trying to surface stuff
that you've repressed about yourself how do you do shadow
work well um I have an episode plan about that
for the future too there's another set of methods that's
very promising and this is what I would call the
various collection of new-age methods these include things like lucid
dreaming astral projection hypnosis Reiki perhaps acupuncture you know chakras
there's there's a lot of stuff that you know goes
on in the new-age circles and a lot of this
stuff is very legit as far as how it can
grow you and how it can shift your emotions and
your entire relationship to life so all these techniques are
pretty pretty involved so they take reading and research I
myself have only skimmed the surface of some of these
I haven't really had time to go very deep on
them but there's a lot of potential there which is
not to say that they're all completely true and then
I agree with all their metaphysics and all the new
AG stuff that comes along with it there's a lot
of dogs when it comes with it so I'm not
saying all that is true necessarily but I think the
technique can be very therapeutic and valuable so if you
can stomach the wow factor there's a lot for you
to discover there and if you're one of these rational
peoples scientifically minded people who cannot stomach the wow factor
well I suggest that you drop that [ __ ]
drop it right now you need to have an open
mind when you're doing personal development you need to put
your skepticism to the test you can actually test out
the techniques a lot of the techniques that you think
are woowoo and New Age and are just for hippies
and won't do anything for you these are some of
the most powerful and life transforming techniques available and you're
really doing yourself a disservice with your closed-minded rationalism just
drop that [ __ ] and actually put this stuff
to the test another method for you is cleaning up
your diet sounds basic but it's extremely important going paleo
going vegetarian going vegan you know there's a lot of
different diets out there raw food diet I'm not going
to get into the pros and cons of which ones
are better than others for me cleaning up my diet
has been a process of over 10 years layer after
layer after layer of you know throwing out bad foods
and bad habits I was fat for most of my
life I was so fat that if you saw a
photo of me you would not even recognize me people
ask me for my photo this was actually I was
fat before the the age of smartphones and digital cameras
so I don't actually have any digital photos my mom
has some physical photographs I'll have to ask her to
send me some so I could maybe post that on
my blog or something so you can see but yeah
you won't even recognize me from that photo it's that
bad I was so fat um it's just terrible and
it affected my energy levels it affected my self-esteem and
my confidence it affected my sexuality it affected me in
so many negative ways and I was really really addicted
to food and that for me has been in a
sense how I got started with self-actualization even though I
didn't know it at the time is that I was
just so tired and so disgusted with myself with all
the food that I was eating and I had no
idea about the right theory what the right food is
I didn't even know that this food that I was
eating was destroying my body I didn't know any of
that and I just had to kind of pull myself
up by my bootstraps and and fix that over time
and I'm still continuing that process just this week I
made another effort to clean up my diet even more
because I'm seeing just how important nutrition is for my
ability to self-actualize especially to get to the very advanced
levels you need to have very clean nutrition you need
to put the right fuel into your body this means
learning about what the right nutrition is and there's a
lot of nutrition theory out there which is quite complicated
to sort through a lot of contradictory information is out
there so you got to do your research and then
committing to some kind of diet changes and then making
those changes finding good recipes mastering those recipes and then
just making it habit in your life with the kind
of [ __ ] diet that most people eat forget
it just forget self-actualization you're just not going to be
able to do some of this stuff you want to
do some sort of astral projection and you're eating a
[ __ ] diet no it's not going to work
you want to what you want to meditate you want
to do yoga this [ __ ] is not going
to work for you given the diet that you eat
you see it's just not going to work it's all
just going to be theory for you you're not going
to have enough energy to sit up and do the
stuff you need to do which of course leads us
to the gym physical exercise as another technique and hatha
yoga hatha yoga here is just the kind of yoga
that you see in Western gym classes the physical poses
that can be great for your physical body can release
some energy blockages and so forth so that's good there's
also of course the real yoga old-school yoga by which
I mean pranayama Kundalini Yoga basically its various exercises specific
very specific exercises for ways of breathing and body postures
and positions and mudras and mantras that's used to send
energy up your spine to purify the chakras or energy
centers in your body and then that can lead to
awakenings that can lead to all sorts of physical healing
a lot of psychological baggage can be released through this
sort of yoga so this Kundalini Yoga can be a
very powerful technique which leads us to breathing you need
to learn how to breathe properly you probably think there's
not much to breathing properly because you're always breathing but
actually your breathing is very shallow it's very poor there
are so many breathing exercises that I want to share
with you that can just utterly transform how you feel
not just in your body but they'll actually trap form
the way you think as well because your breathing is
critical to your physical well-being your energy and vitality and
also to your thinking process to your psyche it's all
interconnected and we're not taught in the West how to
breathe properly nobody teaches you this in school another method
for you is holotropic breathwork that's a very specific shamanic
deep breathing technique which can lead to mystical and psychedelic
like experiences and can release tons of emotional baggage that's
something that I'll talk about more in the future but
the very powerful technique another technique for you is body
work energy work and reichian therapy which is not to
be confused with Reiki Reiki is different from Reiki and
therapy but what this is about is this is about
doing work on your physical body these can be special
body exercises special breathing exercises that you do physically which
release there is blockages because personal development is not just
something you do mentally in your head but also a
lot of it is residing in your body especially the
interface between your your body and your emotions that is
largely physical and you can do years of talk therapy
but not get at that stuff so that's where these
exercises can be very powerful another method for you is
developing body awareness just awareness of what your body is
how it moves and how you hold yourself a lot
of people have very poor posture they have a stress
and tension that they carry around in their back lower
back upper back shoulders from which you have all sorts
of problems you can have physical diseases and ailments you
have limitations with your energy you can have thyroid processes
there's so many different problems that come from lack of
proper body awareness and how you hold your body and
I have a book on my book list that specifically
deals with just becoming more aware of your body that
might seem so basic but actually because it is so
basic you aren't doing it you're not actually aware of
your body and that leads to a lot of problems
in your life you're not even aware of yet another
method I have for you and this one is especially
important for newbies is cleaning up your information intake by
which I mean eliminating television phone internet YouTube stupid comedy
shows news politics blogs gossip tabloids garbage music that you
listen to all of this stuff is going straight into
your mind and it's the most low consciousness lowbrow disempowering
and negative crap and extry it's extremely addictive and it
pushes all of your low consciousness base buttons in your
mind you have to stop this [ __ ] cut
it out cold turkey most people these days are so
addicted to this that they don't have time in their
life for any self-actualization work at all they can't even
pick up a book and read it for 30 minutes
because they're so addicted to television or to the internet
or to their phone I was a very important aspect
of my life is cleaning up my information intake without
that I simply could not be doing what I'm doing
right now actualized or could not exist because otherwise I
would be playing so many video games all day next
which is closely related to this is eliminating hard addictions
by hard addictions I mean things like junk food drugs
coffee alcohol smoking shopping pornography video games many people don't
even consider some of these things hard addictions people eat
junk food or video play video games they don't even
think of that as a hard addiction well I categorize
that at the heart addiction and there's a lot more
of them I have a whole episode called overcoming addictions
which talks about that overcoming addictions is very important for
newbies because if you're doing all this you have no
time you're completely distracted from any higher any kind of
higher consciousness work because look you're just bouncing like a
pinball from junk food to drugs to coffee to alcohol
to smoking to shopping to pornography to video games and
you're just doing this every single day every single week
of your life there's no room in there there's no
possibility for a meditation practice there's no possibility for yoga
there's no possibility for reading books you know there's no
possibility for going to a seminar because when you're addicted
to all this stuff a seminar or meditation looks so
boring to you that it's just impossible to do it
see you're completely overstimulated this needs to stop and that
will probably take you years to cut out all these
terrible addictions but those are just the hard addictions the
second point and method under addictions is the subtle addictions
and these are in many ways even more challenging the
hard addictions because these addictions are so subtle and so
socially acceptable and they're so sneaky and tricky that you
don't even know you're doing them and even once you
realize you're doing them you don't even know how to
begin to stop doing them so what are some examples
of soft addictions theorizing judging chasing success chasing love chasing
validation perfectionism being right all the time morality arguing and
debating criticizing and the list goes on and on I'll
shoot a video soon in the future about dealing with
subtle addictions but this stuff is very tricky and it's
very important that you stop doing these things because all
these things are holding you back from self actualize it
another method for you is getting more life experiences whether
that's through travel going out being in nature camping living
in different City interacting with new interesting people having deeper
conversations with strangers you know because you need more source
material to see the complexity and nuance in life to
see all the different options that are available for you
most people because they don't do any of these things
they don't have a lot of life experience they can't
get motivated to really live a rich life they're just
sitting playing video games all day and drinking off to
porn because they haven't seen how much richness and amazing
stuff there is out there to do and what some
amazing people are out there doing another method for you
is building socialization skills and dating skills this is something
that I've spent a couple of years really hardcore doing
in my life because I've had terrible socialization skills deeply
introverted fearful of people anxious around people social anxiety so
all this stuff and terrible with women terrible with Attraction
terrible it's sex so all this stuff required a lot
of effort and unworked for me and there's a lot
of theory available online about how to learn to socialize
and how to learn to date another method for you
is finding healthy forms of relaxation and entertainment that's tricky
because almost all forms of relaxation entertainment that you know
are these highly toxic kinds that I've mentioned already up
above which are addictions really so finding healthy ways to
do that whether it's some kind of sport or being
out in nature or meditation or whatever that is for
you that's important another method is just getting your affairs
in order a lot of people are living such a
disheveled lifestyle they're disorganized dirty they have bills to pay
they have obligations to their family to the work to
their boss you know that it's just like you have
all your affairs old tax returns that aren't finished and
it's like you have all this [ __ ] that
is just like weighing you down and not giving you
any space no emotional space no mental space nor enough
time to focus on inner growth so you need to
handle those affairs set up automatic systems so that those
Affairs don't keep nagging you in the future for example
with bills set up automatic bill payments so that you're
not worrying about paying your bills every single month that
frees up a lot of mental energy and time which
you can then use to grow yourself rather than worrying
and running to the post office mailing checks and all
this kind of crap just complete waste get that [
__ ] automated and not just your bills but try
to automate everything like that that you can in your
life so the logistics of your life are very clean
and run very smoothly which brings us to the next
point of minimizing your lifestyle I have a whole episode
called lifestyle minimalism which talks about this the problem again
is that you don't have enough time in your life
just to sit and to do nothing your calendar is
way too full you're doing way too much stuff at
work with your kids with your friends just like constantly
doing stuff all the time your calendar needs to be
mostly open with nothing to do but just sit on
your couch to reflect to contemplate just to soak in
life the very mundane aspects of life that you're running
away from with all this activity another method for you
is finding a quality life coach or therapist and working
with them one on one especially if you make over
$50,000 a year it makes sense for you to work
with a life coach or a therapist if you're very
young if you're a teenager if you're still in your
very early 20s if you make less than $50,000 a
year it doesn't really make sense for you to to
work with the life culture a therapist because it's just
going to be too expensive and not worthwhile but if
you make a good amount of money it's a really
good investment they can really help you to figure out
your sticking points and the last method that I'll give
you is neurofeedback training this is a new technology relatively
speaking and I haven't talked about it before but I
will in the future I'm really excited about the potential
of this technology because it can be used to cure
a lot of very serious stuff from depression to anxiety
to phobias to HD ADHD OCD and other stuff like
that anger issues migraines there's a lot of stuff that
it can potentially cure and also can be used to
to meditate very effectively so that's something I've been experimenting
with and I'll be sharing soon with you in the
in the future what neurofeedback basically is that you actually
take electrodes attached them to your head physically and then
you do various training routines that train your brain to
fire in the right ways and to synchronize various portions
of your brain which is different by the way from
binaural beats so if you listen to some of those
binaural beat programs those can also be effective but they
are nowhere near as effective as true neurofeedback training so
I'll talk about that in future and that does it
that's the list over 40 different techniques here now admittedly
I just glossed over them and you're probably wondering Ali
Oh tell me how to do one of the how
do I do yoga how do I begin to do
neurofeedback training how do I begin to do shadow work
where do I start you start with just research don't
expect any one person to tell you how to do
all of these techniques this is a very big challenge
here right we're talking about an extremely large domain self-actualization
or personal development in the way that I think of
it encompasses so much stuff that I have yet to
meet a person even a deeply enlightened master who knows
even a quarter of the stuff that I was talking
about you're going to need to go to experts Hut
for all these different things to really learn about them
properly and and I don't know all this stuff either
you know I'm always doing else while always doing research
and I'm always releasing new content I'm always exploring new
stuff because that's basically what I'm doing is I am
going through my life researching this stuff the stuff that
I need in order to grow to my full potential
so you're probably wondering well where do I start how
do I start to self-actualize yes there's research but then
still where do I start let me give you a
simple little formula if you're totally new to this the
way that you start is just by sitting down locking
out a couple hours of time with a journal and
the first thing you want to do is just to
make an assessment of your life where are you where
have you been where are you going where do you
want to go consider your options what's available to you
how much money do you have how much time do
you have what's holding you back what are your biggest
fears and sticking points what do you really want out
of life what if you tried that hasn't worked what
have you tried that has worked and so forth and
really deeply think about this especially you need to get
clear about what you really want out of life what
is your vision for your life what are you trying
to construct if you have no vision you're lost and
then start making a plan about how to get to
what you really want and do this seriously like this
is the most important activity in your life not just
a sign little tangent and then keep returning to your
plan on a daily basis and even if you're not
working on your plan actively like let's say your plan
is to quit your job and to find your life
purpose okay that's great but you're probably not going to
do that right now because you need to hold down
your current job and you need to figure it figure
stuff out it's going to take months for that to
to really work so you got to keep returning to
your plan though and looking at over strategizing thinking about
it exploring various options start doing the research and then
that's basically how you start and then you can take
all these different techniques that I have and then it's
pretty easy to see that oh hey you know if
my plan is that I want a new career well
maybe I should go to a career seminar okay or
maybe I should do the life purpose course okay and
if your plan is that you want to pursue enlightenment
and become more conscious okay well then that means you
got to read some books about that you got to
go to some seminars you got to practice the meditation
techniques build your concentration practice you know all that sort
of stuff and this isn't rocket science it's pretty common-sense
stuff let me tell you for newbies what I think
are the five the five most important things the most
important is to have a juicy vision you need to
have a compelling positive long term reason for what you
want to create with your life what is your life
about and that starts from really recognizing it you're going
to be dead soon and this is your one and
only life so what do you want to use it
towards what do you want to accomplish what does your
highest potential look like and to get really clear about
that vision and to really drill it into your mind
program it in there because otherwise you're simply not going
to be able to motivate yourself to stop all your
addictions quit eating junk food quit watching TV quit playing
video games start meditating how are you going to do
this stuff if you have no long-term compelling vision you
cannot accomplish these things through negative motivation just because you
want to avoid some bad stuff in your life it's
never going to work that way and if you want
to know how to build a juicy vision that's what
my life purpose course is for the second thing that's
very important for newbies is theory lots and lots and
lots of theory hundreds thousands of hours of theory because
you do not know what is right to pursue in
life unless you've done all this theory you don't know
what the options are for how to pursue the right
things either because you haven't studied enough theory and you
don't know any of the traps the many many many
traps that you will fall into if you just try
to do this by the seat of your pants without
the right theory I'm talking about thousands of hours of
theory to help you with that that's why I have
my book list it has thousands of hours of books
data you can read but not just books you also
want audio programs courses seminars and so forth the theory
is critical like I said before you can do surgery
on someone unless you really understand theoretically all the aspects
related to surgery that's why doctors spend eight years learning
how to become doctors the third thing is removing addictions
and distractions this is super super important for newbies I
think that this is one of the biggest things that
holds newbies back so identify what those are for you
some of them you may not even consider addictions or
distractions yet that's going to take consciousness for you to
realize that so get to work and start cutting those
out because they're holding you back so much fourthly is
installing some small healthy habits meditation cleaning up your diet
daily learning every single day learning something new as far
as theory goes and then a cup doing a couple
of retreats a year if you could just put those
pieces right there into place in your life you're going
to be on a really nice trajectory with this work
and then fifthly I'll say the most important thing for
newbies is glimpsing nan a go at consciousness this is
actually not a newbie thing it's a rather advanced thing
but I think it's so important for newbies because once
you get a taste of not a go of consciousness
a whole new world will open up for you you
will have a much greater deeper vision for why you're
doing self-actualization before you witness not to go consciousness your
self-actualization is going to be very shallow and materialistic it's
going to be all about getting a girlfriend or finding
a spouse or having a good relationship or being successful
or having a bunch of money but that's really just
the tip of the iceberg of self-actualization getting a glimpse
of not ego consciousness whether you do that through meditation
or through yoga or through a breathing exercise or through
psychedelics when you get first real juicy glimpse of it
then you see the light and at that point you
understand that this is this is the most important thing
in your life and this becomes not just a side
hobby this becomes everything that your life is about and
then you become real serious about it and then you
start to grow in leaps and bounds so lastly let
me just give you a couple of pointers about how
this process works this is a lifelong process this is
not something that you do for a month or for
a year to fix one problem in your life probably
the biggest trap that newbie states with self actualization is
that they rush it and they try to do too
much too fast and then what happens that they get
disgusted disappointed they experience an ego backlash they fall back
even worse than they were before they they throw their
hands up and they say look all that self actualization
[ __ ] obviously doesn't work it's just [ __
] it's all new-age Pollyanna ideas and theory and then
they just go back to living their old kind of
life to avoid that what you do is you need
to think long term you have a long term vision
5 10 20 years into the future you need to
make changes in your life with baby steps baby steps
usually means change one thing at a time if you're
working on meditation do that for a month or two
or three and then when you get some success move
on to the next thing maybe your diet and do
that for a month or two or three and then
move on to the next thing and through baby steps
that's going to work you to focus on consistency rather
than quantity of result what's most important is consistency your
quantity of results especially at the beginning the first year
or two it's not going to be super great you
need to have the foresight to see that this is
a long term investment that you're building in yourself and
that you need to build the foundation of the skyscraper
before you can erect the actual skyscraper that means you
have realistic expectations for this process and not get seduced
by any kind of marketing material out there that's promising
you magic pill solutions magic enlightenment magic business in a
box ideas magic marketing schemes magic get Rick's get-rich-quick schemes
magic solutions to your depression or to your addictions there
are no magic pills in this work except for maybe
five Meo DMT which truly is a magic pill but
that's a matter so yeah that's that's the biggest trap
that you're gonna fall into it's just this problem of
consistency and this problem trying to get too much done
too fast you got to remember that the rewards of
this work are so incredible that you don't need a
lot of result a little bit of result every single
month every single year dunk consistently will produce a more
amazing life than you ever imagined possible in five or
ten years that sounds bad for you you don't want
to wait that long well that's one of the things
you can have to work on is that you you
have been imprinted with all sorts of unrealistic expectations by
our culture and a marketing system and lastly and perhaps
most importantly is you have now heard and seen the
path this is what your life is about if you
watch my high-level big-picture intro to the self-actualization and you
watch this episode here you've seen the path you now
know what it looks like from a big picture level
and sort of a medium picture level the biggest danger
now is that you forget this path and that tomorrow
you wake up and you go back to your old
routine and you make no changes you make no commitments
you make no you just go back back into your
old habits and you forget about this entire thing that's
the biggest danger so now what you need to do
is you need to keep this in your mind you
need to write this down put some sticky notes on
your bathroom here whatever to remind yourself that you've found
the path and then now all that needs to happen
you just start to take your first step your second
step your third step and follow through on this path
and remember that the first two years is the hardest
because your results are going to be small your follow-through
is going to be shaky and you're going to be
very tempted to fall back into your old routines and
that's something you have to resist all right that's self
