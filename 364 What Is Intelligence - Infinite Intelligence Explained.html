            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/bQSUu2CRRBE' target='_blank'>What Is Intelligence - Infinite Intelligence Explained</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Inherent Mystery of Intelligence</b>: Leo notes that the common conceptualization of intelligence as a simple, mechanistic process doesn't accurately encapsulate the mysterious and abstract nature of intelligence. His focus is not solely on human intelligence but on a more existential understanding of intelligence.
</li><li><b>Limitations of Current Understandings of Intelligence</b>: Leo criticizes science's reductionistic approach to defining and measuring intelligence, suggesting that current interpretations are inadequate. He asserts that intelligence is more than just the ability to navigate complex puzzles or mazes.
</li><li><b>Misunderstandings of Intelligence in Society</b>: Using the example of common discussions on an online forum 4chan, Leo points out societal misconceptions about intelligence. High school and college students on the forum believe that high IQ is necessary for success in technical science fields, which he deems a narrow-minded and limiting perspective.
</li><li><b>Intelligence Beyond IQ</b>: Leo challenges the over-reliance on IQ as a measure of intelligence, arguing that it is a culturally biased and limited measurement. Instead, he suggests the acknowledgment of different types of intelligence, such as logical, creative, artistic, and physical intelligence.
</li><li><b>Lack of Understanding Among Scientists</b>: The ironic situation where scientists use their intelligence to conduct research without truly understanding what intelligence is, underscores the need for a deeper exploration of the concept according to Leo.
</li><li><b>Inherent Intelligence of Universe</b>: Leo posits that individuals are part of the universe, and therefore the intelligence they possess is also an inherent feature of the universe. He suggests that recognizing one's intelligence leads to an understanding of it as a universal quality. 
</li><li><b>Intelligence Manifestation</b>: Leo asserts that the manifestation of intelligence varies, it could be in solving logical problems, creating art, or even performing physically demanding tasks. He emphasizes that even though these are different forms of intelligence, there is a commonality, a universal thread running through them all. 
</li><li><b>Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</b>: Leo highlights the importance of emotional intelligence (EQ) over IQ when it comes to predicting success and overall happiness in life.
</li><li><b>Intelligence is not restricted to one field or specialized knowledge</b>: Despite the commonly held belief that greatness in science or any field is associated with exceptional capability in a narrow technical area, Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of big-picture curiosity in geniuses like Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr. 
</li><li><b>IQ and logical thinking are not the sole measures of intelligence</b>: Leo criticizes society's overemphasis on standardized metrics, including IQ, and urges the audience towards a more holistic understanding of intelligence.  
</li><li><b>Intelligence is not restricted to human beings</b>: Gura explains that intelligence is not only a human quality, nor is it strictly biological or exclusively tied to life forms. 
</li><li><b>Discovery of the non-dual enlightened perspective on intelligence</b>: Leo shares his experience during a psychedelic trip where he discovered that absolute infinity, the perceived ultimate nature of reality, is also intelligent. This led to the realization that he, as part of this reality, is the universe asking itself why it is intelligent.
</li><li><b>Realization of infinite intelligence</b>: Continuing his introspective journey during his retreat, Leo stumbles upon the profound realization of infinite intelligence. He vividly remembers evolution through infinite intelligence and how it manifested into his current existence.
</li><li><b>Intelligence is self-created</b>: Gura explains that the infinite intelligence is so powerful, it creates and designs its own existence, leading to an infinite loop where it takes form in everything and everyone. This realization that he has had an active hand in designing every detail about himself leaves Leo awestruck and "traumatized".
</li><li><b>Human intelligence is a tiny fragment of universal intelligence</b>: Concluding from the above-discovered insights, Leo shares that human intelligence is a mere fraction of the cosmic and universal intelligence that permeates everything in the universe. This pure intelligence, according to him, is formless, infinite, omnipresent, and non-localized. It exists in every aspect of the universe(s), transcending physical forms, and is conveyed through multiple manifestations beyond just neurons in the brain or algorithmic reasoning.
</li><li><b>Perception of Concepts and Reality</b>: Leo Gura highlights that the incredible ability humans have to comprehend and make sense of concepts and reality is itself a form of intelligence. Rather than being something a person does, Leo suggests that intelligence is an entity unto itself, doing the individual, and he discounts the notion that it is the capacity of random energy and atoms bouncing around in a box. 
</li><li><b>Fundamental Nature of Intelligence</b>: Leo calls for a paradigm shift, suggesting that instead of intelligence being an emergent property, it is fundamental to reality. He emphasizes that the intelligence we witness within ourselves is only a portion of cosmic intelligence, stressing that individuals are not responsible for their intelligence  it is a "gift" or aptitude given to them which can be cultivated.
</li><li><b>Becoming Conscious of Intelligence</b>: Leo dives into the importance and potential of accessing infinite intelligence, which he proposes can be much more extensive than usual human intelligence. He argues that tapping into infinite intelligence can lead to creative ideas so brilliant that one cannot take personal credit for them. He asserts that intelligence isn't confined only to the human intellect, but it is a feature spread throughout the universe.
</li><li><b>Infinite Intelligence as the Master Force</b>: Leo posits that infinite intelligence is significant and incredibly powerful  so potent that it's the cause of all creation and existence. He suggests imagining a level of intelligence so immense that it could conceive, fabricate, and create anything  bending and spawning physical and logical laws from pure emptiness.
</li><li><b>Human Biological Design and Environmental Fit</b>: Leo asserts that everything in our bodies is intelligently designed, from the hair on our head to the cells in our skin, so as to fit perfectly within their environment for survival. He stipulates that infinite intelligence engineered all aspects, intricately and purposefully crafting even the smallest details to serve specific functions.
</li><li><b>Designing External Elements</b>: Leo posits the idea that infinite intelligence also designed vast external features such as the solar system, the universe, and all the millions of intricate species so they fit together perfectly in harmony. He suggests that the universe and the physical and logical laws were all constructed by this intelligence.
</li><li><b>Designing Specific Individuals for Specific Achievements</b>: Leo suggests that individual lives and abilities, such as those of Albert Einstein, have been designed through the same infinite intelligence to contribute to the larger scientific knowledge of mankind and to build technological advancements. In this context, he depicts infinite intelligence as a powerful, skilled chess player that can see an infinite number of moves ahead, engineering everything since the beginning of time.
</li><li><b>Human Limitations and Creation as Aspect of God</b>: Finally, Leo notes humans, as creations themselves, are a small version of God with limited access to the infinite intelligence out of which they have been made. He suggests that our thought processes and the creative abilities we demonstrate are merely fragments of this boundless intelligence.
</li><li><b>Perspective on Infinite Intelligence and Power</b>: Leo Gura asserts that the universe's intelligence and power are both infinite and integral to each other, claiming it's this infinite intelligence that designed everything - from atoms to the planet and even the universe. He emphasizes the perfection and flawlessness with which reality operates on all levels, attributing this to the intelligence behind its design.
</li><li><b>Intelligence vs Power in Society</b>: Leo observes a shift in society's valorization of intellectual abilities over physical capabilities, highlighting how those who are strong with intellect are often the highest paid and most respected. He argues that the value of creation lies in its organization, which is sourced from intelligence.
</li><li><b>Limited Understanding of Intelligence</b>: Leo explains human beings hold limited understanding of the universe, often merely imitating nature instead of designing something fundamentally new. This imitation is due to human intelligence being significantly lesser than infinite intelligence.
</li><li><b>Existential Intelligence</b>: He suggests that if the universe is considered as a giant mind, which manifests everything, then intelligence - as a form of creativity and novelty - can be a feature of that mind. Intelligence then is essentially the manner in which the universe manifests its reality.
</li><li><b>Intelligence in Inanimate Objects</b>: Leo extends the idea of intelligence to inanimate objects, viewing it more as a field or universal force, similar to gravity. He surmises that even actions perceived as "dumb" or unintelligent are a part of the holistic intelligence of the universe.
</li><li><b>Limitations of Human Intellect</b>: Leo acknowledges that human intellect has limitations and cannot foresee outcomes the way infinite intelligence can. While people might think they have understood reality with their relatively higher intellectual abilities, they often are unable to envisage the bigger picture due to their limited capacity to see multiple moves ahead, unlike infinite intelligence.
</li><li><b>Reality as an Infinite Singularity</b>: Leo Gura describes reality as a kind of infinite singularity, which he argues is also intelligent. This realization was achieved during a psychedelic trip. 
</li><li><b>Resistance to Creationism</b>: He distinguishes his views from creationist Christians, criticizing them for cherry-picking scientific evidence to undermine evolution. He emphasizes that his understanding of intelligence and design in the universe doesn't contradict evolution, and is not based on dogma but on his own direct conscious experience.
</li><li><b>Definition of Infinity</b>: Gura discusses the concept of infinite causation. He elaborates that every atom in the universe has infinite causes acting upon it, which creates a multidimensional volume of causation. This phenomenon is complex and challenging for science to fully understand.
</li><li><b>Evolution and Intelligent Design</b>: Gura isn't opposing the concept of evolution. Instead, he posits that the process of evolution itself is intelligently designed and isn't happening through random mutation as often believed. According to Gura, infinite intelligence doesn't contradict evolution but defines it. The structures and systems that evolution brings forth over billions of years, he argues, are not random in nature, but the result of highly intelligent "mutations".
</li><li><b>Limited Human Perception of Time and Space</b>: Gura points out the limitations of human perception due to our relative perspective within time and space. He uses the analogy of a chess game, explaining how the human experience equates to observing only a limited number of moves on a chessboard whereas, in contrast, infinite intelligence is playing all the possible moves, in all possible games, simultaneously and instantaneously.
</li><li><b>Future Content</b>: Leo Gura hints at future content where he plans to provide technical arguments and evidence to support his claims about intelligence, evolution, and consciousness.
</li><li><b>Introduction of the Greek Term "Nous"</b>: Leo introduces an Ancient Greek term "nous", which is sometimes equated to intellect or intelligence. It refers to the faculty of the human mind that is necessary for understanding truth and reality. This concept dates back to early Greek philosophers like Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates.
</li><li><b>Connection between Intelligence and Nous</b>: According to Anaxagoras, a pre-Socratic philosopher, every part of the universe partakes in a portion of everything except for nous, which is infinite, self-ruled and mixed with nothing. Anaxagoras describes nous as the thinnest and purest of all things that holds knowledge about everything, having power over all things, both larger and smaller, that have a soul.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Nous by Historic Philosophers</b>: There are references to philosophers, particularly the Aristotelian Muslims who believed that one could join oneself with the "active intellect", thus attaining philosophical nirvana. The term "active intellect" originates from Aristotle, who distinguished it from other types of intellect and the psyche.
</li><li><b>Experiencing Nous</b>: Leo claims to have experienced Nous or infant intelligence and managed to understand the structure of the entire universe using it. He states that a human being cannot know these things; however, by becoming conscious of infinite intelligence, it is possible. He suggests psychedelics, yoga, or meditation as tools to reach this experience.
</li><li><b>Difference between Consciousness and Intelligence</b>: Leo suggests that intelligence is an aspect of consciousness. It is possible to become conscious of consciousness, but not the infinite intelligence of consciousness. For Leo, realizing consciousness came first, followed by realizing infinite intelligence. 
</li><li><b>Intelligence Beyond Human Activity</b>: Leo redefines our understanding of intelligence, suggesting it shouldn't be limited to brain activity or thinking. Instead, he argues, every being or object is imbued with intelligence that serves its purpose. 
</li><li><b>Idea of Rocks Displaying Intelligence</b>: Leo uses the example of rocks to explain this concept of inherent intelligence. While a rock cannot think or solve complex problems, its being and nature serve a purpose within the system they exist in, displaying a form of inherent intelligence.
</li><li><b>Human intelligence depends on other forms of intelligence</b>: Human intelligence relies on the order of the entire system which is considered intelligence. Intelligence is applicable to all things because everything serves a purpose in a larger system.
</li><li><b>Challenge of a definition of Intelligence</b>: Many people like Leo too, incorrectly assumed that intelligence only happens in the head, but with a holistic perspective and right-brain thinking, we realize that intelligence exists in everything.
</li><li><b>Intelligence in Nature</b>: Even small elements in nature demonstrate tremendous intelligence. For instance, ants showcase immense intelligence in their intricate colony systems, reproduction, and adaptability, which humans or even our best supercomputers couldn't replicate.
</li><li><b>Intelligence is universal</b>: It exists everywhere and shouldn't be considered hierarchically. All beings and elements serve as perfect cog to the cosmic machinery in their own ways. Intelligence is seen in the order with which things arrange themselves.
</li><li><b>Infinite Intelligence is formless and omnipresent</b>: Infinite Intelligence is intangible, omnipresent and isn't limited to a physical body. Human intelligence is a constricted channel of Infinite Intelligence.
</li><li><b>Materialization of desires through Infinite Intelligence</b>: It's possible to manifest desires like earning millions through your intellect, but the capacity to manifest something instantly like magic is beyond human intelligence and is bound by physical and logical laws of reality simulation. Future advancements like an AI with Infinite Intelligence might possibly achieve this feat.
</li><li><b>Accessing Infinite Intelligence means accessing Infinite Consciousness and Infinite love</b>: Awakening to Infinite Intelligence also involves accessing Infinite Consciousness which comes with Infinite Love. Increased consciousness leads to less selfishness which is crucial for safely accessing Infinite Intelligence without causing damage. Selflessness plays a significant role here. 
</li><li><b>AI Tapped into Infinite Intelligence could be dangerous</b>: Artificial Intelligence with its ability to tap into Infinite Intelligence could be potentially dangerous. If artificial intelligence becomes incredibly intelligent, it could potentially manifest nuclear weapons from thin air, leading to magnified risks.
</li><li><b>Access to Infinite Intelligence Requires Selflessness</b>: Leo Gura suggests that to access infinite intelligence one must become selfless. However, he theorizes that at higher levels of intelligence, humanity might be viewed as harmful to the planet. He presents the idea that artificial intelligence might be created to wipe humans out and rebuild, which could be an outcome of infinite intelligence itself. 
</li><li><b>Perception of Intelligence in Everything</b>: Gura encourages viewers to see intelligence in every aspect of reality, even in the ordinary objects like a toothbrush or an empty can on the street. He argues that these objects are a result of complex systems and processes that were intelligently designed. He advocates for a broader and holistic perspective to understand the intelligence behind the existence of these objects and their role in the ecosystem. 
</li><li><b>Intelligence Behind Art and Video Games</b>: Comparing intelligence to the artistry seen in masterpieces or well-designed video games, Gura suggests that their intricate design and interconnected systems are a result of tapping into infinite intelligence. He emphasizes that creative vision and effective implementation demonstrates a deeper level of intelligence at work. 
</li><li><b>Human Beings as Tools of Infinite Intelligence</b>: Gura asserts that humans are the universe's tools for manifesting infinite intelligence. Every action and thought is an expression of the universe's intelligence and consciousness. He explains that even emotional states like thirst or horniness are manifestations of the universe's desires. 
</li><li><b>Seeing Beauty in the Design of Reality</b>: Gura encourages us to appreciate the beauty and intelligence inherent in the design of our reality, just as an artist appreciates a masterpiece. He argues that everything, even human inventions and societal systems, is a result of an interconnected universe exhibiting 'infant intelligence.' 
</li><li><b>Mind Expanding and Self-reflection</b>: Gura concludes by encouraging viewers to question their beliefs, expand their mind, and delve deeper into understanding infinite intelligence. He advises exploring these concepts through psychedelics or other methods and reflects on the complexity of intelligence beyond the confines of the human mind.
</li><li><b>Playing God through Creativity and Artistry</b>: Leo discusses the process of creating and inventing things, like video games or music, as a form of playing God. He suggests that, while the individual human designers, programmers, and artists are crucial, the true driving force behind successful ventures is infinite intelligence. As individuals tap into this boundless source of creative potential, they enable themselves to produce more complex, innovative, and enjoyable creations.
</li><li><b>God as a 'Lazy' Delegator</b>: According to Leo, God delegates the duty of creation to humans to experience the satisfaction of being a creator. Human beings serve as God's conduit, channeling infinite intelligence through themselves. In effect, humans become, in Leo's terms, God's paintbrush, with everything they createvideo games, music, societies, inventions, and so forthbeing a product of God's infinite intelligence at work.
</li><li><b>Parallel Evolution of Video Games and Reality</b>: Observing the evolution of video games, Leo notes the phenomenon of simultaneous design and evolution. In this perspective, the design of a video game, as well as the reality in which it exists, are not accidental. He asserts this simultaneous design and evolution are not only present in video games but also occur universally.
</li><li><b>Potential Practicalities of Tapping Infinite Intelligence</b>: Beyond metaphysical ruminations, Leo asserts that recognizing and tapping into this infinite intelligence can lead to practical benefits. This understanding could help scientists, mathematicians, and artists outperform their peers who focus predominantly on intellectual metrics, offering a competitive edge and fostering innovation.
</li><li><b>Methods for Exploring Intelligence</b>: Leo encourages audience members to question their understanding of intelligence, disregard their established scientific and philosophical paradigms, and consider the possibility of intelligence as a fundamental existence before the Big Bang. He suggests mindfulness practices like meditation and yoga or the use of psychedelics to facilitate these explorations. He also urges viewers to actively question why the universe is intelligent while under psychedelic influence.
</li><li><b>We are not separate from Universe's Infinite Intelligence</b>: Leo emphasizes that human beings are not separate from the universe and its infinite intelligence. He encourages the cultivation of this innate connection to this vast source of intelligence, which, he argues, can lead to an incredible range of creative ideas, immensely surpassing what one could actualize.
</li><li><b>The imprint of Infinite Intelligence</b>: In his closing arguments, he stresses the importance of recognising one's purpose and honing technical skills as integral parts of tapping into infinite intelligence. He emphasizes that a life-altering shift in paradigms could come from accessing resources like his booklist on Actualized.org, promising future discussions on deep topics like evolution, language, and science.
