hey there this is leo founder of actualized org and
stick with me here because what I'm about to tell
you in this video is going to change your life
have you ever been to a movie or seen a
movie maybe something like Braveheart or Troy or 300 one
of those epic dramas that at the end of it
it literally chokes you up or you get tears in
your eyes why does that happen what I would say
is the reason that happens is because you see the
characters in that movie living for something and fighting for
something that's greater than themselves they have some sort of
mission some sort of purpose some sort of vision and
some sort of ideals that they need to fight for
whether it's love or its freedom or anything like that
and when we see that and we see those characters
fighting for it and we see those characters giving their
all going full out and not holding back we reflect
on that and we see that our own potential is
being squandered we see ourselves not living up to our
full potential like the characters on the screen and that
makes us literally cry life is short I hope you
realize that one of the things that I was blessed
with I don't think that I'm different than anybody else
that I'm cut from a different cloth but one of
the gifts that I've been blessed with is that I've
always understood that life is short and then we've got
this one chance and that it's worth it to try
to make something big out of it it's worth it
to live big and not small and that to me
what I really want out of life is I want
everything I want excitement I want engagement I want fulfillment
and I don't want to just hum along and be
mediocre and be comfortable and it really kills me because
I have so many ideas for what I want to
create in life so many visions and these visions there
and these ideas they're bigger than myself and I can
literally make myself cry because I see the potential that
I have in the potential that I'm leaving on the
table and I'm not stepping into that I'm not realizing
and it's really been a struggle for me these last
five years trying to figure out what my purpose is
in life how do I get myself engaged with it
again and how do I stay on track because that
feeling I don't know if you felt this but you've
probably gotten a glimpse of this that feeling of pride
that you get when you set a vision for yourself
something big something Noble and then you actually go out
there and achieve it and you work really hard you
struggle through the challenges you build yourself up you learn
new skills you develop yourself you challenge yourself emotionally and
in every possible way physically but then you finally achieve
it you realize that vision and then you see the
smile that that effect puts on other people so whether
it was a business that you were starting or some
charity work that you were doing or raising your family
or whatever seeing the smile of you putting your best
into it on other people's faces that is the best
feeling in the world and that pride that you get
that you knew that you had to tap into your
full potential to get there you knew that that vision
when you came up with it was bigger than your
current capabilities you didn't have the skills you have the
knowledge you didn't have the resources you didn't have the
inner psychology the mindsets and beliefs you needed but something
in that vision was so compelling that you just said
you know what screw it I'm gonna go for it
I'm gonna achieve it I'm gonna try and then when
you did and you finally got it you reflect back
on everything that you persevered through that was the best
moment of your life for me there have been cases
in my life where I've had that numerous cases but
also inconsistent a lot of times it was a year
of that and then a year off or it was
a week of that and then months nothing just humming
along life being mediocre so if you've ever experienced that
then you've probably been frustrated and you've probably also wondered
how do you make that more consistent how do you
stay on track with that kind of purpose or maybe
you're the kind of person that doesn't really know what
they want out of life right now and but you
you just have a sense that there's more to life
than what you've been getting out of it maybe you
already have a comfortable job maybe you already have a
good relationship maybe you're already happy with your health but
you know also that there's more that there's more to
be had you don't have that kind of excitement that
you see other people's having you don't have the kind
of fulfillment that you see other people having and you
know that you have dreams you have grander visions for
yourself the kind of impact that you want to make
in the world but you haven't really figured out how
to go out there and do it for whatever reason
maybe it's because you literally don't know what the next
step is or maybe it's because you've been trying at
it and you've been struggling but you've been self sabotaging
and you've been not getting the kind of results that
you want to get from your efforts so whatever that
is I've been there my own story really starts when
when I was a kid when I was six years
old my parents brought me and my brother to to
the United States from Russia I was born in Russia
and that's where I grew up for six years of
my life and then they brought me to the States
and I remember this very distinctly that those first few
days being in the States were some of the most
vivid memories that I still have seeing the abundance that
is here walking through a grocery store and seeing towering
aisles of produce kind of abundance that he's just taken
for granted nowadays and I take it for granted nowadays
but at that time it was something special to me
because I came from a place where that didn't exist
and I specifically remember my parents taking us to Toys
R Us a couple days after we came to the
States and they said that we could each have one
toy of our choice I wasted my choice on some
little flimsy paper airplane or a plastic airplane and my
brother he got a gameboy he was he was a
smart one he got a game one I remember looking
to that screen as he was playing it and seeing
the pixels moving around on that screen and just being
so so captivated so enthralled by that that I knew
that that's what I wanted to do I wanted to
create that I wanted to create those pixels and I
wanted to make them move and I wanted to make
games and since I was six years old I knew
that I wanted to be a game designer it's a
long story short eventually after college I ended up getting
landing a good game design job in Boston but the
problem was that I really didn't I wasn't really in
touch enough with myself my own psychology to figure out
how to make that job a success part of the
problem was that I got there and I started feeling
inadequate because I thought that I was this awesome designer
and then when I got there I saw all these
other awesome designers and suddenly that put me my place
and all the sudden I knew that it wasn't talent
that I had to that I had to work off
of it was a it was development I had to
develop myself all of a sudden and that came as
a bit of a shock but then eventually what I
what made me leave that job is the want to
have a certain impact with my career that I just
knew I couldn't have at that company even though it
was one of the best companies in the world I
knew that I had to make the bold choice to
go off on my own and do something myself and
that's when I started my own business but part of
the challenge there was that after I did start my
business I started to lose touch with my initial purpose
because the business that I started was in internet marketing
it wasn't related to games and when I what happened
was that when I made that choice to shift from
games to bit to business to internet marketing is that
I lost touch with that original dryed that I had
and I was no longer passionate and engaged I wasn't
driven by something bigger than myself I was driven mostly
by money at that point it's an external success and
over the next few years I got that external success
and I got all that money and I was more
miserable than ever and so at that point I really
turned to personal development as a success I started reading
books I started listening to lectures I started listening to
seminars and attending trainings and figuring out you know what
is necessary to get this part of life handled because
I wasn't I wasn't satisfied with being mediocre and I
got tired of just earning money being depressed and miserable
all the time because I wasn't passionate about what I
was doing and so I had to struggle through this
idea I had to really struggle through the doubt as
to whether it's possible to even find a life purpose
because that original purpose that I had being a game
designer that came to me unconsciously that came to me
by accident really if I wasn't there that day at
toys-r-us and my brother didn't get that Gameboy perhaps I
would never have wanted to become a designer and so
I figured you know how do I replace that I
through that purpose away I turned my back on it
how do I find a new purpose is that even
possible and so what I did is I spent several
years trying to figure that out and only just a
couple of months ago did I really hone in on
it and I really developed that that drive that I
had again and that kind of drive is just so
amazing if you don't have that in your life frankly
I feel a little bit sorry for you because you're
never gonna feel what life is really about you're never
gonna feel the kind of excitement that you can feel
the kind of pride that you can feel the kind
of impact that you can have on other people see
I want you to start seeing yourself as a creator
I always have seen myself as a creator and not
necessarily as a creative person or an artistic person but
it creates her that means that you're someone who has
a vision for what you want to manifest in the
world and that can happen in any kind of way
that can either be literally through painting and art and
music or it can be by designing great games or
it can be by being an engineer that creates amazing
amazing products are amazing processes or it can be by
being a product designer or creating your own business it
can be starting a charity it can be helping people
with your understanding and your wisdom and your expertise and
figuring out how to translate that knowledge to them so
that it helps their their lives it can be about
raising a great family it can be about having amazing
relationships and contributing everything that you can to that relationship
it can be about helping your friends whatever it is
it's still you creating creating means that you have of
an idea in your mind some sort of vision and
it's compelling enough for you that you're willing to sacrifice
for it and it's something that's gonna make a positive
change in the world it's something that's new right this
is of course the opposite of what a lot of
people do a lot of people do the opposite by
getting a job something that they're comfortable in and just
working at it not really caring about what they're doing
and just kind of humming along and living a comfortable
kind of life you know that's easy to do nowadays
a lot of people actually still struggle even with that
but nowadays that's pretty easy to do you can go
to college you can get a degree you can go
and find a reasonably well-paying job and then you can
find yourself a good spouse and you can find yourself
some good friends and you can get your family situation
relatively well handled and you can get your fitness taken
care of you know how to moderate level and you're
going to be happy life you're going to be comfortable
the challenge though is that you probably also see that
there's more if you settle for a mediocre life then
you also settle for a certain just kind of a
baseline satisfaction but not real excitement are you excited to
actually wake up in the morning if you're not then
something is missing you don't have that purpose you don't
have that drive and I want to tell you that
it's possible to get it don't doubt that it's not
see one of the biggest misconceptions and one of the
biggest things I think that keeps people from pursuing this
path of excellence pursuing this path of purpose and vision
and create creation ship is that they think that people
that are creators are somehow different then than you so
you might be that sitting there and thinking well that's
all well and good but I'm just not that kind
of person I've never been driven I've never been that
motivated I've never been excited to jump out of bed
and the reason that is is not because you're cut
from a different cloth or that I'm different than you
somehow it's just that you haven't found that you yet
and that's what actualized artwork is about is about helping
you unleash your full potential strategies to do that and
figuring out you know what does it take I've spent
really the last five years studying this stuff I'm I'm
on track to process about a hundred thousand dollars worth
of the best books and seminars and video products and
trainings on success psychology human development human potential peak performance
and business and marketing right because all of these areas
were necessary to study for me to build a model
of what it takes to get this handled to get
an exciting kind of life created because it's not just
about getting one piece of your life into place it's
get about getting them all into place and design that
awesome life so that you have an awesome career so
that you have awesome relationships so that you have good
health so that you are free and have the time
and the money to do the things that you want
to do recreationally so you have an awesome lifestyle so
that you're living in a city and a country and
in the house that you kind of want to live
in and you have time to travel and do whatever
else is important for you in your life getting all
of that into place it's critical but it all start
with it all starts with that foundation of being a
creator and contributing something to the world having that kind
of vision and if you're not there yet right now
if you just maybe have kind of a standard 95
job something that just pays the bills you can get
there make your purpose right now to get that exciting
kind of life and then that does mean you'll get
it tomorrow you're gonna have to work for it it
took me five years to really spend a lot of
time working on it I have to read through literally
hundreds of books and talk to experts and go on
some amazing adventures to figure this stuff out and I'm
still working through a lot of it but the idea
here is that I want to plant the seed in
you that this is possible not only is it possible
it's really the the most that you can do with
your life I mean what else are you gonna be
doing with your life are you gonna be watching TV
are you gonna be sitting at home are you gonna
be going to a boring nine-to-five job is that what
you want or do you want something more do you
want to contribute I really challenge you to make your
life big make your to make your life about contribution
to other people and then getting it back in return
so I don't do this out of some altruistic mother
Theresa type of philosophy what I'm what I'm doing here
is actually very selfishly driven I want to feel good
I want feel excited I want to feel engaged I
want to be happy and the reason and the only
way that I found to do that is by creating
to get the kind of financial abundance that I want
the best way to do it is not through some
get-rich-quick scheme it is but by creating it is about
contributing to others because when you contribute to others and
what you're passionate about is gonna come back to you
not in some area fairy way but in a very
tangible way because you're going to be creating the most
value that you can create this is really a strategy
to create a lot of value and to tap into
that strategy you need its happen to your passion so
I talk strategy here and this is really what actually
I don't get about because one of the things by
going through all this self-development literature and success literature all
these seminars and products one of the things that I
found missing was that few products or books out there
give you the biggest picture give you the high-level and
what I found is that it's not about the how
- there's so much how-to information out there in society
nowadays you can go and Google for an article or
a video that will tell you how to do pretty
much anything any skill that you want to learn anything
from playing a guitar to learning to program to building
your own website to starting a business to getting your
marriage back on track to getting your fitness back on
track all of that is out there the problem though
is that we don't utilize those resources and the reason
is that we're not engaged we're not properly motivated we
don't have the big picture understanding of what we're doing
with our lives so for me actualize that our work
is really about giving you the concepts and the strategies
the big picture so that you can be independent minded
and you can be an effective general in your own
life of course we're also going to cover the techniques
and the little tips and the strategies that you can
I mean not strategies but the tactics rather that you
can use to implement this stuff I can give you
a one-two-three checklist that you can go out there and
do tomorrow to really improve some aspect of your life
whatever it is but I also want you to be
an independent thinker and I want you to understand why
you're doing I want you to have the drive so
that when I'm not there whispering in your ear you
are there whispering in your own ear and that takes
an understanding of inner game building the kind of mindsets
that you need to build to be happy in life
because the other thing that I found through my journey
is that external rewards are really not as fulfilling as
we think they are and we know this intuitively but
still we chase after them but here's the thing is
that you can have all the money and you can
have the ripped six-pack and you can have the perfect
spouse and you could have the awesome house and you
can even be doing all the traveling that you want
to do and you're still not going to be happy
and the reason that is is because your inner game
is not going to be dialed in your psychology you
need to have a certain emotional mastery in order to
be happy and successful in life you need to have
a certain self-awareness you need to have a certain appreciation
for knowledge and a certain understanding of how life works
and what it takes to be successful and also kind
of an understanding of your own self and what drives
you because you're different in some level I want to
say that you're the same as everyone else but on
some level you're also unique and different you're the same
in that we're all humans and we're all driven by
certain psychological tendencies of success that are that are easy
to explain and easy to apply and they will apply
across the board it no matter what race you are
what country you're from what social condition of whatever financial
condition you're in or whatever but there's also unique things
about you and the unique parts about you or what
we want to bring forward and what we want to
bring into your creatorship right this is what do you
want to contribute what do you find meaningful and I
really challenge you to find something that's meaningful in your
life you know going back to that that point about
people crying at movies because you see the potential and
you see these characters that are fighting for something that's
bigger than life well I want to challenge you to
have something in your life that you're willing to die
for because if you don't have something in your life
that you're willing to die for and you haven't articulated
that to yourself whatever it is maybe it's your family
maybe it's your job maybe it's your business whatever something
then you're not gonna be engaged you're not going to
be as engaged and you know what the world the
future is going to go to the people that are
most engaged and that figure out how to engage themselves
because the last century was about being a factory worker
and doing what your boss told you to do and
fitting into society and being a cog in the machine
and that was good you know you can get a
steady paycheck doing that and live a relatively comfortable life
but that's not the case anymore nowadays with cheap labor
from overseas from sort of third world countries the future
is not going to be about up being a factory
worker it's about being a creator and it's about taking
your unique talents your unique perspective on life and sharing
that through some sort of vehicle with the world and
then of course setting that up so that you get
value back in return so that maybe you're creating business
out of it that pays for your family and for
you or maybe it's about going to work for an
awesome company that will compensate you fairly for what you're
doing but it's about finding out what it is that
you want to contribute and then contributing that I really
believe that in the next in the 21st century the
next hundred years that this is going to be the
major shift in humanity is that fewer people are going
to be doing mundane jobs that require no creative creative
input no artists no artistic no artistic endeavors to transition
where everybody's going to be doing that and everyone's gonna
be striving for that because first of all that's where
you get your fulfillment from second of all that's where
the most value is generated for other people so if
you want to be wealthy if you want to be
rich counter-intuitively the best way to do that is not
to go after some get-rich-quick scheme it's about taking a
more steady approach understanding yourself and figuring out what kind
of vision is going to be valuable for the world
and getting that vision to also be aligned with you
so it's not about just doing something for the world
that you don't want to do it's the exact opposites
about figuring out what do you want to do the
most that also the world wants and then going out
and figuring out how do I live my life with
all that so here's the thing as I've talked about
before it's very easy for us to be in a
place of comfort right here you know you can be
earning a decent paycheck paying your bills and being in
a place of comfort but then when you have that
vision you have that dream of something that you want
to accomplish in life well usually what that means the
reason that it's compelling for you is because it's a
lofty goal it's something that you know you're gonna have
to work towards yourself and you're gonna have to grow
into it because right now your current capabilities are simply
not enough to accomplish that right and so the challenge
then becomes how do you grow into that what is
the process what kind of strategies do you need what
kind of techniques do you need what kind of things
they need to be aware of what kind of pitfalls
are on that on that journey and that's what actually
eyes that orgas here to help you do on the
one hand we're here to find it I hope you
find out what is that vision let's clarify it let's
make it really well articulated so that you're on track
and then once we have you pointed in the right
direction if you've ever been on track you also know
it's easy to get off track so part of this
here is to provide you with the really the inner
game the mindset the resources the psychological resources that you
need to keep yourself on track right because that's what
I want for you I don't want you to experience
just a little flash in the pan of excitement and
fulfillment I want that to be sustainable in your life
in fact I wanted to grow every year I wanted
to increase every year and what I found is that
I struggle to do this everyone struggles to do this
if you think that successful people and creators out there
somehow just have this naturally handled you're dead wrong and
in fact that's one of the biggest misconceptions I think
that keeps people from getting on this on track here
because you will be challenging yourself there are no easy
answers you're gonna have to work for it I'm not
promising any any magic magic pills here what I am
certain that I can do for you and the value
that I can provide to you is I can show
you how to cut your learning curve because man do
I wish that someone had this conversation with me five
years ago it would have really helped me figure stuff
out and a lot of the things that I'm sharing
with you on this website the free videos the articles
all the downloads are here to help you figure this
stuff out because I want you to be engaged with
your life because that's what my purpose is at this
point I've transitioned and I've designed my life in order
to be able to do what I'm doing right now
this is all I do is I study success and
human psychology try to figure out how I can go
without there and apply it in my life so that
my life is improved and I'm getting the kind of
engagement and success that I want for myself and then
I figure out and look at how it can be
applied to other people I research I study I shoot
videos I write articles I talk to people about this
stuff I interview people and then I come out here
and I want to share this knowledge and this wisdom
with you so take advantage of it don't leave this
information just rolling around in your head I want you
to go out there and take action and watch all
the videos and take all the resources to heart and
really challenge yourself to get excited about your life so

I'm genuinely interested in this I've had my own challenges
they're unique and I think that I found a lot
of strategies that will work across the board for different
people I know things that you should not do that
will definitely not work for you and I know some
things that will definitely work for you and then some
things vary as to how effective they are based on
your own personal psychology and past experiences and values and

tell me what I can do to help you what
kind of questions can I answer what kind of videos

to help you on that on that path because what
I'm really about is results I don't want to just
theorize about this stuff I don't want to about it
I'm hard-nosed kind of guy I like to see the
results I like to feel the results otherwise I feel
like I'm wasting my time and so I want the
same for you I want to create really a database
of resources for for people in the future to be
able to reference and quickly get the kind of results
