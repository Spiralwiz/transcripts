[Music] is gender a social construct i can help you
to answer this question for yourself in a non-ideological non-belief-based
way but that can only happen if you are genuinely
interested in knowing the answer in understanding the answer and
also thinking deeply about the question and not taking it
for granted this question is much deeper than most people
understand it's an extremely deep question that takes us into
the nature of reality and existence and the mind itself
so the question is how badly do you really want
to know or are you just looking for me to
validate your pre-existing belief notice that notice that there's a
difference between arguing based on this question which is mostly
what you'll find on youtube is people arguing based on
this question either pro or con arguing it from an
ideological position from things they've heard other people say whether
it's their professors or teachers or people they look up
to public intellectuals or just whatever their preconceived intuitions are
and of course the difficulty with probing this question this
is a philosophical question the difficulty with probing it is
that you have to actually be serious about doing philosophy
because you already have a preconceived answer a bias depending
on what culture you grew up in as to what
the answer is and for the majority of people it's
obvious of course there's men and there's women and that's
just how it is science says so it's physical it's
biological there are chromosomes to even question these things is
absurd so notice that you're not coming into this question
neutrally with a genuine desire for the truth you're coming
into this question with a lot of preconceived ideas and
one of the reasons that is is because as you
were growing up you had to develop your own sexual
identity and that was a struggle for for you you
probably don't even realize or understand the depth of the
struggle that was there for you to form a healthy
sexual identity a healthy relationship and understanding of your own
sexuality and its role within a larger society and community
that you're a part of and the family that you're
a part of for them to have accepted you to
love you as you think you are for them to
accept your identity this is all complicated stuff and for
many people it goes smoothly if they have good parents
and so forth but for other people it doesn't go
smoothly other people struggle with this for their entire lives
so it's not so easy you see and now that
you did develop a healthy let's say let's just assume
you have a healthy sexual identity you're not confused about
it you're not uncertain about it and also you fit
in with the larger society so you don't feel like
you've been left out or marginalized in any way then
uh see you might feel like oh okay i've got
that figured out it's not a problem for me but
see you've only got it figured out to the extent
that you stick to and defend that version of your
identity and as soon as it starts getting questioned you
get nervous and you get defensive because if let's just
say if if your sexual identity is actually a social
construction and we start to deconstruct it well if you
spent your whole life believing that it's physical reality this
presents some problems for your psyche how does your psyche
cope with that so you see we have a very
deep tangle here of both philosophical issues epistemic issues metaphysical
issues and also psychological issues and personal biases that you
yourself have from the cultural programming that you received on
this on this issue and this is not a philosophical
abstraction it might sound like oh well leo this is
just it's just airy fairy theory right no it's not
theory because you actually believe that you are a man
or a woman or whatever you believe you are if
you believe you're something else that's what you believe that's
not a theory for you that's not high philosophy for
you that's your very core of who you think you
are that's very deeply personal to you and that's why
if you've ever wondered why these on this particular question
why this is such a controversial question and it leads
to all these fiery debates and emotions and people getting
triggered and angry on both sides why this happens is
because you should you should feel inside of yourself that
it it touches something very deep within you it's not
just theory there's something actually practical writing on this namely
your survival sexuality plays a very central role in your
survival as a human and so this is not just
philosophy for many people your whole life is at stake
in many parts of the world you will get bullied
and even physically abused and perhaps even killed for example
if you're admit if you admit that you have homosexual
desires just just for that you could get killed and
many humans throughout human history have gotten killed for that
it's only like in the last few decades where it's
become somewhat acceptable and still in many parts of the
world even in many developed parts of the world it's
still unacceptable to admit such things maybe within your family
it's unacceptable to admit such things so the reason i'm
saying this we're getting to the topic here but i
have to lay a little bit of groundwork for you
here because you're not going to understand what i'm about
to say unless your mind is extremely open and you
are very cognizant and aware and mindful paying attention for
your own internal biases that are going to be skewing
your your perception of this whole issue because there's some
radical territory that this question will take us into and
the problem is is that people don't appreciate how radical
the territory is sometimes you ask a question that threatens
your entire sense of reality and that's basically what this
question does so let's lay this out so is gender
a a social construction where to even begin here so
basically what we're talking about is men and women what
is a man and what is a woman what is
male and what is female you can make all sorts
of fine distinctions between man woman male female um but
what you have to start to understand is that man
and woman let's work with those terms here man and
woman what are these things that's the core question we're
asking here what is a man and what is a
woman now ordinarily under the materialistic scientific paradigm we tend
to think of a man and a woman they're just
that is it's just uh physically encoded in our dna
a man and a woman are physical creatures that are
born they live and they die but that's not really
what a man and a woman are in your psyche
and in your mind a man and a woman these
are abstract categories you never see a man or a
woman or men or women out in the world you
see specific entities specific living creatures you might say although
those two are abstract categories you don't even see any
living creatures per se you see a specific thing and
even see thing is an abstract category too so see
this gets very tricky because our language and the way
that we think about reality it all gets entangled very
deeply here so let's start untangling some of this stuff
so basically even though you think in your mind that
a man and a woman that these are just physical
things defined by genetics and by biology and by physics
and chemistry and whatever you might think it is um
actually if you reflect on where your ideas of man
and woman came from and what these things are these
are ideas not physical objects you thinking that a man
and a woman are a physical thing that itself is
an idea do you see physicality itself is an idea
which you are applying to this category and then you're
you're creating these categories you weren't born with these categories
you picked them up from your culture and then these
categories they're not just a simplistic thing like a lot
of people say well leo but it's kind of obvious
that like a man has a dick and balls and
a woman has tits and a vagina and a woman
can have children and a man can't and this is
just it's so obvious it's so black and white that
how could you even argue against this it sounds like
absurdity but there's something more nuanced that's being said here
because the way you're creating this simplistic duality between man
and woman and ascribing these various features and parts to
these abstract categories you have to understand that this is
not a given this is something your mind had to
invent with the help of society and culture because you
didn't just sit down one day as a baby and
decide for yourself okay well i'm gonna call that a
man i'm gonna call this a woman and for the
man you know all the characteristics of a man include
a beard and uh you know big shoulders and a
big jaw and uh a lack of breasts and testicles
and all these things and for a woman she can
get pregnant and she has long hair and like you
didn't sit down and consciously create these categories where they
come from you might say well they just came from
nature no they didn't come from nature and here is
where look i'm not trying to teach you an ideology
or a belief system that i personally have that i
think is right that i think you should adopt because
i think it's true that's not what we're doing here
what we're doing here is we're trying to actually investigate
where our ideas of things came from this is like
a science that you do on yourself a self-inquiry of
a sort where you actually ask yourself yeah where did
my ideas of of man and woman come from did
i create them or was it fed to me as
a child and i didn't even think very deeply about
them and just accepted them and who gets to say
what is a man and a woman like who gets
to to create that list of features and is this
list of features is it immutable is it defined somewhere
in the physics of the universe like there's a law
somewhere like imagine that that god had a had sort
of a a book with all the laws of the
universe written on it e equals mc squared and a
bunch of other things one plus one equals two and
so forth and then somewhere in that book it said
that a man has testicles and a woman does not
and that is that is that that's sort of like
the universal definition it's not like that though you see
because we ourselves are constructing these labels and these abstract
categories and then assigning various properties or features to them
and so as we're doing that you should be able
to notice that it can be somewhat arbitrary and subjective
and relative in how you assign things to these categories
and that that could change over time and also that
different cultures could assign different features to different categories now
you might say leo we have science science is an
objective study of reality and science itself says that there's
a clear distinction between man and woman these are these
are just these are scientific this is not something that
we invented this is just basic science but see again
how deep do you want to go because we're going
to start to go down this slippery slope you're going
to start to notice very soon um because as you
bring up more and more of your defenses i'm going
to keep deconstructing them and so it's going to start
happening is that you're going to start sliding down the
slope the question is how much slippage down the slope
are you going to tolerate at some point it's going
to start to threaten you too much so see you
have to start to appreciate that science itself is a
social construction where did science come from where did you
get your ideas of what science is and that science
is even valid certainly not through personal experiment you got
it from society and in fact if you're a very
rigorous scientist you'll have to admit that science has never
ever empirically proven the existence of a man or a
woman that's not what science does see people have very
mistaken silly cartoonish ideas of what science is people assume
that science has proven many more things than science has
actually technically proven science has never proven that a man
has a penis and a woman has a vagina you
might say well but of course science has no never
how could you prove that that's not something you prove
that's like a definition you enforce you construct that definition
in order to do your science but that's never proven
that's just assumed as a given it's a sort of
an axiom that you need in order to do anything
in a certain sense i mean what experiment could you
run to prove that a man is supposed to have
a penis there's no such experiment then people say well
leo but what about biology like the chromosomes obviously we
know we have a rigorous technical definition of what a
man and a woman is a woman has xx chromosomes
a man has xy chromosomes we know that but again
that's not something that's actually literally proven by science that's
something that's see we're dealing with abstract categories these abstract
categories are actually a meta scientific phenomenon you have to
create these categories in order to then do your science
upon it technically all science does is just it does
measurements now you can take a human with a body
and you know measure his genitals or her genitals and
you could take another one and measure their genitals and
you can measure their size their weight their length their
their type how they look and all this sorts of
stuff and you can even measure the dna and make
comparisons and see differences but nowhere does it say how
to categorize those things into some sort of higher abstract
category like man and woman nor has science by the
way ever proven the existence of humans what is a
human see this problem of being a man or a
woman it doesn't stop there what we're really talking about
is the problem of identity identity what does it mean
for a thing to be a thing see you sit
there thinking that you're a human and that that's perfectly
obvious and in fact you think that's scientific you think
that's just a biological fact no it's not biology has
literally never proven that you're a human nor could it
even do so in theory because you don't find humans
out in the world what you find are you find
objects creatures and then you create various categories you create
categorize them however you want i mean like literally you
walk outside you see a a cat or a dog
and you say that's not human whereas i am human
now you say and that's a scientific fact that's not
a scientific fact now what science can do is science
can do some dna analysis and tell you that well
yeah the dna of that of that creature over there
and that one over there is different by a certain
percentage from this creature over here and this creature is
more similar to that creature than it is to that
creature so yes you can do dna analysis and you
can technically find through dna differences and similarities you know
what is more resembling of what but that doesn't tell
you what is human and what is cat and what
is dog you could say ah leo but we can
figure that out because humans can interbreed with each other
whereas cats and dogs can't interbed with each other and
also cats and dogs can't interbreed with humans therefore this
is what defines the categories in a rigorous way no
it doesn't there are many examples throughout biology and evolution
where actually all of those all of these boundaries you
think exist that they're all blurred there are different species
some species when they're close together they can actually interbreed
successfully and then other other even members of the same
species sometimes cannot interbreed for various reasons because there's a
dna mismatch or whatever they're going to have a a
miscarriage or or something like that and so in fact
there are no hard and fast lines between what canon
can't interbreed and also moreover that's not really the the
the deep problem the deep problem is that you yourself
are setting the standard of what defines human versus cat
versus dog is whether they can interbreed with each other
that's your own standard nowhere in the universe is it
written that well if two things can't interbreed with each
other that must mean they're radically different that's your own
standard why do you care about that particular standard of
interbreeding or for example for that matter you might say
well leo a man can't carry a baby can't be
pregnant therefore it's clear that that's a man and that's
a woman again but who is setting that standard why
do you care about pregnancy why is that a feature
that's important to you why don't you care about for
example hair and you could say well both men and
women have hair so they're in the same category but
see that's not useful to you personally to you personally
the category of man and woman these are not mere
abstractions these are abstractions which are serving a very practical
purpose for you like you as an animal have to
figure out how to get laid you as a biological
thing that survives and reproduces have to figure out how
to reproduce and create offspring and how to get your
sexual needs met and also your emotional needs for intimacy
for connection or socialization beyond that you need to be
accepted by your friends and your family and they won't
accept you if you have weird categories that don't fit
their own categories and society won't accept you and you
won't get a job and you won't be able to
join the military if you want and you won't be
able to fit in at university if you don't accept
the categories that they're defining you see so what you
have to recognize is that this issue is deeply laden
with survival biases on your part the reason you care
about pregnancy and penises and vaginas and femininity and masculinity
is because you're pursuing these things you need these things
in your life these are a deep survival need for
you a deep craving for you and much of your
existence is wrapped up about this i mean you're you're
watching pornography you're you're interested in nudity you're you're interested
in orgasms and sex and you you masturbate and you
have ideas about what kind of family you want to
raise what kind of children you want to have what
kind of values you want to teach them like this
is very very personal for you i want you to
see that this is not just philosophy and the idea
of a man and a woman for you you have
to also recognize and admit this notice this that for
you these are not purely clinical biological chromosomal facts primarily
when we say man and woman you're not thinking about
dna and chromosomes you will retreat to that justification if
pushed into a corner but that's not what you really
think about when you think about man and woman when
you think of yourself as a man or as a
woman you're not sitting there and thinking about your chromosomes
or your dna you have no direct experience of these
things these are things you learned long after the fact
to justify your deep intuitions about what a man and
a woman is these these categories and these categories have
much more important functional uses in society and in your
own life than merely that of how they correspond to
differences between chromosomes and dna you have ideas about how
a man should behave and how a woman should behave
how a man should look how a woman should look
how a man should dress how a woman should dress
what kind of job a man should have versus what
kind of job a woman is supposed to have what's
acceptable what's not acceptable for for each of them how
they should behave in social situations how they should behave
in bed how they should talk what you're allowed to
be attracted to and what you're not allowed to be
attracted to depending upon how you identify yourself to be
what you think is valuable in a man versus what
you think is valuable in a woman many of these
traits are sort of opposite when you see a strong
brash man taking sort of a leadership role in a
situation you might think oh that's good that's how a
man should be and then when you see a woman
doing that you look at her you say oh that's
she's she's being weird i don't like that where did
you get these ideas these standards and norms you see
most people take this completely for granted and just assume
well that's just how it is can't be otherwise and
it's pointless to question it and to questions is just
empty philosophy and word games but it's not empty philosophy
in word games and if you study different cultures you
see that different cultures and also throughout the history of
of time that there were very different standards placed upon
men and women even if we ignore for a moment
that just the purely physical differences of vaginas and penises
and we look more into the role that you play
as a man and a woman in a society in
your tribe in your family and so on these roles
have been very different across time and across cultures different
standards the kind of length of hair that one is
allowed to wear in a society the kind of occupations
that one is allowed to have whether you're a hunter
or a gatherer or you're a doctor or you're a
teacher or you're a nurse right and even just in
the last 50 years our own last generation or two
the generation you you grew up in we've seen significant
evolution and changes in in these standards and norms and
this is actually a deep reason why people debate and
fight over this question so vehemently and so passionately is
precisely because this question is not purely physical or biological
if it was that simple there'd be nothing to argue
over and you wouldn't get passionate about this question the
reason this question inflames your passions is precisely because you
need to fight to defend your ideas of what a
man and a woman are because if you don't fight
to defend them they'll cease to exist they'll dissolve culture
and society will change and then you will be left
out you will be left with the old ideas not
the new ideas and see this is very threatening because
you spent your whole life using man and woman as
a sort of an anchor in your life to ground
your sense of self your identity and your even your
sense of physical reality you assume these things are physical
so now if someone like me comes along and starts
to undermine that by sowing seeds of doubt in there
by starting to get you to question all these distinctions
and boundaries as maybe not being physical but being more
mental mentally constructed this this can be very threatening to
you it threatens your sense of identity and it threatens
your sense of understanding of the world because all of
a sudden the world you thought you had figured out
doesn't make sense anymore and then this leads you to
ask deeper questions about like well leo but if that's
a social construction then what about science and if that's
a social construction then what about mathematics and if that's
a social concern what about something else and then where
does it stop and usually people don't want to go
all the way down the slippery slope they just kind
of cut the line off somewhere and then they just
stick to defending that line because that's what's convenient that
helps them to maintain their sense of reality but it
gets way weirder than this we've only seen the tip
of the spear here of how deep this problem goes
you might say well leo it's obvious to me that
i'm a man because i have a penis and testicles
and i have high testosterone you know i've measured my
testosterone we can measure that and in a woman we
see the testosterone is lower obviously she looks different and
all of us can tell the difference between a man
and woman just even a child can tell the difference
so what is the point of all this philosophy why
are you blurring lines that are that are so obvious
well of course it's true that the majority of us
have developed a very good sort of heuristic and intuition
for quickly distinguishing men from women and in 95 percent
of the cases this works pretty well so from a
purely pragmatic perspective if all you care about is just
living your life and getting along and then you know
knowing who to flirt with and who not to flirt
with and who you should have sex with and who
you should not have sex with and who you can
impregnate and who you can't just making those basic survival
distinctions at a practical level yeah for that purpose the
category of man and woman are very useful categories no
one's arguing with that but that doesn't mean they're not
constructed in fact the reason you're constructing things to begin
with is because it's very very useful constructions are very
useful illusions can be very useful falsehoods can be very
useful in fact the majority of what your mind is
doing is it's constructing various fantasies and ideas to help
you to get by in life and it doesn't care
very much whether it's true or not or what the
underlying reality is it just all it cares about hey
as long as it works i'm just going to continue
doing this until it stops working see that's the problem
you might say well leo if it's working then what's
the problem well the problem is that it works for
a while but it doesn't work forever and then you
run into edge cases that force you to reconcile your
model of reality with the stuff you see out in
the world you're walking into a grocery store and you
you're checking out at the cashier uh stand there and
the cashier for the first time in your life you
can't tell is this a man or a woman you
can't tell because of the hair and the clothes and
the body weight and certain uh you know features that
are amorphous or kind of nebulous and androgynous you you
literally don't know if this is a man or a
woman and the voice is not too deep and it's
not too it's not too high and there's some feminine
qualities or some mascot so what is this thing see
now your mind is is a bit disturbed and not
only is it disturbed it might actually creep you out
you don't just get disturbed at the intellectual level you
also get disturbed at sort of a deep gut level
where you're looking at this person and you're just repulsed
by this person because your ordinary way of interacting with
men or women is that if it's a beautiful woman
let's say you're a guy you're a straight guy like
you prefer to be attracted to beautiful women you want
to be talking to beautiful women because why because it's
just it because it gives you dating opportunities of course
uh and then uh and if you're talking to men
then there's a certain kind of man that you respect
maybe sort of a macho man kind of you know
manly man type of man and then when you're talking
to an effeminate man you feel like oh this guy
is weak that like i don't want to be that
way i don't like this guy i'm not going to
befriend him you might feel that way why because you
yourself are in the business of constructing sort of macho
man identity why because you think you need that in
order to attract that highly feminine woman that you are
attracted to right so you're playing this game all the
time and then when you're faced with this cashier that
you don't know what it is at a gut level
you don't know how to react to it and you've
got to figure out how to react to it what
to do about it is this a good thing is
this a bad thing what does this mean for me
can can i have sex with this thing or can't
i see all of this subconsciously is going on in
your mind and what you feel from all that you
don't cognizantly realize most of that mostly what you just
feel is like ugh i don't i don't like this
feels weird it feels creepy and you try to leave
as quickly as possible now i hear some objections here
is like well leo but surely we could take that
person's dna and actually measure the dna and figure out
what the chromosomes are and based on those chromosomes that's
how we determine what the uh what the identity is
here it's a man or a woman and then just
just because i can't tell from surface features even the
yeah it's an edge case but it doesn't really matter
so what underneath all that is it's really a man
or a woman and it doesn't matter what this person
identifies as as long as they got the proper chromosomes
that's just what they are and then you know if
they think there's something else well that's their problem they're
deluded they're playing games in their own mind but again
you're grossly over underestimating this problem of identity of how
you think you are who you think you are rather
you see man and woman these are not merely abstract
categories that are just applying to the people they also
apply to you you believe yourself to be one of
those or something else that identity that was not scientifically
derived you have to notice that if you dare that
was constructed by you and it has to be defended
by you and to defend it you will use very
powerful justifications you will employ science you will employ appeals
to authority you will point your fingers at others and
at society but you're never going to actually really deeply
want to question where your identity came from you might
say well leo but it's obvious that i have a
penis and therefore i'm a man this is just a
scientific fact and there's nothing you can say to argue
against this well look at this look at how look
at how tricky this gets here but you have to
open your mind to really see this see i'm saying
here is something very radical i'm saying that when you
say that you have a penis and not a vagina
i'm gonna make the move that why don't you have
a vagina why don't you consider your mother's vagina if
you're a man your own who told you her vagina
is not yours now you're gonna say that's ridiculous leo
um cause she's her and i'm me but you see
there's the rub there's the crux of the whole identity
problem who's to say you're you and she's her science
science has never proven that her vagina is not yours
if you think it does then you don't understand science
science does not and cannot prove identity of anything the
question of identity is a meta-scientific issue it comes prior
to science all science does is it just measures stuff
again science can measure your mother's vagina it can measure
your penis but it cannot say that that vagina belongs
to her and not to you and you say well
that's ridiculous because clearly i'm over here and she's over
there there's no way that her vagina is mine because
i don't feel it i can't use it but again
that is your standard that you're drawing that you have
to feel it and use it why where is the
line i dare you to take your finger and to
point at the line between you and your mother's vagina
what you'll notice if you're honest and open-minded is that
there is no such line you might say well the
line is the skin it's the boundary of the skin
here i'm this organism and she's that organism but there
is no line there's no line between one organism and
another the skin is just an arbitrary line that you
you selected for your own selfish purposes you have to
see that you have to see that your own selfishness
is completely distorting and biasing this entire inquiry so what
i'm saying here is something very radical the idea that
you have a penis and not a vagina that you
cannot give birth as a man but that women can
or other creatures can that this this whole way of
how you're categorizing and carving up reality it's all a
construction what i'm telling you is your the paradigm you've
lived under for the last how many decades of your
life is the idea that you're this separate creature here
with a penis or with a vagina and so forth
and what i'm telling you now is just imagine changing
that paradigm such that you start to see yourself as
having three and a half billion penises and three and
a half billion vaginas remove the bias from your psyche
that a penis and a vagina have to be attached
to your body because you're going to now further deconstruct
the idea that this is your body and that you
only have a single body so of course now you're
going to switch your identity imagine for a moment that
instead of identifying with this body and this one life
you start to identify with the entire human species so
you now have seven billion bodies now you say leo
but i don't feel those bodies so they're not really
my bodies i'm just you're just fooling yourself when you're
saying that not so fast who told you that to
have a body you need to feel the body science
didn't tell you that where'd you get that idea if
you're honest and you contemplate this deeply you'll realize that
you got that idea arbitrarily from your society you didn't
think very deeply about this idea it is actually possible
to switch your identity to that of identifying with the
entire human species you might say well what's to stop
me there why don't i identify with the entire planet
yeah you could and leo what's the stop if i'm
the entire planet why can't i identify with with being
the entire solar system right you could well what's to
stop me from the from going further nothing nothing is
stopping you and so now you might say well leo
what is my true identity because because now i'm not
like even human anymore what is a human well that's
right what is a human a human is a social
construction there's no such thing as a human now when
i say that it doesn't mean that this that this
thing you're seeing here disappears this is the mistake people
make is that see they think that when we're talking
about social construction or mental construction we're talking about something
very simplistic and stupid like well leo why can't i
just imagine myself to be a kangaroo and turn into
a kangaroo that's not what i'm saying i'm not saying
you're doing that when you imagine yourself to be a
human that's a conceptual overlay that you're adding on top
of whatever is experienced right here the raw experience here
let's say it's not going to change it is what
it is this body is sitting here and talking to
you and ordinarily you project upon my body that it
is a human being that it is biological that it
is uh a homo sapien that it is uh a
man that it is leo these are layers and layers
and layers of conceptual abstractions projected upon what is actually
here now if you remove all of those this will
still be here the colors and noises i'm making will
still be here you're still going to see basically the
same shape but it will no longer be human it
will no longer be leo it will no longer be
a man it will no longer be alive even you
might say leo but you're just playing word games if
we remove all these labels from you you're still you
and everything is still the same nothing changes it's just
word games mental masturbation right wrong if you think that
what i'm communicating to you and this is an advanced
communication i am not parroting some ideology to you i'm
trying to get you to actually think about the very
nature of your being what i'm trying to communicate to
you is not merely a word game if you think
that you're not understanding my communication watch out for that
because it's a very common defense mechanism that people use
as soon as we go deep down this slippery slope
people just throw their hands up and they just say
oh it's all just a word game it doesn't matter
let's move on it does matter there are practical consequences
to what you identify with because these abstract projections of
categories you make they bring in with them entire implicit
webs of meaning that you're barely even conscious of see
you assume i'm a man but you don't really know
for all you know i might not have testicles you
don't know that you assume that based upon a certain
projection you make upon me you also assume i'm human
you assume that i think of myself as this body
see because you identify as being a body and a
man or a woman or whatever as a human you
also therefore project that upon me and you assume that
i do the same thing too and you assume that
all humans do the same thing and if they don't
that they're insane and by this point you're probably thinking
i've lost my mind but consider the possibility that not
all humans think of themselves as human only some do
the ones who aren't very intelligent the ones who haven't
thought very deeply about these things but that there are
other humans who actually literally do not think of themselves
as a human and that is not something that they're
just tricking themselves into you could say oh leo but
yeah of course you can i mean in theory you
could trick yourself into believing anything like you could think
of yourself as a unicorn that doesn't make yourself a
unicorn right you could be an attack helicopter if you
wanted to as the meme goes um but that's not
what i'm saying yeah of course of course you can
construct any kind of entities you want if you want
to think of yourself as a unicorn you can and
that will have certain consequences does that mean that your
body will turn into that of a unicorn no um
but it can have other consequences in your life positive
and negative um maybe maybe if you believe you're a
unicorn you won't have that crippling low self-esteem problem maybe
you'll be able to talk to to girls whereas when
you think you're this ugly human you can't do it
when you think you're you're a man but you don't
match up to the sort of the arnold schwarzenegger stereotype
of a man you know you struggle talking to a
beautiful woman as as this kind of man because you
feel like you're inferior as a man you don't feel
like you're a strong sort of stereotypical macho man alpha
male and therefore you're you're not confident flirting with her
but maybe if you start to believe you're a unicorn
even though your body won't change maybe now you think
oh well as a unicorn i'm this magical special creature
and i'm the only one you know unicorns are rare
so maybe maybe that increases your self-self-esteem and you might
say well leo maybe that's even true i'll grant you
that maybe that's even true you could [ __ ]
yourself into believing anything about yourself to make yourself feel
good but it doesn't correspond with reality but you're doing
this when you create the identity of man and woman
you are doing this to yourself you have ideas about
what is a good man what is a bad man
what is a good woman what is a bad woman
and then how you relate to that and then you
try to live up to that and then you struggle
with that and it makes you suffer and it's difficult
or it gets you a sense of pride maybe you
do feel like you're this alpha macho man and you've
got the sense of pride and you're like yeah none
of this affects me it doesn't matter i'm this macho
man i was just born this way here i am
everything's great well yeah everything's great now and then in
20 years you're gonna lose your testosterone and then you're
gonna you're gonna age and you're gonna lose your your
macho man physique um and then what happens and then
and then you start to suffer and you get depressed
and you start to feel worthless because that ideal you
had you're not able to live up to anymore and
see you don't hold these ideals as just merely philosophy
to you these ideals are are are reality you hold
them as reality and you hold them as important and
on them hinges your happiness and your ability to survive
in life identity is a purely imaginary conceptual relativistic thing
any identity you adopt whether human man woman programmer engineer
artist businessman boxer athlete good bad evil a unicorn these
are all imaginary biased partial identities that the mind constructs
in order to aid itself in the survival wherever it's
trying to survive depending upon the situation it's in it
will adopt different masks and personas and identities some of
them are going to be more functional some of them
are going to be dysfunctional in that environment but all
of them will be limited and all of them will
limit you and all of them will con will create
suffering for you because if you're wondering well what's my
true identity if all identities are imaginary what's my true
identity well for that you would need to awaken awakening
is the realization of your true identity which is infinity
the reality is that you're absolutely everything your mind everything
that is occurring is occurring within your mind your mind
is that which unifies everything or that which creates divisions
between things so for example right now you're sitting there
and you're thinking well leo i'm a woman and you're
a man you have a you have a penis i
assume let's just assume that um and you know leo
i don't i don't have your penis i don't know
i don't know what kind of nonsense you're spewing here
but but your penis is yours it's not mine but
what you're not aware of is that my penis is
literally inside your mind right now what you think of
as my penis as being a separate physical object from
you or from your mind is not this is a
mistake you've made in your awareness of your own mind
my penis has never existed anywhere but within your own
mind and it's your own mind that told you that
that is not your penis you've literally disowned my penis
in your own mind and you did that so that
you could be a woman if you did not do
that you would not be a woman you would not
be able to maintain that identity which is precisely why
if you're resisting some of the things i'm saying right
now or you feel disgusted or offended or triggered by
the things that i'm saying or they're making you scared
or anxious or nervous the things that i'm saying that's
because what i'm saying is directly undermining your fantasy of
being a woman you see for you to keep your
identity as a woman you have to keep disowning my
penis as being generated by your mind for this disconnect
to keep happening you have to keep enforcing it which
is why you might get emotional here you might be
tempted to you know go down in the comments section
and leave leave me some nasty comments some snarky remark
you might want to argue with me and debate this
point but you can't debate this point because what i'm
telling you is how it is you can only deny
it so the question is what kind of denials will
you invent in order to keep disowning my penis as
being your own mind that's the real game that's being
played here i want you to see the the seriousness
of this game when you hold this as philosophy and
merely theory that's just one of the mechanisms you use
to avoid looking deeply at the issue because what i'm
talking about here now is not philosophy and it's not
theory it's not an ideology and it's not a belief
system of mine you can actually look inside of your
own awareness and realize that my penis is your own
mind now whether you want to do that or not
that hinges on you do you want to really understand
or do you want to just keep playing your games
and going about life as you always were or do
you actually want to question some stuff and realize something
new that of course can be threatening to you you
have to start to notice that what you identify as
is not any kind of objective truth what you identify
as is that which helps you to survive and that
in fact what helps you to survive are fantasies and
illusions not truth so you're very committed to your fantasies
and illusions and you're very committed to your sexual identity
because you see if you start to open your mind
to some of the things i'm telling you this is
going to keep you awake at night this might produce
an existential crisis for you you might start to question
your sexuality and you might start to now open your
mind to the possibility that you've had maybe sexual urges
that you were denying maybe you had some sexual attraction
towards the same sex and you were suppressing those deep
in your mind because you were just you had to
disown those in order to maintain or construct maintain the
construction of yourself as a woman or as a man
and so you did that and you're not even aware
yet that you did that you might have done that
30 years ago when you were just a baby and
to this day it's it's still repressed in your mind
you see like like look science can measure a rock
it can measure its length height breadth width whatever its
size its colors and so forth science can do that
but what science can't do is tell you that it's
a rock i mean it can but that's not strictly
science it's just a meta scientific projection a category abstract
category that's made see um now if you look at
a rock and you ask yourself does a rock have
a gender is iraq male or female it's pretty obvious
that rocks don't have gender why would they i mean
what is gender after all where did it come from
like ask yourself in the universe where did male and
female come from when did they come into existence before
they were humans before there were mammals before there were
even fish they were just rocks none of them were
male and female and then at some point male and
female came into existence we sort of presume uh how
where where did it come from you had some molecules
i mean the sort of standard scientific stories that there
were some molecule organic molecules in the sea and they
kind of collided together and they created little little sort
of proto-organisms were those male and female no probably not
okay so then that pushes the problem up one level
so then okay so that we had these little proto-organisms
that weren't male and female and then they turned into
like a little proto-bacteria with little dna in there okay
so did those already or were those male and female
did they have x and y chromosomes probably not chromosomes
are like something higher order than just regular d strands
of dna so it's like okay well then we have
to go one more level okay well then at some
point eventually like a bacteria full-fledged bacteria emerged it's like
okay well was that male or female probably the first
ones weren't okay but then at a certain point the
bacteria they became more complex they turned into very complex
like eukaryotic bacteria and then and then those started to
differentiate and then finally there was some sort of cleavage
or division where there's a sort of a specialization it's
like there's one that had a little bit different dna
than another one and then they all were basically 50
50 half the bacteriums had this kind of dna have
them had a little bit of a different dna not
chromosomes yet but just a little bit different dna so
were those now males and females and you will still
probably be forced to no not really i mean and
and like uh i mean that's not what we really
mean by man and woman anyways we mean something much
richer than that but anyways at some point you get
to a point where you have like one lizard that's
female one lizard that's male they have different organs and
even different chromosomes and now finally you say okay well
this one's clearly uh male this one's clearly female but
do you see how arbitrary all this is there are
no lines there are no clear lines there anywhere and
the connections you draw between a female lizard and a
human woman and a male lizard and a and a
human man there are some loose connections you draw there
i mean they can both have penises or whatever uh
or not and some of them can have you know
a lizard like a female lizard can can lay eggs
or whatever can can be pregnant whereas a man of
uh a male lizard cannot and you can draw certain
similarities but you see your mind is drawing all these
connections and how you draw and link different things within
reality this is not a strictly scientific process this is
a subjective relativistic process that is very much biased by
what is convenient for your survival what serves you and
what serves your identity are you getting this are you
starting to see how these abstract categories are projections of
your own mind they're not really there i'm not really
a man you think i'm a man because that's how
you're used to thinking about me and i might even
think of myself as a man or maybe i won't
it depends don't assume that i'm going to think of
myself the way you think of myself and also of
course my idea of a man might be very different
from your idea of a man so there's not just
this sort of monolithic single idea of a man and
a woman each human on the planet has their own
ideas of a man and a woman there's seven billion
different ideas of man and woman on the planet and
most of them aren't very original most of them are
just blindly indoctrinated into us as children and we just
live with them for the rest of our lives without
ever questioning them and so what we see with these
sort of culture wars that are going on in society
politically with the gender sort of wars and the you
know trans rights and this sorts of stuff and the
lesbian gay issues and whatever else what other identity you
know gender identity issues there are multiple different genders that
that are like not non-binary so transgender so what we're
seeing with all these sort of culture wars is that
it's literally a war for the definition of these categories
that's why it's such a juicy and intoxicating issue it
triggers people a lot precisely because this issue can't be
settled physically by science this is a meta-scientific issue which
is going to be settled at a societal and cultural
level through a culture war so we needed a culture
war to get to the point where now where gay
marriage is considered acceptable and homosexuality is not considered evil
deviant behavior a hundred years ago for example or even
even today in many parts of the world in less
developed areas like not in america um i usually sort
of speak from an american point of view but in
in other countries even today homosexuality is considered evil it's
considered devilry it's considered it's considered sinful now is that
really true if you believe it is if you imagine
it is if that's how you define your categories but
here now in america we we've we've redefined our categories
in the last couple decades such that that is no
longer the prevailing opinion and that has threatened many people
and the people that threatens the most are those who
are the least secure about their sexual desires and their
sexual identity there's actually been research done on this the
people who are most vehemently opposed to homosexuality are those
who themselves have latent repressed homosexual tendencies that they've repressed
and denied which is precisely why they're so adamant about
demonizing homosexuals it's a projection they're demonizing homosexuals because they
don't want to acknowledge that part of reality as being
part of themselves and their own psyche so they're disowning
it they're actively disowning it but they're not aware that
they're doing this so so anyways the point is that
these these standards change and you might say well leo
but this is still all pure philosophy it doesn't have
any practical consequences it does have practical consequences it has
practical consequences for how you relate to the opposite sex
or even the same sex it has practical consequences for
your dating life for your relationships intimate and so forth
it has practical consequences for how you raise your children
um and here's here's another practical consequence which is going
to come pretty soon in the future uh look pretty
soon with uh genetic engineering not in our lifetimes but
probably in future generations what's gonna happen is that mankind
is gonna start to modify our dna splicing it with
that of animals and other creatures i mean this is
obviously coming just a question of when so this will
completely blur the lines of what you consider as human
so what happens when we blend the dna of a
of a fox and a and a dinosaur with human
dna is that a human is it a fox is
it a dinosaur is it a man is it a
woman what happens if we take some dna from you
know from the woman's chromosome and we give it to
the man and vice versa what happens when we start
creating creatures that combine the chromosomes of both men and
women what happens when we create a creature that has
a x x y chromosome or an x y y
chromosome what is what is that going to be is
that going to be a man a woman something else
a hybrid do you see how arbitrary all this is
these categories of man and woman you can try to
cling to them for now i mean even now it's
becoming untenable but let's say you can clean them for
another generation or two but you're not going to be
able to cling to them for more than a few
generations at best once all this genetic engineering starts going
it's simply not going to hold and even your category
of human is not going to hold it's not going
to hold for example we could probably extract some dna
from from old neanderthal fossils and other you know even
older hominid fossils we could we can even you know
do the sort of jurassic park thing where we can
even birth a neanderthal in the future or some sort
of you know earlier hominid we can we can have
those and then the question will rise are those human
and then we can further take those and mate them
with modern humans and then the question will arise are
those humans and you see so everything will get completely
blurred and so this is very practical right so actually
what i'm what i'm talking here has scientific implications it
has practical scientific implications because uh if your mind is
so close as to only think in these categories to
hold these categories as scientific if you're a scientist and
you actually believe that man and woman are defined by
science and that human kind is defined by science or
by dna this is actually limiting your ability to do
science you're not thinking enough outside the box you're thinking
way too narrowly in some sort of limited black and
white dualistic paradigm and future scientists who have a more
open mind will outdo you in your science and they
will make radical new discoveries and and crazy new technologies
that will better mankind or other kind and um and
then you will be left in the dust as a
dinosaur as the dinosaur that you are and you will
go extinct and your philosophy and your worldview will go
extinct because there's more accurate philosophies and more accurate worldviews
out there and they do have practical consequences and just
like albert einstein relativized the idea of space time going
from absolute to relative space time and velocity uh the
same will happen with the idea of of humans humanity
itself will become relativized in the future just through science
if nothing else but also there will be big culture
wars as like how do we define these things and
are there dangers and risks here absolutely now you say
leo well maybe maybe you're right maybe maybe technically you're
right maybe man and woman are these abstractions but ultimately
we got to keep society cohesive i mean what's going
to happen if everybody just starts coming up with their
own sexual identities and just being whoever they want and
one person is a unicorn another person is a kangaroo
another person is an alien i mean where does it
end it becomes you know it becomes this sort of
a pluralistic madness that is an important consideration and i
am not saying that you should discard completely discard the
notions and categories of men and women these are useful
categories i still use these categories in my own life
they're effective for certain purposes the only thing is that
you just have to keep in mind the limitations of
what you're constructing and you have to be honest with
yourself that is constructed so there's no problem with construction
per se i mean the majority of what mankind does
is constructing stuff whether physically or mentally in our minds
we're always constructing stuff and and we need our mental
constructions the only problem is when you just you cling
to them you become close-minded about it you get going
to denial of their constructions and you refuse to ever
change them that's that's the problem is when you get
too rigid about it too ideological about it and there
are constructions that are useful and valuable and worthwhile to
preserve so for those of you conservatives and traditionalists in
the audience who are probably disgusted already um by all
the things i've said um you know you're wondering about
you know well what about the old traditions that are
that are worthwhile to preserve yeah there are there are
useful categories to preserve and we should probably preserve the
male female category um for a bit longer because it's
useful for dating for raising children but also recognize that
you have to be careful about it because it's it
can also be harmful just because it's useful to you
for a specific situation doesn't mean it's it's useful to
everybody it limits certain people it might limit your children
you have to be open to that you see the
constructions and categories that got us to where we are
today are not going to be sufficient to get us
to the next level of mankind's evolution but nevertheless they
can serve as a sort of a foundation we just
have to be honest and aware of what the limitations
of the foundation are so this sort of like a
jordan petersonian idea of like well we shouldn't you know
question traditional marriage too much because that's going to lead
to families breaking down there's going to be a breakdown
of families and then there's going to be violence you
know and and then we need strong traditional family values
and this sorts of stuff this is sort of the
traditional line and um and you know children are going
to grow up confused they're not going to know whether
they're a man or a woman or a unicorn and
this is going to be dysfunctional they're not going to
know you know how to relate and how to date
and how to flirt and how to do this there
is definitely some truth to that concern it's way overblown
by conservatives but there is some truth to that is
that yeah like for example if you grow up with
parents who are very hands-off and give you no pointers
and guidance as to whether you're a man or a
woman or how to relate to the to the opposite
sex and they just say well you figure it all
out yourself maybe you're a man maybe you're a woman
maybe today you're decided you're a man tomorrow you decide
you're a woman and then the third day you know
on friday you decide you're a unicorn and yeah just
experiment and just kind of go with the flow kind
of you know these sort of hippie hippie parents um
that sort of tell you this when you're very young
they don't enforce a you know a strict you know
standard for you of being man or woman you know
they buy you toys of all kinds if you're a
boy they buy you a barbie if you're a girl
they buy you you know hot cars or whatever um
or guns and and you know you you grow up
playing with in a sort of confused environment yeah it
is it does lead to more confusion see that's one
of the trade-offs one of the trade-offs of relativity is
confusion that's not a mistake that's not a bug that's
a feature confusion can seem bad at first but it
forces you to actually reconcile and deal with with reality
with the complexities of reality you can no longer rely
on just simplistic black and white categories without thinking about
them here now the kid has to actually think for
himself he has to be aware of his own feelings
and cravings and desires he has to like be honest
with himself about like do i really enjoy playing with
guns more or with barbies and if i enjoy playing
with barbies do i like do i feel guilty about
that as a boy because i want to be like
all the other boys or am i cool with that
i can embrace that and i can i can be
strong enough to take you know the sort of insults
that other boys will hurl at me for playing with
barbies and liking barbies can i you know resul you
know develop a spine or am i going to be
insecure that's going to develop some sort of psychological neuroses
within me and i'm going to be i'm going to
be wrestling with this trauma for the rest of my
life because i'm playing with barbies in you know in
the playground and all the boys are laughing at me
and picking on me and bullying me and punching me
and all this sort of stuff and then that's going
to make me into like a a [ __ ]
homicidal you know serial killer in 30 years that's possible
it's absolutely possible and it's possible that you don't develop
a firm clear sexual identity within yourself therefore for the
rest of your life you're going to be sort of
sexually weak and confused and you're not going to know
how to flirt with with women too well or with
men because you're going to be kind of like splitting
the difference there you're not going to be developing a
strong feminine or masculine polarity um and you're going to
be confused and maybe you're going to be frustrated sexually
because you're not going to have the kind of you
know polarized sex that maybe you might want and so
this whole thing might be very confusing for you it
might lead to a lot of suffering and sexual problems
is that possible absolutely and we're seeing more and more
of that today if you were born 500 years ago
in a sense life was a lot simpler because the
society was so rigid that you couldn't even bring up
the idea that you were gay or not a man
or not a woman you probably would have been killed
just for saying that so you didn't say it so
the choice was easy for people back then you're just
a man or a man and a woman but now
as a society liberalizes and opens up gives yourself gives
us more freedom it gives us more freedom of choice
in all different ways you have more freedom as to
where you can fly where you can travel where you
can live what you can eat what books you can
read this is what freedom means i mean you guys
you conservatives love freedom at least you claim so well
how about the freedom to identify as whatever you want
see oh you don't want that freedom you only want
as much freedom as you can tolerate and no more
because freedom is actually death to the ego so yeah
there are consequences to what you identify yourself as but
it cuts both ways so see if you start to
identify as a unicorn jordan peterson would be right in
saying that that's going to create problems because your identity
is not just something you identify and define for yourself
maybe i could even convince myself that i'm a unicorn
but that doesn't mean i'm going to convince you that
i'm a unicorn it is a complex social game that
we're playing and your identity is defined in relationship to
the identities of everyone in your community and in your
tribe but that does not mean that there are only
one or two fixed identities and that they can never
change actually it means the opposite of that jordan peterson
has this idea backwards precisely because our identities are constructed
socially it's extremely important what others think of our identities
and whether they approve of them or not and that's
precisely because the identities are not real you see it's
sort of like with money money is not real it's
purely imaginary but it is extremely practical and important and
serves a very crucial function within our entire society like
our entire society would collapse if we got rid of
the idea of money right now tomorrow and it only
works precisely because it's purely an illusion and everybody buys
into it as soon as people start doubting the value
of the dollar the entire american country would collapse if
that happened enough now the mistake that people like jordan
peterson make here is they say well that proves the
that ploop that proves the reality of the dollar no
it doesn't it actually proves the immateriality and the imaginary
nature of the dollar so yes it will be much
more difficult for you to survive as a unicorn amongst
humans who think of themselves as humans than it is
to survive as a man or as a woman as
sort of a traditional man woman so be careful what
you identify yourself as in that sense jordan peterson is
correct you're not just free willy-nilly to pick whatever you
want i mean you are but you will have to
live with the consequences and you better be prepared for
whatever the consequences will be so there's a negotiation happening
you're identifying yourself in a way that other people will
tolerate other people are identifying themselves in a way that
you're going to tolerate and yes it is a negotiation
that's the social game that's what social construction is but
now i have a bit of bad news for those
of you who are sort of in the progressive uh
lb gtq plus camp who probably have been liking some
of the things i've been saying up to this point
i have some bad news for you and the bad
news is this is that you're still falling into the
trap of identity you're a little bit more conscious than
the conservatives who are in denial about this whole thing
but you're still falling into the trap and you're still
creating problems for yourself so here's how see um once
you start to open yourself up this idea that gender
is a social construction okay then you start to play
around with different identities and genders and so forth and
you're doing that first of all along the lines of
what jordan peterson says is like you could be picking
identities which are not very healthy for you just because
you have the freedom to pick some identity doesn't mean
you're going to use that freedom wisely so you could
be doing that you could be just confusing yourself and
taking yourself sort of down down a a dead end
but also see whatever new identity you adopt let's say
you you were born a man and then you decide
that you want to be a woman or vice versa
um and you say well i was born i was
born a man but really my soul my soul was
that of a woman and then i've transitioned now i've
become a woman and that's who i really am now
no you fooled yourself you fooled yourself you just made
the same mistake that ordinary traditional men and women make
i mean it just you kind of flip-flopped it took
you longer um but you made the same mistake in
the end because now you identify as being a woman
or a trans woman or whatever and you really believe
that's what you are that's who you are and again
the reason you're so touchy about that and you're so
defensive and you get triggered and maybe now some emotions
are arising within you maybe some nervousness maybe now there's
a little bit of fear maybe now you're not liking
what i'm saying because what i'm saying now is again
going to threaten your identity and you might say oh
leo but but you're being anti-trans now because you know
i've worked so hard to overcome all the abuse and
all the ridicule and all the confusion in my life
and now i finally settled on my trans woman identity
and i finally got in there i have a little
bit of peace in my life and now you come
along leo and now you're disturbing that piece yeah because
you're you built a you built a house of cards
on a foundation of sand and i'm merely pointing that
out to you you see it cuts both ways if
identity is truly relativistic and imaginary and it's not objective
and it's not scientific and we are the ones defining
it that means you constructed your trans identity you also
constructed your gay identity or your lesbian identity and if
you believe you're some gender that's not a man or
a woman but something in between or some you know
xyz thing um whatever you think you are i mean
you constructed that it's still a limited partial identity and
it's going to cause you problems and suffering because every
limited identity necessarily causes suffering and problems why because the
truth is that there is only one identity infinity you're
not a trans woman you're not a gay man you're
not a lesbian you're not bisexual you're not some xyz
thing you are infinity you're everything and you will never
be satisfied or at peace until you realize your true
identity which is infinity your everything so beware what masks
and roles you adopt and play they're all finite and
limited and anything finite is going to be limited and
you're going to feel the constraints of that thing and
you're never going to be fully at peace because it's
not true you're never going to feel fully at peace
as a human as a man as a woman as
a unicorn as an attack helicopter as a gay as
a lesbian as a bisexual as a trans as xyz
as a other kin as an alien as anything you're
never going to feel fully complete because none of those
are complete because all of those are finite and you're
infinite the nice thing about the man woman identities is
that they have been time tested they've been tested and
refined and evolved over thousands of years probably more like
hundreds of thousands of years and our culture has also
evolved co-evolved with those identities such that they're functional they're
functional partially because our culture is designed to make them
functional right so it's a sort of a reciprocal self-fulfilling
prophecy sort of type of relationship a reciprocal relationship where
the two halves were were designed or co-evolved to fit
nicely together and work organically smoothly together and for the
most part they do there's a nice sort of division
of labor division of responsibilities between men and women and
it for the most part it tends to work it
doesn't work for everybody but for the most part it
tends to work and that doesn't mean it works because
it's absolutely true in some ultimate sense it works simply
because that's how it evolved it evolved to work that
way in the same way that there's a symbiosis between
a bird like a hummingbird and its long nose beak
and a certain flower which also has a long you
know long petals and a long you know sort of
cone and so there's a there's a very nice fit
between the two why is that is that because the
hummingbird is you know some sort of absolutely true thing
no it's just the hummingbird evolved this way and the
flower evolved this way and they co-evolved and they work
together this one pollinates that one and this one helps
this one you know feed his children with nectar and
stuff and it works it's a symbiosis so man and
woman is a sort of a set of symbiotic dualities
and there's there is sort of a deep wisdom to
it there in that sense conservatives have some good idea
about that but also you have to recognize that all
of these symbioses because everything is evolving not just hummingbirds
and flowers everything is evolving including mankind society culture and
in fact mankind and society and culture are evolving at
much more rapid speed uh orders many organs of magnitude
more than hummingbirds and flowers so for the hummingbird the
life is easy because it always finds the flower unless
mankind destroys the flowers and the hummingbird is [ __
] but you know life for the hummingbird in a
sense is easy it doesn't need to think about these
things but for mankind because our environment is evolving so
fast every generation we have sort of a new media
environment new cultural environment things are changing everything's globalizing you
know dna and computers and all this crazy stuff it's
all coming online and so um so we are forced
to evolve faster so really you are sort of like
a hummingbird and i'm telling you that okay you've been
a hummingbird but um now stuff is changing you gotta
adapt you know you gotta actually change the the shape
of your beak to fit into this new thing that's
coming online because these old flowers that used to exist
they're all dying out they're all changing into something else
so you either adapt or you die and for humans
we have to do it mentally it's our minds that
are the beak that needs to change but also it's
possible to change too much it's possible to overswing the
pendulum in the opposite direction and you start to you
know you start to play around with these weird identities
you start to imagine yourself to be a unicorn or
something this could end up actually hurting you psychologically you
can construct identities that are dysfunctional or just not optimal
for life there are identities that are more optimal for
doing good in business and others that are not if
you walk around dressed as a unicorn you're not going
to survive in the corporate world they're going to laugh
at you now you might say oh leo but that's
just because they're they're they're arrogant and they're obnoxious and
they're close-minded and they're judgmental and they're sexist or whatever
and that's why like if they were more open-minded i
would be able to survive in a business environment you
know with my unicorn costume maybe you would but also
maybe you wouldn't and consider just because you have the
freedom to do anything just because you have the freedom
to glue a [ __ ] unicorn horn on your
forehead you know permanently attach it with surgery just because
you can do that you're free to do that doesn't
mean you should doesn't mean it's smart doesn't mean your
horn is not going to get stuck in in you
know in some doorway or poke somebody in the eye
there are consequences to identities and the problem is that
see the male and or the man and woman identity
these were these were co-evolved for hundreds of thousands of
years and they've been sort of polished and field tested
a lot so in a certain sense they're reliable they're
a good sort of baseline to go to when you
don't know anything else because they've been sort of field
tested and proven to work whereas once you start to
experiment with your own wacky identities it's not that they're
not true it's simply that they might not be practical
and you may not understand what you're doing a hundred
thousand years of evolution is a lot smarter than you
especially if you're very young and you know most people
who are identi who are playing around with their identities
you know these are college kids that are 18 years
old 20 years old 25 years old something like that
or even younger and that is problematic because at that
age you're so ignorant you're so unconscious you're so immature
you're so stupid and you're so wrapped up in group
think and in conformity see you might be thinking that
oh i'm being very independent by coming up with this
unicorn identity probably not actually you're probably doing it because
friends around you are doing it and encouraging you to
do it after all where did you get this idea
that identity is a flexible thing fluid thing you didn't
derive that through first principles by actually sitting down and
contemplating this stuff in some existential philosophical manner the way
that i would encourage you to do you didn't do
that what did you do you spent your middle school
and high school years just talking [ __ ] with
your friends and then together as a little you know
a little hive mind you guys came up with some
ideas where those ideas come from they came from universities
they came from academia from you know post-modernist philosophers and
so forth and that is also all social construction the
strange loop of social construction of course is that social
construction is socially constructed post-modernism is a social construction so
actually you have to be very careful here because if
you've watched a lot of jordan peterson and so forth
you might be sitting here thinking like by this point
like oh leo you're one of these cultural marxists and
post-modernists that he keeps talking about no actually what i'm
saying here is something way more advanced and nuanced and
complicated than post-modernism post-modernism has some important truths about relativity
within it but post-modernism post-modernism itself contains um certain performative
contradictions and lack of awareness of its own biases and
and sort of logical illogical contradictions so actually what i'm
what i'm talking about here is not post-modernism and it's
not cultural marxism and it's not just some ideology i
learned in university in some you know social studies class
or whatever gender studies class i'm talking about something much
deeper here i'm talking about metaphysics and epistemology i'm talking
about becoming conscious of the very structure of your mind
and awakening to your true identity this is beyond anything
that is taught in universities or that any post-modernist or
relativist or cultural marxist or socialist or communist understands it's
beyond anything that social construction theorists and academics understand i'm
talking about literally the process by which your entire mind
constructs the universe this is very radical and if you
think we've gone deep here no this is just the
tip of the spear even now an hour and a
half into this talk this is just a tip of
the spear of this issue if you're interested in more
i recommend you check out my other episodes i have
many episodes dealing with epistemic metaphysical and philosophical topics that
will take you deeper into this work this work is
so deep it can't be covered in in even 10
episodes there's way too much way too much here and
it's it's way too threatening you would never be able
to stomach all of it at once many people would
struggle just to reach this point in the episode because
they would have clicked off by now probably an hour
ago because it got too heavy for them this is
not stuff most people want to think about but also
this is amazing stuff to think about do you know
how amazing it is to free yourself of being attached
to any identity any finite identity man woman child adult
young old gay straight trans unicorn attack helicopter living creature
that's a good one to transcend you know after you
transcend being a man and a woman and uh after
you transcend being young or old and after you transcend
being human try transcending being alive that's what i teach
that's the pinnacle of everything i teach everything i teach
is designed to help you to jailbreak your mind of
the various social constructions that you've adopted just unconsciously being
born in society and culture to deconstruct all those to
ultimately get to your true identity which is infinity that's
what you really want you don't know that you want
this yet you don't understand what infinity is as an
identity if you did you would you would be so
floored so i'm trying to guide you towards realizing your
infinite identity but we have to do it in a
sort of a roundabout way inch by inch because you're
gonna you're a stubborn mule and you're gonna resist all
the way that's how the mind is but also you
could like you know go along willingly you don't have
to be a stubborn mule about this you could open
your mind and actually be excited about this stuff because
i mean this is exciting this is the best news
there is why would you be want to limit yourself
to a man woman unicorn identity why why don't you
want to become everything do you see how stupid it
is to think of yourself as just a man or
a woman or trans now i understand why you do
it you're afraid you're afraid of letting it all go
whether you're a conservative or even if you're a progressive
you're still afraid of letting go of your identity and
see progressives are sneaky they're they're constructing identities in a
higher way than conservatives so that makes progressives think that
oh well i'm i'm superior to a conservative because i'm
more open-minded and liberal and so forth yeah you are
but just by like an inch and um and you're
still stuck in your your progressive identity and you still
get offended and you're still insecure deep down inside if
you check you're still insecure if you're trans you're still
you're completely insecure about your identity and you're not able
to love yourself completely i mean yeah yeah you've you've
worked on it hard let's say and you've you've gone
as far as you you've come and that that's that's
been good you've needed that to you know to survive
and to get to where you are you've made great
strides let's say if you're gay lesbian bisexual transsexual whatever
you've made great strides especially in the social environment you
were in which was hostile to you when you were
growing up and so forth i totally get it and
i totally get why you want to change culture to
be more accommodating and less marginalizing and oppressive i totally
get it but um i'm just here to tell you
there's higher to go way harder to go and you're
still playing games and you're getting stuck in the culture
wars in the identity politics you're still getting stuck you're
getting triggered by people like jordan peterson just the fact
that jordan peterson triggers you already shows you that there's
something you're not understanding about yourself and nature and him
and um that there's a toxic dynamic going on there
so just like he's disowning you you're disowning him and
it's a it's not a it's not a it's not
a sustainable or truthful or healthy ultimate long-term situation but
see there's a point of commonality between you progressives and
conservatives because see as a progressive let's say you're like
a trans progressive or bisexual or whatever um you have
a deep personal experience felt experience of how difficult it
is to to grapple with your identity your sexual identity
and how confusing it's been and all that and the
whole ordeal you went through but what you should be
able to recognize about the conservative is that the conservatives
they also struggle with that just in their own way
in their own conservative way see they are struggling just
as much as you struggled to figure out your trans
identity the conservatives struggle just as much every day to
maintain their conservative identity because they're scared of losing that
identity and you might say well what are they scared
of leo there's nothing to be scared of well but
look at all the challenges you faced when you came
out with your weird non-binary non-ordinary identity look at look
at all the abuse and ridicule you got look of
the lack of acceptance and love you receive look at
all the judgment and hate you got and now recognize
that that's precisely what the conservative is scared of the
only difference between you and the conservative is that you
took on that challenge with courage and you faced it
whereas the conservative doesn't even want to open that door
to that challenge because he's too scared of it and
also what would happen if everybody inside he did this
all at once you have to be honest that society
could collapse if everybody did this all at once that
is a legitimate concern now that doesn't mean you have
to be paranoid about it it doesn't mean you have
to become a hater and a homophobe and a sexist
and all this anti-trans because of that but but you
have do you understand that where the anti-trans sentiment ultimately
comes from and the homophobia comes from and the sexism
comes from it comes from a deep gut level fear
of what these significant changes and openings to relativity would
lead to and the kind of degradation of society social
structures that it might result in how it might destroy
families or the raising of children or marriage or religious
traditions that people are very attached to or even workplace
hierarchies and orders now see as a progressive you say
well who gives a [ __ ] leo yeah let's
destroy all the hierarchies and orders doesn't matter let's flatten
the hierarchy to zero well see the problem is that
you don't understand what you're really asking for because if
that happened in one fell swoop tomorrow i'm telling you
society would collapse now that doesn't mean that we can't
make changes it just means that you have to appreciate
that there's it's very important what your rate of change
is and that just because you're progressive and very open-minded
you're more tolerant of change but there are other people
in society the majority of actually people the conservatives who
are not so tolerant of change that's not because they're
bad people it's simply because they're not conscious enough nor
secure enough in themselves and they don't have an environment
which allows them that luxury of change the majority of
of people around the world are living in such conditions
that they don't even have the luxury to sit around
watching this video and entertaining lofty ideas about the relativity
of identity no the majority of people if they don't
go to work tomorrow on time then their kids will
go hungry and that's all they care about that's their
highest priority in life and they are barely able to
do that because their country doesn't afford them the economic
conditions the job opportunities the technology the infrastructure the political
you know structures to do that which is exactly why
things like trans rights and gay rights are virtually non-existent
in underdeveloped countries because that's a luxury to them to
them they just need basic water food medicine vaccines education
like very very basics of job opportunities a currency that's
not going to crash and inflate within a week you
know a basic sense of democracy that's not just a
tyranny or a propaganda state or something these are the
basic things that they need you as a progressive need
to realize this so uh really the the sort of
the curse of being a progressive is that in a
sense you're at the at the cutting edge of the
evolution of culture and society that is great in a
certain sense you're on the vanguard but in other sense
you got to realize that the cutting edge there's more
there's more to the knife blade than just the cutting
edge and that you have to bring the entire knife
blade with you if you want to advance the edge
you can't just move the edge and leave the rest
of the knife blade behind and the rest of the
knife blade has more inertia and mass and bulk and
volume than just the edge the edge can move faster
in a certain sense if you only consider it separate
from the rest of the mass but that mass has
inertia and it it creates resistance so that's what you're
experiencing as a progressive you're the edge experiencing the resistance
and inertia of the rest of the blade and so
for you to evolve higher beyond your progressivism you'd have
to integrate that that will move you into spiral dynamics
tier 2 stage yellow so yeah the trick with relativity
is it becomes very complex and confusing you don't know
how to ground yourself it becomes more difficult to create
an identity but also there are advantages the advantage is
that you have more freedom now of course with freedom
comes responsibility so even though you have more freedom if
you don't exercise responsibility a lot more can go wrong
in a sense the man woman these categories were invented
for idiots you're born you just take you accept one
or the other and then that's it easy simple you
have to think about it you have to create anything
more it's already been created for you whereas if you're
going to be truly creating your own identity whether you're
doing spiritual work personal development work or you're just you
know trying to figure out your sexual identity and you're
creating something new uh you're in uncharted waters there's more
mistakes you could make and uh you're just kind of
like flying by the seat of your pants you're not
really sure what you're doing it could turn out great
could turn out awful those are the pros and cons
and you have to be very responsible and wise in
how you exercise your freedoms but it's also great because
if you truly do become conscious and responsible and wise
and you do educate yourself with that freedom you can
do a lot you can do amazing things in the
world with that freedom but for that you need a
very deep study and understanding of yourself human psychology philosophy
epistemology metaphysics consciousness emotions awareness developmental psychology sociology and many
other important topics which i cover on this channel so
you're in the right place if this conversation has a
sparked a curiosity within you good that was the point
now follow up with it remember that i am not
here to teach you an ideology or to shove ideas
down your throat i am here to guide you towards
a personal investigation into the nature of your own mind
and by the way when i talk about deconstruction some
people will confuse that with the post-modernist deconstruction of jacques
dereda that is not what i mean by deconstruction when
i say deconstruction i don't use it in that technical
philosophical sense i say deconstruction in its most abstract and
general sense in the sense of undoing the house of
cards that you've constructed throughout the rest the entirety of
your life to get you to the point where you're
at today for me deconstruction is just questioning everything without
bias the mistake that most people do when they try
to do deconstruction or debunking or skepticism is that they
misuse it by applying it selectively against the things that
they don't like and not to their own pet ideas
and theories and in this way the deconstruction becomes just
another tool of the ego mind and just reinforces the
constructions that the ego mind has created so in this
way the ego mind weaponizes deconstruction it's a very very
sneaky maneuver a very common trap that many scientifically minded
and skeptically minded people fall into so i'm all for
skepticism i'm the biggest skeptic there is but you have
to apply your skepticism without any biases whatsoever and you
have to especially apply to the constructions of your own
mind that's the true function of skepticism is applying it
to the constructions of yourself um and that's not how
most people use skepticism most people have weaponized it so
yeah this this this channel actualize.org is a massive deconstruction
project it's such a massive deconstruction project that most people
who get into it and watch my content don't understand
that that's what it is they confuse it for beliefs
ideas philosophy ideology models just another self-help teaching just on
their spiritual teaching it's not that it's a radical deconstruction
of everything that your mind constructs and it's such a
radical deconstruction that even the deconstruction process itself will of
course in the strange loop have to be itself deconstructed
because even the deconstruction process you're using is a construction
that you've constructed to do your deconstruction which has to
be deconstructed if what you truly want is an entire
total complete deconstruction there is a big difference between a
construction that does deconstruction and deconstructs everything except itself and
a deconstruction or rather i'd say a construction which deconstructs
everything and then also deconstructs itself leaving behind not even
deconstruction are you getting that difference that's a key difference
this is post modernism this is awakening this is spirituality
in its genuine form this is academic mental masturbation so
i hope that clears it up for you uh really
you're not gonna be able to understand these issues without
contemplating them very deeply so i recommend you go check
out some of my prior episodes specifically that explain how
to do high quality contemplation i have an episode called
contemplation i have an episode called how to use a
journal for contemplation or contemplation using a journal one of
those i forget the wording exactly and i have episodes
called introspection i have a lot of episodes i have
episodes about how to ask questions because contemplation is basically
questioning how to question i have an episode called how
to discover what is true that one would be very
useful for you and basically what you want to start
to now study if you want to get to the
sort of bottom of things i said here is you
want to study epistemology i have many episodes about epistemology
and you want to you want to study relativity i
have an episode called understanding relativism part one and i'm
soon gonna be releasing a part two because relativity that's
that's the core concept here right ultimately what all that
i've said in this episode is that all identity is
relative that's all i've said everything else is just an
elaboration upon that point all identity is relative if you
understand that you've understood everything there's nothing else to understand
about what i said here but the problem is that
people don't understand that it's very difficult to understand that
in the same way that it's not easy to understand
that time and space are relative i mean look think
about it this way a hundred years ago albert einstein
proved and demonstrated to the whole world that time and
space are relative and people still don't fathom the significance
of that people actually believe that objects are a certain
length and height that's not the case general relativity says
that an object doesn't have a length or a height
an object's length or height depends on the velocity at
which you're approaching it and the velocity at which it's
moving so you might think that i'm six foot two
i am conventionally speaking but i'm only six foot two
assuming that you're moving at a certain velocity and that
i'm moving at a certain velocity if we were moving
at different velocities i would not be six foot two
literally now you might say oh that's just philosophy no
it's not philosophy that was albert einstein's geniuses to is
to realize that i am not actually six foot two
when the whole world assumed that i am that's essentially
what albert einstein discovered but people still don't don't fathom
this they don't care about this because it doesn't matter
for your everyday life but people still have yet to
acknowledge our society still has yet to acknowledge that all
identity is relativistic good luck getting a scientist to to
agree that a rock is not a rock or a
human is not a human it's not going to compute
because these are not scientific questions these are meta scientific
questions but anyways i ramble on long enough you get
the idea is gender a social construction yes but even
social construction is a social construction and ultimately reality is
deeper than just a social construction reality is a construction
of consciousness or infinite mind so there is something deeper
going on than just social construction one of the objections
to social construction is people say well leo but then
if social construction is true then anything goes no not
anything goes people say well leo but if social construction
is true and you're saying what walls are socially constructed
well why can't i walk through a wall then if
i'm socially constructing it no first of all i didn't
say that walls are social construction walls are a mental
construction which is different from a social construction it's a
deeper order of construction there are many layers to construction
so a wall is a mental construction but then you
say well why can't i imagine the wall being transparent
to walk through it precisely because a wall is a
physical object that you are constructing that you're not conscious
of how you're constructing it therefore you can't unconstruct it
if you could become conscious enough to deconstruct your construction
of a physical wall you would be able to walk
through it but you don't know how to do that
because you're not conscious enough nor is that something that
the ego can control see the other objection people have
said well leo but why don't you do it then
show us a demonstration well see because the problem is
there how you define you you define me as the
ego self the ego self doesn't have access to deconstructing
physical walls the universal self does not the ego self
so leo can't do it as an ego you can't
do it for a selfish purpose you can't do it
because you want to show off to somebody or because
you want to materialize a million dollars for yourself that's
not how it works you have to understand that when
we're saying mental construction i'm saying something very very nuanced
very advanced and very sophisticated it is not a simplistic
stupid sort of law of attraction idea where it's like
oh all you got to do is just sit there
and imagine there's no wall and the wall will disappear
i'm not saying something so stupid in general when i
say something for future reference it would be wise of
you to assume that i'm saying something intelligent rather than
something stupid and you will be more right than wrong
the things i'm teaching here are very very very advanced
there's only a handful of people on this planet who
can fathom the things that i'm saying here and those
people aren't watching me because they don't need to so
just again like i started this episode i asked you
do you really want to understand we have to come
back to that we have to close with that do
you really want to understand how much do you really
want to understand and how much are you just playing
games and defending your ideas of the world if you
really truly want to understand then you'll you'll be willing
to surrender your ideas of how the world is and
you'll embark then on an investigation a genuine investigation where
you might discover some things that's the people i'm talking
to it's very difficult to communicate these things especially to
people with very short attention spans who are careless and
flippant and closed-minded and think they understand the world everything
in the world is more complicated than you think it's
more twisted and counterintuitive than you think so don't just
trust your intuitions if you think you understand something like
gender or physical walls or humans or science you don't
understand any of these things notice that you have not
investigated any of these things all you have are just
your prejudices and beliefs that you've picked up from somebody
else you haven't sat down and contemplated the nature of
a physical wall for 100 hours if you did you
would be much more open-minded to some of the things
that i'm saying all right that's it i'm don here

actualized and i recently launched a new channel the actualized
clips channel where if you don't have the patience to
sit through a long two-hour episode you can get little
bite-sized five 10-minute clips there so make sure you subscribe
to that um people seem to be loving it so
far and we still got a lot of work to
do on it so there will be hundreds and thousands
of clips coming over the next year or two and
um and that is that and then the final thing
i'll say to wrap all this up is i'm working
to make my work more accessible beyond just the actualized
clips channel and in fact this episode here was one
of my early attempts to make my work more accessible
that means i'm going to be talking about more controversial
topics sort of topical topics topics that are in the
news questions common questions that people have and all of
this is is an effort to of course attract attract
more viewers um but also because at this point my
work has gotten so sort of deep and esoteric that
i have to we're sort of starting to hit an
inflection point where we have to kind of come back
out and tackle just more practical matters and kind of
like more common questions that people have and one of
the things that i'll be experimenting with in the future
is i will be releasing some shorter content so i
will still be doing long two-hour episodes here and there
as i always have but um i'm also gonna try
to do some short ones in fact this was supposed
to be a short one believe it or not when
i first sat down to to to plan this episode
out i didn't really plan i'm just riffing here i
don't have any notes or anything but um when i
first started planning it out i'm like okay well maybe
i'll do it in 30 minutes i want to i
want to do something like in a 30 minute range
um but then i'm like who am i kidding this
this topic will definitely take two hours so here we
are of course two hours in um but i i
promise for sure that over the next few months you
will see me publishing some shorter episodes on the main
channel that are not going to be clips but they're
also not going to be these long two-hour you know
spiels these are going to be like i'm going to
try to do 20 30 minute episodes we'll see the
problem is that my mind is so interconnected with everything
that i always want to interconnect everything and it takes
two [ __ ] hours to do so um but
i will i have to retrain my mind and i
promise i'll do some more casual episodes on more casual
topics some of you might hate that some of you
might like that i mean it's still gonna be profound
stuff either way um i'm gonna i'm gonna try to
make it uh appealing for both the casual and sort
of the hardcore folk and uh i'll i'll receive your
feedback on that and then depending on how the feedback
is i'll adjust maybe i'll do more of that maybe
i'll go back and do the longer stuff i don't
know we'll see i'm i'm experimenting i'm at this point
where i've done a lot of a lot of very
deep material and i've built up a long catalog of
that stuff the problem is that this catalog is so
deep 95 of people who view my stuff will never
will never even scratch like the surface of that catalog
so in a certain sense it doesn't make that much
sense for me just to keep like pumping out more
and more and more like crazy depth because the majority
of people just can't fathom what's already there so now
my focus is maybe shifting a little bit more towards
how do i how do i make this stuff more
accessible without compromising the quality of it so that's always
the trick there so anyways i look forward to releasing
some of those stay tuned for those and then give
me feedback and i will take it into account and
adjust accordingly you
