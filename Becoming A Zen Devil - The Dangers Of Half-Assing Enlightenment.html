hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about becoming a Zen
devil the dangers of half-assing enlightenment for a while now
I've wanted to address this problem and the dangers that
I see with neo-advaita neo advisor what is this exactly
well it's this tendency in the West especially especially in
modern times to basically say oK we've got this thing
called non-duality great so let's take a look at all
these different traditions we've got Christian non-duality Islamic non duality
the Buddhist non duality Hindu non duality that's what advising
you invited is I mean regular advisor is is just
basically a school of Indian non duality so what happens
is that people see that and they say well there's
all this bad stuff with religion there's all this kind
of traditional ritualistic stuff all these beliefs and dogmas so
you know we're very advanced here in the West so
what we're going to do in our infinite wisdom is
we're going to take the techniques and strip all the
spiritual traditions of any adornments or any belief systems and
just take the techniques so we'll take for example advaita
vedanta we'll strip it of all its cultural baggage we'll
bring it to the west and now we'll just teach
a very direct method for enlightenment and what could possibly
go wrong with that this is a tendency that we
see here in the West in America and in Europe
and generally speaking I'm kind of of two opinions about
this trend I think that in a sense it's good
because some of the traditional baggage that comes with these
techniques and core teachings about non duality is quite frankly
outdated and unnecessary but it can lead to problems there
are dangers and that's what I'm going to talk about
here so before we get to that though I want
to really set this point drive this point home by
talking about Mount Hiei the founding of Mount Hiei in
Japan this is one of the most hardcore non-dual school
rules and traditions that exists and it still exists today
even though it was founded over a thousand years ago
so here's a little back story about Mount Hiei this
is where you find the marathon monks of Mount Hiei
if you've heard me talking about that before in my
strong determination sitting video so Mount Hiei is a mountain
near Kyoto the ancient capital of Japan and back when
Zen was first getting started and there were multiple schools
of Zen there was a guy by the name of
Saito who was one of the first people who wanted
to found a monastic order on the mountain of he
a he was a very upstanding principled guy and he
was very serious and very scholarly so what he actually
did to ensure that the Japanese have a Zen tradition
is he actually traveled by ship on a perilous journey
all the way to China this was in 800 AD
roughly speaking he traveled to China he spent years in
China learning from the greatest Shan masters learning about Buddhism
learning about Taoism learning about the Chinese forms of Zen
gathering hundreds if not thousands of scriptures reading them translating
them understanding them and then bring them all back to
UM to Kyoto in Japan and then starting his school
in Mount he he actually died before the school was
really built but after him then he had students who
took on the the lineage and they founded Mount Hiei
with many hundreds of temples there where they practice to
send very hardcore so what I want to do is
I want to read to you an excerpt from a
book that mentions the history about here because this is
very illuminating and this really drives the point home about
Zen devilry so here it is quote temples began to
conduct trade and establish commercial concerns to increase the size
of their Treasuries each large temple functioned as more or
less an independent entity and engage large numbers of assistant
priests and lay brothers to maintain and protect their establishment
attracted by the promise of free food and lodging the
ranks of the temple aides and lay workers were rapidly
infiltrated by vagabonds brigands and eventually mercenaries contrary to the
strict injunctions of sideshow who is dead by this point
horses cattle and weapons were now provisioned on Mount Hiei
and each monastic faction on the mountain organised its own
militia justifying such Armed Forces is absolutely necessary to protect
Buddhism from its enemies as each faction strove to improve
his fortunes and consolidate his position conflicts arose between rival
gangs and attacks and violent reprisals became commonplace buildings were
constantly being torched and the entire mountain turned into one
large camp there were disputes over territorial claims funds selection
of officials and even fights over who had precedence in
bathing in the monastic bathhouses during the turbulent medieval period
some of the abbot's were in office only a day
or two before being ousted by one fashion or another
Hiei Marauders took on the temple armies and ruthlessly attacked
any new Buddhist sect that dared to attempt to establish
itself even though nearly all the leaders of these new
schools were originally the same Hiei monks they turned on
their form rad comrades-in-arms and burned every one of their
sects temples in Kyoto to the ground in the process
slaughtering every adherent they could lay their hands on the
new Sheren sect in Kyoto never recovered from that blow
by the middle of the 15th century an internal corruption
of he a the first training site in Japan to
have banned alcohol in all sexual activity was now overrun
with drunkards sodomites rapists and [ __ ] and finally
in 5th 1871 a battalion of 25,000 of the Emperor's
troops unleashed a furious assault on the mountain fortress in
key a torching all the buildings and massacring the inmates
the conflagration lit up the sky for three days and
three nights and the ashes of some three thousand temples
blanketed the capital and quote that's from John Stevens's books
from John Stephens book the marathon monks of Mount Hiei
where he goes into a lot of depth about this
incredible history of Zen and this specific form of them
found on this mountain now why do I mention this
well because take a look what's going on take a
look at the meta picture these guys here these were
not just random guys just doing some fluffy form of
spiritualities or serious practitioners they were very serious about becoming
enlightened and some of them were enlightened and yet look
at the chaos and carnage that resulted on that mountain
what this demonstrates is a lack of understanding of history
human psychology and systems thinking and this is just one
of the traps that can happen to you on this
path of non-duality see people think when I teach non-duality
sometimes I hear this and I'm in fact I'm I'm
noticing this trend of people who follow me are espousing
this very simplistic notion of enlightenment as though there's just
this one insight there's just one existential insight to be
had and then BAM as soon as I have that
insight then that's it that's the end of seeking that's
the end of illusion that's the end of everything that's
the end of personal development there's no more need to
improve myself there's no more need to learn there's no
more need to do any of this kind of stuff
and that is just like BAM it's just that simple
but that's a very simplistic notion of enlightenment what I
want to point out to you is that enlightenment is
a little bit more nuanced than that and in fact
if you have any common sense you should expect it
to be a little more nuanced than that because if
it was just that damn simple then we wouldn't have
all the complexity nuance and richness that we find in
all the various mystical traditions around the world some of
these schools are very elaborate almost Byzantine in their rituals
in their prescriptions in their practices and their techniques in
their teachings in their theory in their concepts of cosmology
in the world now you might think that oh well
all of that is just tradition and Dogma and we
don't need any of that but then that actually leads
you to the opposite end of the negative spectrum so
I hear you you want to move away from the
dogma and the tradition okay but then if you swing
your pendulum too much to the other side then you
get the Zen devil and this is where people think
that all okay so there's just one monolithic enlightenment experience
and then once I have that that means no more
values no more principles no more passion no more pursuit
of mastery no more goals no more purpose no more
vision no more career no more business no more relationships
no more pursuit of excellence no more education no more
hard work no more thinking no more planning no more
strategizing no more caring and if you are interpreting non-duality
in that fashion ah that's a very naive understanding of
non-duality if you take a look and you do a
broader survey of the history and the various mystical traditions
as I encourage you to do then what you will
see is that the greatest masters have very strong principles
very strong values enormous passion a to mastery a commitment
to excellence they're very hardworking they make plans and goals
they don't just sit around on their ass they're not
lazy they're not slobs they're not slovenly they conduct business
they engage the world they care about society they care
about ecology they care about relationships and in general they're
very caring individuals enlightenment doesn't make you less caring it
should make you more caring otherwise what you're doing is
you're doing enlightenment in the Zen devil way and really
an individual who thinks like this this kind of simplistic
notion enlightenment to me it shows that they've never been
face-to-face with a great master and I can understand that
great masters can be hard to find but you know
what they do exist right now in the 21st century
you can find them and I found various ones and
I've been face to face with them it's one thing
to read about enlightenment in a book somewhere it's another
thing to actually be in front of a master because
this thing this non-duality thing is not a book learning
thing it's embodied and it's not even you sitting on
a meditation cushion and having some amazing brilliant insights into
the nature of reality I mean it is that but
it's a lot more than just that and you can
only sense that and appreciate it when you meet a
great master face to face it's a remarkable thing I
mean could you imagine if you've read anything about zen
and zen temples and how strict the zen tradition is
could you imagine that you're a monk in a zen
temple and you've been there you've been on the cushion
working towards enlightenment and then all the sudden you have
a big breakthrough enlightenment experience and then the next day
you know they ring the gong to wake up at
4:00 a.m. to meditate you only sleep for like four
to five hours every night it's a pretty grueling schedule
and your meta dating long hours then you're working in
the kitchen and then you're you're cleaning the temple and
doing all this stuff could you imagine that they ring
the gong at 4:00 a.m. everyone's getting up and you're
like now you know guys I like it got enlightened
last night why should I be waking up at 4
a.m. wake it up at 4 a.m. I mean that's
for the unenlightened people I'm enlightened so I'm going to
sleep in till like noon and then I'm going to
wake up I'm gonna go eat whatever I want them
to order a pizza drink some soda maybe we can
get some vodka in here you know then I'm gonna
go I think I'm gonna go go out maybe go
hit on some girls you know it doesn't matter after
all I've realized all this is just an illusion so
I can play the game however I want can you
imagine that kind of insolence in a Zen temple what
would they do to you they would beat you they
would physically beat you and throw you out of the
temple or could you imagine that you become enlightened then
you come to your master you say ok that's it
I'm enlightened now so no more I don't need to
meditate anymore don't need to do anything anymore the master
would probably slap you in the face if you said
that or could you imagine coming up to your master
and saying oh yeah I had I had this most
amazing enlightenment experience I don't need to study anymore I
don't need to read the books I don't need to
read the scriptures I don't need to care about any
of that kind of stuff again he would slap you
in the face in fact you wouldn't even get that
far because when you're face to face with the great
master just the way he looks at you it's like
a a wolf looking at a rabbit alright you are
in no position to espouse this sort of philosophy of
nothing matters anymore there's no further to go there's no
more room for growth values go out the window I
can just be slobbing Lee and lazy you know I'm
walking through the Zen temple and I'm I'm smoking a
cigarette and then I'm just going to throw that cigarette
into the air into their sand garden can you imagine
that they would beat for that they would beat you
and kick you out now someone might say but leo
all this stuff you know yeah it might be true
but you're talking about Zen Zen is after all a
religion it's very strict and ritualized and it seems like
what you're doing here is you're you're idolizing you're talking
about these masters as though they're these like you're putting
them on a pedestal like they're these super enlightened people
that we can never to be no yes it's true
that in Zen there is ritual and there is dogma
and there's religious elements and there's tradition and you know
what I'm one of the most anti traditional guys you'll
find out there I don't really like tradition for traditions
sake but I've studied enough I see enough of the
big picture of how mysticism works that I can see
that there's wisdom in tradition not all tradition is just
tradition for traditions sake there's actually a lot of very
deep wisdom embedded in it so when you throw out
all tradition the way neo invited tends to do and
all you do is you go for the most straight
direct method for existential insights okay that's great I like
that idea but you can't throw out the other important
stuff like strong principles ethics having a good character emotional
development and so forth otherwise you're going to become a
Zen devil and you're going to lead to a lot
of chaos and damage that's what's going to happen these
masters I don't put them on a pedestal um I
don't subscribe to any one master but what I do
do is I recognize skill and excellence wherever I see
it whether I'm watching an amazing movie by some amazing
director or I'm reading an amazing book or I'm looking
at an amazing piece of art I can recognize the
excellence there that doesn't mean I need to put the
person on some sort of pedestal as above me in
any existential sense but I do see that man this
guy has really gone to some remarkable lengths to master
this field and that's amazing and there's something valuable there
whether it's non-duality or any other kind of field right
this is just uh caring about excellence and caring about
mastery here's an important distinction that I want you to
make small non-duality versus big non-duality you might say well
leo how can there be two non dualities after all
it's just non duality how come you're subdividing it here's
what practically tends to happen is that when people first
learn about non duality and they have a few non-dual
experiences they get cocky and what they do is they
pit non-duality against duality and so what this does is
this creates a new higher level of duality veiled as
non duality as you would expect you know someone who
doesn't have a lot of maturity and a lot of
depth of experience and mastery they might be able to
play a good game of tennis or they might be
be able to beat you at martial arts but they're
not masterful at it and also they've got the subtle
signs of cockiness so small non-duality is a sort of
non-duality that pits itself against other schools of non-duality so
there's rivalry there's nitpicking and criticizing there's a tendency to
weaponize the lessons that you learn and then try to
use them against others to make others feel inferior and
to make yourself feel superior and it's also a separation
it's not a full integration yet of the duel and
the non-dual so to appreciate this you understand what big
non-duality looks like and it's really hard to understand big
non duality unless you actually see it embodied in the
master this is what the master is about big non
duality it's humble it's deeply humble it understands and integrates
non-duality and duality both you see it's got both of
them because big non-duality is so non-dual that even the
dual stuff the mundane stuff that a small non-dual person
would poopoo it embraces it because it sees that the
good and the evil in the world even though it's
not existentially true it's still there it's still a part
of the world on a practical level it's also generous
big non-duality you don't see a big non duality practitioner
going out there and waging ideological Crusades or nitpicking or
criticizing other teachers whether they're of the non-dual tradition or
even of the dual tradition a big non duality individual
will take a look at techniques and methods that have
nothing to do with non duality just maybe some basic
self-help techniques and he might say oh you know what
yeah I can see a room for that I can
see a place for therapy therapy could be useful I
can see a place for working on your career and
I can see a place for working on your bad
habits is kind of a basic generic self-help type stuff
I can see a place for that all of that
lays the groundwork and prepares you and introduces you to
the deeper spiritual work or as a small new small
non-dual individual will say oh no all that's nonsense all
of its illusion everything's illusion just go straight for enlightenment
not realizing that some people can't go straight for enlightenment
it might take them a decade to work themselves up
to that see so big non duality is much more
inclusive it's less competitive and this might have been the
key difference that led to the the chaos on Mount
Hiei versus there not being any chaos there right had
the people they are truly been embodying big a new
ality which is a rare thing takes a lot of
years of mastery if they really embody that then maybe
that chaos could have been avoided so I keep talking
about the Zen devil this is a phenomenon and in
Zen it's called Zen Tama TEM MA and it's defined
as one who has the experience of Satori or enlightenment
but has done no scholarly study of the literature that's
a Zen devil they also have a concept called wild
Fox Zen or yakko Zen Y ako yakko's n this
is the opposite end of the spectrum so on this
end we have someone who sits and meditates all day
but doesn't expand his broader knowledge of the world that's
Zen devil and that leads to chaos and problems and
on this end we have the wild Fox Zen which
is someone who does the opposite someone who only reads
the books and knows the theory of Zen but has
no practice and has it had any the insights and
this also leads to a lot of problems and so
ideally what you want is you want to walk right
in the middle of those two and both of those
extremes are going to lead to problems right so when
I hear people saying oh leo you know after enlighten
I don't need to study anymore I need to do
personal development anymore to me that's ridiculous that shows me
that that person's going to become a Zen devil and
all the chaos that comes with being a Zen devil
is going to come out from that it's going to
be a half-assed enlightenment if you still doubt me just
use common sense here common sense will tell us that
we have something called a 10,000 hour rule the 10,000
hour rule says that to master any field of human
being needs to invest at least 10,000 hours into that
field if not more I don't care if you're talking
about golf art music running a business becoming a successful
politician or non-duality all of it requires you to obey
the 10,000 hour rule for mastery now ask yourself just
using very basic common sense why would non duality be
an exception to this rule why is it special what
I want to suggest is that it's not special and
that in fact the field of non-duality is the most
serious field to master it requires even more than the
10,000 hour rule to really master and embody it otherwise
how do you explain why virtually all the greatest masters
of non-duality no matter what tradition they're from have over
10,000 hours of training how else do you explain why
every mystical tradition for the last 5000 years whether it
be Christian Buddhist Hindu Kaaba list or Islamic that all
of them have extremely hard core training disciplines these guys
would make an Olympic athlete training schedule look amateur that's
how hard they go at it Yogi's and monks and
nuns and sages have been training for decades dozens of
hours a day a dozen hours a day for decades
right they've really been working on this and they have
some very hardcore and brutal training techniques if you doubt
that go read up on the marathon monks of Mount
Hiei what they do seems impossible what they do seem
superhuman why do they go through all that is it
just because they are masochists and they enjoy torturing and
flagellating themselves is that why they do it is it
just because of religious tradition is it just dogma is
that why they do it or could it be that
there's something very valuable at the end of that mastery
road and that that's why they do it and that
there really is a lot of stuff to learn about
non-duality beyond merely having a few enlightenment insights could that
be the case hmm interesting to think about you might
wonder well Leo what more could there be to non-duality
or to spirituality than just some enlightenment experiences there's a
lot more a lot more first of all there's different
depths of enlightenment and there's a whole spectrum and variety
of different enlightenment experiences so you might think like walking
leo yeah I can see how you know developing some
good character and developing compassion and love yeah sure that
should be part of the non-dual path but you're not
saying that there's actually like different degrees of enlightenment are
you that wouldn't make any sense after all we're talking
about non duality non-duality just this one thing it's one
monolithic thing um and what I'm telling you is yes
developing character is important but even beyond that if you
don't take on the full mastery path you're not going
to have the deepest levels of consciousness and existential understanding
you will not your enlightenment will be shallow existentially speaking
not even speaking practically you will not really understand what
reality is all about that's highly likely it's very rare
that somebody becomes fully enlightened in one moment just like
BAM it happened that's it I'm fully enlightened all right
let's go home and watch cartoons and eat pizza we're
done here that's extremely rare extremely rare I don't even
know if it ever has happened like that sometimes in
the myths if you go back in your eat thousand-year-old
myths you might read examples of that happening but if
you like a little bit deeper it doesn't tend to
happen that way doesn't seem that way right the Buddha
spent spent six or seven years within rigorous training and
practice to get to the point where he did have
his enlightenment and even that I don't know did he
really have a full enlightenment in one go or then
did he spend many years uhm deepening it keep your
mind open to that possibility also keep your mind open
to the possibility that there are other insights that aren't
perhaps as earth-shaking as a full enlightenment into the nature
of who you are and what reality is but there
it might be other more minor insights which are still
very important and relevant and very interesting and fascinating and
worth your while to have I'll talk more about that
in the future but for now keep your mind open
to it so if all you do is you go
for this one monolithic enlightenment thing you find out what
you are but then you're missing all these are the
minor insights that would be a shame also what more
there is to enlightenment is emotional mastery this is a
huge component in fact probably the biggest component of enlightenment
is not the having of an Enlightenment insight but then
the bringing it down and letting it transform your entire
mind structure and your emotional reactions and patterns changing all
of that that takes a lot of time and a
lot of work and it doesn't happen spontaneously and automatically
the way that naively some people expect this is probably
one of the biggest traps that creates Zen Devils and
all their chaos is they think that just because they
saw something that now oh I'm a master and that's
it there's nothing more to do and then they run
amok in the real world then you have all sorts
of problems like they become greedy power-hungry leads to sexual
abuse to stealing to all sorts of unethical behavior because
they haven't really mastered their Shadowside they haven't done any
shadow work they've dismissed psychology as unimportant because they've made
the mistake of thinking that oh now that I've experienced
the transcended absolute truth and I've transcended my mind that
that solves all the problems but it doesn't because you
know what you have to come back into your mind
your mind has to integrate and bring back down to
earth this very lofty existential insight and then you're back
in everyday world and your mind it doesn't change instantly
you have a brain in here all those neurons have
to rewire and that's in some cases a way harder
than just breaking through to enlightenment what more there is
to enlightenment is unconditional love and the cultivation of that
love in all situations that's extremely um difficult to do
and that takes much more additional work relationships are another
facet of enlightenment learning how to have enlightened relationships with
people the bad patterns that you learn throughout your entire
childhood and adulthood until you became enlightened those bad habits
in your relationships will carry over and they will still
remain even after you've become enlightened so you're gonna have
to work on your relationships you want to have successful
ones ones where you don't abuse and manipulate people take
advantage of them and so forth if you want to
have a marriage if you want to have a girlfriend
or a boyfriend you want to make that work if
you want to have good relations with your children you
have to work on all that also all your other
negative bad habits your drinking habit your prescription medication habit
your bad eating habit especially in Western society we have
all these negative habits so one of the real dangers
of neo-advaita is that you forget about this and you
have a breakthrough into existential truth and then you come
back and because you in a very toxic Western culture
all these bad habits you had they're still there you
can transcend the mind but the mind still will run
the body um you see and those patterns of how
your mind runs the body those could be very negative
and destructive also what more there is to enlightenment is
education there's a lot to learn about the world sure
you could be inlined about the ultimate truth of God
and existence but then you're ignorant about a great many
things you can't point to Pakistan on the map or
you don't know about politics or you go voting for
the wrong president and then that leads to a nuclear
holocaust right education does matter that's important everything that you
try to do in the practical mundane world requires knowledge
technical skills and understanding and you're not going to solve
that problem by just experiencing existential absolute truth what else
is important is being a good citizen and also community
is very important it's possible that you become enlightened but
then you're not a good citizen and you don't give
a [ __ ] about the community and then your
community turns into the kind of hellhole that Mount Hiei
became where everyone is running around raping each other right
or you're not contributing to the community or you're not
caring about the community all these things are important things
to say that all I'm enlightened and I'm living in
this dream everything is an illusion so [ __ ]
the community I don't give a [ __ ] about
the community that just shows you how little enlightenment you
actually embody on a day to day basis having an
ethical career is important to just because you're enlightened and
then you're working at a slaughterhouse or you're working on
Wall Street or you're working in politics or you're working
somewhere else where you're causing a lot of damage to
the ecology to the community to your society the world
this is not cool this is not cool you're going
to want to have a career where you're contributing in
a positive conscious manner to the world and helping the
world and your community raise its level of consciousness you're
going to want that and if you're missing that component
that's going to create suffering for you and also it's
just not going to be part of a real commitment
to non-duality you see a commitment to non-duality is not
just to no non-duality it's to embody it transcending your
culture is also going to be an important part just
because you're enlightened does not mean you've transcended your culture
there can be a lot of negative nasty things about
your culture will you which you can still be perpetuating
for example if you live in a racist culture then
you might still be an enlightened racist now that might
sound paradoxically leo how can one be an enlightened racist
but actually think about it these racist tendencies have been
programmed into your brain physically programmed from your birth for
twenty thirty forty fifty years then you become enlightened you
see existential truth but those again those bad habits and
that programming is still in there that needs to be
unwired it's not going to happen spontaneously of its own
see you have to make an effort and also there's
many limitations to culture so it's not just like racism
but you might become an ideological Crusader where now you
think that your culture is the best culture because let's
say you use your cultural techniques to become enlightened then
you try to force every other culture to transform and
to buy into your culture otherwise you attack and you
criticize them that could certainly be um something that happens
to you if you don't engage in this effort to
become more multicultural more worldly more cosmopolitan in your understanding
of all the different mystical as I talked about last
week transcending of various ideologies is also very important just
because your light does not mean you don't have ideological
biases and dogmas and letting those go again that can
be tricky what more is there to enlightenment there's your
physical health taking care of your physical body making sure
it's well nourished making sure you're getting the right nutrition
and exercise there's developing good character morals and ethics matter
there's ecology concern for the environment concern for the globe
concern for other beings that are not human for animals
for plant life and so forth there's also spiritual powers
that one can develop there's actually a lot more to
spirituality than just non duality and I'll talk specifically about
that in the future but there's all sorts of interesting
spiritual powers and various phenomenon that you can experience you
can use to help heal people to help teach people
better to help to understand people and so forth some
people go really down a deep down that rabbit hole
and lastly I would say there's understanding I would say
that understanding is even more important than enlightenment because yeah
you can have this one insight into the absolute nature
of things and that of course get to a lot
of understanding about the world that's important but there's more
to understanding than just that it's hard for me to
express how much uhm richer and more enjoyable the insights
that I have had the existential insight that I had
had when I can put them into a broader perspective
in context in my understanding of business society history humanity
evolution science cosmology physics biology physiology you know putting all
that stuff together is so much more rich than just
having a direct insight into who and what you are
I mean that's important don't get me wrong that's important
but there's more to understanding than just that there's a
bigger perspective here for you to have so what I
want to do now is I want to quote you
from another book which drives this point home about the
importance of psychology in pursuing non-duality it says quote post
Satori practice for ha cooing and ha cooing was one
of the Reviver zuv the rinzai zen school so for
Hakka Wien post Satori practice meant finally ceasing to be
preoccupied with his own personal condition and attainment and to
devote himself in his practice to helping and teaching others
finally at long last he realized that true enlightenment is
a matter of endless practice and compassionate functioning and not
something that occurs once and for all in one great
moment on the cushion non-duality especially as it's developed in
21st century America runs the risk of emotional bypass of
imagining that deep-seated emotional problems and character pathology can be
washed away solely by sufficiently deep realization without ever having
to engage psychological problems directly not only did realization fail
to heal deep divisions in our character more and more
it looked as if for many people and in particular
for many Zen teachers practiced opened up bigger and bigger
splits between an idealized compassionate self and the shadow self
where split off and denied sexual competitive and narcissistic fantasies
held sway and quote and that's from a book called
nothing is hidden by Barry maggot so here he talks
about some of the pitfalls of being Oh we focused
on just the non-dual aspects of this path a lot
of people don't realize that being a good person is
separate from enlightenment and you might say well leo why
should i be a good person after all good and
bad is just duality it's just an illusion app but
see again this is a small non dual way of
thinking a large non dual way of thinking understands that
yes good and bad are relative they may not be
existentially true but nevertheless that doesn't mean they aren't important
because non duality includes duality in it see otherwise by
your logic why do anything why wake up in the
morning why tie your shoelaces why drink water why eat
food why wipe your ass after you take a crap
and for that matter why become enlightened in the first
place why I mean it's all just an illusion doesn't
matter does it matter that you became in line -
no doesn't matter enlightenment says it doesn't matter that you
became enlightened but that's not what you actually act like
you don't really have a choice in the matter unless
you kill yourself you know if you want to become
enlightened kill yourself okay fine but otherwise you're still alive
in this world you're still here until you're dead and
you have to choose how you're going to act you're
going to act one way or another you could sit
at home with your shoelaces untied with your ass unwiped
eating Cheetos watching reruns of Seinfeld something like that you
could do that but again I could pose that question
back to you why why do that why not tie
your shoelaces why not wipe your ass why not put
down the bag of Cheetos and why not get up
off your ass off the couch and go do something
good for the world why not there's no reason not
to just as there is no reason to do it
reason is a function of the mind and existence is
beyond that the fact is that there are no reasons
nevertheless values and principles still matter this is the paradox
of non-duality yes existentially speaking values are arbitrary and there
is no good and evil but there's also the practical
level don't get so enlightened or so caught up with
non duality that you forget about the practical trivial level
where it does matter how you act it does matter
how you think it does matter what values and principles
you hold and this is not moralizing someone might say
but Leo you've ranted in the past about not moralizing
and how there are no shoulds and now it seems
like you're telling me that I should be this good
upstanding saintly person why should I do that there's no
reason why you should if you don't want to be
a good standing upstanding person a decent human being I'm
not going to be here standing here convincing you that
you're wrong or that you're evil you're not that's your
choice you can do that if you want to but
you know what true goodness doesn't come from obligation or
from reasons why you should be good it comes spontaneously
just from the fact that you understand that this is
what up high consciousness being does and that's different from
moralization I'm not telling you you should be anyway I'm
telling you you have the option to do whatever you
want in life you can play the game however you
want so the question is how will you choose to
play the game once you've realized that it is just
a game and remember that karma still applies still have
consequences if you say that nothing matters does that mean
that you're okay with me raping your grandma you cool
with that if I rape your grandma or maybe you're
not that cool with that maybe you don't like that
idea if you don't like that idea then maybe you
should have a rule or should have a principle that
says that raping people that's something that's low consciousness that
I don't want to do I'm not going to do
it and then hopefully other people won't do it and
then you know what hey all of a sudden we
had a social contract a social contract where now all
of a sudden we can have a decent community of
people who aren't worried about everybody raping each other see
because your actions have consequences they have consequences and if
you sit on the couch eating your Cheetos that's going
to have consequences so no matter what you do there
will be consequences see this is why these sort of
mystical non dual teachings have been kept secret for centuries
and they have been esoteric one of the reasons why
is because it's been done to prevent abuse people who
do a sloppy form of non-duality can easily become Zen
Devils can abuse it to do all sorts of evil
and harm and in fact they can become extremely dangerous
once they become enlightened and yet they still have weak
values and little compassion for other people they they can
then they can use their new non-dual insights to justify
any kind of actions whatsoever they can rape somebody they
can murder somebody they can raise an army of Crusaders
and go conquering other religions they can start their own
religion you know they can do all sorts of stuff
that has led to a lot of damage in the
past that leads to a lot of suffering and you
are not truly enlightened until you can have compassion for
the suffering that everyone around you is experiencing you might
say well I'm in light now I don't suffer anymore
you might not suffer anymore but how about that little
kid who's not enlightened yet and you see him suffering
how about your mom who will never maybe be enlightened
and you see her suffering how about your community they
as a whole might not be enlightened for another ten
thousand years and yet you see them suffering and as
a part of non-duality you see that all these things
are not separate from you they are you they're literally
you your mom that little kid that community that you're
a part of even the community you're not a part
of it's all you do you have compassion for all
that are you going to lead your life in an
ecological sustainable manner or are you going to be a
zen devil I do not want to create Zen Devils
with my work all of my work everything I teach
should never be interpreted as a weapon to be used
against other people other traditions other religions other ideologies other
non-dual teachers family members friends co-workers [ __ ] evil
people none of this that I'm saying is to be
used against them it's only to be used to embody
non-duality in your own life to take responsibility for everything
to live a conscious life to strive for that to
have values and principles that are in line with higher
consciousness that's what I want this work used for because
man if history has taught us anything it's just how
easy it is to take this work and to twist
it around because the ego loves to twist stuff around
you twist it around you become a Zen devil you
backwards rationalize why you're not a Zen devil and then
you go out there and run amok in the world
and it's even more sad when enlightened person does that
you would think that only unenlightened people could behave that
way No what history shows us is that even very
enlightened people can behave that way very enlightened people can
be [ __ ] can be rapists can be cult
leaders so keep that in mind and don't become a
Zen devil and also don't dismiss the the value of
common sense and goodness I would much rather be surrounded
by a group of common sense and decent human beings
who know nothing at all about enlightenment then a bunch
of people who are all enlightened but have no common
sense and no goodness inside of them all right so
there is work for you to do here even if
you're not enlightened yet and sometimes people think like well
leo so you're talking about this lofty enlightenment thing and
it seems like all this other work that I'm doing
is just a waste it's just a waste why should
I work on this part of my life why should
I care about my relationships because all I need to
do is just reach for enlightenment and then I got
it all and that's a fallacy it's not going to
happen that way the psychological work you're doing now the
very basic personal development stuff taking care of your finances
take care your relationships working on your career finding your
life purpose rearranging your values that you're clear about those
that's all very good stuff and if you're a kind
of person who already has caring and compassion inside of
them even though you're not inlined yet that's awesome that's
great enlightenment can take that to the next level but
still build up that goodness in that compassion with within
and practice it on a daily level you don't need
to wait till you're enlightened until you practice it you
can start practicing it now and you're going to start
to see the rewards and payoffs now not later it's
going to help you with your sufferings can help you
with your emotions it's going to help you with the
success it's going to help you with the people you
attract in your life and so forth so the bottom
line is that this is a nuanced topic and there
are many traps here very many traps and the traps
are found on both sides there's this extreme here and
there's that extreme there you got to find that perfect
balance in between that's why true masters are so rare
because most people get seduced into one trap or another
and never walk that narrow road long enough to really
see the full fruition of non-duality which is what I
want for you so that's it I'm signing off post
