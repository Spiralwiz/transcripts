[Music] you I'm really excited about this episode because this
is gonna be a profound one we're gonna take a
really deep dive into the structure of language thought philosophy
reality post-modernism and non-duality and we're gonna tie all these
things together in a very beautiful and profound way and
there's gonna be a very interesting twist at the end
of this episode so make sure that you stick with
me to the very end I know it can get
a little bit of nerdy and technical at times but
I promise that it'll all come together in a in
a beautiful way which will blow your mind I'm gonna
be citing various sources here a lot of the things
I'm talking about is not my original work but I'm
pulling from other intellectuals namely three sources here that I
want to give credit to first is a book called
Derrida for beginners by Jim Powell second is a paper
called the deconstruction of Buddhism by David Loy and third
is a lecture series that I took a lot of
notes on called the modern intellectual tradition from Descartes to
Derrida by Professor Lawrence Calhoun so I'm gonna be taking
a lot of information ideas from them and mixing them
together with a lot of ideas of my own and
also my insights about mysticism and non-duality and all of
it will come together towards the end but first let's
begin at the beginning which is with Jacques Derrida now
maybe you've heard about Jacques Derrida maybe you've heard about
post-modernism maybe you've heard the word deconstruction he was a
very influential philosopher in the 1960s 70s and 80s his
dates are 1930 to 2004 so he died fairly recently
and he was the father of post structuralism and post-modernism
and these philosophical movements went on to have a pretty
big impact in academic circles in colleges and also in
many other fields from literate literary criticism to philosophy to
to even art and architecture and poetry and and anthropology
and linguistics and just the this-this-this movement was a was
pretty pretty influential but even though you might have heard
about these words like post-modernism or deconstruction or Jacques Derrida
you probably don't really know the details because Derrida is
notoriously difficult to read and deconstruction which was his philosophical
method that he sort of invented it was just a
real mind [ __ ] it was a real challenge
to to figure out exactly what it means what the
practical implications of it are so here I'm gonna give
you an introduction to deconstruction and the ideas of Jacques
Derrida in a very simple manner I don't recommend that
you actually go and bother to waste your time reading
Gyarados work it's brutally difficult notoriously difficult you can read
a sentence or page of what he says and you're
not gonna understand a single damn thing so instead what
I recommend if you are interested in this is just
read the commentaries read the analysis of Darrow das work
don't actually read the work itself unless you're you're really
into philosophy and you're really uh a nerd and maybe
that's what you do professionally so the significance of Derrida
though is that he mounted a radical critique against all
of Western intellectual tradition not just philosophy but also science
and logic and mathematics and basically like I said all
of Western intellectual tradition for the last 2,000 years since
the Greeks and Romans that's a pretty significant thing to
do and of course philosophers we tend to be ambitious
and we tend to be cocky so we can -
like these sorts of things we like to challenge the
establishment but before Derrida really came onto the scene there
was a movement in philosophy in the early early 20th
century called structuralism which was advanced by two men so
sewer and cloud Levy Strauss then Derrida came up Derrida
came into the scene and he turned structuralism sort of
against itself and that led to post structuralism and then
post structuralism gave way to post-modernism and so on and
then with post-modernism there were a lot of thinkers and
intellectuals that came onto the scene that sort of took
derrida's deconstructive method and start to apply to all sorts
of different fields that i mentioned above so what we
need to do first though is we need to go
back to structuralism which is what inspired Derrida so the
the keys to structuralism are very very simple what structure
isn't basically said is it was a it was a
development within the field of linguistics and the linguists were
so sewer and cloud leve Strauss and what they sort
of hit upon was this idea that all symbols in
a language for example all letters in all words those
are symbols that they are all actually arbitrary which of
course makes perfect sense and it's quite obvious but then
again it's the obvious stuff that gets you so let's
make sure you understand this point what is meant by
a symbol being arbitrary is that any word that has
any kind of meaning is a label that was completely
arbitrarily selected and that any other label could serve as
that label so for example if we have the word
tree there's nothing special about those four letters T REE
or the sound tree which designates the actual object in
the real world of a tree we agree that's a
arbitrary designation right right so that's point number one pretty
obvious now point number two is a little more significant
maybe a little harder to swallow but it's a really
profound and this is the point of structuralism it said
that all meanings of symbols are structurally determined by the
difference of the symbols from each other in a network
of symbols so what does this mean this means that
unlike the way we conventionally think a word like tree
isn't merely pointing to a physical object in the world
a tree the word tree gets its meaning by its
association with all the other symbols in the English language
and to really understand what the word tree means you
have to understand all the associated words that come with
that word for example leaf and branch and green and
tall and slender and wood and a bunch of other
symbols this was the key insight of structuralism and then
so what Derrida did is he came and he took
this and he ran with it and actually he sort
of turned it in on itself in a sort of
self reflective self-conscious way he was interested in how language
shapes how we think and also what language says or
knows about itself what happens when you turn language in
on itself and of course to really grasp the significance
of this you have to expand your understanding of the
significance of what a language is language is not just
words like tree and cat and car and the English
language and it's not just all the human languages of
which there are hundreds and maybe even over a thousand
different languages and different dialects and so forth that exist
all around the world and have existed throughout time but
also it includes science logic mathematics and poetry and literary
criticism and philosophy and basically all concepts and all human
thinking so take a moment right now to try to
fathom the significance of what it means to really get
at the heart of what languages or to make a
radical critique of language it doesn't just mean like oh
we're talking about linguistics no no we're talking about all
of humans law we're talking about all concepts we're talking
about all human knowledge there is no knowledge without language
so you can see here that we're going to something
very fundamental and that any kind of changes we make
to our understanding of what languages will have very significant
long-range consequences for a whole host of fields literally every
single field and domain within universities from physics to chemistry
to biology the hard sciences to all the soft sciences
to all the humanities to history to linguistics to anthropology
to all this sort of stuff because all of it
is held together by the glue of language and concepts
and ideas so Derrida comes along and he invents post
structuralism and basically for him what does a symbol mean
the meaning of a symbol comes from two things firstly
all of its historical uses so when we take the
word tree what are all of its historical uses of
course it's changed throughout time and secondly the meaning comes
from the network of all the current symbols in the
entire web of the language that this word is a
part of so let's drop the example of tree let's
pick up a new example like the word science which
is a little bit more complicated a bit more abstract
see with the word tree it seems like well but
Leo you know what what's the meaning of criticizing the
word tree is it really is it really that significant
I mean we know what a tree is right what
can you really criticize about that well maybe then we
need to take a more abstract term like science because
see science a little trickier than tree because tree you
can sort of point to it and say okay that's
a tree but with science a little art or like
what is science have you ever seen science how did
you even come to learn what science was it's a
it's a very abstract and subtle concept and yet people
throw around the word science very casually as though it's
just like a tree as though it's just something obvious
everybody knows what science is well do they really what
does the word science really mean for Derrida he would
say what science really means is first of all all
of the historical uses of that word and you better
believe that that word has evolved over time quite a
bit and what science meant three hundred years ago is
not what science means today or what it'll mean a
hundred years from now our notions of science changes as
we actually do science but also our understanding of science
is never complete unless we bring into the picture all
the other words literally in the English language but let's
uh let's forget the unrelated words let's mostly focus on
the related words so for example to understand science you
also have to understand the word or concept of knowledge
truth proof physical non-physical a model rationality logic contradiction quantity
measurement and even something like religion or something like superstition
you might think that well science is the opposite of
superstition so why would you need to understand superstition to
understand science but of course you do precisely because you
frame it as the opposite so whatever word you're framing
has the opposite to some other word they're defined in
terms of each other so for many people they think
of science like ah science is the opposite of religion
or it's the opposite of superstition so all that informs
what you think science is but of course not merely
just these 10 words that I mentioned or so what
Derrida is saying is that you literally have to pull
in every single word in the English language that has
ever been used throughout the history of the English language
from it's very inception in order to truly understand what
the word science means because this word is like one
node in a giant graph that expands infinitely in all
directions connected to every other node in some fashion of
course some words are less important than other words for
understanding what science means but if you want to be
technical about it and you want to be very precise
and accurate you have to admit that all of the
other words in the English language color and shape your
understanding of what the word science means and so the
meaning of science is not that it points to something
in the outer world so much as its relationship to
every other word rather profound for Derrida the critical insight
is that meaning is composed of both present and absent
symbols so when I say the word science that symbol
is present and maybe some of these other symbols like
knowledge and truth and proof and measurement and quantity and
even religion maybe those are present but notice that the
vast majority of the English language is not present when
I say the word science and yet what Derrida is
trying to say is that it is still in the
background playing a part it's like science is the tip
of the iceberg and this giant iceberg is completely submerged
underwater you're not seeing it that's all the other English
language words and of course if you want a very
clear demonstration of this you can pick up a dictionary
and go try to look up any word in the
dictionary coming at it from the position of someone who
is completely clueless about any kinds of words in English
so for example look up the word science and see
what the definition is what are you going to find
you are gonna find a it's probably 10 or 20
words long again more symbols which tell you what Sciences
and they will tell you something all science is a
is a method of empirical investigation of reality which uses
measurements and experiments to validate hypotheses you know something like
that it'll say something again but what are all those
those are all complicated abstract words so how do you
find out what those are if you don't know well
you have to look each one of those up and
notice what happens you get an infinite expansion and infinite
regress because every one word you look up gives you
ten more words that need to be looked up and
those ten words you look those up they all have
ten more words need to look up and so basically
the meaning of the word is always deferred or put
off till later you don't really fully get it because
the word is defined both by what is present but
also by what is absent another way to think of
it if you're familiar with how Bitcoin works with how
block chains work it's kind of like that language is
decentralized like Bitcoin it has no central authority it has
no ground it has no foundation and where have you
heard me talking about that before for Derrida meaning is
relative to all the uses of a symbol it's not
enough for me just to say oh well science means
this and I get to define what it means sure
I could do that some human could do that some
dictator could say okay I am in charge of human
language and I'm just gonna say that science means the
following thing by Fiat but of course that dictator is
gonna die eventually and then some other person will come
in say no sciences and that science is something else
and and then someone else will say something something else
and so basically everyone gets a say in what words
mean and in fact if you if you look at
some of the online dictionaries they add new to their
dictionaries every single year because humanity spontaneously just invents new
words I remember like five or ten years ago they
added the word selfie to the dictionary and you know
20 years ago if you said the word selfie nobody
knew what that meant and now everybody knows what a
selfie is and it's actually now found in the dictionary
because we spontaneously invented it now what does selfie really
mean you might think well we know it's selfie means
it's a picture of yourself but see that's a very
casual way of speaking what the word selfie really means
is the idea of a selfie in every single humans
mind all over the world so there's a billion of
these ideas billions of slightly different notions of what a
selfie is and of course your notion of selfie is
is connected to all sorts of other notions that it's
defined next to and against without which it really wouldn't
mean much for example you need to have a notion
of a phone you need to have a notion of
a self that you can take a selfie of you
also need to have a notion of another person because
if you're taking a selfie does the other person also
count as part of your selfie you see now is
tricky you can say well a selfie strictly speaking should
just be a picture of me and myself but then
see other people will use the word selfie to refer
to pictures of them and they're best friends so you
have the selfie stick and then you see people walking
around with a selfie stick them and a bunch of
their friends and then they take a selfie is that
truly a selfie or cell a group photo what's the
difference well you see this is the complexity and trickery
of language it's a lot more tricky than it seems
on the surface the way that we normally assume for
Derrida this notion of deferment deferment of meaning is very
important a words meaning always depends on words which are
never being said alongside with the word so when I
say the word selfie I'm not usually saying the word
phone friend self-other and a bunch of other stuff like
even photograph I'm not saying any of those things but
in the back of your mind you have all those
oceans at hand that's the power of the mind see
if you didn't have all those notions selfie wouldn't really
mean what it actually means to you also very importantly
for Derrida the meaning of a symbol is not an
object in the outer world but another symbol a symbol
points to another symbol which points to another symbol points
to another symbol just like we said with the dictionary
example every single word in the dictionary is defined against
itself in this sort of iterative manner such that what
is the entire dictionary really made out of symbols which
ultimately point to what to other symbols which ultimately means
that what is this whole thing doing well it's just
a set of symbols which are ultimately grounded in nothing
it's a set of differences which are ultimately nothing that's
the miraculous structure of language and every symbol has an
infinite potential of meanings and there is never a moment
in time when a symbol is finalized and set in
stone and it's like well now we have figured out
what a selfie is no it's constantly evolving it has
an infinite potential of meanings so the full usage of
a word like selfie or science is literally its every
single usage that has ever occurred throughout all of human
history that's what you need to pull up in order
to fully understand the meaning of the word otherwise what
you have is you have a partial incomplete a very
tiny tiny sliver of it's real meaning for Derrida there
is no such thing as the meaning of a word
or a concept there's just no such thing and he
would say that were very sloppy thinkers and philosophers when
we go around talking about things as though there is
just one canonical meaning for a word or a thought
for a concept especially very abstract words like science or
selfie now this should now start to remind you of
something I've talked about in the past when it comes
to epistemology and webs of belief I've talked about Klein's
epistemic ilysm I've talked about how one of the most
important developments in philosophy in the 20th century was Klein's
sort of discovery or his thesis that when it comes
to scientific understanding and scientific knowledge no single statement or
proposition is ever tested in isolation so a naive notion
of science goes like this well we take a we
take a statement like snow is white and then we
just go and we check is it true or false
that snow is white or we take a statement like
there exist atoms is it true or false that there
exists atoms then we just kind of go and check
and we get the answer true or false but that's
not how it works what Klein proposed is that the
way that science works in the way that all knowledge
all epistemology works not just science but religion and anything
else philosophy is that you never you never test a
single statement because your knowledge is not individual statements but
it's also just like language it's a complicated network of
vastly interconnected truth statements with various probabilities about the world
and so it's not so simple to just go and
say okay do atoms exist let me go quickly check
no because the mechanism or method that you are using
to check whether atoms exist are also colored by your
knowledge you see by your own beliefs and even very
primitive notions like true or false are colored by your
web of beliefs so even the fact that you think
that it can be either true or false but not
both for example that is already a a presupposition in
a part a very deep part of your entire web
of beliefs and then of course which apparatus are you
gonna use to test your theories or your hypothesis well
the apparatus will also depend on your level beliefs and
then how are you going to interpret their results so
let's say your apparatus gives you some numbers how are
you gonna interpret those there is no interpretation free access
to knowledge for human beings there's always an interpretation so
whatever scientific methods you use even if they're the most
hard-nosed and the most quote-unquote objective sorts you still have
to make certain assumptions and then make certain interpretations and
how are you making your interpretations will again based on
your entire level beliefs and so what Klein said is
that never is a single statement tested in isolation what
happens is that the entire web of belief gets tested
when you're testing a single statement because a statement like
snow is white you might say well snow is white
that's so easy to test what's wrong with testing that
leo you can just go outside in the middle of
winter see this note confirm that it's white okay but
how do you know you're not hallucinating you see you
assume you're not hallucinating in that example but what if
you are how do you know you're not inside of
a dream when you're doing that C so all of
that is part of your background web of beliefs which
is coloring how you go and evaluate these statements so
snow is white but then you also have to qualify
that and say well it's white when we're not dreaming
it's white assuming that it's not a hallucination and then
you have to qualify what is the word snow is
your definition of snow really the same as mine for
example the students being snow in between ice and of
course that gives us and all the trickiness of of
what Derrida was talking about so what I want you
to see here is I want you to see the
sort of isomorphic similarity between Klein's web of belief model
of knowledge and also what Derrida is now talking about
with language this language is also the sort of what
belief because what Derrida wants to say is that there
actually is no one objective correct way to read a
text and even though he's talking about text here as
in a book of course he means a much broader
notion by text he means any kind of argument any
kind of philosophical position that one puts forward any kind
of scientific model any kind of work of literature or
poetry what he's saying is that because meaning is so
slippery and so nebulous and so complicated that even the
author who wrote the poem or who wrote the scientific
paper even he doesn't quite understand what he means when
he wrote it because he didn't have in mind everything
that all these words could mean and so in his
mind maybe he meant one thing but then what I'm
gonna read when I'm reading that paper is something totally
different I will interpret in a different way and who's
to arbitrate between my interpretation versus his interpretation versus a
billion other interpretations and a billion other people could have
if they read that same paper who's gonna say which
is the one right true canonical interpretation what Derrida wants
to say is that there is no such thing and
the the desire to put forth a canonical reading of
any text a canonical definition of any word or any
concept is folly and that we are kidding ourselves when
we're trying to do that Derrida says that when we
speak the challenge we have is that because there's infinite
meaning we have to boil and limit ourselves to a
very particular set of limited meanings so when I say
the word selfie I have to say well I mean
by selfie of a particular thing I mean you take
it with your digital phone I mean that your friends
are not part of it or maybe they are part
of it you know I have to define you see
I'm taking a word which has potentially infinite meanings and
I'm defining it down suppressing meanings so Derrida says that
all philosophers and all thinkers and all speakers are always
in this process of suppressing unwanted meanings which is sometimes
why when you're communicating with people and there's a miscommunication
you have to say no no I didn't mean that
I didn't mean what you thought I meant I meant
something else and a lot of times when I'm communicating
complex and abstract concepts to you like non-dual concepts I
have to say no no I didn't mean that and
I didn't mean this and I didn't mean this and
I didn't mean that I meant this and even when
I do that still you could have a different idea
of what I actually want you to understand because language
is just constantly exploding with infinite meaning and our limited
human minds are trying to suppress it down because there's
literally too much meaning for your mind to handle your
mind explodes with meaning so we're always in this process
of suppression and because of this we are always pretending
that meanings are simpler than they really are literally when
we're speaking we're not quite sure what we're saying and
maybe you've had experiences that sometimes when you say something
and then you actually discover that what you meant isn't
what you really meant and ultimately this leads Derrida to
conclude that every statement is a lie because it's B
suppressed and limited and it's being confined in this artificial
manner to serve our human purposes and this is what
he's going to use to make his radical critique of
of all Western intellectual traditions now let's quickly go back
and revisit the idea about what a symbol is before
we delve into the critique of the Western traditions so
notice that a symbol is a very peculiar thing a
symbol is a thing which is not itself what a
symbol is a thing which is not itself so for
example we use words like cat and tree and selfie
to refer to things but the thing that the word
is referring to is precisely not the word that's what
makes a symbol useful if a symbol was the exact
thing that it was trying to represent then there would
be no symbol there would just be the thing for
example if I wanted to represent a cat with a
cat I would just show you a cat and I
wouldn't say the word cat I've just show you a
cat but then I just have a cat I'm showing
you a cat the cat is the cat it's not
a symbol of a cat it's the cat so to
represent the cat with something else and make it be
a symbol it could be anything notice it could be
anything I could take a shoe I could show you
a shoe and have you understand that that shoe is
actually referring to a cat so of course the shoe
is not a cat and yet the whole trick of
language is to get you to think that the shoe
is the cat that's the both the absurdity and the
ingenious nosov it is that literally we have taught our
minds to misunderstand reality such that we could use that
misunderstanding to manipulate reality so there are two ways in
which a symbol is a thing which is not itself
the first way is that the meaning of the symbol
is not its being so the being of the word
cat that being right there is not the same as
the being of the animal cat and the second way
is that a symbols meaning is its difference from another
symbol that's another way in which a thing that is
a symbol is not itself so for example I can
tell you the sentence the fat cat sat on the
mat eating a rat and you understood very quickly instantaneously
what that sentence meant but notice that in that sentence
the word cat is only different from the word Sat
because of the letters C and s or the letter
fat F for fat is just one letter difference so
in order for your mind to understand this sentence the
fat cat sat on the mat eating a rat you
have to actually distinguish between all the subtle differences between
all those words which sound very similar because as soon
as you change one little shape in that in that
word it changes the meeting completely from cat to rat
too fat to Sat to mat to bat to something
else so literally the meaning of the word cat can
only work by leveraging itself against the word fat Sat
mat and rat it's not only that there has to
be a logical connection between let's say a cat and
a rat you might say well yeah Lea I understand
that a cat is related to a rat conceptually because
cats like to hunt rats and maybe cats also like
to sit so thats related to sat and cats can
also be fat so that's where it's not just that
it's literally at the word cat is relate to every
single other word in the English language by the differences
in its appearance because that's all that language is is
the appearance if I take the word cat and I
change that appearance to Sat it now becomes sat in
the same way that if I took a real cat
in the real world and I turned it into a
dog what would happen it would no longer be a
cat it would be a dog because the only thing
there is to being a cat is the cat there's
no essence behind the scenes it's not like if I
took a cat and I transformed his body into a
dog it would be like no that leo that's that's
that's actually a cat in a dog's body the essence
of the cat now is inside the dog no there
is no essence of the cat that's what Derrida is
saying the essence is if structure there's nothing else behind
the scenes so this notion that Derrida came up with
called difference it's actually a French word because Derrida was
french-algerian he was also a Jew the reason I say
that is because it'll come in later at the very
end for the twist but um this word he invented
called difference for him it's an important word it has
two meanings first it means that every meaning is just
differences and second it means that all meaning is always
deferred and put off till later you're always promised the
meaning of a word or a concept but it's never
completely delivered or given to you just like with those
dictionary definitions you keep looking and looking and looking for
more meaning and it's just a never-ending wild goose chase
so all of this that I've been talking about might
sound a little bit abstract let's bring it all home
with this visual example for those of you who are
visual in the audience so here what you see before
you is the sort of triangle pyramid which has a
bunch of different triangles in it so here's a different
way to understand what Derrida is saying very simply what
he's saying is that this triangular pyramid represents language it's
completely groundless and decentralized as you look at this pyramid
notice how different triangles pop out into the foreground of
your vision and you notice them and then what happens
it as your eyes are scanning through the image that
triangle pops back into the background and some new triangle
pops into the foreground so these triangles are supposed to
represent words or symbols or concepts they are all interrelated
in a complicated and very messy way as you can
see here and it's difficult to distinguish precisely where one
triangle ends and another begins in fact some triangles are
like parts of bigger triangles and some bigger triangles have
overlapping smaller triangles and then two big triangles can overlap
with each other in some interesting way and that is
how language works and so what Derrida is saying that
fundamentally the problem with the entire Western intellectual tradition is
that what philosophers and scientists and thinkers are trying to
do is they're sort of like trying to take a
black sharpie to this diagram of triangles and they're trying
to outline one particular triangle and they're trying to say
that's the most important one that's it that's the key
one right there that's the true one that's the objective
one and everything else is hinging on that one triangle
and what Derrida is trying to say that that is
that is an invalid thing to do in truth what
we have is we have this decentralized network of concepts
none of them more important over any other none of
them being able to dominate any other and that really
what's happening in truth is that these triangles or these
concepts are just kind of popping in and out from
foreground to background they're appearing and they're disappearing there is
their presence and their absence and there's this sort of
shimmering effect that's going on and so what Derrida is
trying to get us to grasp is that this is
the true nature of the mind and of language and
that the mistake of Western philosophy is to try to
cling to one particular formulation of these triangles because in
fact everything within language is relative it's a matter of
perspective and the mistake that philosophers make is they they
try to claim one perspective as being the ultimate one
whereas really you have it this dynamic infinite interplay of
perspectives which is what Derrida wants to point out you
get that good so now let's move on to his
central criticism of Western thought and philosophy and science and
literature and everything else and this is something that post
modernists all basically agree on is that they agree that
Western intellectual tradition is logo centric which is a fancy
way of just saying that in the Western tradition in
academia in science and in writing in philosophy there was
always been for the last 2,000 years ever since Plato
and Aristotle there has always been this over emphasis on
language and words and this absolute faith that you could
describe truth and reality with language and with words and
course with logic because logic is also language and words
and so Derrida claims that all Western thought basically seeks
to find a center within this triangle pyramid it seeks
to find a foundation it seeks to establish objectivity it
seeks to establish normativity it seeks to find what he
calls a meta-narrative a sort of overarching big picture understanding
of of any particular topic or field and it seeks
to say that's the truth that's the one right way
and that's the equivalent of taking a sharpie and outlining
one particular triangle and what Derrida wants to say is
that you can't do that not if you want to
be honest because in truth there is no foundation two
concepts two meanings or two language it's very essence is
that it's foundationless there are no canonical definitions it can
sometimes appear that way simply because we have a loose
consensus but in truth the reality of the matter is
that it's much more messy and complicated and that it's
relative and he goes even further and he says that
the great mistake of one of Western intellectual tradition is
that it uses distinctions it operates by categories dichotomies hierarchies
and binary opposites and this is always a way to
seek a ground or a foundation which doesn't really exist
there it's sort of a sneaky move that the mind
makes it creates a distinction and then it ignores the
fact that it constructed this distinction so that's where deconstruction
comes in and that's why Derrida calls his method deconstruction
is that he's gonna deconstruct all the binary opposites categories
and dichotomies and hierarchies that have been constructed he's gonna
basically take an eraser to all these Sharpie triangles that
have been drawn by various individuals and philosophers and scientists
throughout history he's gonna erase them all so that what
we have is we have the more natural state of
justice sort of shimmering triangular pyramid of just this groundless
some network which is always in play and never is
one domineering over all the others so what does he
mean by distinctions and binary opposites well these should be
very familiar to you if you've ever spent any time
thinking have you noticed that all thought is dualistic and
happens in terms of binary opposites there's a very deep
reason for this but we'll get to that later but
what do I mean by these binary options here's some
examples for you so man versus animal that would be
one office by neri opposite reason versus intuition intellect versus
emotions mind versus body good versus evil nature versus culture
inner versus outer as in there's the inner world and
the outer world scientific versus spiritual true versus false a
priori versus a posterior II you've heard that one if
you were ever a student philosophy epistemology versus metaphysics Physics
versus chemistry subjective versus objective the mundane versus the divine
reality versus illusion material versus immaterial the practical versus the
theoretical the abstract versus the concrete something versus nothing existence
versus non-existence life versus death and so on and so
forth there are millions of these conceptual distinctions in order
for the mind to work at all it has to
create these distinctions but what Derrida wants to show is
that yes you can create these distinctions and they work
within a limited context but as soon as you try
to push this distinction further and further eventually every single
distinction will collapse it must collapse because the only way
you can define these opposites is against one another and
so if you take your analysis of these distinctions all
the way to the rock-bottom what you'll discover is that
actually one in a set necess neccessity --tz-- or necessarily
implies the other and that you cannot have one without
the other the only the only meaning of a word
like reality is because it's juxtaposed against something like illusion
the only meaning of a word like something is because
it's juxtaposed against nothing the only meaning of the word
theory is because it's juxtaposed against practice and so on
and so forth and what you find is that not
only does Western intellectual tradition create these binary opposites these
dualities but it goes one step further akin it's an
even greater sin is that it arbitrarily assigns a privilege
to one of the sides of the binary opposite and
it marginalized another so a good example of this might
be something like rationality versus emotion generally in Western culture
we privilege emotionality and we marginalize emotion we say something
like well rationality is is the great one it's better
than emotion because emotions you know emotions are things for
for girls you know real men don't believe in emotions
we operate on cold hard rationality and facts and rationality
after all is what we used to do science and
to do hard math and physics and look at what
that's Kotnis we've gotten from physics we've gotten rocket ships
and cellphones and semiconductors and computers and all this sort
of stuff and we got logic and that's the thing
you can really count on is logic because logic is
certain where as emotions emotions are airy-fairy and they're so
wishy-washy one day you're sad one day you're happy it's
unreliable what can you really do with emotions like this
right that's how it sort of characterized but what Dara
da would do is he would deconstruct that he would
say aha so you think that huh well let's take
a deep look at that is that really true what
is the true interplay between rationality emotions can you have
rationality with no emotions and his rationality really as powerful
as you think it is without emotions so for example
and this is not his example of my example but
I think he would agree with me here I've hughster
alive and listening to this for example he might say
something like ok but we've done neuroscience Studies on people
who actually have damaged brains where their emotional part of
the brain is actually damaged and doesn't work anymore so
these people don't feel any emotions at all they are
purely rational they're rational side of the brain the left
brain is working perfectly no flaws at all so what
do these people do in real life well what we
discover in practice is that these people are not able
to put their socks on in the morning because as
it turns out to actually do something in the world
one way versus another way you need to have some
emotions that compel you to like have a reason for
doing it you see motivation is not rational it's emotional
so a person who has no emotions cannot put on
the socks because to him why put on the socks
when you cannot put on the socks how do you
decide between which way to go both are rational after
all there's nothing rational about putting on socks or not
putting on socks and after all there's nothing rational about
eating or not eating how do I determine which I
should do not on rationality it's based on emotion emotion
compels you to eat and how do you know if
you're supposed to have a family if you're supposed to
be nice to your wife or your husband not the
rationality because rationally speaking there's no reason why you should
be nice or why you can be an [ __
] there's no reason why you couldn't go in and
murder people rationally speaking makes no difference rationally speaking there's
no reason why you can't put a gun to your
head and shoot yourself right now there's no rational reason
why you should be alive at all in fact rationally
it makes a lot more sense to kill yourself now
because you're gonna save yourself a lot of hassle think
about it you will save yourself 80 years of hassle
living live going through all these problems why do that
shoot yourself right now and rashly that's the best option
to take but you don't why not because you have
emotions which override rationality and in fact the thing that
governs you is not your rationality but mostly your emotions
and in fact your emotions dictate what you will rationalize
to yourself so what Derrida would say is that actually
the tables have turned on us my friend it's not
rationality that's superior if anything it's emotions that are superior
and more primary see for all these years we have
been privileged aggression allottee and marginalizing emotions and dare it
I would say no we got to do the opposite
let's take the marginalized half of this equation and start
to privilege it just to see how how radical it
will change we can get and then of course see
Derrida is gonna be slippery here and he's gonna play
that play devil's advocate such that if someone does come
and say well okay emotions fine emotions are the privileged
term you're right rationality yeah it's not as good as
we thought in fact you know what rationality sucks and
if someone does that Derrida will come in and say
wait a minute let's look at the issue again let's
really look at what emotions are emotions are and he'll
analyze that and say oh well emotions are kind of
flimsy and really look with your emotions you can't really
decide what to do and so rationality is important and
so his whole game is to play both off each
other such that neither one is above the other because
to put any one of them above the other is
to fall into the mistake that all Western thinking has
has been falling into the last 2,000 years is to
take this triangular diagram and to mark out one particular
triangle at the expense of all the others and that's
invalid that's not truthful is what he wants to say
if you want another example of this how about reality
versus illusion as a duality talk about privileged and marginalized
terms man what is more privileged than reality and more
marginalized than delusion in the West here illusion has a
very negative connotation dreams have a very negative connotation people
are always looking for reality reality is what's real illusions
those are just like hallucinations and if you want to
dismiss the importance of something you just say oh it's
just an illusion it's just a hallucination it's just a
dream whereas this thing here look this is real the
real world it's tangible it's solid it's physical you can't
[ __ ] with it this is what science investigates
science investigates reality religion investigates illusion see reality is privileged
illusion is marginalized and then when non-duality comes into the
picture you see this it flip this is flipped on
its head and a lot of times when I say
that reality is all hallucination people flip out about this
and like Leo what are you talking about our reality's
hallucination everything's an illusion how can you say these things
it's clearly untrue see because what non-duality means that you're
you're breaking all these dualities down and then in fact
there is no difference whatsoever between reality and illusion this
right here is completely illusion it's all illusion everything is
an illusion all your problems are illusions your entire life
is an illusion but you don't like to think of
it that way because well you have marginalized illusion for
so long that now if you something bad is happening
to you when you think of reality as an illusion
and that's precisely what Derrida wants to question now technically
speaking reality is neither real or unreal is neither reality
or illusion it's actually completely undefined that's what non duality
means but the reason for example that sometimes I like
to say it's a hallucination it's an illusion is because
it [ __ ] the most with your mind it
triggers you why does it trigger you precisely because you've
marginalized it so it breaks it starts to like break
and [ __ ] with your model of reality which
is exactly what we need so it's sort of like
we take that triangle that you have and then if
you think reality is real then it's like you've taken
a sharp E and you've marked out a little triangle
there that you think is the right one and what
I'm doing I'm taking you an eraser I'm erasing that
one and then I'm taking another sharpie and I'm marking
the opposite triangle just to [ __ ] with your
mind see and you don't like that because your whole
thing in life is that you want this triangle to
be the right one you hate that other triangle now
of course ultimately what you want to get to and
what Derrida is advocating is that you want to erase
all the triangles and you want to open yourself up
to the shimmering interplay of the entire network and of
course that's ultimately what I'm trying to get you to
as well but sometimes to do that what we do
is we draw the opposite triangles just to [ __
] with your mind but anyways so Derrida says that
philosophy needs to fix meanings that's what Western philosophy is
about it can't work otherwise philosophy has a constructivist biased
it has a constructivist agenda it is trying to construct
a house of cards to do that it needs to
sharpie it needs to draw these triangles and Derrida wants
to deny it that Derrida says that Western philosophy tries
to always advance some kind of thesis it tries to
have the final word he tries to create a meta-narrative
what postmodernists mean by meta-narrative is just it has to
it tries to have a like a big-picture final say
on some matter for example within history there are meta-narratives
and we try to say well history basically was like
Christopher Columbus he he came over the Atlantic Ocean and
he conquered the the Native Americans here and then European
civilization rose and that's the true history that's really how
it happened and what Derrida wants to say is that
no that's a meta-narrative that's a silly childish notion of
how history works the reality of history is that it's
much more complicated there were millions and billions of people
at work to create the history around the time of
the era of Columbus Columbus was just one guy on
one ship around him were many other people and millions
of people existed here in native as Native Americans in
America that that are completely unknown to the history books
never talked about their net their names were never recorded
so basically a postmodernist would criticize all of history as
being meta-narratives highly selected data points which are done arbitrarily
connected together to create a sort of narrative or a
picture which isn't really there it wasn't like that it's
just convenient for us to think of it that way
because our minds are constantly oversimplifying everything but if we
really want to be accurate honest we have to say
that's not how it worked and that everything you learned
in school about history was a fiction that's really what
it was history is just fiction and a lot of
people find that upsetting because they think I know Leo
the world really it really was like Columbus came over
and like my ancestors were on that ship and and
you know gotta turn on it really happened like my
grandparents were in World War two and and they they
were suffering really badly and then it on that's best
real that's real history that's not a fiction that's the
power of the mind that's the power of language that's
the power of concepts is that you can construct these
realities out of thin air and they really start to
feel real but you have to start to see that
their gross oversimplification of of what's really transpiring and even
deeper than that it's all based on these dualities which
ultimately must collapse and the whole problem is that once
you're buying into all these dualities then you don't want
them to collapse your body into the dualities all of
Western tradition intellectual tradition is bought into these dualities and
these dualities prove to be very limiting they're like straight
jackets or pigeon holes ultimately what Derrida is trying to
say is that Western tradition has been trying to capture
the truth with words and the truth is that you
cannot capture the truth with words because words are just
differences and nothing more than that differences without substance all
right I'm gonna take a quick intermission here take a
little break but you don't go anywhere because I'll be
right back with more all right let's continue because there's
a lot more to be said here we're almost getting
to the really juicy part but first let's talk about
explicitly what is deconstruction Derrida's method so here's how it
works you take any logo centric argument or a thesis
or a philosophy or a model and you start to
question its conceptual distinctions until you break them all down
and you show their limits and you show how eventually
they must collapse you question and undermine the privileged parts
of the distinctions and you empower the marginalized parts of
the distinctions until ultimately you break the whole thing up
and you reveal that this entire scheme is actually in
truth completely groundless and you sort of stand off as
a neutral observer on the sidelines as it were you
don't take sides over one part of the distinction versus
another and you just step outside the whole game and
you just observe the entire interplay the shimmering of all
these elements and you delight in that and that is
in essence deconstruction you can apply this as a technique
to literary criticism to poetry to linguistics to science to
philosophy to psychology to whatever you want the key is
that all conceptual distinctions in a text are unstable they
must be this way and the deep reason for that
which Dury dorita didn't really get into is is the
fact that realities non-dual it's because reality is non-dual that
all dualistic conceptions of reality must ultimately collapse it doesn't
matter whether they're made within science within physics they will
all ultimately collapse can't be otherwise that's what it means
to say that reality is non-dual that's what it means
to say that that's the absolute truth but now I'm
starting to get into a little bit more of how
deconstruction dovetails with non-duality which is strictly speaking not what
Derrida was talking about but nevertheless it's important for our
work here so ultimately what you discover through deconstruction is
that each side of the dichotomy contains and implies the
other side so you can never deny the other side
it's rather similar to how morality works you know some
people who are very moral they like to denounce evil
without realizing pet you can't have good without evil you
can't go around denouncing evil because the only way you
do that is by not being conscious of the fact
that the evil you're denouncing is part of the whole
you can't have the whole without the evil the evil
comes with the whole and so this just doesn't apply
to good and evil but this applies to all dualities
and ultimately rationality must eat its own tail they must
come full circle even rationality itself as we'll talk about
for example with Kurt girdles incompleteness theorem I'll shoot an
episode about that even rationality itself when tickets to us
full limit must eat itself break itself down and ultimately
devolve into paradox the distinction between a rational and the
irrational must collapse the distinction between true and false must
itself collapse the distinction between reality and illusion must collapse
and that's something that you can even see demonstrated from
within side of logic which is what Kurt kernel was
able to demonstrate so what's the end result of all
this deconstruction and all of Derrida is thinking well the
end result is that the essence of concepts is that
they have no essence they are the pure possibility of
play the end result is that no thesis can ever
be advanced about anything no argument can ever be made
for or against anything because deconstruction is the exhaustion of
all theories and views it's the collapse of all hierarchies
it's the collapse of all power structures of all attempts
to privilege one concept over another the collapse of all
justifications and reasons it is to become unmoored and D
anchored such that you have no more ground to stand
upon and the only thing that results is this sort
of endless playfulness of reality it flows which is different
from the way it is when you're under the Western
intellectual tradition because when you're under the Western intellectual tradition
you're encased in this conceptual matrix which locks down the
free flow and playfulness of reality because it says that
no reality is this way and this way and this
way and not this way and this way is bad
and that way is bad but this way is good
so all of that is being blasted apart with dynamite
here and what this means is that if you're gonna
be using concepts and ideas feel free to do so
but just remember what you're really doing just remember the
house of cards that you are building and remember to
hold all your ideas lightly rather than cling to them
as though your life depended on it and of course
what this means is also that all philosophical philosophical questions
are endless they never end so if you wondered maybe
that philosophy is just a mental masturbation and a wild
goose chase chasing your own tail around the circle as
well Derrida is saying that basically that's exactly what it
is you can never settle a philosophical question at the
level of language because all language just sort of revolves
in an endless merry-go-round and that's precisely why if you
wondered you know in philosophy for thousands of years philosophers
have basically dealt with the same questions about truth and
metaphysics and justifications and normativity and and morality and existence
of God in all this and basically none of the
questions have been answered and this is precisely why because
the only way you can try to answer them is
by building a house of cards but that some other
philosopher comes and says no I don't like your house
of cards I'll build my own I'll blow down your
house of cards I'll build my own house of cards
but I'm not gonna call it a house of cards
because your house of cards is a house of cards
but mine is not a house of cards mine is
built out of real solid stone it's set on a
real firm foundation and of course what Derrida says no
you can't do that yours is also house of cards
everybody's house of cards is a house of cards and
of course a lot of people don't like that idea
because to them this smacks of relativity relativism and this
leads us to the question of what was the impact
of Derrida and his work on culture at large well
it's probably like you might think of course most serious
academics viewed him as a nihilist and as utterly toxic
to what academia is about his work had very little
impact within the sciences the hard sciences because think about
it for the academic for the hard scientist what is
he up to he is on a constructive agenda there's
something that needs to be constructed something pragmatic science is
not about idle theory building it's about pragmatism for our
reason now science will tell you oh well we're pragmatic
because Leo we like to be practical and we precisely
want to avoid all this metaphysical speculation all this philosophy
all that stuff yeah it's just kind of airy-fairy we
are very practical and they tout that as a positive
thing and in a sense that is a positive thing
but also there is a negative side to pragmatism because
when you're purely pragmatic that means that you don't really
care about the truth what you care about is you
just care about getting a utilitarian result you care about
building your technology you care about building your theory damn
the consequences damn damn whether it's true or not doesn't
matter if it's a house of cards if I can
build a house of cards that can accomplish something in
the real world if I can use a lie or
a deception or an illusion to push something through that
I want then I'm gonna do it that's the danger
of pragmatism see and so most academics were very dismissive
of all of derrida's work precisely because it's so threatening
to their very livelihood the whole point of being in
academic is that you are dealing with concepts for a
living you are using concepts to construct houses of cards
so if you are denied that as Derrida is trying
to do well what are you gonna do are you
gonna say okay I'm calling it quits I'm going home
is that what you're gonna do or are you gonna
say no no that's okay I can keep building my
house of cards they're not really house of cards they're
just made out of stone this guy who's just smoking
a bunch of stuff he was just some some some
radical philosopher guy I mean who cares about what he
said in effect it's as though Derrida went to a
butcher and asked him to become a vegan what do
you think a butcher who's been butchering animals for 40
years and has made his entire career out of this
he has children who get fed from his butchering and
you tell him to become a vegan what do you
think the butcher is gonna say is he gonna agree
with your vegan philosophy of course not so of course
the hard science is dismissed most of what they're to
have to say but there was some traction in dario's
work with the field of literature literary criticism it became
quite popular there which if you think about is a
quite odd application of these ideas to me that's a
very shallow application of these idea but that's sort of
where it caught on and in certain softer sciences in
the humanities has sort of caught on perhaps in anthropology
perhaps in various cultural studies gender studies feminism and stuff
like that it caught on and post-modernism did flower for
a while in the 70s and in the 80s you
sort of ran its course at this point it's not
really that popular but it still exists within universities and
academic institutions and certain scholars it's had an impact because
basically what it turned into is a sort of relativism
where you could say that well one culture might have
a certain set of values but then who says that
those values are the dominant ones the ones that we
should put on a pedestal what about these other cultures
who have marginalized values maybe we should put those more
on a pedestal and so that sort of thing started
to play out in universities and then also what came
from post-modernism is the sort of anti-establishment relativist political ideology
so it got involved with politics and then of course
you know a lot of people started to abuse this
philosophy to justify whatever kind of things they wanted to
justify largely post-modernism was dismissed by most people as mental
masturbation as most philosophy is because it's just not practical
enough to meet they're just like self-survival agenda and and
then the other problem that happened with it is that
people didn't really know what to do with this philosophy
after all like okay let's say we believe Derrida and
let's say we just accepted always okay he's right so
all all of our Western traditional institutions and conceptual models
that they are all just houses of cards and we're
gonna break them all down well where does that leave
us what do we do most people are practical people
they want to know what am I going to do
with this how am I going to apply this and
for a lot of people this philosophy just strikes them
as impractical and for example for this hard scientist this
strikes them as impractical because a hard physicist will say
well what do you want me to do Leo do
you want me to stop doing physics I mean after
all I got to keep doing physics I got to
keep running my experiments I got to keep you know
writing papers I got to keep going after my Nobel
Prizes I got to keep making discoveries are going to
help to advance technology and all that so I mean
we can't really stop doing that so what should we
do should we stop should we continue to do it
who knows this darrid I even say what the practical
consequences of any of this stuff is it's hard to
say and see a lot of people took this sort
of ambiguity in terms of the practical consequences and they
sort of ran off with it to do whatever they
wanted to so for example people who were marginalized like
feminists or minorities in universities they would they would use
the philosophy to advocate a privilege of their values or
kind of a leveling the field and so this became
popular and for example certain feminist studies and circles and
certain minority circles like the LGTB community and the transgender
community saw this as something that they could use like
well I could define my own gender because previously it
was said that well there's just males and females but
now Derrida seems to say well why are there only
males and females isn't that just like a privileges of
this dichotomy what if there are other dichotomy what if
we can say there are some other kinds of genders
and in some people you know who want that then
they seize on that and then they use it to
justify whatever kind of gender they want to create and
so on so see the danger with relativity of course
is that the ego can seize on relativity and use
it as a weapon to push through whatever kind of
self agenda it has and that was one of the
things that I think tarnished the legacy of post-modernism that's
exactly what happened and that's very predictable of course that
would happen because the truth of non-duality is that it's
complete freedom when you break down all conceptual structures you're
sure left floating on anchored and you can float whichever
way you want you can do whatever you want and
this is part of the problem with Zen devilry is
that you can become enlightened but just because you're enlightened
doesn't mean you're you can stop being an [ __
] you can still be an [ __ ] you
can still rape people you could murder people you can
start holy wars you can become a cult leader I
mean enlightenment doesn't preclude anything the way that people sometimes
like to think enlightened Atman doesn't make you a sage
non-duality is complete freedom and that's sort of what Derrida
was pointing to but then of course when you give
unconscious people who are not deeply conscious of non-duality but
are just believing in it as an ideology and that's
what deconstructionism became as it became an ideology for people
when you just believe in this stuff as an ideology
then you actually fall into the very same trap that
Derrida was trying to use this method to escape from
see you invent a new ideology and then that new
ideology you follow it dogmatically and and and then you
use it to justify all your unconscious egoic needs and
wants and desires and and that's where a lot of
abuse can happen so in the words of Lawrence Cahoon
in talking about the legacy of Derrida he said quote
sometimes if the philosophical critique is sufficiently radical it simply
leaves us where we were before and quote and that's
sort of what ended up happening with deconstruction now I
want to say a few words about why Derrida's writing
is so convoluted and complicated a lot of intellectuals and
scholars after reading Derrida they criticize him as being actually
an obscurantist and an intellectual fraud so by obscurantist what
they mean is that his writing is so convoluted and
so non-committal doesn't try to take any stances whatsoever that
it seems like he's using language in a fancy way
to say nothing at all and of course in a
sense that is what he's doing but to most academics
and scholars this strikes them as just complete mental masturbation
and not only that but it just strikes them as
as complete fraud because it seems as though he's writing
these books and he sang these very complicated things to
make himself seem intelligent like he has something important to
say but really he's not saying anything and here's a
quote that I want to give you from one of
his critics which exemplifies this this is a critic by
the name of Mark Goldblatt and here's what he writes
about Derrida quote Derrida special significance lies not in the
fact that he was subversive but in the fact that
he was an outright intellectual fraud and that he managed
to dupe a startling number of highly educated people into
believing that he was on to something whatever Derrida was
affirming he is also simultaneously denying from a logical perspective
the only way to read Derrida on his own terms
is to mentally insert the phrase or not after every
one of his statements and quote see you see this
is precisely what this academic is is criticizing Derrida on
so if Derrida wants to criticize all of Western intellectual
tradition and say that its logo centric you see the
problem that Derrida faces is that if he says okay
so all Western intellectual tradition is logo centric and that's
bad if he says that he can't say that because
to say that would be to play into the game
of logo centrism that's too advanced a thesis that's to
mark out one triangle out of the whole so he
can't say that so the reason that Derrida's language is
so con looted and it seems like at the same
time he's affirming something but then also denying it is
because of course that's the nature of non-duality from the
position of duality which is what this critic is coming
from yeah it seems absurd from the position of logic
it seems absurd because duality has to at the same
time affirm and deny so derrida's has to say at
the same time that Western intellectual tradition is complete nonsense
and it's all logo centric and then in the same
breath yes to say but also it isn't and this
is what really irritates and confuses a lot of people
who are strictly rational and strictly dualistic because they want
to concrete answer but the whole point is that Derrida
is trying to give you the answer that there are
no concrete answers derrida's position is that there are no
fixed positions tada that's the point but the problem is
how do you say that when the thing you're criticizing
is the very mechanism by which you're trying to speak
your criticism it's a problem of self-reflection and Derrida was
keenly aware of this problem which is why his writing
is so convoluted and complicated because look if his position
is that all language is a lie and yet he's
writing a book using language how does he say that
without himself opening up his writing to further deconstruction so
you see what Derrida has to do as he's writing
is he has to deconstruct himself in a very sort
of self-conscious manner so that nobody else can deconstruct him
because if he wrote something that smacked of being a
thesis or a firm stance what would happen is that
someone would come back to him and say ah well
you're deconstructing us why don't we just deconstruct you and
what he has to do is he has to say
ah but I've already because myself so there's nothing in
me left for you to deconstruct and if he left
something there for further deconstruction that would mean that he's
being a hypocrite because he's actually committing the very same
sin of which he is accusing all other academics and
all other intellectuals of of committing so this is actually
a very interesting point about his writing style now of
course I think that his writing style could have been
a lot more clear and a lot more simpler I
don't think his ideas are that complicated that you couldn't
put it down on paper in a simple way but
nevertheless the paradoxical nature of his ideas I think some
of that is just inherent to non-duality is inherently irreducible
because there is there is paradox within reality which cannot
simply be ignored the way that Western intellectual tradition has
tried to do for thousands of years it's just not
that simple that's what Derrida is trying to say so
very much just like a Zen master Derrida has to
write with one hand while he erases with the other
see he has to say something and then he has
to negate what he says just like a Zen master
and that is for good reason that's not an accident
because that's that's the difference between a sort of dualistic
attitude and a non-dualistic attitude towards reality now of course
the most important question though is yes now we understand
where Derrida was coming from what he was trying to
do and some of the implications of all that but
was Derrida right did he actually accurately describe non-duality did
he actually describe reality well here is again where the
twist happens here is where the master gets hoisted by
his own petard yet again you see the problem with
Derrida and deconstruction isn't that it's too radical and that
it goes too far it's that it doesn't go far
enough yes language and concepts of course their logo centric
of course their dualistic but there's an even deeper layer
which Derrida himself never got to deconstruction as Derrida proposed
it was not complete it was deconstruction but it was
still stuck at the language at the at the level
of language and the level of concepts Derrida's mistake was
that he was overly focused on language and philosophy and
academia and that he never went beyond that to actually
make a discontinuous jump into proper non-duality his non-duality was
really just conceptual non-duality he understood and a very important
thing which is that all philosophy is dualistic all thinking
is dualistic the entire mind is dualistic but see there's
two things that could happen when you understand that one
is you can understand that and then be aware of
it but still continue to use the language and the
concepts that you were sort of criticizing because you think
that there's no alternative it's sort of like yeah you
might say like yeah humanity is a [ __ ]
up race and we do evil [ __ ] to
each other so you know what we're just gonna continue
doing evil [ __ ] so I'll just participate in
the madness that would be sort of one take on
it or you could say okay so all of language
and all of concepts and all of mine is dualistic
but is there a level beyond that can i transcend
the mind can i transcend language can i stop using
concepts to interface with reality and that last step is
precisely the step that i don't think he made see
for Derrida he was operating within the domain of philosophy
and epistemology and linguistics and he still took for granted
even though he questioned a lot of that stuff he
still took for granted many fundamental metaphysical assumptions of materialism
so to really complete his deconstruction here's what would had
to happen he would have to recognize that the distinction
between language and reality is itself a false distinction and
the distinction between epistemology and metaphysics is itself a false
distinction and the distinction between doing deconstruction on the mind
and doing deconstruction on the physical world is itself a
false distinction such that when you realize all this there
is a spontaneous breakthrough in sight that happens when the
in the inside the mind where the mind shuts down
and you have a raw direct unmediated non-dual non symbolic
experience of reality at this level there is no language
there is no concept there are no distinctions you are
interfacing with being itself and this is true non duality
this is what all spirituality aims at but of course
they I didn't get this far at least that's my
opinion because he was still thinking of non-duality in a
purely intellectual way it's the difference between understanding enlightenment intellectually
and talking about it and actually experiencing it for yourself
you see you can talk about that oh yeah maybe
all this is an illusion maybe we're just living in
the matrix maybe this is all a dream and that's
a nice interesting sort of philosophical notion to have but
to actually experience your present moment as being an illusion
as being a dream that's a whole nother level and
that's something that Derrida was maybe on the brink of
breaking through to but he never quite broke through to
it so I see Derrida as having stumbled upon the
duality of the mind and having advocated for a sort
of conceptual non dual stance when it comes to mental
things but not taking it all the way because he
never really fully transcended his own mind and I think
that's because he never thought that that was a possibility
I think that he always thought that the only access
that the human being can have to reality is through
language through concepts through the mind it's quite a radical
thing to consider that you could possibly transcend the mind
and access reality through something other than language and I
want to read to you here a really great quote
from a paper by David Loy who is a Zen
master and he's also very knowledgeable about deconstruction and he
pinpoints precisely this problem that Derrida's deconstruction faced when looked
at from a true non-dual perspective from someone who's enlightened
from someone who has studied and actually embodied the teachings
of Zen Buddhism for example here's what he says quote
what is interesting about Derrida's type of deconstruction from a
Buddhist point of view is that it is logo centric
for what needs to be deconstructed is not just language
but the world we live in and the way we
live in it trapped within the cage of our own
making bound by our own rope to use a Zen
phrase the problem is not merely that language acts as
a filter obscuring the nature of things rather names are
used to objectify appearances into self existing things that we
perceive as books tables trees you and me in other
words the objective world of material things is metaphysical through
and through and it is this metaphysics that most needs
to be deconstructed because this is the metaphysics that disguises
itself as common sense reality which makes me suffer and
quote so that's just what I was talking about the
latent metaphysics which makes you believe that you are in
a real physical reality right now the materialist paradigm your
sense that you are a a separate self separate from
other individuals your sense that you were born that you're
going to die all of these they seem as just
common sense Givens that's just how reality is but is
it really what if you take deconstruction to its ultimate
ultimate ultimate end way beyond where Derrida took it beyond
just the intellectual realm but to the actual physical realm
where your deconstruction literally starts to break down your physical
reality to the point where you start to feel like
you're going insane because physical barriers are now starting to
melt and collapse before you in your very direct experience
what happens when you start doubting that there exists a
floor so much the possibility opens up that the floor
will actually cease to exist beneath your feet and you
will fall through it that's the level of deconstruction that
Buddhism deals with and of course not just Buddhism every
single mystical tradition from advise of a danta to to
Kabbalah to yoga to to everything else that's true deconstruction
you're not just deconstructing ideas or philosophies or texts in
a book which is the problem with Derrida his deconstruction
was mostly aimed at philosophies and textbooks but actually your
present experience what if you deconstruct your entire sensory experience
your sense of having a physical body what if you
deconstruct your physical body so much that you stop believing
in a physical body that would be pretty radical and
that might actually solve this problem with deconstruction of not
being a practical philosophy because yes when deconstruction is only
happening at the intellectual level it might not be so
practical but when it starts to happen at the level
of your emotions at the level of your real world
metaphysics what you think is real and physical and true
well that becomes very practical very quickly the problem there
is that actually becomes so practical that are you able
to handle the consequences of that because you will start
to feel like you're going insane a little bit maybe
a lot depends on how deep you go with this
deconstruction so just like Douglas Hofstadter was really close to
really understanding at all of reality the strange loop just
like Georg Cantor was really close to understanding that his
proofs of absolute infinity and different sizes of infinity that
those actually pointed to the real deal the actual absolute
infinity but he didn't quite get there I think the
same problem plagued Derrida and he never actually got there
what would have been cool is if he actually did
get to true non-duality and he actually saw what's ultimately
true which is that reality is absolutely relative not just
at the intellectual level not just at the cultural level
not just at the level of academia and philosophy but
at the physical level at the objective level there are
no objects because objects are a duality there are no
boundaries because all boundaries are constructs there he would have
realized that there is no difference between something and nothing
there is no difference between reality and illusion there is
no difference between herself and another it's all one everything
collapses as it must because that's the nature and the
logic of being if you were to ask Derrida what
is everything he would have probably said everything is just
differences and that's exactly right that's the nature of reality
the nature of reality is not atoms or molecules or
things or energy or or God or any of that
the nature of reality is just differences and what is
the nature of differences it's nothing differences and nothing that
they're made out of that's what all this is it's
just differences just distinctions we have conceptual distinctions we have
physical distinctions but even the distinction between the conceptual and
the physical is itself a distinction which can collapse all
distinctions can collapse and when the when that happens what
do you get get under emptiness you get nothingness and
then you realize that reality is a strange loop you
realize that everything as Derrida said is truly infinite play
nothing has dominance over every anything else it is this
tangled hierarchy where every element is inter playing with every
other element it's infinitely diverse it's constantly in motion you
can't pin it down it has no foundation it's absolutely
groundless it's what the coupe the Buddhists call the groundless
ground that makes everything else possible all of these differences
and distinctions just like Derrida was saying within language well
that's what's actually happening not just within language but at
the physical level of reality so to me that's what
I found very profound and beautiful about derrida's work is
that I see the isomorphism between how he describes the
structure and function of language and then what I experience
as the structure and function of physical reality and that
they're really the same sort of structure it's a web
with no central authority God isn't some central authority who
sits outside of the web dictating commands that's not God
that's a bastardization of the notion of God God is
simply the realization that there is no ground and that
all there is is just as infinite expansion in all
directions of this decentralized web so if you want to
put it poetically you could say that what reality is
is reality is sort of like an infinite Bitcoin expanding
in all directions with nobody in control and that's something
I wish that Derrida was able to directly become conscious
of for himself that would have been a a beautiful
way to go full circle with his philosophy when I
was like 16 years old I actually developed my own
version of deconstruction which is why it was really easy
for me to understand where Derrida was coming from as
soon as I just read a couple of things about
him I could just quickly see that okay I know
exactly what he's doing that's kind of what I was
doing in my own mind except I wasn't doing it
the level of language I was doing at the level
of epistemology and metaphysics basically I caught on very early
when I was 16 years old when I started thinking
about the nature of reality the nature of language and
thoughts and and beliefs I sort of caught on the
head all belief systems are just houses of cards that
are foundationless and so I was able to kind of
come up with my own version of deconstruction back then
I haven't even heard about Derrida or post-modernism earning this
kind of stuff just on my own I was thinking
about this stuff and it just became very apparent to
me that all of it was growl as it had
to be groundless it couldn't be grounded in anything because
every ground needs a new ground so what's it grounded
in it can only be grounded in nothing and so
I basically used my little version of deconstruction to deconstruct
religion to deconstruct atheism to deconstruct science to deconstruct all
of philosophy and I actually fell into the very same
mistake that Derrida fell into is that even though I
did deconstruct all this stuff I was still only doing
it on an intellectual conceptual level and that was very
helpful because a lot of people get stuck in these
concepts so that allowed me to unstick myself from all
these concepts that was super helpful but it still didn't
take me all the way to non-duality you'd only take
10 or 15 more years of doing research and then
ultimately stumbling upon enlightenment and having some enlightenment experiences that
I was able to to really complete that circle and
to actually to actualize the deconstruction my my deconstruction wasn't
actualized and I still don't consider it completely actualized there's
still a lot more actualizing of it that I need
to do there's still a lot of things in my
mind that I need to break down and deconstruct but
but what's nice about deconstruction is that it sort of
gets your foot into the door if you can deconstruct
your concepts most people can't even do that they struggle
to do that go take a scientist or go take
out an atheist or go take a rationalist or go
take a theist and ask him to deconstruct all his
concepts and beliefs good luck with that they ain't gonna
do it they ain't gonna do it and if they
don't do it at least on that level then how
are they actually gonna do it on the physical level
of their being of their emotions of their entire personal
life there's no way in hell they're gonna get that
far you see so you want to start at the
conceptual level then the deconstruction will sort of burrow its
way in and corrode all your concepts all your beliefs
the entire mind and then it goes deeper and deeper
and then starts to actually corrupt your physical reality like
[ __ ] in your physical reality starts to to
melt away the floor under your feet starts to disappear
so to speak and that's when things get really heavy
that's when you get the real deep mind [ __
] that's when your deconstruction starts to actually actualize and
that's when you get true spirituality is when you get
mysticism that's when you get non-duality that's all it really
is that's how religion happens that's true religion for you
right there but good luck convincing a religious person of
that or even a scientific person that or even an
academic person of that you won't because they are deeply
bought into this entire enterprise of constructing see that's what
humans do we construct the mind is a construction machine
it's a conceptual construction machine it builds a conceptual matrix
why does it do this because that helps us to
survive that puts food on the table believe it or
not the greatest business of the mind and of human
beings is to construct [ __ ] have you noticed
this the mine is a [ __ ] spinning machine
as it must be because as it turns out the
only thing that can exist is [ __ ] because
in reality nothing exists so for you to think that
something does exist that something is objective that something is
non relative well the only way you can get that
is by bullshitting yourself that it's not so people work
really hard to [ __ ] themselves into thinking that
their their morality their values their purpose their very physical
existence their nation their government their philosophy their ideology that
all of that is tangible and objective stuff and that's
precisely why they're so touchy about it and they're so
defensive and they get so offended and so angry when
you start to really burrow in and start to deconstruct
that stuff they hate it if you haven't noticed philosophers
have hated skepticism since the very beginnings of philosophy since
the early Greeks skeptics have been hated why is that
because skeptics are one of the few philosophers who say
hey you know what all the philosophy is probably [
__ ] and all the other philosophers hate that and
the scientists hate that and the intellectuals hate that and
government and leaders hate that and institutions hate that in
businesses hate that they all hate that because they want
to construct conceptual landscapes that's what the mind is for
that's why it's so powerful because it literally creates reality
through illusion and through concept because with all you have
to work with is the medium of illusion within that
domain you can construct something very solid seeming because illusion
within illusion is just reality it looks like reality because
there is no real reality against which to compare the
illusions and of course actualized Org lest you forget is
not immune to this in the same way that Derrida
was not immune to this see deconstruction can be deconstructed
and everything that I talk about with actualized org can
be considered a position by those who don't understand what
actualize that org is really aspiring to be see the
point of actualized org is to show you that you
are drowning in a sea of [ __ ] of
human [ __ ] that's why you suffer that's why
you have all the problems you have in your life
you are bullshitting your family as [ __ ] and
your friends are bullshitting your society as bullshitting everything around
you is [ __ ] you're drowning in a sea
of [ __ ] then you find actualized org and
you think all actualize that org that's solid land let
me swim up on solid land actually no actually I
said Rocky's not solid land if you are drowning in
a sea of liquid [ __ ] actualized org is
an island of solid [ __ ] that you can
creep up onto you crawl up on this island of
solid [ __ ] and for a while it feels
great because like oh at least I'm not drowning in
liquid [ __ ] but then you have to realize
wait a minute isn't this also [ __ ] it's
just a different form of [ __ ] it's helpful
see it's helpful to get yourself out of the liquid
[ __ ] but then you're on the mountain of
solid [ __ ] you gotta say well okay how
can i transcend beyond that how can i transcend beyond
the concepts of enlightenment beyond the concepts of actualize that
org and then eventually ideally what you do is you
become so conscious that you even transcend the island of
[ __ ] and you just completely sort of float
off into empty space and then you're free of all
the [ __ ] altogether but of course the trouble
is that I have to communicate all this to you
using language using concepts so how am I supposed to
use concepts to make you aware of the fact that
concepts are false and dangerous isn't that an inherent paradox
an inherent contradiction yes of course that's the entire problem
of religion the entire problem spirituality is a problem of
mysticism the entire problem of all Zen masters which is
why Zen masters talk in riddles because they're trying to
use concepts to show you that concepts don't work but
then people don't get that to get that requires a
leap in consciousness which most people don't get because actually
most people when they hear you using concepts to criticize
concepts they go ah Leo I got you aren't you
committing the very same sin that you are criticizing all
of us for doing yes of course you have to
jump beyond that just as Derrida was trying to show
for dared on to truly succeed he had to have
no position for me to truly succeed with my work
I have to have no position to and is difficult
because every time I'm delivering a concept my mind tries
to kind of stick to it it clings to it
the very nature of the mind is that it clings
to everything so the whole problem here is how do
you transcend the mind using the mind and the answer
is you really can't so then why are we talking
about this stuff well like I said because even though
everything here is [ __ ] there are degrees of
[ __ ] you can be drowning in liquid [
__ ] so some solid [ __ ] that's what
I consider actual eyes that are solid [ __ ]
can be helpful to keep you from totally drowning but
then once you get yourself up there and then you
got to move beyond it so that's gonna require some
intelligence from you see and it doesn't matter if you're
listening to actualized org or just some other non-dual teacher
or teaching whether you're a Buddhist an advice an EO
ad Viton whether you're a Sufi or Muslim or a
Christian mystic or whatever kind of mysticism you subscribe to
it doesn't matter you're gonna face this problem this is
the core problem of mysticism is that the mind loves
to talk about it and think about it but it
never actually makes the leap off of [ __ ]
island it gets stuck on [ __ ] Island because
it seems like oh well now I'm in a spiritual
community and all isn't this good it's so much better
than what I had before yeah it's a little bit
better being on a solid mountain of [ __ ]
is better than drowning in liquid [ __ ] but
it's still not the ultimate end goal and I hope
that this episode has has helped to convince you of
that to illustrate to you to demonstrate why that is
the case in fact derrida was so close to non-duality
that one of one philosopher who met him said the
following thing the French Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas is said
to have asked Derrida to confess that he was in
fact a modern-day representative of lyric kabbalah so this philosopher
Livanos was a Kabbalist and Kabbalah is just Jewish mysticism
they have a firm handle and understanding of non duality
they had for thousands of years probably for four or
five thousand years the the Jews have understood this and
as I said before Derrida was a Jew he wasn't
a devout Jew I don't think he understood anything about
Kabbalah or cared about it at all but see when
a Kabbalists hears Derrida talking about everything being groundless and
he hears him talking about deconstruction see the Kabbalists instantly
can understand this anyone who's had a true direct experience
of non-duality can understand what Derrida was trying to grasp
at but couldn't quite fully get that's why this guy
accused Derrida of of stealing ideas from from Kabbalah of
course I don't think Derrida I did it's just uh
it's just sort of an accidental convergence because when you're
looking for truth as happened in my case like when
I independently sort of develop my own version of deconstruction
when I was 16 or so I was just looking
for truth and I didn't know any other philosophies so
I was just going Streatley on what's true and if
you just honestly genuinely go for what's true you will
ultimately discover that what's true is complete groundlessness deconstruction is
going to be your method that's why you have negative
theology the method of negative physiology and many different methods
from zen to yoga to neo-advaita to buddhist methods they
involve deconstruction of one form or another and that's a
very powerful method that's what self inquiry ultimately is about
you sit down and you try to deconstruct what you
are until you get to the truth and that's a
that's not an additive process that's not a constructive process
that's a destructive process and that's where most people really
find it unpalatable because people hate deconstructing themselves what they
want is they want to construct themselves into some kind
of spiritual ego some super-ego which is ultra spiritual and
ultra loving and ultra magical and all this sort of
stuff but it turns out that enlightenment and non duality
is really the exact opposite of all that so there
you have it what I want you to do now
is I want you to click on the link down
below the video I have a link to David Loy
paper the deconstruction of Buddhism this is one of the
most important works of philosophy that I've ever read in
my life it's about a twenty page paper it's a
quick read it's not very complicated especially after you've listened
to all this so make sure you go read that
paper because there's profound insights and truths there which take
everything I said here and just take it to a
whole nother level it's gonna completely explain non-duality spirituality and
Western philosophy this one paper puts a nail in the
coffin of all the last two and a half thousand
years of Western philosophy from the Greeks till today this
is the answer after this paper you really don't need
anything more what you need is then you need to
go and you need to actually do the the practices
the actual deconstruction until you actualize the truth alright that's
it I'm out of here make sure you click that
like button for me please come check it actualized org
check out my blog I've posting lots of new stuff
there check out the forum check out life purpose course
check out the book list I've got books along these
topics as well that I'm adding to the book list
and stick with me for more content coming soon I
hope you start to see that more and more stuff
is starting to interconnect and very profound ways and this
is gonna keep happening because this is ultimately why I'm
passionate about actualized org it's not about sharing one technique
or helping you with one problem in your life it's
about interconnecting all of these diverse and very interesting facets
in this rich juicy way sometimes that can get a
little nerdy and it might seem like oo leo is
this very practical do I really need to know all
this stuff do I really know need to know about
Derrida in order to attain enlightenment of course not of
course not if you want to go and just practice
enlightenment in a cave please go do that you don't
need to listen to me ever again but most people
are not capable of doing that number one and number
two well what are you going to do with your
life what I find meaningful in life is I find
meaningful to explore interesting ideas and concepts and see how
they interconnect because I'm a cerebral and sort of intellectual
and conceptual guy maybe you're not in which case you
probably don't want to watch me you probably want to
go do some yoga or something but if you are
I mean what are you gonna do after you're light
and what are you gonna do you're gonna sit around
and do what Wow what I find meaningful and interesting
is you sort of playing around with all these concepts
not because I have to not because it's necessary but
just because it's interesting because ultimately life is about doing
stuff you find interesting and there's no reason why one
thing is more interesting or better than another if you
want to go live in a cave fine if you
want to go watch TV and play video games your
whole life fine if that's what floats your boat and
for me what floats my boat is studying these concepts
and talking about them and thinking about how they all
interconnect to me that's beautiful to me that's like the
artistry of life the artistry of the mind I love
exploring the mind and maybe one day I'll exhaust that
interest then I'll move on to other interests but for
now this is what I'm interested in and for people
who are still on the fence about this and people
who are still deeply stuck in their mind people who
are still floating around in a sea of liquid [
__ ] well a mountain of solid [ __ ]
could be just what you need so stick around for
more of that you
