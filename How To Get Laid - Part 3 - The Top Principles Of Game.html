[Music] how to get laid part three make sure you
go watch part one and part two because i'm not
gonna be repeating that stuff by the way just because
i'm covering this topic does not mean that we're done
with spiritual topics or other sorts of advanced metaphysical topics
i'll be talking about those more in the future like
i've said in the past um i'm gonna be sort
of oscillating back and forth between spiritual topics and very
philosophical topics that are very abstract and metaphysical and epistemological
and also very practical topics so this is part of
the practical stuff and i will have more practical stuff
about just um other aspects of life not just sexuality
not just dating but other things including business and leadership
skills and relationship skills and so forth so all that
is coming and just so you understand that where i'm
coming from it's uh i want a well-rounded set of
teachings and i don't want to just repeat myself endlessly
so my my goal with this work is that every
video stands on its own and talks about a topic
on its own and i don't like to repeat myself
so once i cover a topic that i'm done with
it i move on to something else i'm not just
going to keep covering the same topic year after year
after year all right so let's get into it the
first distinction we should make here is fake value versus
true value so really in order to attract higher quality
people into your life especially relationship wise dating wise you
can do it in one of two ways you can
fake value or you can generate true value basically to
attract higher quality people you need to have higher value
because higher quality people bring more value so what are
you providing in terms of value in this negotiation it
is a sort of a negotiation game here and so
uh what a lot of people do is they try
to fake their value without actually changing themselves to provide
more value to their partners so what i suggest though
is that if you want a solid strategy for attracting
higher quality people and retaining them you know retention can
become a problem if you just do fake value because
with fake value you can you can hook people in
maybe you can even sleep with them a few times
but then you're not going to be able to retain
them because they're going to see that actually they're going
to regret who they slept with and the value you
you bring they see that that was just like a
front it wasn't the real deal so what i recommend
just as a general strategy in life is bring massive
value become a massive value provider stop trying to leech
value from other people and this is true not just
in dating and attraction but in your business in your
career even in your friendships just in general adopt the
principle of being a massive value provider provide way more
value than you ask for in return and this counter-intuitively
will set you up to have a very abundant life
both financially and creatively and with relationships and with women
and so forth become a genuinely valuable man make a
list of what makes for a genuinely valuable man not
just a front and then go about systematic systematically building
that out in your life this is a multi-year long
decades-long maybe even multiple decades-long project that you undertake as
a man and so this of course goes way beyond
just attracting women with your verbal skills and approaching this
also then goes into into deeper aspects of developing yourself
developing your masculinity your core confidence and strengthen yourself your
self-esteem working out various kinds of traumas and psychological baggage
and problems that you have so you don't burden the
woman with that and you don't burden your relationship with
that right that makes you more available in your relationship
for having fun and positive emotions and deeper intimacy and
if you develop yourself financially that gives you more freedom
in terms of the flexibility of your schedule you can
travel more you have more money therefore you can buy
plane tickets you know if you need to see some
girl and she's somewhere else around the country you can
buy a plane ticket you can uh change your schedule
to see her and so forth this kind of flexibility
you know you can develop this develop your lifestyle your
sense of dress your fashion uh even where you live
your bachelor pad so to speak develop that so that
like when a woman comes into your life she's like
wow this guy is really well put together he's not
just spewing some lines at me that sound funny and
cool and interesting and that hooked my attention although maybe
he did a bit of that to grab my attention
but then he hooked me in but then what he
hooked me into was this amazing life and now i
can be part of it and then you will hook
her in even deeper than that because not only will
she partake in your life in the material aspects of
your life that you've developed and the abundance you created
for yourself but then you will also and this is
perhaps the biggest gift that you're going to give her
is that you're going to help her develop herself and
develop her life too and in this way you're going
to offer that kind of leadership that she's not going
to get anywhere else because what other guy is going
to teach her how to meditate teach her about psychedelics
teach her about self-actualization teach her about emotional mastery and
all these other things that you're doing as part of
this larger project of self-actualizing yourself and maybe even awakening
yourself and herself and then growing together and that's really
that's the thing that's going to connect sort of be
the transitional bridge from attracting her to then developing a
deep relationship with her because really what a deep relationship
is about it's about growing together that's what it's about
and so really the whole point of all your attraction
work is to find the right girl who you can
then grow with and self-actualize together with and that's you
know that gets us into relationship advice which we'll cover
in a separate section in a separate video all right
so another point that i forgot to mention which i
probably should have said earlier in the series is that
attraction is one of those things that is deeply deeply
counter-intuitive i've talked about counter-intuitive things in the past the
theme of life being very counter-intuitive i have a whole
episode about that the counterintuitive nature of life it's called
go check that out well attraction is one of those
things and so it's actually very painful when you first
get into learning about attraction there are some painful truths
that you have to come face to face with and
admit to yourself that you're not going to want to
admit and to embrace even uh a lot of the
way that women are attracted to men is the opposite
of what you would think you would think being nice
to the girl and showering her with attention and praise
and compliments and gifts and bending over backwards for her
that this would make her the most attracted to you
you would think that bragging about yourself and showing off
your fancy house car watch your bank account that this
would make her more attracted to you and actually what
it does is it does exactly the opposite it's so
counterintuitive and so it's not enough just for me to
tell you that you literally have to go into the
field and try all these methods that you think will
attract women and then you you watch them fail again
and again and again and you see how painful it
is this sort of nice guy approach you take you
you test it out and you see that it doesn't
work and it hurts you it's like it's like being
stabbed in the heart because here you've been trying to
be nice your whole life you've been trying to be
intelligent you've been trying to be respectful of women and
you know um you were trying to be high consciousness
and wise and all these good characteristics of a self-actualizing
guy you're trying to be all these things and then
you realize that women don't reward you for this in
fact they reward you the most for the exact opposite
behaviors when you act narcissistically like a douchebag when you're
a jerk when you tease them when you push them
away from you a lot of women respond the best
to that kind of behavior and uh that's difficult to
accept it's difficult for us guys to accept it was
difficult for me to accept as a nice guy when
i started learning all this stuff i didn't want to
accept this but i was forced to accept it just
by going out a lot and and seeing what really
works in the real world and also it's it's difficult
for women to admit this to themselves too see like
a lot of women will say no leo that's not
true well the problem with you ladies is that you
don't have experience actually attracting women and so you actually
you're also your mind is also filled with various kinds
of myths about what you want in a guy and
what you're attracted to in a guy and uh what
you think you're attracted to may not be what you
actually respond to in the same way that like i
can sit up here and talk about how i'm a
very healthy guy and i eat the most healthy food
only the healthiest fruits and vegetables and organic stuff but
then when there's a piece of chocolate cake nearby am
i going to eat the chocolate cake am i going
to eat the greasy pizza am i going to eat
the greasy burger or am i going to just eat
a kale salad see and so i have i have
ideas of of what i what i want for myself
like my highest ideals then i have those things that
i actually respond to and so this is this is
part of the challenge of of understanding attraction is that
it's very counterintuitive and that your ideas about it are
not enough you have to actually go and do it
in field and see what women actually respond to and
the process of getting good at attracting women requires you
to rewire your mind your mind literally has to work
in opposite ways and it's that's part of the challenge
of this process that you go out and you talk
to hundreds and thousands of women and each interaction as
it fails and it breaks your heart and you wonder
why did it fail you realize you have to rewire
your mind each one rewires your mind and it trains
you to to think in different ways and you have
to think very fast on your feet you know you
don't have a lot of time with a woman when
you're face to face with her to sit through and
carefully plan something out or things think something through you're
acting on instinct so you have to rewire those instinctual
patterns you have because she's gonna throw something at you
verbally then you got to throw something back at her
verbally and usually it's the opposite of what you thought
you should say a lot of times it's like that
so uh what do women want most at the highest
level attraction-wise relationship wise in their day in their dating
life really what they want a woman wants a player
who she can tame and so in a sense she
wants a very paradoxical and impossible thing because the more
of a player a guy is the more value he
has the more options he has with girls the less
interested in he is in being tamed and committed to
one girl she has to be a very very special
girl for him to give up all the other girls
for her and yet that's exactly every girl's fantasy she
wants to be that special one the one for whom
he gave up all the other girls now will she
get that uh maybe she will actually most players end
up settling down at some point they get it out
of their system after they do it for five or
ten years they get out of their system and they
do end up settling down and getting married or getting
a long-term girlfriend so it's certainly possible for women to
tame a player but the odds of course are against
you because let's say a player sleeps with 50 girls
and he settles down with only one of them of
course he can only settle down with one so that's
a one in 50 chance that you have as a
girl not very good odds so girls play this sort
of dangerous game um they're they're very much attracted to
players even though they don't like admitting it and then
they convince themselves that they can tame the player and
whether they can or not is you know up for
grabs maybe you can maybe you can't it's really not
not very wise to think you can tame a player
um unless you're also bringing a lot to the table
unless you're you're truly an extraordinary girl then uh watch
out um and of course players abuse this this power
we'll be talking about that at the end of the
episode is how this power is abused because that's that's
important to talk about so what i recommend though you
do your strategy is to if you're a nice guy
if you're sort of the typical nice guy actually develop
yourself into more of a player learn how to set
the player frame which will get women attracted to you
quickly and will get them sleeping with you quickly because
one of the most paradoxical aspects of game that you'll
learn is that if you set the boyfriend frame it's
going to take her longer to sleep with you it's
gonna take her three dates to sleep with you if
you set the player frame she'll sleep with you on
the same night now this is completely counter-intuitive because you
would think it would be the opposite you would think
like well a girl should be able to sense that
the guy is a player and therefore she should avoid
him no it actually works the opposite because see when
she thinks that oh this is a boyfriend guy he's
going to be my long-term boyfriend material sort of guy
now she's like oh i got to be extra careful
i don't want to appear too [ __ ] i
got to go really slow we got to build this
thing up you know properly but when she's with a
player guy and she knows he's just a player guy
it's all just for fun it's like oh sure okay
yeah we can sleep together tonight it's just we're just
having fun and we're partying nothing serious is gonna happen
from this so uh he's not gonna judge me and
i'm not going to judge myself and that's it we'll
sleep together i'll forget about him and that's it very
very counterintuitive and many women will not admit this to
themselves but this is actually how it works it's uh
i mean i would love if it worked the opposite
way it would be easier for me if it worked
the opposite way it would be easier for nice guys
if it worked the opposite but it doesn't so anyways
what i recommend is that actually fulfill her deepest fantasy
become the player adopt some of the qualities of the
player and then when you find the right girl you're
gonna end up settling down with her at least for
uh for some while and and then she can feel
that she tamed you and she can feel really special
for that and that will fulfill her deepest fantasy and
at the same time you're not just going to be
this scummy player who has nothing else going in his
life but you know chasing girls you're going to have
all these other things in your life that you've developed
and built so really you're going to be working twice
as hard here as a guy you're going to be
working twice as hard maybe even four times as hard
in order to develop both capacities you're going to develop
the capacities of the provider guy the long-term relationship guy
and the capacities of the player and you're going to
develop that flexibility to kind of jump between the two
uh as appropriate uh really on the front end you
want to wear the player frame and on the back
end once she's attracted to you then you can do
the more provider frame and then you kind of get
the best of both worlds and she will be the
happiest with that situation and you will too but it
takes like four times as much work which is why
it's rare and also because it's rare it's valuable and
she's gonna see that value at some point once you
attract her but let's start talking about attraction again so
uh i mentioned this thing called hook point in the
last episode let's talk about hook point because this is
a crucial thing that when i understood this this this
was a giant chunk of understanding how to attract women
as hook point so if you just walk up to
a random single girl and you start talking to her
and you're being attractive you're speaking to her man to
woman you're flirting with her you're teasing her you're gonna
reach hook point with her within one second to five
minutes it's gonna happen somewhere there so what hook point
means is that you can clearly tell that she's attracted
to you as a sexual partner how do you tell
that hook point has been reached i'll give you a
whole list here in a second uh but really what
it is is you develop an intuition for it you
feel it and i'm going to help you to figure
out how to feel it but really you got to
go in and feel and actually try this some interactions
you have with girls she's just not going to get
attracted to you maybe because you're not her type or
because you two just don't resonate you don't have chemistry
together right so hook point is really the point where
you can clearly tell that there's chemistry between you two
and what's amazing about hook point is that it happens
so fast it happens within five minutes usually and if
it doesn't happen within five minutes it's probably never ever
going to happen and so this is one of the
problems that a lot of guys face who are trying
to like slowly attract women through this sort of subterfuge
or this kind of sneaky long-term approach a lot of
nice guys try to do this it's like there's there's
like susie at work she's my work colleague and i've
known her for five months and you know we've been
talking a little bit and maybe i i think maybe
i can date her and grab her number or something
like this and so i'm trying to like butter her
up butter her up and butter her up and i've
been buttering up for like months but you don't need
to do this literally like you can trigger a girl's
attraction within five minutes you don't need to butter her
up for months in fact if you're buttering her up
for months that's almost a clear sign that she's not
attracted to you and she never will be you don't
need to wait a long time like i was under
the impression that maybe it takes 60 minutes of talking
to a girl to get her finally attracted to me
no all you really need is five minutes if you
can't do it within five minutes that doesn't mean that
not enough time has passed that more time is needed
that means that you weren't charismatic enough and you didn't
present yourself properly within those first five minutes because if
you did she would have gotten attracted or maybe she
wouldn't simply because of you know she's not into your
race your ethnicity your type or maybe she's not looking
for a relationship right now whatever of course there's many
reasons she won't get attracted but if she will get
attracted she can do it within five minutes and oftentimes
what's really shocking is to discover it can happen within
five seconds that's one of the biggest epiphanies you'll have
in game if you go out a lot you approach
a lot you will have girls who you will reach
hook point within five seconds and even faster within a
single second you'll have plenty within a single second you'll
reach hook point and it's so amazing like the most
amazing part of my nights when i go out is
you know i'm walking looking into girl's eyes like sometimes
i get a certain kind of eye contact i can
just tell by the eye contact that i get from
a girl even without talking to her yet as i'm
opening her within one second i already i can already
tell how receptive she is to to my approach and
already i know i've reached hook point and so what's
crucial about reaching hook point is that when you reach
hook point you clearly know she's into you now you
can get away with so much more because if you
haven't reached hook point the girl is going to be
cold and she's going to be logical towards you and
she's gonna be in a sort of a like a
more of a you know two strangers talking or like
two business colleagues talking sort of situation whereas when you
reach hook point then you can escalate really quickly physically
you can start making out with her you can start
kissing her you can start groping her all sorts of
things become possible once hook point is reached so it's
really the magical stage that you want to reach in
every single one of your approaches of course you you
can't reach this in every approach um but it and
then also what you want to do is you want
to register when the hook point is happening and then
you want to capitalize it on it really hard because
what you'll realize is that if you can't hook the
girl within five minutes it's not really worth your time
to stay in there and plow that set for 60
minutes like sometimes when i when i first began gaming
years ago um i would just think that you know
well the longer i stay in set and the longer
we talk then the more chances that she's going to
like me and i would do these long 60 minute
sets or 90 minutes that's where i would just talk
and talk and talk and entertain the girls with stories
and you know whatever and i would think that well
at some point she's gonna get attracted it's like no
the problem was that i didn't do it within five
minutes properly i didn't hook it within five minutes and
then all the rest was just a waste of time
right like and sometimes you'll have that sometimes you'll just
be talking to a few girls and if you didn't
talk to them you didn't begin the interaction with a
clear dominant sort of a man-to-woman frame then no matter
how long you talk to them you'll see that it's
going to just kind of devolve the set is going
to develop into sort of a friendly conversation it's going
to be nice and friendly but it's not going to
lead to any sex or any dating and so hook
point here becomes a really crucial distinction that you want
to reach and quickly make um and you really want
to be able to tell within seconds if it happened
and if you're doing physical openers so what's great about
physical openers is that they tend to be very polarizing
and either you reach hook point immediately within a few
seconds or she blows you out because you're not her
type or whatever and she just blows you out she's
not receptive and so with with physical openers you know
you can open let's say 20 girls in a night
at a club and maybe two of them within a
few seconds will immediately reach hook point and so it's
those two that you got to focus on and then
all the other 18 who just weren't receptive you just
completely forget about those ignore those doesn't matter and focus
on those two and then maybe one of those two
you can convert to something all right so how do
you tell that you reach hook point it's the point
that you can tell that she's clearly attracted to you
so the most important aspect of this is that her
attention shifts to you so one of the most challenging
things to do when you're cold approaching a girl is
just to get her attention to shift to you because
a lot of times girls are in their own space
thinking about their own problems focus on their friends focus
on having fun focused on dancing focus on other guys
that they're you know with in the group focus on
everything but you you come in there and you know
you approach her and she gives you a little bit
of attention because you demand it when you do a
strong confident approach but then her attention will waver off
to something else unless you attract her attract her attention
and then her attention shifts to you she starts looking
you in the eyes she starts facing you she turns
towards you and she's very attentive and she's listening to
what you're saying and she's interested in it she's not
just there to entertain you like some sort of salesman
or a telemarketer where she's just kind of like nodding
along just you know just to be polite she's genuinely
interested in you something about you is special in her
eyes and she wants to know more about you also
how you can tell is that she lets you touch
her she lets you hug her without any flinching or
resistance she lets you rub her body she lets you
put your hands on her hips she lets you put
your hand around her shoulders like this you can hold
her like this this is this is big and and
so the nice thing about a physical opener if you
open her physically is that you can immediately tell her
receptiveness to your touch some girls you can open them
very hard physically and she will just be immediately receptive
you can like walk up to a girl and just
immediately start hugging her and she will be receptive to
it and this clearly tells you that she's she's interested
and then from there like you can immediately tell that
things are on and then you just carry it on
now of course some girls could be interested in you
but they could still be a little bit frigid and
a little bit standoffish in terms of physical touch not
all girls are into you know heavy physical touching right
away uh so sometimes you can you will need to
go a little bit slower but in general once you
reach hook point she's going to be very very open
to being physically touched by you in various ways of
course you still have to escalate in a smooth fashion
you don't want to be too abrupt uh and you
know you want to start with lighter touching and move
on to heavier stuff but especially if she lets you
like for example put your hands on her hips like
that's a really good indicator that she's uh attracted to
you and you've already reached hook point and so you
can use physical touch to actually test for how for
whether you did reach hook point you know just see
how much physical touch you can get away with and
that that can be one of the best clues to
uh how attracted she is to you also she cares
about what you're saying and what you're doing and when
her attention breaks off let's say her friend comes to
her and starts grabbing her attention away she will turn
to her friend talk to her friend but then she
will turn back to you if you reach hook point
if you haven't reached hook point usually what happens is
that her attention is so fickle that her friend can
just take her attention away or some other guy can
come in and take her attention away and then she
loses she forgets all about you see if she forgets
about you within a second that means you didn't hook
her but if she keeps coming back to you and
especially if her friends drag her away like let's say
they drag her away 10 feet for a few minutes
and then she comes back to she actually walks back
to you that's obvious sign that you hooked her and
that she's attracted to you because no girl would do
that if if she wasn't attracted to you um so
so look for that your goal should be to grab
her attention within the first five minutes so strongly in
such a compelling fashion that then she will be returning
back to you like a puppy dog for the rest
of the night now that in practice that's pretty difficult
to do because when girls go out you know they're
partying they're drinking they're with their friends it's chaos they're
dancing and so it can be difficult to grab her
attention but you can do it another clear sign of
hook point is that she wants to know more about
you which means she starts asking you a lot of
questions she starts asking you for her for your name
she asks you what you do she asks you where
you're from and she asks you even deeper more personal
questions about yourself usually unless you reach hook point most
girls will not be asking you these questions simply because
they don't care they're not invested enough in you but
once she's attracted now she wants to know more about
you because in a sense now she's sort of trying
to figure out like well who is this guy i
want to know more about him if i'm going to
date him or sleep with him another point here of
hook point is she qualifies herself to you what that
means is that she tells you about why she's worthy
of you she starts to justify herself to you she
tells you about her job if her job is good
she tells you how much money she makes if she
makes a lot of money she tells you how um
loving she is she tells you all of her good
qualities so that it's almost like she's trying to impress
you or bragging a little bit about herself because she
was the way the way it basically works from her
from her perspective is like this it's like well this
guy is amazing i don't even feel on his level
he's above me and i want him to kind of
register and notice me as a potential you know mating
opportunity so let me qualify myself to him and and
kind of brag to him a little bit how good
i am and maybe that'll get his attention so if
she's doing that to you then clearly she likes you
of course another very obvious sign of hook point is
that she gives you compliments if she tells you you're
cute if she tells you you're handsome if she tells
you you're a good looking guy if she tells you
you're wonderful you're amazing these sorts of things obvious girls
never say this unless you hook them another very good
sign is that she laughs at things you say that
aren't even funny she's giggling another good sign is that
she has difficulty maintaining eye contact if you're doing very
strong sexual eye contact and then she has to look
away or she has to kind of like coily turn
to the side because she can't hold the eye contact
but not in a sort of way where she doesn't
want to talk to you like she still wants to
talk to you she still has a smile on her
face but she just can't maintain that strong sexual eye
contact because you've been practicing it and she hasn't um
that's also a really good sign and the final sign
of hook point is that she follows you around if
you try to move her she's compliant so if you
move her two feet you're like hey come over here
this is a better place to sit and it's just
two feet and she comes with you without any resistance
or any questioning obviously she's attracted to you and then
the further you lead her and the more compliant she
is the more attracted to you she basically is the
more she trusts you so if you're like hey let's
let's get let's walk outside the bar so my friends
are there usually a girl will not walk with you
outside the bar unless you've hooked her so those are
some of the points look for all of these develop
a radar and intuition for this when you're going out
and your job as a newbie when you're first starting
this is that your job is to approach very consistently
and then to hook as much as possible within the
first five minutes and if you're not able to hook
it can still be worthwhile for you to stick and
set just to practice your verbals uh when i was
a newbie i would try to you know do 60
minute sets even if they were just friend to friend
and nothing sexual was coming out of it still it's
still useful but eventually when you get to an intermediate
advanced stage you're going to want to cut those off
and if you can't hook within five minutes just move
on to the next girl that's basically how you make
the most efficient use of your time out all right
now let's move on to the list of the top
principles of game so principle number one is go out
go out game doesn't work if you're not going out
some of this stuff the fundamentals are so simple you
start learning game theory there's so much theory out there
on the internet that you can find products courses seminars
workshops videos channels whatever you know you can find all
sorts of you can spend thousands of hours studying advanced
pickup theory but uh really a lot of it's just
a waste of your time you'll be much better off
spending that time most of that time spend 99 95
of your time going out rather than reading theory go
out learn from the field that's where you get your
results you can't get laid unless you're going out the
next principle is in field is king that means that
a lot of the things that you're stressing over and
you don't know how to solve about your game like
you know leo how do i approach what opener should
i use should i say this thing or that thing
should i hug her or kiss her and at what
time did i reach hook point or didn't i reach
hook point uh you know how do i get her
back to my place like all these sorts of questions
that you know you're looking for theory to fix this
most of this stuff will just auto correct by going
out go out it's okay if you don't know some
of these things you're not going to know the answer
to most these questions when you start going out just
go out and trust that by gaining a lot of
experience and running tests yourself when you're out that's how
you really learn even if you sit down and learn
all the theory for a thousand hours you're not going
to be able to register and implement and embody that
theory when you're actually out in practice it takes a
lot of going out and week after week month after
month you slowly learn lessons and make distinctions and integrate
various aspects of theory and basically you're going to develop
your own theories and principles just from going out and
uh doing testing right like test if you if you
don't know uh if you have some sort of question
rather than asking someone online on some forum or some
reddit thread or whatever i mean you could do that
that can be helpful but but your first instinct instinct
should not be to ask me or somebody on the
internet your first things instinct should be like well i'm
going out friday and saturday so why don't i test
it why don't i test this opener versus that opener
why don't i test kissing her versus not kissing her
and see how it works and what what what works
and what doesn't work this makes it empirical otherwise you
start getting into elaborate theories and your labor theories they
don't match up with the actual empirical reality of talking
to a girl so infield is king it trumps everything
else and all the theory comes from in field otherwise
it's not valid theory the next principle is called the
law of state transference this is a principle popularized by
rsd um so this principle means what you feel she
feels girls are very emotional and guys are leading the
interaction so your emotions as the guy are leading the
interaction so if you feel depressed and insecure and fearful
and anxious around her and nervous guess what she's gonna
feel insecure anxious nervous around you if you feel weird
and creepy she's gonna feel weird and creepy if you
feel awkward you're gonna make her feel awkward if you're
terrified of her she's going to be terrified of you
emotions transfer between people they transfer through your eye contact
through your posture your body language your vocal tonality all
the sub-communications those subtle signals that she's just instinctively reading
off you women are really good at reading these subtle
cues implicitly much better than guys they have to because
it's important for their survival they need to just instinctively
tell whether you're a rapey creepy weird [ __ ]
guy or you're a cool chill fun social guy so
she can tell this within seconds so what this principle
this is a crucial principle what this what this principle
means is that you got to put yourself into a
good playful mood and state when you're talking to girls
in order to attract them it also means that you
got to be attracted to them for them to be
attracted to you and you can't be hiding your attraction
for them because then you're reducing your chances of them
being attracted to you so a big aspect of your
game to work on is actually put yourself into a
fun playful happy mood when you're going out put yourself
into a flirtatious sexy mood when you're going out because
that's how you want her to feel when she's talking
to you so this is why building your state is
also so important that's another principle lower on the list
that we'll get to you know building your state the
reason why you got to build your state is because
your state is going to rub off on her and
so as a newbie one of the biggest problems i
can tell you that you're gonna have is you're not
gonna you're not gonna be in a state of playfulness
and flirtation and fun and you're not gonna feel very
sexy you're gonna feel insecure you're gonna feel awkward and
creepy and perhaps most of all you're gonna just feel
anxious and terrified especially when you're talking to very beautiful
women at night they're all dressed up dolled up uh
you know they're cleavages hanging out they're wearing skimpy dresses
you might think she's really beautiful really hot you're talking
to like this girl who looks like a model standing
here and you're nervous and you're scared that rubs off
on her and that's why you failed to attract her
so you got to get to a point where you're
very loose in your body you're very comfortable at the
club even when the loud music is blaring you can't
even hear yourself think you got to be very comfortable
very relaxed and when you're talking to her it has
to feel very casual and easy rather than forceful and
anxious and you're kind of like looking at her with
these scared eyes the scared eyes remove all fear from
your eyes all anxiety from your eyes because any fear
in your eyes is going to transfer to her and
will immediately blow you out it's going to be very
creepy it's going to feel very creepy and awkward to
her and she'll just run away from you sometimes girls
will literally run away from you know try it go
out to a club and just give a girl like
walk up to a girl and just give her a
kind of a scared look she'll run away from you
and that will show you the power of the lawsuit
on the other hand go out and just be be
having fun dancing with your friends laughing and all this
and as you're laughing just literally a girl is walking
by just [ __ ] grab her and pull her
in and just [ __ ] hug her while you're
laughing and you'll see she's gonna start laughing and she's
gonna start hugging you back and she's gonna start smiling
and giggling and it's gonna be on immediately you'll you'll
you'll hook her within a second by doing that just
through law of state transference the next principle we discussed
already in part two but let's reiterate it man to
woman communication you gotta look at her in a sexual
way the frame of the entire conversation has to be
sexual without saying anything explicitly sexual it can't be a
business communication it can't be a sales communication it can't
be a friend to friend communication so work on this
principle man to woman every time you're talking to a
girl who you're who you are attracted to make it
man to woman how do you do that well um
you can drop little you know subtle hints you can
just tell her she's cute she's beautiful you can give
her compliments like that um you can say she's sexy
you can you can do it through the way you
physically touch her but most importantly it's how you look
at her look at her like a wolf looks at
a rabbit look at her like a uh cat looks
at a canary uh but it has to be playful
too right because there's there's two aspects to the look
if it's just like raw sexual energy but you have
like a deadpan serious face then you're gonna give her
like a rapist vibe and that's not gonna work um
so you gotta you gotta give that kind of sexy
look but at the same time it's you got to
be smirking and smiling it has to be playful like
i don't know if i'm doing it right it feels
very awkward to do it here to a camera but
practice that practice giving her that kind of like sly
sexy playful masculine look and what could even help you
more with that is actually when you're looking at her
imagine like you're having sex with her the kind of
look you would give her if you were having sex
with her but again maintain the smile otherwise you're going
to give her that creepy rapist look that will scare
her off and in general when you're communicating with her
man to woman it's like you're not talking about the
weather right it's it's a more intimate communication it's sort
of a banter back and forth that involves a lot
of teasing and flirtation and it's like personal between you
two so you're basically talking about her and you you're
not talking about the weather you're not talking about sports
you're not talking about spirituality although of course you could
be talking about these things but you have to you
have to imbue that with a certain like um intimacy
and a sort of like you and us together against
the whole world look at her or just maybe another
frame of mind you can take is just assume that
she's already your girlfriend how would you talk to her
if she was already your girlfriend like that uh the
next principle is let her feel your raw sexual desire
for her and and what i mean by this is
is not sexually groping her but i mean like if
you if you're genuinely attracted to a woman um one
of the problems is that the way we're raised culturally
is that like we're taught to hide that as men
it's not appropriate to show that like if you find
a woman sexy at work it's not appropriate for you
to comment on that you have to hide it right
at school you had to hide it uh and probably
you're hiding it even when you're at the bar or
the club where it's actually appropriate to express that you're
also hiding it you're repressing it and you feel like
if you showed it to her then she would get
scared or be weird and awkward um actually some of
the best results you'll get is if you don't jerk
off for a week or two so that you actually
feel very sexual and then you go out to the
club go out to the bar and with that raw
sexual energy inside of you that genuine desire you find
a girl you really are into her those hormones are
pumping through through your body through your mind and then
that energy you broadcast that energy and you transfer that
energy onto her the way you look at her the
way you talk to her the way you you put
your hands on her all of that now keep in
mind nothing sexual needs to be said at all it's
just the energy you're putting forth and also it's your
genuine desire for like do you want her do you
want her tonight because see a lot of guys especially
as newbie you go out there and it's like why
are you going out well i want to get laid
okay you want to get laid but see it's it's
an abstraction it's like yeah i want to get laid
someday if i keep going out eventually maybe in a
week or two in a month i'll get laid i
mean you can start there of course but eventually you
want to get to the point where it's not like
you're just going out and maybe you'll get laid or
maybe you won't it's like no i'm out i see
that girl i want that girl that one right there
tonight right like tonight we're making it [ __ ]
happen i'm gonna do everything possible to make it happen
tonight that kind of intentfulness is very important if you
want serious results and uh and she's gonna feel that
from you and that's gonna suddenly influence how you're talking
to her and also the the urgency and the energy
you're putting into um uh the interaction and what you're
willing to do to make it happen i um i
remember when i first started going out like i didn't
i didn't really even have the possibility of of sleeping
with that girl the same night i mean i knew
it was possible but it was so far away it
was such an abstraction that it wasn't like palpable in
the moment when i was talking to her so practice
just transferring your raw sexual desire onto her when you're
talking to her and you can you'll you'll feel and
you'll experience how powerful this is and and really to
do this don't jerk off for a while don't have
sex for a while for a few days for a
few weeks uh and then you'll see how powerful that
can be another principle is allow your true self to
get rejected so when you're first starting off you might
fear rejection so much that you put on a sort
of a act or a persona or a mask when
you're talking to a girl therefore she's not really rejecting
the true you when she rejects you and this this
is safe for you because yeah she rejected you but
she didn't reject the real you so what you want
to do is you want to try to remove all
the masks and all the sort of dancing monkey acts
and just at least try this once a night walk
up to a girl as your true authentic self without
trying to be too gamey with her and running some
routines on her and some dancing monkey you know stories
and stuff just like be completely yourself and try to
get her to reject you as your true self this
is very healthy for you to grow and what you'll
probably realize is that when you're going up to her
and just being your true self without any routines or
masks or games or monkey business and you try to
get rejected you might notice that actually she doesn't reject
you she gets more attracted to you and this will
show you that actually the most advanced forms of game
is about letting all the monkey routines go and just
like being chill and being your authentic self and of
course of course girls will still reject you there's no
guarantee that she won't if you approach enough girls many
of them will still reject you even for your true
self but you got to be mad enough to take
that rejection because see what you really want is you
want the girl to love you not for your dancing
monkey routines and for your lines and your games you
want her to love you for you otherwise it's not
going to feel satisfying to you so if girls are
rejecting you for your true self your authentic self then
girls will also be those who you will be hooking
will be getting hooked to your true self and this
is what really builds that inner core self-esteem and confidence
is you'll realize that yeah sure some girls reject my
true self but plenty of girls get attracted to my
true self and that makes you feel good about yourself
now you can start to love yourself and that will
help you to heal some of that insecurity that you
feel about yourself you know a lot of guys think
they're not attractive they're not good looking enough they're not
lovable and other things like that and that they have
to act out some sort of routine for the girl
in order for her to love you no girls can
love you for your true self but you have to
be vulnerable enough to put that on the line you
got to be man enough to put yourself on the
line so practice that another principle is be positive bring
value and energy if there's a couple of girls at
the bar and they're having fun and laughing and then
you walk up there and you bring less energy than
they have in the group you're less positive than them
they're laughing more than you they're having more fun than
you you are like leeching their energy and they're gonna
feel that you're a value taker you're not a value
provider so try to actually when you're entering a set
add value and energy into the set add positivity add
humor into the set then they're gonna see like oh
this guy's cooler than us he's more playful he laughs
more than us he makes better jokes than us he
he he wants to dance more than us he has
more energy than us and then they get attracted to
your positive energy you see and for this you got
to put yourself in a great state going back to
that point another principle is that attraction is not a
choice this is a phrase from david deangelo the classic
dating guru attraction is not a choice that's his phrase
so what that means is that your attraction to her
is not something you logically chose and her attraction to
you is also not something she logically chose a lot
of times if you ask women online like on a
forum like hey ladies what do you get attracted to
they will tell you they'll give you a list of
all the sort of qualities they want in their ideal
boyfriend but a lot of this is nonsense because in
reality a woman doesn't get attracted while she's sitting at
a computer answering a logical question nor does she get
attracted when she's in a laboratory environment like some scientists
or some researchers at the university that you know they
invite a few girls over and then they show them
pictures of of men with their jaws and their six-pack
abs and the sports cars they drive and so forth
how much hair they have and whatever and then say
okay ladies which of these guys are you most attracted
to and then the woman is sitting there and making
sort of logical choices this is not how a woman
actually gets attracted in real life when you go out
to a bar to a club her attraction is not
a logical choice and a lot of times she will
get attracted to exactly the wrong kind of guy she'll
get attracted to the guy who does not fit all
of her ideal criteria she might say she wants she's
going to be attracted to the most spiritual the most
awake the most healthy the most nice the the the
provider guy with the most money and who's tall and
who has a nice mustache and whatever else she might
say all that but then in practice when she's standing
at the bar with her friends and she's bored and
then you come over and you're short and maybe you
don't have as much hair as that guy you don't
have a mustache you whatever you're not her type maybe
she says she wants a white guy and you're like
an asian guy and you walk over there and you're
chatting her up but you're funny you're charming your friends
are around you you're in a really good mood you
know how to dance a little bit you're dancing with
her you hug her this sort of stuff you make
her feel good better than her friends make her feel
and she gets attracted to you that wasn't a logical
choice she made and her attraction for you is genuine
and from that she will be able to sleep with
you whereas from all of that logical stuff if you
walk up to her and you just say hey you
know what i got a nice car and i got
a nice mustache and i got a nice watch i
got it i own a house i'm into spirituality i'm
very awake all this you tell her all this and
she's not gonna get attracted to you even though that
might hit all of her points on her logical list
because women do not have sex from logic this is
one of the other principles the other principle here is
never try to logically sell yourself to a woman because
women never have sex from logic you cannot logically convince
a woman to sleep with you you can't walk up
to her and say hey hey baby you know i'm
going to take good care of you i'm going to
give you so many orgasms it's going to be amazing
come on come home with me no she's never gonna
come home with you um and this is why when
a woman rejects you sometimes as guys you know you
you're needy and you're like oh maybe i can convince
her through text messages i can convince her that i'm
the right guy for her and you start to logic
with this woman stop doing that she's never gonna sleep
with you from that that's a fundamental misunderstanding of how
women have sex she needs to be emotionally stimulated if
a woman is in a logical mood if a woman
was in a logical mood her entire life she would
never have sex with anybody the only time women have
sex is when some guy comes along and busts her
out of the logical mood that she's in 95 of
the time throughout her day you know 95 of time
she's logical and then that five percent window she's emotional
when the guy is being charismatic and funny and witty
and charming and flirty she gets a little emotional about
it then he starts to physically escalate she gets more
emotional she gets turned on and then she has sex
and even then if if her logic kicks in she
will not have sex with the guy you know if
her logic says oh i'm going to be a [
__ ] if i sleep with him i was like
oh my friends are watching me or it's like oh
i got work tomorrow it was like oh i don't
know this guy if any of that logic kicks in
she will not have sex with him so the guy's
job is to disarm all the logic and so the
reason that most guys don't get laid is because they're
way too logical if you're going to be logical through
law of state transference she's going to be logical and
then she'll never have sex with you so perhaps the
number one thing you can do to get laid more
besides just going out and socializing the number two thing
you can do you know and also maybe besides approaching
you gotta approach maybe the number three thing you can
do after going out and approaching is be as emotional
as possible with the women that you're approaching and disable
all their logic scramble all their logic so a lot
of what game comes down to is just scrambling her
logic you gotta scramble her mind so that the logic
is turned off because otherwise she's not gonna have sex
with you and you might say oh yeah that's so
manipulative in a certain sense yeah it's very manipulative on
the other hand that's what's required for most women to
have sex they're not gonna have sex with you for
logical reasons and so and also they like it right
see a feminine girl likes to feel like she's a
girl she spends the majority of her day at work
being logical pushing buttons on a computer that doesn't make
her feel very feminine so when she goes out to
a club or to a bar she drinks she lets
loose a little bit she's out of her logical mind
due to the alcohol she goes and dances the dancing
further puts her out of her logical mind she's making
jokes with her friends that further puts her out of
a logical mind then you come in there and you
start blasting her with some game some you know some
flirtation some teasing uh you do a little push pull
on her you know spike up her emotions up and
down give her some emotional feelings you know play a
little bit hard to get this sort of stuff and
now she gets really on that emotional roller coaster and
then you start escalating on her physically now she gets
feelings of you know erotic feelings now she's very emotional
now she's ready to sleep with you that's how it
works and if you don't do any of that stuff
she's probably never going to sleep with you next principle
is the three second rule and also the three the
thirty second game so the three second rule is sort
of old mystery method uh principle uh basically if you
see a girl that you're attracted to approach her within
three seconds the more you hesitate the worse your approach
is going to be so train yourself to approach within
three seconds of seeing a girl and really you should
cut it down to even less than three seconds but
we'll give you three seconds as a newbie uh and
the other uh aspect of this is you can play
the 30-second game which means you walk into a club
or into a bar you don't want to approach you
give yourself 30 seconds and at the end of those
30 seconds you got to approach somebody anybody it doesn't
matter who and then you keep playing that game anytime
you get stuck in your head and you feel like
you don't want to approach you play the 30-second game
and you force yourself within 30 seconds to approach somebody
new and you just keep doing that all night long
and you'll see if you do that play this game
you can also play it with a friend if you
have a wingman out you can both give each other
30 seconds you know alternate you know i give you
30 seconds you give me 30 seconds and we got
to approach in those 30 seconds because otherwise you're gonna
be making rationalizations and excuses and you'll just stand there
for 10 20 30 minutes not approaching anybody and then
you're gonna be in such a terrible mood you won't
be able to approach anybody the rest of the night
and you'll go home and it'll be the worst night
of your life so the 30-second game will save you
from that the next principle is context sensitivity and calibration
so basically all game techniques no matter what techniques you
learn are highly contextual requiring a masterful calibration and social
acuity that means whatever technique you're using whatever verbal you're
saying whatever lines you're using uh if you're doing physical
escalation anything it has to fit the context so you
have to always ask yourself where am i talking to
the girl am i at a loud club am i
in a lounge am i in a bar is it
like a high energy bar or a low energy bar
is the music very loud or is it kind of
soft that means we can actually have a conversation am
i on the dance floor of the bar or the
club or am i in the quiet area am i
indoors am i outdoors is it hot is it cold
um am i at the mall am i at a
cafe depending on all these different contexts certain techniques and
lines and maneuvers will work and others will not and
so how do you know what fits where you have
to you have to fit what you're saying to the
girl to the specific situation as much as possible so
that it comes out very natural otherwise what's going to
happen is that you're going to be like spouting lines
or techniques at her but it's going to be so
incongruent it's not going to be fitting the situation and
so this is what makes games so difficult is that
you have to practice it in all these different contexts
and you got to see what works in which context
certain lines and openers will work in certain contexts but
not in others like a physic very physical opener can
work great on the dance floor in a very loud
nightclub in las vegas but it's not going to work
in some sort of loungy bar little hole in the
wall bar maybe in san francisco where there's not very
loud music and there's not even a dance floor and
people are just kind of sitting around and maybe they're
part of a very it might like certain places like
in vegas for example there's not a lot of social
circle type of stuff whereas in many parts of the
of the country they have these like little bars and
it's very social circle everybody there knows everybody else it's
not like a bunch of strangers like in las vegas
for example and so you gotta you gotta be cognizant
of that so if you're in a location talking to
girls where all the girls are part of big social
circles everybody knows everybody else you got to play a
different kind of game a more indirect kind of game
than you would play where everybody's just strangers having fun
and it's all chaos there you can just grab girls
start making out with them you can't do that when
all the girls know each other and it's a more
kind of chill environment also during the day there's different
expectations of how to hit on girls during the day
that at night uh if you're hitting on a girl
for example maybe in new york city on the street
late at night you gotta understand that like girls are
gonna be extra wary of dudes just walking up on
the street late at night she doesn't know you could
be a [ __ ] thief you could have a
gun or a knife or you could be a homeless
person like she doesn't know right so you need a
certain set of techniques for that specific situation i'm not
saying you can't open in that situation you can you
can open you can hook in that situation but you're
gonna have to be more calibrated right so there if
you're walking up to a girl like in some dark
alley behind the club as she's walking home and you
want to chat her up like you're going to have
to have some sort of like disarming techniques like hey
don't don't worry you know i'm not a homeless i'm
not a homeless criminal or something you might want to
open with that kind of line just to disarm her
a little bit uh just to show her that you're
cool that you understand the situation you got to be
sort of aware of her own internal um concerns and
fears that she legitimately has as a you know a
girl um because sometimes girls can put themselves in dangerous
situations you got to like be able to understand what
the dangers are for her and then to empathize with
those and then to disarm those and to show her
that you're not fitting into that kind of stereotype you're
not that kind of guy you're not the creepy rapey
pushy uh you know criminal whatever guy and that you're
very socially calibrated and how do you become very socially
calibrated by going out a lot and practicing in various
different kinds of environments think of it almost like what
you're doing and in fact this is literally true is
it's like training a neural network ai neural networks you
know they're trained to recognize do image recognition and so
forth uh by by iterating thousands of times and then
making mistakes then making little corrections fine-tuned themselves and then
over time they become really good at recognizing images numbers
letters words so forth well that's literally what's happening inside
your brain when you're going out week after week month
after month for years and you're failing over and over
and over again and occasionally you're having successes and then
you're you're learning to make distinctions between your failures and
your successes and you're training up your neural network you're
literally developing a neural network for how to attract women
and how to handle all of their objections and you
know common excuses and all of their fears and how
to make them comfortable and not feel awkward around you
so as you're going out you know pay attention what
makes her feel awkward what makes her feel scared what
makes her feel uncomfortable and then find little strategies for
disarming that so that she can feel comfortable with you
because she can't have sex with you she's not comfortable
with you if she feels awkward with you right make
it very smooth and easy and then it'll happen the
next principle is congruence congruence means that whatever words are
coming out of your mouth they have to be congruent
with your own personality and how you feel a lot
of times you're gonna be in this great state one
night and you're gonna just spout some line off the
top of your head something you come up with you
know on the moment and it's gonna be the perfect
line for the perfect situation for the perfect girl you're
talking to and it's going to hit and it's going
to hook immediately and it's going to be wonderful and
then the next night you go out and say hey
you know i remember that line from yesterday that i
came up with why don't i just use it again
and it'll work just as well right and so you
go go up to a different girl now it's a
different environment you're in a different mood you're not feeling
the way you were feeling before you're not maybe in
a high energy state and you deliver the same line
the same opener from last night and it bombs and
she blows you out what happened well again everything is
so contextual it very much depends on what mood you're
in what energy you're in like if you're in a
very positive playful mood with your friends the things you
say will be very uh will will be perceived very
differently than if you say those things when you're in
a depressed low energy mood none of your friends are
around you and you have approach anxiety and you're scared
and you're walking up to a girl who's maybe a
little bit above your league it's not gonna land the
same way a lot of times some of the most
flashiest game and some of the craziest most obnoxious openers
they can work so well when you're fully congruent with
them but then if a newbie says it like an
advanced an advanced guy could say it it lands so
well but when a newbie says it it just it
comes off as creepy and awful that's because the newbie
is scared he's not congruent with it so um try
to be more congruent that means if you're feeling in
a low energy state then you need to have game
that works in that state basically you need to have
a form of gain that's low energy and a form
of game that's high energy depending on like what mood
you're in because like let's say you're feeling depressed and
you just got out to the club you walk up
to some girls and what are you gonna say are
you gonna say you're happy no you should sort of
own the fact that you know hey ladies you know
tonight [ __ ] sucks i had a shitty day
i'm feeling depressed you know own it be congruent with
how you feel and you know of course that's not
ideal ideally you would be in a better mood but
if you're depressed then just sort of admit you're depressed
if you're shy maybe even admit that you're shy if
you're feeling awkward or scared maybe even admit that you're
feeling awkward or scared at least that's congruent and then
based on that you can kind of build up your
state further but if you are depressed or shy or
scared and you try to walk up to them and
pretend as though you're happy and high energy you're probably
gonna bomb that the next principle is build up state
and momentum by getting rejected so the beautiful thing about
building up state and momentum is that it's not really
the successes that build it up it's oftentimes the biggest
bombs and the biggest rejections so one of the best
things you can do early in the night is get
a huge rejection just like walk up to a girl
and just like be completely tongue-tied and awkward and have
her completely blow you out and then what you notice
is that yeah it felt awful for like a second
but then as you walk away you realize nothing bad
really happened it was just a little bit of awkwardness
a little bit of embarrassment and then there's gonna be
a sense of like i can relax i can just
you know let myself go it's not a big deal
that i got rejected it's not a big deal that
i said something stupid or embarrassing there's more girls to
talk to and um and that builds your state and
so a lot of times just the idea in your
mind that you have a rejection is a lot worse
than the actual rejection itself and so usually rather than
trying to avoid rejection early in the night actually embrace
the idea that you're going to get rejected and actually
sort of look forward to it walk into the club
and just tell yourself okay let me get my first
big blowout let me just get totally rejected [ __
] it this relieves the pressure because when you first
walk in and you put the pressure on yourself like
oh i gotta approach this girl and be perfect you're
just not going to be warmed up enough you're going
to be tongue-tied and kind of logical and it's going
to be kind of rusty it's not going to go
so well and so the related principle here is warm-up
warm-up sets especially at night time do warm-up sets your
first five to ten girls you talk to are just
the warm-up so don't judge yourself for the warm-up sets
in fact you could say that you know what the
first 10 approaches i do tonight i'm not going to
judge myself at all i'm not going to place any
expectations on this at all i don't have to be
suave or charming or funny or flirtatious i don't have
to be in a good mood nothing all i have
to do is just walk up and talk for the
first 10 10 girls and just see how it goes
i'm not going to judge myself at all and then
after those 10 then i can start to put a
little bit more expectation on it where i'm actually going
to try to be a little bit more flirty and
fun because i'm going to be now i'm going to
be warmed up the first 10 or just warm up
because otherwise you're going to walk in there you're going
to expect yourself to be perfect on the first one
and it's going to put way too much pressure on
you and then you're going to delay and hesitate and
not make that first approach for a whole hour because
you're going to be like stuck in your head thinking
about what should i say to make it perfect to
avoid the blowout just get blown out get blown out
10 times and then you'll relax and then you'll be
able to move forward the next principle is become comfortable
in your own body this is actually closely related to
that idea of law of state transference because if you're
tense in your body if you're uncomfortable in your body
she's going to feel that off you it's going to
come through in your body posture and even in the
the flow of the words that are coming out of
your mouth this this is related to how tense you
are in your body how how how you're carrying tension
in your face in your neck and everywhere else so
just practice practice going out and just relaxing and being
completely at ease the way that you would be at
home but like in a loud nightclub because usually when
you walk into a light now into a loud nightclub
you're not going to be as at ease as you
are at home on the couch watching tv you need
to be that at ease you can't do a good
approach if you're fearful anxious stiff tense or stuck in
your head so practice just relaxing and you can practice
relaxing completely relax your body until you're completely comfortable you're
at ease you have no thoughts in your head you
have no tension in your body you're not stiff or
anxious and then from that place immediately do an approach
and you'll notice that it goes a lot better the
next principle is clear your mind as you approach so
you're going to spend a lot of time probably thinking
a lot analyzing your game thinking about what could i
have said better which line could i have used uh
what went wrong in my approach what should i say
next and so forth you can do all that when
you're not doing the approach you can do that when
you're at home later in the night when you're out
of the club you can do that you can analyze
your sets and you should and you can look for
ways to fine-tune stuff but when you're in the club
your only objective should be to have fun when you
enter the club forget all about your lines forget all
about what went right or what went wrong the other
night forget all about analyzing your approaches forget all about
all the logical stuff completely throw that out when you're
in the club clear your mind as much as possible
and especially when you're beginning to do the approach like
you see a girl you're gonna walk up your feet
are moving to walk up to her completely clear your
mind you don't want any ideas of like what should
i say should i say this thing or that thing
remove all that you want to as you approach just
instinctively react you're going to be reacting you're going to
be completely in sort of unconscious execution mode and you
don't want any thoughts interfering with that so practice that
this is very counterintuitive because as you're approaching her you
think that you can get an advantage and that you're
going to have a better approach by pre-planning what you're
about to say you're going to want to pre-meditate you're
going to want to like script it out like well
first i'm going to tell her hey how are you
then i'm going to tell her oh i think you're
cute then when she responds in a positive way then
i'm going to say blah blah blah blah then she's
going to say this and i'm going to say that
and oh and then and then it's going to work
you think that that's going to be your best approach
but that's not your best approach that's going to be
a shitty approach so counterintuitively have to let that go
and just trust on your sort of uh spontaneous ability
to intuitively run your game on her now your game
might even be bad if you're a newbie your intuitive
game might be very bad but over the months as
you're developing it it's going to get better and better
and better you're going to be able to trust in
it more and the less pre-planning you're gonna have to
do and then the more natural and authentic it's gonna
feel and then the more girls will get hooked the
next principle is chill and friendly method versus flash game
a lot of what you see you can you can
find in field of game on the internet uh and
a lot of what you find on the internet is
this very flashy sort of game where guys are just
grabbing girls saying obnoxious things to them using like weird
funny absurd openers and uh you know doing these almost
it's almost like stunt game it's like you're stunting you're
performing for not the girl it's like for the youtube
audience a lot of pickup videos online it's just it's
not for actual girls it's not good game it's for
dudes on the internet who have never approached a girl
in their life and are just looking for like some
sort of um stunts to entertain themselves with that's not
the best game the best game looks very simple it's
so simple it doesn't look like game so we call
this the chill friendly method so of course there's room
as you're exploring game there's room for flashy game i've
done some flashy game especially like if you're in a
place like vegas you can you can get away with
some pretty crazy obnoxious flashy game and sometimes it works
and it can be fun it can put you in
a good state but this is not a very consistent
way to hook girls the most consistent ways are actually
kind of boring looking they look more just like friendly
and chill you're not grabbing girls and telling them obnoxious
[ __ ] things you're just kind of friendly and
chill but at the same time there's there's sexual intent
clearly in your eyes and uh it's obvious this is
a man-to-woman communication but it's friendly it's chill it's easy
going nothing crazy is happening you're not saying some obnoxious
lines you're not talking about sex and you're not talking
about um anything absurd uh it's just like chill and
normal and you're not you know you're not sticking your
tongue down her throat you're not groping her tits like
it none of this is really necessary to get good
results and in fact you want to tone that stuff
down because a lot of that stuff will trigger defenses
in the girl and in her friends so friendly and
chill try doing a month of just friendly and chill
game and also try doing a month of flashy game
and see which one works better you might be surprised
at what you discover the next principle is do not
supplicate do not chase and do not brag to women
if a girl is let's say you're talking to a
girl and then she turns her back on you and
she's walking away from you don't chase her in that
situation you clearly failed to hook her into a tractor
if you hooked her and attracted her she would not
be walking away from you you would not need to
chase her down now of course if you have to
chase her down to open her in the first place
to approach her let's say a girl is walking very
fast it's okay to to walk after her fast and
to get her to stop you know to approach her
to do the approach that's fine but then if she's
walking away from you don't persist in chasing her trying
to like be very pushy with her don't do that
your goal is not to force yourself on her your
goal is just to attract her if you attract her
she will come to you she will stick around she
will look at you she will ask you questions there's
no need to brag to her either because again when
you're bragging the the fundamental problem there is that you're
assuming that she will get attracted to logical things that
you're saying that's what bragging is logical stuff you're saying
girls don't get attracted to logical stuff so you're misunderstanding
attraction there she's gonna get attracted to how you make
her feel with the witty things you say and how
humorous you are that's what she gets attracted to not
to the logical words of what you're talking about the
logical words of what you say to a girl virtually
don't matter this is a huge principle the logical words
don't matter it doesn't really matter what you're saying it
matters how you're saying it it matters the mood that
you're in and it matters the mood that it puts
her in so if you're saying logical stuff and it's
very boring and she becomes bored and you're a boring
guy there's not gonna be any sex and the problem
there is not the specific words it's the fact that
it was all boring and if you're saying some obnoxious
things you might even be saying some sexist things you
might be even saying things that are just downright offensive
or even racist but because they're emotional and because they're
funny and you're not being serious about them when you
say them that puts her in a fun emotional state
in a humorous state makes her giggle it makes her
playful too and it works great even though the things
you might be saying are just ridiculous absurd obnoxious they
make no logical sense whatsoever that's what makes games so
fun is that you can be completely illogical with girls
and it's just it's just fun and i mean a
lot of times as guys we spend so much of
our of our day in logical mode that we make
our speech so logical that if something isn't logical we
don't even say it and this was what trips us
up and this is why we run out of things
to say a lot of times with girls is because
we're looking for like logical things to say that make
sense and have a a reason behind saying them um
and if you talk like that to a girl all
you're going to do is just put in a logical
mood and it's not going to go anywhere another principle
is be polarizing not all girls should like you express
emotional range and when you genuinely feel negative about something
express that negativity if there's something you don't like about
her express that now of course you don't want to
be mean like if she has a big nose you
don't need to tell her oh you got a big
ugly nose that's not what i'm telling you i mean
you know still in a sort of a playful fun
way um if there's something about her you don't like
let's say she says she's an accountant and you don't
like accounts you don't have to pretend like oh oh
you're an accountant oh that's so nice this would be
supplicating this would be sort of putting on a fake
front in order to uh maintain her attraction uh rather
you know if you don't like accounts you say oh
you're a [ __ ] accountant you're going to hell
you know in a in a playful funny way like
that um express your genuine negativity about that it's important
that you're not just pulling the girl in but that
you're also pushing her away at the same time this
is known as push-pull so one of the problems is
that if you're very needy you might like come in
there everything you're saying or doing it's trying to get
the girl to to get pulled into you like you
might be pulling her in physically you might be hugging
her the things you might be saying like compliments every
compliment you give a girl that's pulling her into you
in the sense that it's showing that you want her
and it's like come to me come to me come
everything you're saying is like it's all about come to
me be with me be my girlfriend this sort of
stuff but this becomes too needy this repels girls so
you throw out a little bit of that of you
know like come to me you might hug her but
then as you hug her you might also push her
away a little bit as well you might give her
a compliment you give her a compliment but then also
you take it back a little bit you might say
you're cute sort of right the sorta takes it away
a little bit it's like oh you're cute but maybe
you're crazy it's like you're cute but are you also
smart right so it's like a lot of attraction is
this kind of tension that builds where you're not completely
direct with her that you want her you throw signs
that you want her that you're attracted to her but
then you also take them away a little bit so
that she's a little bit confused and ambiguous as to
whether you truly want her and like her and then
this gets her interested and then this gets her trying
to chase you a little bit and that's very important
she needs to feel a little bit like she's chasing
you a wing of mine made this really great analogy
he said girls are like cats and game is like
a cat toy so you know when you're playing with
a cat toy with a cat you don't just plop
down the little cat toy in front of the cat
just leave it there the cat isn't interested in that
when you're playing with the cat you gotta like jiggle
and wiggle and jerk around the cat toy like this
in like these weird motions almost like you know some
sort of like wounded prey you gotta like move it
around a little bit and the cat gets excited and
then the cap pounces this is uh the perfect uh
metaphor for game the next principle is physical escalation as
soon as possible so begin touching her in non-sexual ways
right off the bat and then keep amping that up
probably from for most of you newbies you should escalate
faster and sooner than you feel comfortable just to see
how much you can get away with of course you
can overdo it but as newbies you want to practice
this you'll be amazed at how fast you can escalate
so test that out practice it uh you want to
become a kind of guy who's just touchy with everybody
don't just touch girls touch guys too every time i'm
going out i'm meeting wings and friends out at the
club i'm high-fiving them i'm holding you know i'm slapping
them over the shoulder i might slap their ass you
know whatever guy friends um uh i i might take
them like this i might shake them um just so
that i put myself in this sort of touchy mode
and then i feel comfortable touching other guys i feel
comfortable touching like if there's a security guard i can
walk over just put my hand on his shoulder right
like you just get comfortable touching guys and girls both
in non-sexual and sexual ways become a sort of like
naturally touchy guy such that you're not even thinking about
touching people you just are in a sort of just
a friendly way and then when you're talking to the
kind of girl you like and you're attracted to her
and she's attracted to you you reach hook point then
you can amp that up and make it more erotic
and sexual and it'll work great and it'll feel very
authentic and just natural and she'll just perceive you as
a touchy sort of guy you know just like a
very kinesthetically friendly sort of guy the next principle is
lead her and test for compliance so leading her i
know when i started i thought that leading her was
so hard but actually you gotta like baby step it
so you open a girl you talk to her for
two minutes even after two minutes just try this talk
to her for two minutes and then get her to
just move two feet to the left or to the
right for whatever reason you know like oh there's somebody
you know we're standing in the path of people here
here just move over here or it's like oh there's
a bench right here let's walk over to the bench
it's like five feet away get her to sit down
on the bench maybe there's a bar area that's a
little bit less crowded it's like hey it's you know
it's too crowded here let's walk over here it's a
little bit quieter uh or hey like you know we're
indoors there's a balcony let's go walk to the balcony
let's look at the view of the balcony it's nice
over there and just move her and see how fast
you can do that you should be able to do
that within two or five minutes especially if you reach
hook point you'll be able to do that so just
like baby steps move her a little bit and see
if she's compliant or not if she's not if she
resists then that you know you have problems there you're
not you haven't attracted her enough um but as your
game gets better you'll see she's going to become more
compliant because she trusts you more she's more comfortable with
you she's more attracted to you and then try try
leading her even further and see how far you can
get away with it so just this is all about
reminding yourself because a lot of times you go in
and your mind is so focused on doing the approach
and your opener and all these other things you got
to do that you forget to lead at all and
you can just stay stuck in that set talking to
her in the same spot for an hour and you
might say yeah that was a great set i talked
for an hour yeah it was that it's good that
you talk to her for an hour that's that's an
achievement but really you should have moved her within five
minutes within an hour you should have moved her like
five times already and you probably forgot so make sure
you go the next time and uh start moving her
much earlier because it's awkward to stand there for for
60 minutes talking not moving and then finally after that
you're like okay come home with me it's not gonna
happen it's way too big of an ask it's way
too big of a gear shift you gotta slowly bounce
her around and get her comfortable following you around the
next principle is err on the side of making a
move rather than not making a move so a lot
of times guys go on a first date right you're
on a first date and then you're walking with her
and maybe you sit down on a bench and it's
like oh this might be a good time halfway through
the date to make a kiss but i don't know
is she ready for a kiss i don't know and
then you're hesitating in your mind should i kiss her
now or should i wait five minutes maybe it'll be
a little bit easier in five minutes and then you
wait five minutes and then five minutes later it's like
ah but now it's not the right time we're both
walking and it's an awkward position to kiss her in
so i'll wait another 10 minutes and then 10 minutes
come by and then you have other excuses and you're
hesitating and hesitating and hesitating and then you get to
the end of the night and like okay i'm going
to do it for sure at the end of the
night when i'm walking her back home and i walk
her to her doorstep that's when i'm gonna kiss her
for sure and then you walk her there and then
you chicken out again because there's some excuses like oh
well her friend was texting her so i didn't have
a chance to kiss her because she was looking at
her phone this will happen to you if you hesitate
so you need to train yourself when it comes to
leading women to just make a move if you feel
like making a move if you feel like kissing her
if you feel like now's probably the right time to
kiss her kiss her go for it even if she
rejects you go for it rather it's better than than
waiting for some better time in the future don't second-guess
yourself that second-guessing and hesitation that's what's killing you it's
making you anxious and is putting you in your head
you want to be acting from a spontaneity so if
you spontaneously feel halfway through the date that you want
to kiss her go for it and if she rejects
you that's fine you can try again in five minutes
this of course doesn't just apply to kissing this applies
to everything this applies to moving her for example if
you're talking to a girl for five minutes and then
you feel like ah um i think i can move
her to the balcony ah but maybe she won't go
with me ah but maybe i should talk to her
for 10 more minutes before i ask her no take
her to the balcony you already got the feeling the
urge to take her to the balcony that intuition arose
to take her to the balcony now take her to
the balcony if she rejects you she refuses fine she
rejects you just stay where you are and keep talking
to her try again in five minutes likewise you might
be with a girl talking to her for 20 minutes
and then you get the feeling like hey these girls
are interested in dancing maybe her and her friends want
to dance i could take them to the dance floor
we can all dance together but i don't know maybe
they won't like that maybe it's too early maybe i
gotta kiss her first before i take her maybe they
gotta get a drink first maybe they gotta go to
the bathroom first maybe i gotta do something else first
maybe i gotta check my text messages no you already
got the idea to take her to the dance floor
don't second-guess yourself don't hesitate just grab them and say
hey let's go dancing take him to the dance floor
likewise now you're on the dance floor you've been dancing
for 30 minutes and it feels like you know what
i'm getting a little tired on the dance floor it's
getting a little bit boring here we've been dancing for
30 minutes i should take him outside the club we've
been here now for a few hours it's getting late
in the night it's time to go outside let's get
some pizza outside but then in your mind you're hesitating
like ah well but will they really go with me
do they trust me enough maybe they want to dance
some more maybe we should dance for another 30 minutes
maybe we should go to the bar maybe i should
get my friends maybe i shouldn't go for pizza but
maybe we should go straight back to my place like
no go for the pizza that was your initial urge
take him out of the club go for the pizza
and if it doesn't work then you improvise if something
doesn't work you improvise based upon that you don't pre-plan
ahead of time so a lot of what game teaches
you is that you stop planning too far ahead because
reality will shatter all of your plans it's way too
chaotic at night to have these long perfect plans you
got to be able to improvise on the spot and
that means acting on hunches and intuitions and then if
those are wrong you adjust you calibrate and then you
you go based on new intuitions and new hunches and
over time those hundreds of intuitions will become very solid
next principle screen her and have standards don't adopt the
frame that you're gonna sleep with anything in the club
anything that wants to sleep with me i'll sleep with
that's a terrible frame you need to have a frame
of like there are certain things i want in a
girl in order to enjoy sleeping with her and i'm
going to screen her for those things before i sleep
with her the next principle is abundance mindset don't get
stuck on any one girl some nights you'll go out
and you'll meet what you'll think of is like the
perfect girl that girl is the perfect girl for me
and you talk to her for five minutes and then
whatever her friends grab her away and pull her away
and you never see her again and then you spend
the rest of the night thinking about oh that girl
was the perfect one i'll never find one that good
again it was she was so rare rather than wasting
time thinking about that stuff go talk to other girls
trust that if you keep going out night after night
after night you'll see better and better and better and
better girls there's never gonna be a night where you
see one girl that's so perfect that you're never gonna
see her again and there's ever gonna be any other
girl ever in the world that's gonna be better than
that no you need to if you're living in a
big city uh if you move to a big city
with a good night life you'll see literally hundreds and
thousands of amazing girls this abundance mindset is important because
then you're not placing too much importance on any one
girl and you're not being too needy in your approach
and if she blows you out or she rejects you
or her friends drag her away you're not gonna be
butthurt about it wasting time thinking about it you're just
to move on next principle minimal investment until sex the
problem is that women have almost no investment in men
before sex this is a problem for men because for
us we get way too invested in doing the approach
and we have because we have to put a lot
of time and energy into doing approaching so this puts
a lot of investment up front and then what happens
is that usually the women don't have sex with us
they flake us and whatever else they don't show up
to the date they don't respond to the text message
and so forth so what you're going to learn is
that as a newbie you're going to invest all this
emotional energy into every phone number you get every girl
you talk to every set that hooks every girl that
you go on a date with um you're gonna invest
a lot of emotional energy in this a lot of
hope you're gonna think oh this is the one it's
gonna work this is gonna this is gonna be a
close and then what you discover is that 90 of
them never pan out and so you just invested a
lot of energy into nothing and in fact the fact
that you got so invested this is one of the
reasons it didn't pan out because you were too needy
you were texting her too much you were complimenting her
too much you were supplicating too much and so forth
so what you need to do is just lower the
investment into every interaction to as close to zero as
possible until the girl shows signs that she's invested in
you and really until she has sex with you because
the reality is that all you're doing is actually you're
matching her level of investment the reality is that until
a girl has sex with you she has almost zero
investment in you uh you mean to her probably less
than a zit on her ass that's the reality uh
this is why girls don't text you back they flake
on you they don't show up to a date whatever
because she's just a stranger that you met and to
her you're just a stranger and you mean nothing to
her uh after sex you will mean something to her
and then you can match your level of investment so
so basically the the idea is that you want to
be at roughly the same level investment as she invests
more into you you can invest more into her but
don't go creating the situation where you've invested three months
pursuing a girl and she's invested zero into you she
barely thinks about you you've been dreaming about her for
three months this is a horrible situation it's never going
to work out the next principle is enjoy the process
and have fun this is so important you can't just
grind it through you can't because you're going to be
doing this for years or for months for you know
hundreds of nights if it's a grinding challenging process for
you you're going to quit you need to have fun
and one of the things that will help you to
have fun is to have fun wings and guy friends
who you go out with and do this stuff with
the next principle is stick it out to the end
of the night so this is actually very important because
most of your success will come when you stick it
out to the end of the night in most cities
the nightlife lasts from about 10 pm to 2 a.m
it depends on the city in vegas it lasts from
about i would say 10 p.m to 4 a.m and
then also during the day time there's day parties so
anyways vegas is basically around the clock um but that's
unusual most cities are from 10 a.m to 2 a.m
so if you go out stay till the closing time
stay until 2am don't go leaving at midnight or at
1am because most of your results will come probably in
the final hour of the night this is when girls
are partied out and they're looking for fun they're looking
for sex some of your best opportunities will come here
and so some of my best nights actually started out
as some of my worst nights where early in the
night things weren't going well i wasn't feeling in a
good mood and i wanted to go home and i
was just telling myself ah you know i should take
it easy i should you know i've been going out
all week and you know tonight is a is sunday
night you know uh it's what does it matter if
i go home a few hours earlier it's no big
deal there's not a lot of girls here anyways to
open so i'm just gonna go home early i've had
a lot of nights like that and then what i
do is i say no i'm [ __ ] staying
till the end and then as soon as i make
that decision and i stay for another five or ten
minutes i end up hooking a girl and it goes
amazingly and it makes the whole night it turns the
entire night around so the difference between a horrible night
of no action versus an amazing night which gives you
crazy reference experiences and great learning opportunities and great results
that difference can be razor thin that difference can just
be the difference between deciding to stay till the end
or quitting early that difference can just be the difference
between one single approach you know a girl is walking
by and you're kind of hesitating like should i open
her or not and you say oh [ __ ]
it i'll open her you grab her in and she's
fully into you start making out with her and it
hooks immediately right that difference can be razor thin so
um never underestimate the power of persistence in this game
you got to be so persistent do not let yourself
off the hook with excuses approach every girl without hesitation
that you want to approach that you find attractive and
stay till the end of the night make the most
of the night as long as there's girls there to
approach keep approaching don't go home early some nights you'll
feel so terrible you want to go home early and
some nights you will go home early and it'll be
a very shitty night and other nights you will want
to go home early but you'll force it anyways and
you'll have amazing nights and through this process you will
learn the importance of sticking out it out to the
end and the final principle is that this is about
growing your skills it's not about sex take your mind
off the sex now sex is great and all that
and you should have the intent to close that is
important if you have that sexual desire definitely use that
to fuel this process but this is not about sex
really this is about growing yourself as a man this
is about confidence building confidence this is about becoming more
social these are much higher principles and goals than sex
all right here's a list of the biggest newbie mistakes
first not going out and making excuses for why you're
not going out watch your excuses very carefully because your
mind will concoct hundreds of excuses like oh well i'm
feeling a little bit sick i got the sniffles i'm
feeling a little bit tired i got work tomorrow you
know i've been going out all week so don't i
deserve a day off your mind will make all these
excuses like oh my friends are not coming out so
i'm gonna i'm gonna stay in too because my friends
aren't coming out you know i got a date in
two days so i don't need to go out i
mean your mind will come up with so many excuses
the other mistake is a victim mentality and blaming others
for your lack of results there's nobody to blame here
but yourself so watch out for your victim mentality about
how it can't work this and that the next mistake
is the crippling self-doubt and negativity closely related to the
victim mentality and sub points here are obsessing over your
look stop obsessing over your looks and stop doubting the
process these are probably going to be the two biggest
doubts you're going to have in this whole process is
that as you're not getting the results you want you're
going to keep going back to your looks and you
say oh it's my looks it's because i'm bald it's
because i'm too skinny it's because i'm not muscular enough
i'm too fat i'm you know i'm too black i'm
too asian i'm too brown i'm too hispanic i'm too
introverted or i don't have a symmetrical enough face i
don't have a good enough beard i don't have a
big enough jaw you're going to keep coming back to
this because your mind wants excuses for why you're not
getting results and it's hard to admit to yourself that
the reason you're not getting results is because you're not
taking enough action and that you're just not very good
at game it's easier to blame your looks so watch
out your mind's going to keep coming back to that
even once you get good you'll have nights where nothing
hooks and you'll be like ah it must have been
my looks and then the other point here is the
doubting the process you might start to doubt the entire
process you say oh this is not going to work
it's not for me this is for other guys but
it's not going to work for me because i'm different
i'm special i have unique problems that other guys don't
have it's just all a scam or whatever uh next
biggest newbie mistake is not approaching making excuses for why
you can't approach that girl and you can't approach this
girl she's with a dude and that girl has some
friends around her and that girl's on her phone and
that girl has a drink in her hand and that
girl is tying her shoelaces and this girl is doing
something else and so i can't approach anybody watch out
for that uh the next biggest newbie mistake is one
itis what's called one itis basically getting stuck and obsessed
on one girl thinking that oh that's the one perfect
girl how do i get that girl and putting all
your focus energy on just that one girl rather than
trying to get good with girls in general the way
you get that girl is by getting good with girls
in general and honestly just forget about that girl she's
not as special and magical as you think she is
the reason you feel that she's so special is probably
because you're not going out and you're not approaching and
you're not seeing the full abundance of all the other
girls that are out there because when you see that
you're going to forget about your one girl you're coming
at it from scarcity um now of course occasionally you
will meet a girl who's really exceptional you connect on
a very deep level yeah occasionally you'll get that and
you know what happens when you get that usually you're
gonna act all needy and obsessive about it and she's
gonna blow you out so the less needy you are
the more chances you have of actually landing and closing
that one special girl that you will occasionally meet if
you go out a lot the next biggest newbie mistake
is reading too much theory i've talked about this already
you want to be maybe spending 10 of your time
on theory and 90 of your time in the field
actually practicing the next biggest newbie mistake is a meek
approach doing a half-ass approach i talked about this in
part two when you approach you must definitively decide that
you are approaching and you go a hundred percent not
ninety percent one hundred percent you walk up fully committed
to opening that girl you get her attention you make
sure you get her attention and you you open her
firmly like you believe it's going to work watch yourself
for half-assed approaches and don't let yourself get away with
that the next big newbie mistake is looking for the
perfect pickup line or opener thinking that some pickup line
will get you laid it won't what gets you laid
is your ability to vibe with the girl over a
period of an hour or two no single line will
get you laid in fact the verbals of any line
you say don't matter and you can test this out
by testing out stupid openers for example go out tonight
and open every girl with an opener like i hate
facebook and you'll see that it doesn't matter whether you
open girls with i hate facebook or you know i
hate elvis presley or i hate donald trump or i
hate vegetables or i hate alcohol it doesn't matter which
of those lines you use they will open about the
same as long as you're congruent with your delivery what's
going to matter is the congruence of your delivery your
posture your vocal tonality your eye contact that's what's going
to matter not the actual words that you say so
much and so you can test that out now of
course if you walk up and you say some uh
really obnoxious verbal line like i want to [ __
] you that will probably not go so well for
you so yeah you want to avoid certain lines certain
sexually explicit or very vulgar lines like that which will
probably immediately get you blown out although they could also
work once in a while too you never know sometimes
some of the craziest lines work um but you want
to be careful with those so i mean yeah verbal
content doesn't matter so long as it's not like completely
obnoxious and just completely sours the vibe and the mood
of the interaction the next biggest newbie mistake is poor
body language poor vocal tonality poor eye contact and no
smile these are actually the things you got to work
on the most these are the fundamentals that get you
the most results in game not the verbals themselves the
next big mistake is a stiff body and not being
comfortable in the club being in a state of anxiety
while you're in the club being stuck in your head
overthinking things while you're in the club the next mistake
is running out of things to say this is huge
i'll have more points to make about this a little
later in this episode the next problem is ejecting too
early everything is going great but for whatever reason you
just want to grab the phone number and eject because
you don't want to screw it up by staying in
there longer this is a big mistake watch yourself like
a hawk ejecting and force yourself to stay in there
the next mistake is being too nice and too friendly
the next mistake is being too needy too thirsty and
over investing in the girl all pull but no push
the next mistake is asking too many interview style questions
being too logical being too serious asking her the like
most common question of like where are you from where
do you work what do you do why are you
here and just keeping the conversation in that interview mode
the next biggest mistake is trying to be her formal
boyfriend setting that frame as you approach her it's like
i'm going to be your boyfriend i'm going to buy
you flowers i'm going to take you on a date
i'm going to take you to a restaurant we're going
to be begin this long courting process no set the
player frame even if you want to be her boyfriend
still start by setting the player frame get her attracted
first then once she's interested in having sex with you
then you can move towards the boyfriend frame and really
you should wait until she actually has sex with you
before you start going to the boyfriend frame because what
you'll find is that if you set the boyfriend frame
too early most likely she's not gonna get attracted to
you she's not gonna have sex with you and even
if she does it's gonna take a long long time
days and weeks it'll take uh the next mistake is
being too sexually explicit and making sexual jokes that blow
you out of the set being too vulgar so watch
out for that the next mistake is being inauthentic trying
to act alpha acting macho acting more cool than you
really are trying to impress her bragging qualifying yourself uh
actually what you should be doing is in a funny
way disqualifying yourself telling her how bad and lame you
are like if she asks you what do you do
you can tell her uh i scrub toilet to taco
bell that would be a way of disqualifying yourself rather
than telling her that oh i'm an attorney or a
doctor that makes six figures tell her you scrub toilets
at taco bell next mistake trying to logically convince her
into sex this is not going to work stop doing
that next mistake not physically escalating right off the bat
resulting in a sort of a creepy physical escalation later
on the next mistake is hesitating when making a move
we talked about this earlier when you want to make
a move make the move if you want to kiss
or kiss her if you want to hug her hug
her if you want to touch her touch her and
then if you make a mistake ask for forgiveness later
apology you could always apologize if you make a mistake
if you over escalate you can always apologize and dial
it back you're much better off doing that than just
doing nothing and just waiting because then it shows her
you don't have balls and you're not leading and you're
not confident and you're not assertive and that's what women
need the most from men is confidence assertiveness leadership the
next mistake is trying to hide your raw attraction from
her if you're sexually attracted to her genuinely let her
feel it the next mistake is being too gamey being
too much of a clown or a dancing monkey or
being too edgy saying things that are just kind of
flashy and obnoxious and edgy just for the sake of
saying them your best game is not going to come
from this your best game is going to come when
you're just kind of more chilling normal and then occasionally
you can sprinkle in a little bit of a uh
like a little something edgy or a little bit something
kind of like outlandish here and there but you just
you sprinkle it in it's got to be the spice
not the main dish the next big mistake is not
being socially calibrated just not being attuned to what the
social situation is for example you walk up to a
group of girls and you start talking to only your
girl but you completely ignore all the other girls who
are her friends you don't ask her how she knows
the friends you don't try to befriend the friends you
don't you don't you're not like attuned to the social
dynamics of that situation of that group and then in
the end they end up the friends end up blowing
you out because you you weren't paying good enough attention
to what's going on there the next mistake is not
going for a close try to go for a close
with every set that hooks stick in there if it
hooked she's attracted to you see how far it can
go even if like you're not even interested in having
sex that night just see how far you can take
it you need that experience for those times when you
actually do want to close have the intent to close
don't just be going out there to collect phone numbers
don't just be going out there to socialize don't just
be going out there to flirt but not close you
need to get good at closing the next mistake is
asking women for attraction advice don't ask women for attraction
advice most women don't understand what they're attracted to the
only people who understand how attraction really works are those
guys who've gone out and done it hundreds and thousands
of times women will oftentimes give you just their over-idealized
mythological ideas of how attraction should work or what she
wants in a boyfriend this is not what you need
to understand how to attract her to be your girlfriend
these are very different things and so women will mislead
you in this regard which is not to say that
women can't give you some you know relationship advice they
can it's not to say that women can't have insights
into femininity or masculinity they can there's value in in
studying and reading that stuff like if there's some dating
book written by a woman fine you can read that
but like when you want to know how to really
attract a girl at a bar or club don't go
asking women to tell you how to do that the
next mistake is or before i move on to the
next ones a little bit more about this point so
like let's say a girl was attracted to you but
then she lost attraction for you and then so you
text her and you ask hey why did you lose
attraction for me like what happened why why aren't we
dating why don't you have sex with me and you
want to logically ask her like you know like for
advice on how to improve um her advice is not
going to be good advice for you that's my point
um her advice is gonna be from her point of
view not from your point of view and there are
different agendas here the male agendas and the female gender
they are at odds and so just um stick to
the fundamentals of game this stuff has has been figured
out by guys right you don't need to you don't
need to go reinventing the wheel we know how it
all works and you'll know how it works by going
out and testing this stuff the next mistake newbies make
is quitting after less than a thousand approaches at least
reach a thousand approaches before you judge this process it
takes quite a while to understand how this all works
because it's so deeply counter-intuitive and it runs against the
grain of society culture what you've been taught your own
ideas your whole nice guy frame it goes against all
that the next biggest newbie mistake is not moving to
a big city we've talked about this in previous episodes
the next biggest newbie mistake is getting too invested before
sex hanging your hope on that one particular girl like
you got a phone number and maybe even she's responding
to your text messages and you're like oh yeah this
is it this is it i'm gonna have sex with
this girl then you start daydreaming about having sex with
her and you start fantasizing about it maybe you start
jerking off to your fantasies of having sex with her
and you just keep planning the dates and you keep
waiting for that day she's gonna have sex with you
a few weeks from now and you keep obsessing over
it and then she never has sex with you uh
the next biggest mistake is buying her drinks and things
you don't need to buy girls drinks and other things
to get them to sleep with you uh honestly i've
never bought a girl a single drink i'm very cheap
and actually i probably should buy girls more drinks because
sometimes just for logistical reasons uh you want to buy
a girl a drink not to get her drunk but
you want to buy her a drink simply because if
you don't it just it just makes things kind of
awkward um and she like if you didn't make it
awkward she would have come home with you but just
by the fact that you made it awkward by making
it a thing she won't because like her mood has
been soured it has nothing to do with the drink
it has nothing to do with the money it's just
sometimes there's like a social awkwardness so sometimes you buy
a drink just to avoid the awkwardness but in general
you don't need to buy grilled drinks um in fact
girls should be buying you drinks um and finally the
biggest last newbie mistake is quitting the night early i've
already talked about this quitting the night early stick in
there to the end all right so how do you
get a girlfriend or a wife well attracting a girlfriend
or a wife is exactly the same process as attracting
a one-night stand there's no difference because attraction is the
same thing it everything begins with attraction you can't get
a girlfriend or a wife without attraction you understand this
so the way to get a girlfriend or a wife
is to select her from a position of abundance which
means go out there develop your game develop your confidence
develop yourself as a man sleep with 10 to 20
girls at least and then from those girls select one
girlfriend for yourself and if you want make her your
wife and if you do this then your girlfriend will
genuinely feel like she is the one for you because
this is what girls want girls want to feel like
they are your one the special one they don't really
care if you slept with 10 or 20 girls or
even 50 or 100 girls they want to feel like
out of all those she's the one now the mistake
a lot of guys make is that they want a
girlfriend or wife so badly that they they will select
the first one because they have no abundance just any
first girl that likes them they're gonna try to fall
in love with this is a bad idea because the
chances that she's going to be compatible with you personality
wise and other factors is going to be quite small
and also you don't even know what you want in
a girl unless you slept with 10 20 50 girls
you don't know what you want in a girl um
you don't even know what's possible you don't even know
what ethnicity of girl you want you want an asian
girl do you want a latina girl you want a
white girl do you want a european girl in america
you don't even know right what kind of personality do
you want to have you don't even know what do
you need from a long-term partner you don't even know
until you've it a bit and also what will happen
is that if you sleep with 10 20 50 girls
you're gonna get some of that out of your system
you're gonna burn through some of that karma such that
when you do find that one amazing girl you can
make her your one and then it's gonna feel like
you don't gotta be like thirsting after other girls you
don't you gotta be you don't have to like be
regretting oh did i select her just because she was
the first one that i slept with no i selected
her out of a out of a deeper sense of
experience and abundance that i had um this is gonna
this is actually gonna make your relationship stronger with her
a lot of guys who only sleep with one or
two girls and then convert one of them into a
girlfriend they actually have regrets they're they might even be
in a great loving relationship with a girlfriend but just
because they're so inexperienced they in the back of their
mind like their biology is telling them to go out
and experience more sexually you're sexually inexperienced but they have
this great relationship they don't want to break up this
relationship on the one hand they don't want to lose
this on the other hand they they feel this kind
of like unburned karma in the back of their mind
which is bugging them and eventually actually it ends up
destroying the relationship a lot of times all right so
you don't want to put yourself in that position um
you want to be i mean i'm not telling you
to be some you know scumbag player that sleeps with
hundreds and hundreds of girls endlessly and is never satisfied
by any girl that would be a big problem but
on the other hand it is also a problem if
you're so inexperienced that this makes you needy this makes
you immature this makes you kind of insecure about yourself
and what you want and also you end up settling
with for a girl who you're not fully committed to
and then that's not fair to her either because she
wants you to be 100 into her not just like
a lukewarm 75 now we come to the question of
but leo what do i say tell me what to
say when i'm talking to girls what's the what are
the line what's the combination of magic lines that i
say to get her to sleep with me um can
you give me some routines and scripts that i can
use here's the problem with routines and scripts is that
conversation with girls are so chaotic and there are so
many different permutations and sort of an infinite branching path
of where conversations can go that you can't possibly have
scripts and routines for all of them so it's just
not sustainable and memorizing all those routines it's a pain
in the ass and it's difficult and then when you're
spouting them off it's not authentic either so really the
solution to this is to sort of bite the bullet
and to say that you're going to learn game without
routines and the way you're going to do this is
you're going to go out there approach approach approach you're
going to build state you're going to do warm-up sets
you're going to have friends there with you and you're
going gonna [ __ ] talk with your friends just
have fun when you're at the club you're just [
__ ] talking you're riffing you're flirting um you're just
having fun you're you're basically partying you're learning to party
you're being random and spontaneous and emotional you're not being
logical you're getting out of your logical mind basically you're
using your friends to help you do this you're using
the music the dancing to help you do this but
then also you're approaching and that helps you to build
up your state and you're not gonna pre-plan what you're
gonna say you're letting go of the whole pre-planned paradigm
there's not gonna be some perfect plan that you're gonna
execute to get into a girl's pants let that whole
fantasy go instead you're gonna fully embrace the improvisational spontaneous
nature of game you're going to go out there not
knowing what to say and you're just going to throw
yourself in and you're just going to like learn to
sink or swim a lot of times you'll sink but
sometimes you'll swim and sometimes you'll say something clever and
witty and it'll work and through this process you will
gradually develop your game so rather than having a whole
bunch of stuff to say you're going to be putting
yourself in the right frame of mind you're going to
be building state now with that said here are some
tips for how to not run out of things to
say because this is what most newbies struggle with i
struggle with this still to this day so first of
all make observations become very observational this helps a lot
make observations about her dress her shoes her face her
ethnicity her skin her tattoos her jewelry her earrings the
bench that she's sitting on the club that you're at
the bar that you're at the country you're in the
city you're in the friends who are around her the
friends who are with you just make observations about everything
very observational and and your observations don't have to be
profound they can be rather simple crude and kind of
dumb for example it's like you're wearing a black dress
it's i mean that's that's like the simplest dumbest observation
but it's something it's better than being stuck in your
head it's better than having nothing to say at all
it's like why are you wearing a black dress that's
something or you can say you're wearing a black dress
that's boring or you could say you're wearing a black
dress what does that say about you or you could
say you're wearing a black dress i like it or
i hate it or you're wearing a black dress that's
so predictable that's so cliche that's like every other girl
in this club or it's like you're the only wear
girl wearing that that kind of dress right that's something
you'll be surprised at how far you can get away
with just simple basic observational openers like that i mean
you can literally walk up to a girl and say
hey did you see those guys over there sitting on
that bench there's some guys sitting on a bench that's
it that could be your opener that's enough to get
a conversation going so don't ignore the power of observation
the next way to not run out of things to
say is make dumb assumptions like there can be two
people sitting on a bench and you can say you
can just come up with some dumb assumptions like i
bet those two guys are gay lovers you could tell
her that uh just a dumb assumption it doesn't have
to be true um you can make dumb assumptions about
her you look like an accountant you look like a
nurse you look like a philosophy major you look like
you're clumsy it looks like your shoes are uncomfortable it
looks like that dress is uncomfortable uh it looks like
those tattoos you have were painful to get you know
just dumb assumptions some of them will be true some
of them will be false it doesn't matter it's conversation
material uh practice that the next tip is stop being
logical and just stay stupid things right it's okay when
you're at a bar or a club to say stupid
[ __ ] things it doesn't have to be smart
it doesn't have to be spiritual content amuse yourself with
just funny ideas and little games that you come up
with to amuse yourself and to amuse other people and
your friends [ __ ] talk you know learn what
[ __ ] talking is go out with some buddies
and just [ __ ] talk all night long you
can tell fantastical stories and you can role play you
can literally just invent stories on the fly as you're
talking to her you can create role play scenarios where
it's like hey we're going on a honeymoon you can
kind of grab her pull her in lock arms and
say let's get let's go on our honeymoon where are
we going around the world we're going to plan a
trip around the world let's go to hawaii then let's
go to the bahamas then let's go snorkeling then let's
go scuba diving then let's go on a hot air
balloon right like just [ __ ] invent [ __
] another great way not to run out of things
to say is to read some pop culture and news
before you go out so pop culture is like what's
happening with the latest celebrities what kind of gossip you
know what's happening in the news um interesting just little
factoids and stuff you could find websites that just do
like pop culture news you can read that for 10
minutes on your phone as you're driving out to the
club or whatever or you're standing in line for the
club you can read some of that stuff and just
read one or two articles there and you'll you'll you'll
read some interesting factoid about something and then you can
bring that up in the conversation for example the last
piece of news that i read is that like over
100 000 people in america died last year from opioid
overdose that's just it's just a little factoid i could
sprinkle that into the conversation that i have if i
go out tonight i could say you know i can
start a conversation about that topic it's not particularly sexy
or whatever but it's it's something it's something to talk
about and since it's new it's news it's kind of
topical and the person might say oh yeah i heard
that too or it's like oh yeah that celebrity did
something crazy in the news oh okay yeah i heard
that too and we can talk about it and that'll
generate some fodder for conversation uh the next way to
get fodder for a conversation is talk more about yourself
if you have nothing to say you run out of
stuff to say and you're very introverted the problem is
that you don't talk enough about yourself talk about yourself
what are your plans for your life what are your
dreams what are you working on are you working on
a business talk about that is there some problem in
your life talk about that is is there somebody you
hate in your life talk about that is there something
that pisses you off talk about that did you just
get out of a breakup talk about that is there
some some crazy thing that your ex did that pissed
you off talk about that whatever talk about yourself it
could be past stuff or future stuff don't neglect the
future stuff talk about your future and your dreams if
you're the kind of guy that says you know leo
i'm young i'm 21 years old i have not traveled
around the world i have very little life experience i
don't have interesting stories i haven't done any cool things
all i've done is played video games my whole life
okay fine so you don't have a lot of life
experience to to work with but how about the future
how about your dreams talk about that where do you
want to travel to where do you want to live
what kind of job you want to have what do
you want to do with your career how do you
want to impact people what kind of relationships do you
want to have what kind of car do you want
to drive talk about all that [ __ ] with
the girl and assume she's going to be interested us
introverts we usually tend to not like to talk about
ourselves and our dreams and our future and we just
assume that people won't be interested in us this is
a bad assumption you gotta correct this uh the next
way not to run out of things to say is
to free associate i've talked about a little bit in
part two i've explained what that is so free association
practice improv practice uh the next point is watch and
listen to infields of guys who have good verbals you
can find these infields online on youtube and so forth
of guys doing game day game night game listen to
their infields listen to their verbals listen to what they're
talking about you'll notice that they're talking about dumb things
that are not very significant not very logical take notes
on that and just dissect it not so that you
can regurgitate all their lines but just so you can
understand what a nothing conversation really is i mean for
me it was difficult because like all the conversations i
used to have were very substantive conversations like the kind
of videos that i shoot for actually a lot of
substance right a lot of insights a lot of depth
to it so for me what was very difficult is
like just i didn't even have a framework for what
it's like to be at a bar or a club
and to be talking about absolutely nothing i mean you're
talking but it's like verbal diarrhea you're not saying anything
of of import or significance or logical meaning it's just
it's just pure [ __ ] talk you're saying nothing
and yet your mouth is moving how do you do
that well you got to listen to that kind of
talk and just kind of analyze it and then say
well how can i restructure and rewire my mind restructure
how my mouth moves so that i can just have
like verbal diarrhea talk about nothing essentially but i'm still
talking and other people are enjoying it that that's something
you gotta learn um another point that will help you
to not run out of things to say is make
a list and have some of your favorite funny lines
make a list of some funny lines that you or
your friends develop or maybe you steal them from some
infield videos it's good to have a little bit of
a repository of some funny lines that you can pull
out of your back pocket and just study those you're
not particularly trying to like develop a whole routine or
like a comedy routine right um you're just kind of
inventing funny lines and you're memorizing a few of them
that you can kind of like sprinkle into conversations once
in a while um you know funny things you can
say i'll give you a few of those here in
a minute um what you don't want to be doing
is memorizing a long sequence of routines this is not
good also what you don't want to be doing is
like using some sort of very corny canned pickup line
like um i don't know you can you can find
like really silly and ridiculous lists of pickup lines online
don't use any of those instead though what you do
want to do is you want to develop a catalog
of common responses to common situations because what you'll notice
is if you go out a lot you're gonna encounter
uh quite a few situations to just repeat themselves over
like patterns over and over and over again for example
girls will tell you oh i have a boyfriend or
it's like oh my friends are are in the bathroom
i gotta go run to the bathroom or they will
tell you that like oh we gotta go get for
food or they will tell you oh i'm from california
or i'm from brazil or i'm from russia right and
you'll keep encountering these situations over and over and over
again you'll keep encountering situations where girls are too drunk
you'll keep encountering situations where girls drop their phone uh
where girls take off their shoes because their high heels
hurt at the end of the night um situations where
the girl has lost her friend situation where the girl
is crying situations where the girl is dancing crazily and
lost her balance or whatever and so you want to
have some some sort of witty responses to these situations
these are not so much pickup lines it's just like
look even if you're in a business situation you will
have sort of canned responses that you use inside jokes
within your business at your office at your workplace with
your friends with your family you're gonna have sort of
like inside jokes and standard lines that you say to
each other when something does somebody does something you know
silly or stupid or whatever or makes a mistake and
so this is just um i recommend you make a
sort of a list of these and you keep compiling
it because what happens is that you build good state
you go out you have fun and some nights you
will be so witty that you will actually come up
with like these amazing gems of responses to certain situations
that will be very funny and very uh contextual and
whenever you come up with something like that write that
down that's gold that's comedy gold you write that down
you make a whole repository and you customize it for
yourself so um here's a a small list of some
of the common ones that i use so oftentimes this
happens so often at least once a week if i
go out i'll see girls dropping their phone on the
floor cracking it open and stuff like that so anytime
i see a girl drop her phone or her purse
or something like that my standard line is this is
why we can't have nice things and almost always it
gets a laugh great line for that situation uh another
line that i like to use is don't be racist
and using this line works the best especially if if
it's completely absurd and and irrelevant so for example um
like let's say i'm talking to a girl and her
friend comes over and tries to drag her away to
the bathroom i might turn to her friend say to
her friend and say hey don't be racist now this
makes no sense whatsoever but it's a great way just
to scramble the minds like logical mode and it gets
people laughing or it's a little bit like shocking it's
a little bit jolting it's just it's just unexpected it
works really well um of course you don't want to
actually accuse somebody of racism that's not what's happening here
when you use this line don't be racist you know
say it in situations where it completely doesn't apply like
you know i might say that you know um let's
say i say oh i like eckhart tolle and she
says i hate eckhart tolle i might say eight don't
be racist and of course you're saying it in a
funny way right it has nothing to do with racism
but it's just a great response all around um another
response that i like is it's okay i'm very gay
so the way i might use this one let's say
i do a very physical opener on a girl right
off the bat you know she's walking it's a dance
floor area loud club i grab the girl i pull
her in uh you know i'm hugging her and it
hooks and it's going really well she's smiling she's loving
it you know i'm rubbing her body and then i
whisper in her ear i'm very gay it's okay right
and this just makes her giggle even more because obviously
i'm not gay obviously i'm physically escalating and um and
this is just a bit of a like a so
it's a pull and a push right this kind of
pushes her away and it makes her wonder like is
he gay but wait a minute his hands are on
my body he can't be he's not acting gay but
he's telling me he's gay what's going on here it
scrambles her mind it's great um also if she has
a boyfriend you can a great line is just to
say it's okay just just tell him i'm gay that
always gets a laugh another great one is i hate
you basically this one's very generalizable and universal you can
use this almost for anything she tells you something that
you don't like or whatever you just say i hate
you but you may say with a smile like i
hate you or you can say it very slowly like
for example uh actually a very great opener is that
a girl is walking by you grab her by the
hand you pull her in you smile at her and
you look at her in the eyes she's looking at
you it's clearly on and then you whisper in her
ear i hate you great amazing another one is can't
we all just get along that one's great for example
you might be talking to a bunch of girls in
a group like let's say there's four girls and then
sometimes you're talking to girls one of the girls gets
a little bit you know dramatic and then like a
little bit of a fight breaks out maybe there's a
disagreement or something like that and the whole set is
getting blown up because one girl is disagreeing with the
other girls or she's disagreeing with you and it's a
bit of like an argument that's going on and we
get and then you can just say hey everybody calm
down can't we all just get along and that can
be a way to like pacify the situation and to
to switch to kind of like switch people's minds in
a different state another great line that i like is
you're so predictable so like if a girl tells me
i ask her where are you from and she says
from california i'll say you're so predictable i mean it
it's it's stupid it makes no sense right but and
you can say that for almost anything anything she tells
you can just look at her like this and just
nod your head like this and go you're so predictable
um another one is you and i would never get
along and then as you say that you can push
her away so like she might be walking by you
grab her pull her in you smile at her she
smiles at you you might say you're you might say
you're cute but we would never get along and then
you push her away a little bit another great line
is how dare you and you say it with a
cheeky smile how dare you or you can say it
serious but then smile at the end like how dare
you like that depending on you know what she's saying
and you can use it in the most stupid situations
like you might say what do you do and she
might say i'm an accountant and i might say how
dare you uh you just like it's so general you
can sprinkle it in anywhere another great one that i
like is you just hate me because i'm black so
anytime let's say she disagrees with me or she disapproves
of something i say like i might say i like
meditation or something and she might say oh meditation like
no i don't like meditation and i might say you
just hate me because i'm black again very nonsensical but
it works great um another one is so sometimes when
you're like trying to pull a girl home or whatever
she might be uncomfortable with you she might feel like
you're like she doesn't really know you that that well
um she doesn't know if you're gonna rape her or
you're gonna kill her or whatever so a great way
to disarm that is say don't worry i've only murdered
three people and all of them deserved it so a
line like that i would sprinkle in like if i'm
if i'm walking a girl to my car for example
that would be a great line because when we're walking
together to my car you know that in the back
of her mind she's thinking like where's this guy taking
me can i trust this guy right and so the
worst thing to do would be say yeah you can
trust me it's like no don't you you can ask
her like do you trust me and she's like sort
of and then you can say you shouldn't or it's
like don't worry i've only murdered three people and they
all deserved it great line um another one is this
one i use for boyfriends so anytime she says she
has a boyfriend i try to play it rather than
being all butthurt about it and sad i try to
play it off funny i say it's okay i'm not
greedy i can share is your boyfriend greedy now i
don't say that because i intend to steal her from
the boyfriend if she has a boyfriend i won't pursue
it any further but i still say that line because
just because it puts me in an amusing mood and
it it makes her laugh too so that we don't
end on some like awkward butthurt depressed state where it's
like oh you have a boyfriend oh well that sucks
i guess i'm not getting laid tonight it's like no
don't end it like that end it like you know
end it cocky funny it's like it's okay i can
share i don't mind sharing you why is your boyfriend
so greedy do you want to date such a greedy
guy now i'm not saying that because i'm going to
steal her from the boyfriend i'm just saying that because
it's it's just i'm self-amusing another line that i use
is i feel like you're trying to use me for
my body this one's great because it it flips the
frame and flips the script because usually women say this
to men and so you want to you want to
preempt that by just flipping it around flip it around
on her like um let's say she puts her hands
on your body you can use that line i feel
like you're just using me for my body another one
that i like is just pretend none of this is
real so you might be talking to a girl she's
laughing or you might even say something obnoxious and then
you can you can sort of cut that down by
saying ah just pretend none of this is real it's
all just a dream it's all we're all we're just
in a hallucination don't you know this is all a
hallucination here none of this is real um i i
would say that a lot of times if i go
physical very hard on a girl like if i grab
a girl pull her in and we start just like
dancing together or something like that and she doesn't even
register what like she doesn't even understand what's going on
because it happens so fast so she's kind of giggling
and smiling and she doesn't even know why i'm dancing
with her and then i just kind of like whisper
in her ear it's just all a dream pretend none
of this is real in five minutes you're going to
wake up your alarm is going to be ringing you're
going to be back at work and then this just
makes her laugh even more uh here here's a line
a funny line dumb girls make me depressed in the
dick so you know sometimes you want to like spike
a conversation by just saying something a little bit obnoxious
and just like completely out of left field so uh
that would be a good line um let's say she
tells me that she's an accountant you know girls will
tell you their accountants their nurses their teachers their uh
pharmacists their attorneys so these professions are so common that
you basically want to have funny witty responses to every
most common profession that exists so you meet you'll meet
a lot of accountants and cpas so if i meet
an accountant then i say something like do excel spreadsheets
make you hard uh you know it's better than just
saying oh you're an accountant oh that's cool see if
you just say oh that's cool that's nice that's boring
but when you say something like oh so excel spreadsheets
make you hard that's that's something emotional and funny another
great line is be gentle with me i'm very shy
so this is an amazing line especially when you go
physical on a girl and you pull her in maybe
you're dancing with her you're being very bold and so
then you say the opposite of that you just whisper
in here be gentle with me i'm a shy virgin
something like that also kind of disqualifies you in it
it's the opposite of bragging and then of course when
you're saying this it's clear to her that you're the
opposite of shy you don't want to say this if
you're coming across shy um and here's a final line
that i'll give you that's kind of funny that i
will use sometimes it's like if i'm talking to a
really beautiful girl i'll say i want to shave your
head so that other girls here can feel good about
themselves so anyways i mean like i'm not telling you
to take these lines and to become some sort of
line spouting robot i'm just giving you these as examples
of like a repository this is just a like a
tiny percentage of of of my repository of kind of
witty things that i invented or stole from other people
whatever um i don't even know where most these lines
come from just by going out having friends [ __
] talking all you know watching infields and so forth
you develop this repository of lines and then you use
them once in a while when you're out your whole
game is not built on these these are things you
sprinkle in so maybe like 90 of your game is
gonna be completely spontaneous and just whatever comes to you
in the moment and then maybe ten percent you're gonna
be sprinkling in some of these lines you know to
spice things up when the situation calls for it and
of course not every situation will call for it and
what i recommend is that you make your own list
and use these as examples not to just copy them
word for word but you know change the words around
use these as like a formula you can kind of
find the structure within these lines and then use those
structures to invent your own lines and your own sort
of funny self-amusing phrases that then become part of your
lexicon in your repertoire of you know jokes and witticisms
that you will pull out whenever the situation calls for
it and and what you'll realize is that actually very
social people whether they do this consciously or unconsciously they
do have this sort of repertoire or repository of lines
that they commonly use a lot of business jargon is
like this you know even with your family and your
friends you you use certain kinds of like lines and
in jokes like this and various kinds of witticisms that
you've unconsciously developed over years well the same thing is
going to happen with your game and why not make
the conscious i mean make the process more conscious rather
than just leaving it all up to chance this is
going to help you to not run out of things
to say and what's more important is that it's going
to help you to break out of your just logical
conversations that's one of the other reasons that i gave
you these lines because i want to show you what
emotional versus logical conversations like these lines are designed to
be not logical but emotional and absurd and obnoxious and
kind of outrageous and just fun all right that's basically
it for game now let's talk about the ethics of
game this is a lot of what is missing from
the pickup community and in fact i released an episode
maybe five or six years ago called a rant against
the pickup community where i was pretty harsh i had
some harsh criticisms against pickup and in fact if you
go watch that episode and compare to these episodes here
you might say well leo it's like night and day
it seems like you're being a hypocrite because you said
some crazy negative things about pickup in that old video
and now you're talking about pick up in a more
positive light so what's the deal how do you reconcile
these two well i was thinking about this and actually
it's it's not so easy even in my own mind
it's not easy for me to reconcile high consciousness with
pickup because honestly pickup is not high consciousness stuff but
then again getting laid and even dating and most relationships
are not high consciousness things the dumber you are the
more sex you have uh the dumber you are the
more you date right very high conscious people they don't
they don't have much sex they don't date very much
a lot of them also aren't very social so being
social is a lot of what being social about is
about is just being stupid being stupid going out partying
being stupid um now this doesn't necessarily contradict high consciousness
per se you can do both um but you have
to understand that dating and sex is a survival activity
and as a survival activity it's very much like sales
or advertising there are dark low consciousness petty selfish aspects
to marketing to sales to pick up to dating to
sex these are very selfish activities they're designed to be
selfish so reconciling it with the highest levels of selflessness
and love is not so easy see and don't pretend
like women are somehow above game women play games and
women can be very obnoxious when it comes to sex
and to relationships and they can be very unconscious about
how they go about these things so let's not pretend
that women are these high consciousness angels that all they
care about is love and deep long-term committed relationships no
women sleep around women have one night stands women get
drunk women party women do ridiculous stupid obnoxious things at
the clubs just as much as guys so you know
both sides are guilty here and you have to understand
that even if you don't learn about pickup there is
collateral damage that is done from sex and from dating
sex comes with risks the risks are not just stds
but the risks are and not just pregnancy but the
risks are getting your heart broken emotional entanglements codependency abuse
of relationships both from the woman's side or from the
man's side um you know toxic relationships cheating on each
other jealousy and i mean many relationships consist of these
sorts of things most relationships are not very healthy relationships
but so i mean so that's sort of like par
for the course now the problem is that pickup can
take this and kind of crank it up to 11
if ethics are not properly observed so here are some
ethical points that i want to make about pickup as
you get good at attracting girls you're gonna gain a
power it is a power it's like political power the
more political power you wield the more opportunity to abuse
it and for corruption and so what you got to
understand is that sex and power warps your mind and
especially when you combine power and sex together the power
of being able to get lots of sex this will
warp your mind you will the ego will tend to
want to abuse this so be careful be careful not
to get sucked into narcissism and selfishness as you get
better with game because you're gonna get drunk on this
power and so that episode where i ranted about the
pickup community mostly i was not talking to newbies as
much as i was talking to the more intermediate and
advanced guys who are into game who game for five
or more years and are getting really good results with
it and then they become drunk with power and they
forget all about ethics and for them it's all about
how many lays they can get and it turns into
this narcissistic selfish thing where it's just like an endless
cycle of sex and more girls and building rotations and
harems and this sort of stuff and this i see
as being toxic and an abuse of power um there's
a fundamental lack of empathy there that i see they're
not really thinking about the girl's agenda because they don't
need to because their game is so good that normally
a normal guy whose game is not good he would
actually have to like respect and be careful with the
girl not to lose her whereas with one of these
like scumbag player types as a really good game he
can just treat women as completely disposable objects and not
care about their emotions not have any empathy and treat
the whole thing very narcissistically and break a lot of
hearts because he can just literally go out tomorrow and
get a new girl a hotter girl the next week
and so on and he already has 10 girls hitting
him up every week so he has so much abundance
that um it's sort of like being wealthy you know
when you're very wealthy you can just waste money and
you completely forget about the poor people who live in
the world who barely have enough you know just on
a few dollars a day they live barely enough to
feed their children and you can become very cavalier with
your money throwing it away burning it you can even
like use 100 bills to light your cigars while children
are dying in africa you know you could probably feed
a whole village in africa on a hundred dollars for
a week and here you are lighting your cigars with
hundred dollar bills and so this this this is not
a healthy attitude towards money and it's not a healthy
attitude towards towards women or towards sex and this is
an abuse of the power of game the problem with
game is that it's very difficult to learn but once
you learn it it's a it's like a super power
it's like a nuclear weapon and precisely because it's so
difficult to learn what happens is that a lot of
guys simply never learn it and therefore they never get
the power but those guys who do go through the
hell and challenge of learning game then they can almost
feel entitled to wield the power and abusive ways because
in their mind they can rationalize it as well but
i work so [ __ ] hard at this i
work so much harder than everybody else therefore i deserve
to be able to wield this power however my ego
wants to wield it in this narcissistic way i've earned
it and this is a mistake i want to caution
you against this it's very important that you treat women
as humans as conscious beings with no less value than
yourself and that you seriously look at the world through
their perspective and not just your own and that fundamentally
your attitude towards women has to come from a deep
love and i think a lot of puas [ __
] themselves about this because they will tell themselves that
they're coming at this from a place of love but
really it's a place of narcissism and selfishness it's a
sort of a limited narcissistic love for oneself and the
ability to get sex but it disregards the agenda of
the other person true love is to want for the
other what is best for themselves to want for the
woman was best for her and i think a lot
of puas are in denial about the fact that these
p way these puas are not really good for women
stop treating women as numbers and objects have compassion and
empathy for her feelings a lot of puas part of
the process of developing yourself into a player involves shedding
empathy and compassion because empathy and compassion makes you sort
of a beta nice guy and so actually in a
sort of toxic way to get really good with women
you have to remove all of your empathy and compassion
that can be helpful but it can also become a
trap so you're kind of making a deal with the
devil here to get lots of sex you you stop
having empathy and compassion you stop developing that and or
you develop some sort of twisted form of that and
then that gets you stuck that becomes a problem you
have to be careful not to become jaded resentful or
bitter by going through this process of pickup because what
happens is that you'll get rejected thousands of times and
this can make you jaded resentful and bitter towards women
it can make you start to treat them just as
objects and numbers simply because you're approaching so much that
to you it is just a number it is just
a pattern it is just a an object to manipulate
this is not healthy and this is not what i
am advocating for you have to be careful this is
a trap i'm pointing out all the traps here so
what's what's challenging is that i wish it was so
simple that i could talk about meeting men's needs and
dating and sexuality and at the same time making it
very high consciousness but the reality is is that these
things are are rather at opposite ends of the sort
of consciousness spectrum now i'm not saying that your sex
can't be highly conscious it can but the reality is
that for most guys who are struggling how to get
laid they're not thinking about high consciousness sex right and
what they need to get good results with women is
not some sort of higher consciousness stuff they actually need
like very nuts and bolts simple things um a lot
of times just like mechanical techniques and so forth to
start getting results and so uh i wish there was
a way to marry perfectly the higher consciousness you know
godly absolute love aspects of reality with getting your sexual
needs met but a lot of times these are going
to be very difficult to reconcile and there's going to
be trade-offs between the two and you should expect that
because this is about survival and this is about complete
selflessness this is about selfishness getting laid is about selfishness
and god is about complete selflessness how do you reconcile
these two things in a certain sense this is the
whole challenge of of life and of survival that i've
talked about in the past a lot and this is
not just true with sex but it's true about money
it's true with um advertising and sales it's true with
business how do you make a really high conscious business
that's difficult to do and for most people who are
just struggling to pay their bills telling them about high
consciousness businesses selfless ways of running a business this is
not gonna help them to pay their bills they're not
at that level yet they have to do a lot
of low conscious business before they can rise to a
point of appreciating and doing high consciousness business but nevertheless
there are still some ways of doing business which is
very unethical and i want to point those out to
you because i don't want to be teaching unethical business
practices and likewise i don't want to be teaching unethical
dating practices either and where do you draw the line
between what is and if it isn't ethical this is
also very difficult to do you see so i don't
really have like clear perfect answers for you here i
can just point out the traps and then it's going
to be your responsibility to avoid these traps and not
get seduced to the dark side here into selfishness and
since your sex warps your mind so much you're craving
for sex and it's a very deep desire that us
men have especially um there's gonna be a tendency for
you to sort of backwards rationalize whatever helps you to
get lots of sex to rationalize why it's actually good
and loving and selfless and godly and conscious and all
of this i see this in a lot of puas
who are serious players who have slept with hundreds of
women they have all sorts of stories and excuses in
their minds about what how they're treating women how it's
actually all fine and good and even loving so watch
out for that trap do not blame women for not
sleeping with you no woman owes you sex this is
important when women reject you a lot you can start
to start to blame them want to blame them for
not sleeping with you uh be respectful be friendly be
kind don't be a jerk don't be a [ __
] [ __ ] don't be obnoxious don't be offensive
deliberately try to reduce that don't call women [ __
] [ __ ] [ __ ] and so forth
this is not necessary again this is going to put
you into an adversarial relationship with womankind as a whole
which is not going to be healthy for you don't
be creepy don't be cruel don't be hurtful don't be
angry don't be obnoxious don't physically coerce women into sex
if she tells you no and she's not smiling and
she means it and she's firm no then that's where
you stop none of this that i've been teaching is
anything about coercing her into going home with you if
at any point she doesn't want to come home with
you you don't take her home another point here is
do not take advantage of emotionally broken girls or girls
who are too drunk uh i mean the reality is
that at night time at bars and clubs most people
drink personally i don't but most people do and it's
fine to to sleep with a girl who's had a
few drinks that's fine that's how most people have sex
your parents probably had a few drinks before you were
conceived and without those drinks you probably wouldn't be here
right now and probably neither would i that's just the
reality uh probably if we got rid of alcohol the
world's population would probably be half of what it is
but there's a difference between just having a few drinks
and just being really really drunk to the point where
you've lost your cognitive capacities so if you see girls
like this then don't take advantage of them i have
known some some really scumbag players who would take advantage
of girls who are totally drunk and i don't consider
that ethical so watch out for that don't do that
uh and also i've known some players who will take
advantage of emotionally broken girls like i know a guy
who would who would hit on girls who were like
crying outside the nightclub because they just had a breakup
or their friends left them or something like that and
they're sort of in a traumatic very emotionally vulnerable state
and then this guy would walk up to her and
chat her up run game on her and then take
her home she's very likely to come home with him
because she's in an emotionally vulnerable state he's taking advantage
of her um i don't consider this ethical game again
you have to look at it from her perspective is
she going to regret this later uh is she in
a place where she's actually deciding uh in a conscious
way that she likes you or are you just really
like a vulture taking advantage of a situation and that
you really don't care about her well-being uh you're just
trying to use her and you know she's just like
the lowest hanging fruit that you can find and you
find in the night so don't do that try to
reduce lie and manipulation and inauthenticity as much as possible
reduce collateral damage and avoid breaking her heart her heart
so i think a lot of players are are very
uh much in denial to themselves about how much they
break girls hearts when they kind of like hook them
in and then string them along and then eventually just
you know leave them out to dry uh do not
mislead her about your intentions and what you want with
her be clear and upfront with her about it um
don't turn pickup into an ideology or an identity don't
base your whole life around it don't turn it into
a life purpose do not ruin relationships and marriages so
what i recommend is that if a girl says she
has a boyfriend and it's a serious boyfriend and if
she says or she says she's married then just leave
the set don't push it further i know some players
who will still keep going if she says she has
a boyfriend to me this is unethical they rationalize it
to themselves by saying that oh well but if she
was gonna if she's gonna sleep with me that means
she's not really into her boyfriend and therefore it was
going to end anyways yeah maybe so maybe that's true
but even if that's true it's still not ethical for
you to sleep with her if she has a boyfriend
you should know better you're not looking out for her
best interest in that situation you're just being exploitative just
because you can run game on her and make her
attracted to you that doesn't mean that you should uh
don't brag about your conquests don't do revenge porn sex
tapes secret videos of her having sex with you field
reports posting pictures of her online and stuff like nude
photos like don't do that don't be a selfish [
__ ] treat your girl well don't be a jerk
to her so once she's attracted to you and she's
sleeping with you treat her well treat her like a
princess because you actually care about her a lot of
puas they'll like sleep with a girl but then deep
down they sort of hate her or they're bitter towards
her or they're um they're like vindictive they want to
take vengeance on her this is very immature low consciousness
and it's going to create a lot of bad karma
for you don't cheat on girls this goes back to
the point about not misleading her about your intentions so
if if she assumes that you're exclusive with her then
you shouldn't be cheating on her otherwise make it clear
to her right off the bat that you guys are
not exclusive so that she knows that you're gonna be
sleeping with other girls as soon as possible i recommend
that you use game as a way to build deep
relationships to find that right girl for you that's really
the proper use of game find the right girl for
you don't just be endlessly cycling through girls because this
is not going to satisfy you anyways what you really
want is is deeper love and deeper sexuality and deeper
intimacy and you're not going to get that just by
having a bunch of one-night stands also i want you
i want to encourage you to think deeply about the
ethical problems with building rotations and harems so a lot
of puas that i know they'll have 10 girls that
they see on rotation a bunch of friends with benefits
and [ __ ] buddies and so forth and then
as they're doing this rotation girls fall out every couple
of months then they replace them with new girls and
so they just keep a rotation going if your game
is good enough you can do this but of course
the problem is is that you're exploiting these girls you're
not really being honest with these girls you're not being
loving towards these girls when you build these rotations and
harems um so i don't think that this is a
very ethical way to go contemplate the problems with that
i recommend that you plan to outgrow cold approach have
an exit strategy don't stay in it into your 40s
and 50s and 60s have an exit strategy also work
on your traumas and your fear of intimacy and commitment
a lot of pwas have serious problems with trauma fear
of intimacy and commitment you guys need serious work on
that it's really holding you back in terms of your
evolution on a spiritual level and with ego development the
stages of ego development you got to work that [
__ ] out and that's really the reason why you're
chasing girls endlessly and you're building these rotations and harems
and you're just doing it over and over and over
again and you're chasing hotter and hotter girls this is
not going to satisfy you and really the reason you're
doing is because of unresolved trauma fear of intimacy and
commitment and a lack of understanding of the kind of
depth of love that is possible with more longer term
committed relationships stop chasing after the hottest girls in the
perfect tens as though this is what life is about
i would actually recommend that you lower your standards for
physical attractiveness so that you're settling for a less attractive
girl but one that really matches you one that has
a really healthy personality one that is spiritual that is
interested in self-actualization other things that you're interested in so
you can grow together sacrifice a few points on physical
attractiveness to get a better personality this is a very
worthwhile trade-off some of these hottest perfect 10 type of
girls they end up being narcissists they end up having
borderline personality disorders or other sorts of crazy problems emotional
drama and so forth and that turns into toxic codependent
relationships that you don't want to have anything to do
with even though she's really hot it's not worth it
and lastly do not get stuck in spirodynamic stage orange
that's where i feel that most p waves go wrong
is that they get stuck in this cycle they get
drunk with their power and then they just game endlessly
and they just keep gaming and gaming and gaming and
gaming with more girls hotter girls and then where is
it going they don't have an exit strategy and they
just stuck get stuck in stage orange and then they
might even study higher stages they might study sage green
and stays yellow and and so forth they might even
talk about spirituality but fundamentally they are still stuck at
that chakra two stage orange place where they're they're basically
run by their dick their life is run by their
dick you're letting your dick run your life this is
not a proper use of game that's not what i'm
suggesting and so when a lot of women react negatively
against this topic of how to get laid uh this
is really what the women are reacting against there's a
lot of these ethical problems and this idea that basically
they're like leo why are you talking about this why
are you teaching guys how to get stuck in stage
orange well of course i'm not i don't want to
teach guys how to get stuck in stage orange but
what you have to understand is that if we don't
talk about stage orange then we can't get them to
higher stages so ladies i understand your concerns here um
but you have to understand also the power that sex
has over men's minds it has a much stronger power
than it does over women's minds now it has a
different sort of power over women you get very attached
to a specific kind of guy um after you have
a lot of sex with him so that can be
a problem for women too abusive relationships all that sort
of that can happen with women but with guides it's
a slightly different it takes a different form with guys
um if they can't get sex that becomes extremely toxic
and if they can get sex but then they get
stuck in stage orange then it also becomes toxic because
just endless sex and nothing higher to it and so
i'm hoping that this can be used as a way
to go go further so what i'm suggesting for you
guys who are great at game or plan to get
great at game is that you use it and then
you you transcend it transcend it burn through that karma
but actually burn through it don't just spend your whole
life in a cycle doing the same damn thing over
again because then you're not really burning through it burn
through it and then transcend it and then come out
the other side and then move on to higher things
there are much more beautiful things in life than just
endless sex with perfect tense and one of the things
that makes me saddest about some of my my really
good pick up friends is that sure they've had sex
with hundreds of girls beautiful girls that i might not
even ever have sex with and so forth but uh
but the end of the day the kind of love
and joy and happiness that i've received through consciousness work
and other things that i teach through my channel is
orders of magnitude beyond anything that these guys can imagine
and so in the end pickup is a pretty low
consciousness activity but then again so is most normal sex
and most normal dating this is not high level iq
stuff this is dumb stuff sex is dumb stuff it
had to be because animals have been [ __ ]
on this planet long before uh humans developed very advanced
brains long before there was language long before there was
mathematics long before there was uh you know complex societies
and all this kind of fancy technology and stuff there
was sex so you got to figure sex is a
pretty base thing but at the same time precisely because
it's a base thing if you don't get it handled
if you don't handle this problem in your life and
you're not getting the sex you feel you deserve this
is not going to be healthy for you you see
so it's all about finding that right balance between survival
and the transcendence of survival so we want to help
people master their survival so that they can transcend it
but not get stuck in it endlessly endlessly chasing more
survival alright here are some of my final tips about
game that was all the ethics we got the ethics
out of the way my final tips firstly use a
condom carry two condoms with you why two condoms carry
them in your wallet uh always use a condom when
you're having sex don't have sex without a condom uh
not a good idea you want two because most likely
you're gonna have sex with a girl once at night
and then if you sleep with her in the morning
you're probably gonna have sex with her again especially if
she's hot and if you only have one condom you're
gonna be very tempted to have sex with her in
the morning without a condom also if one of your
condoms breaks you got a second backup otherwise you're going
to be screwed or you're going to put yourself in
a dangerous situation so always have two condoms make sure
they're not expired also i recommend that you clean your
bed clean your bathroom clean your apartment wherever you live
make it nice so you can take girls back there
also develop your style your sense of dress buy new
clothes get everything tailored and fitted every single shirt that
i buy i go to a tailor to get it
fitted to me because i'm pretty tall and there's most
of the shirts i buy they're not they're not gonna
fit very well it makes a big difference it makes
you look so much more attractive when your clothes are
perfectly fitted and it doesn't cost a lot to fit
a a shirt like this costs 15 it's totally worth
it get your pants fitted get your vests fit everything
fit everything everything has to be fitted so that your
physique is visible develop your lifestyle don't just work on
the mechanics of game or what lines you say but
develop your lifestyle so you have a cool lifestyle that
a girl would be happy to be a part of
make your lifestyle exciting do interesting things go interesting places
travel around go to different cities meet interesting people make
interesting friends decorate your bachelor pad so that it's cool
so it's unique develop some interesting hobbies so you have
something more going for you than just games or video
games learn pop culture a lot of the reasons you
might not have anything to say when you're talking to
a girl is because you're not very well versed in
pop culture and pop culture of course is dumb and
stupid especially if you're studying spiritual stuff all the time
um but still pop culture helps you to relate to
others on their level and then what you find is
that first when you're relating to somebody you got to
relate to them on a shallow level then you can
take that relationship to a deeper level it's hard to
just begin relating with some stranger on a deep level
immediately so pop culture is good for this if you
really want to learn game study in-field videos you have
to observe how other people actually do game well look
at their verbals study it rehearse it not because you're
going to copy it word for word but you want
to just get the general sense of what's going on
and how they're doing it especially look at their body
posture their tonality how comfortable they feel in their body
how relaxed they are look at all that look at
their eye contact look at how they're standing squaring up
also of course look at the kind of words they're
saying find infield there's a lot of infield you can
find online and lastly remember it's not about the quantity
of approaches it's more about the quality it's a mistake
to just think that just by doing a thousand approaches
that will make you good you need to do a
thousand high quality approaches to become good not just approaches
it's easy to do bad approaches make sure that you
analyze why your approaches are working or not working otherwise
you could be doing thousands even tens of thousands of
approaches but not be getting that much better so quality
of approach over quantity of approach is important i fell
into this trap myself when i started off i was
just i was just counting approaches without thinking about their
quality at all maybe for the first thousand approaches and
it didn't go so well now i i really don't
count approaches unless they're a really high quality approach and
i think about what could have made the approach better
and what made it fail all right so to wrap
all this up how do you know that any of
this theory is true of course you test it the
claim is that all this stuff is empirical go out
and take action now is time for action these three
episodes have really given you the big picture of how
game works a very realistic set of expectations and all
the traps and problems all the common mistakes you really
don't need much more theory than this these three episodes
should give you enough theory to basically cover your first
year or two of approaching so go now and approach
for a whole year and keep re-watching these points and
working on each sticking point working all these traps and
problems and mindset issues and all these techniques and [Music]
really it's that simple of course it's not simple but
you don't need much more theory than this in fact
more theory could hold you back make sure you work
on your victim mindset stop making excuses you will despite
all the rejection you get you will have many positive
interactions you will have many nights out that are just
fun and amazing you will also have some brutal nights
this whole process if you decide to commit to it
seriously is going to be far more challenging emotionally than
you ever imagined but at the same time it will
also be far more rewarding and it will not just
be about sex it'll be about so much more than
sex and lastly if you're deciding that you're not going
to do this process then you need some other strategy
for how to solve this problem of not getting laid
in your life as a guy you can't just keep
stomaching this it's gonna fester like a wound and it's
gonna get worse and worse and worse this problem will
not solve itself you need some way some strategy for
how to socialize develop social skills and then from that
get girls whatever that is for you maybe for you
it's not going to be pickup it's going to be
social circle fine then go master social circle if that's
more your style but you need some kind of proactive
concrete strategy and there are not that many different strategies
but you got to pick one you got to work
it do not just ignore this problem because it's not
going to go away for you as a man you
