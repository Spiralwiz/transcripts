hey this is Leo for ash lies dorg and in
this episode I'm going to be talking about relationship red
flags how to avoid dysfunctional intimate relationships I honestly feel
like bad or dysfunctional intimate relationships is one of the
biggest hurdles and obstacles that prevents people from self actualizing
and living up to their full potential life people waste
decades of their life in terrible toxic relationships that are
going nowhere and they know that they're going nowhere and
yet they're trapped in these relationships and they can't break
out and because of this they waste so much of
their energy these these relationships can become so abusive and
so dysfunctional and so toxic and they just screw with
your emotion so much that you're not able to accomplish
anything of lasting value in your life you're not able
to focus on personal growth you're not able to focus
on your health you're not able to focus on your
life purpose on your business on your career or even
on creating a great family or creating a healthy relationship
so what I wanted to do is I wanted to
help you to avoid this this is a long list
I sat down I started writing up all these different
red flags for how to identify if you're in a
dysfunctional relationship and the list just kept getting longer and
longer and longer but I think it's important to go
through it so here we go let's just get right
into it the first red flag very obvious is substance
abuse so alcohol drugs smoking alcohol abuse terrible your relationship
is going to fail if your partner is a digit
to any of these kinds of substances right so be
very careful about this keep your eyes open as soon
as you see any signs of this overuse of alcohol
I mean a little bit of alcohol is okay but
overuse of alcohol and then accepts of smoking and any
kind of drugs really you should ditch that relationship another
one is if your partner is asking to borrow money
from you this should virtually never happen never ever ever
should this happen if it happens and your partner makes
you feel like it's normal it's okay or well this
is just an emergency so in this situation it's cool
then that's still a really huge red flag your partner
should respect you enough never to have to borrow money
from you and especially if they try to borrow money
from you under pressure so it feels like they're in
an emergency and you know they need the money right
now they need the money in the next 12 hours
or something really bad is going to happen like these
kind of high-pressure situations nah that's that's a bunch of
[ __ ] that should not happen in a healthy
relationship another one is a history of cheating stealing swindling
or arrests or even jail time so as you're getting
to know your partner and by the way here I'm
talking about both guys and girls so these red flags
some of them apply more to guys some of them
apply more to girls but it could be a mix
right so when you're getting to know your partner as
you're dating them really be asking them about their history
be asking about their history of relationships be asking about
their history of a business of work of friendships of
their life of their backstory as you're finding all this
stuff out you're going to be able to see what
their character is like and it's gonna be very hard
for them to hide everything about themselves right so stuff
will slip out so be on the lookout for situations
where your partner's telling you some sort of story and
he tells you about how he cheated on subtest when
he was in school or how he stole some pencils
from the from the office you know little things I'm
not talking about like he robbed a bank I mean
that's obvious if you robbed a bank then don't be
with him but even if it's little things like he
cheated on a test in college or you see that
he stole some pencils or some staplers from his office
or maybe he's kind of a swindler / con artist
type and he likes to kind of con people out
of deals through various trickery or manipulation techniques any of
this kind of stuff immediately tells you what the character
and integrity of this person is whether it's a guy
or a girl and of course if this person has
any records of arrests or jail time that tells you
everything that you need to know people like this who
have a history like this they're not going to reform
overnight all right and you don't want to be sitting
around waiting for them to reform and these kind of
people usually get you into a lot of trouble money
trouble trouble with bad friends bad influences drugs like all
sorts of stuff is going to go wrong here not
to mention that if they have this low level of
integrity just think about what's going to happen when it's
going to be applied to your relationship right a cheat
is a cheat is a cheat everywhere if he cheats
on a test he probably won't think twice about cheating
on you and he probably won't think twice about lying
to you or manipulating you in some way as long
as it serves him so just keep that in mind
right judge people by the consistency of their character another
really good red flag real tip-off here is if the
person runs a shady business some sort of half illegal
business I mean if it's a totally obviously illegal business
like selling drugs huge red flag immediate disqualification for a
relationship but if it's kind of borderline and shady maybe
this guy's selling damaged used cars or he's a I
don't know he's swindling people out of money in stock
deals or he's selling some of shady stocks or you
know whatever is happening the business that's kind of shady
that's a huge red flag because a person who runs
a shady business also runs a shady life and that
comes directly from his or her lack of integrity so
make sure you ask the person like what kind of
business are you running what are you doing at work
what kind of products do you sell how do you
service your customers like this kind of stuff you should
be asking these kinds of questions over the course of
the relationship just to get to know just in case
you know is everything aboveboard they're shady stuff going on
that's semi-legal and in that case huge red flag okay
another one is a history of short relationships so as
you know this person asked him about their relationship history
you don't need to go into all the painful details
and have them tell you all about their previous sex
life and stuff but you can find out what their
relationship history was like did they have a history of
relationships that lasted four years or was their longest relationship
like six months that's a huge red flag if that's
the case also if they've had very very few relationships
like one or two that could also potentially be a
huge red flag so watch out for that and also
of course if they have a history of very many
relationships like 20 or 30 relationships that should also tell
you that probably something is off there another red flag
is if they're evasive about their past relationship history so
every time you kind of try to bring it up
and you try to ask them all like you know
tell me what your first you know relationship was like
or tell me who you fell in love with when
you were in school and they just kind of like
completely avoid and change topics and they're very evasive and
sketchy about the whole thing and you can see that
then that's a huge red flag because they're hiding something
now maybe they're hiding something embarrassing or they're hiding something
that they haven't coped with themselves so it's not a
complete and 100% disqualifier you know people can have legitimate
reasons for being evasive about stuff because they might even
be denying it to themselves because maybe it was a
traumatic event or something they wish they didn't do you
know they're feeling guilty about it but generally you need
to be able to have them open up to you
especially after you know a bit of a time in
the relationship they should be opening up to you and
if they're always evasive about it then that's a problem
speaking of evasive this the next red flag is are
they evasive in conversations in general not just past relationship
history but you know maybe you're asking them about their
business and they're kind of evasive about telling you about
their business that's a red flag or maybe you ask
them about their parents and their their early family life
and their evasive about that that's a flag right there
red flag too so how do you tell evasion well
usually the person just kind of like hand wave something
away or gives you a glib response or just a
vague generality is being very abstract kind of shifty eyes
maybe looking downwards doesn't look you in the eyes maybe
a shaky tone in the voice this sort of stuff
so watch out for all that stuff because they're concealing
something they're hiding some sort of skeletons in the closet
and the fundamental problem is that they're not being honest
with you they're not opening up to you which they
should be doing in a legit relationship the next red
flag is that this person can't hold on to a
job so find out about the person's job history like
oh when did you get your first job and how
long did you have that one for and how many
jobs have you had in your whole life and how
long were you at your previous job was it like
three months is that as long as you can hold
the job is for three months that's a problem it's
certainly a problem if a guy can't hold on to
a job because the guy's primary value in life is
to have a job and to work but for girls
to you know I've dated girls who have had difficulty
holding on to jobs and that shows something about the
person that shows that this person is irresponsible they're not
dependable they're not consistent they don't have persistence and perseverance
they don't have a results-oriented mindset or they can't get
along with people at work you know all these things
are just obvious clues to deeper psychological problems that this
person has which will come back and bite you in
the ass in your relationship it's not just a money
issue I'm not saying here that you need this person
to hold the job because you want them to pay
for you all the time or to support you know
for example if I'm with a girl I don't expect
her to support me at all but if she can't
hold on to a job that means she's gonna have
her own money problems I'm gonna have to deal with
that [ __ ] in the future she's not going
to be happy about her life how can you be
happy if you can't hold on to a job you're
going to feel worthless you're going to be depressed you
can be miserable and more along those lines another red
flag this was a big one is if your partner
is losing friends meaning that friends are leaving your partner
or if your partner has no friends at all zero
friends or like one or two friends now maybe your
partner is extremely introverted and therefore doesn't have friends or
maybe they just moved into town and they don't have
friends and those are legitimate perhaps reasons for not having
many friends but especially if you can see that actively
friends are leaving and not talking to your partner anymore
that tells you that something's going on there somehow in
some way those friends are not wanting to associate with
him or her and therefore that tells you that you
probably shouldn't either another big red flag is when your
partner expects money gifts or favors from you are they
hinting at the that the fact that you should be
giving them all sorts of fancy clothes and fancy cars
and fancy jewels and this and that if they are
if they're kind of pressuring you if they're trying to
do some sort of bartering exchange in the relationship like
oh you buy me a diamond necklace and then I'll
do something nice for you tomorrow this kind of thing
if there's this kind of transactional nature to your relationship
that's a huge red flag big problem another red flag
is chronically showing up late once or twice is okay
but it is happening repeatedly or if your partner is
completely standing you up that's a big problem shows a
lack of respect also shows that this person is not
very responsible another red flag is flakiness and forgetfulness so
a lot of times girls can be very flaky like
you schedule a date or you schedule this or that
and then they just completely forget or they just pretend
like they're running through life like a leaf blowing in
the wind like schedules don't matter to them they don't
adhere to schedules they don't like schedules I don't like
this I don't like that they don't keep tie they
don't have a watch you know this kind of stuff
all excuses for being flaky and for being forgetful um
that speaks to a deeper character flaws within this person
how are you going to depend on this person longer
into the relationship right to have a successful long-term relationship
you need to be able to depend on the person
you be able to trust this person this person needs
to have some saikal psychological foundation that will allow them
to create success in life these people are losers if
your partner is a loser why are you tolerating that
next red flag is if your partner is possessive or
jealous trying to control you trying to watch her every
move asking you where you're going who you're hanging out
with maybe he's a insecure about the fact that you've
got male friends if you're a woman and maybe vice
versa the woman is insecure because you've got female friends
as the guy they're trying to control you and monitor
you all this kind of stuff um that speaks to
deep insecurities within them that they need to resolve another
red flag is that the person is very clingy and
is always on call and is always there to answer
your phone calls answer your text messages and to be
there at your doorstep whenever you want this might sound
like a nice quality to have a partner who is
completely loyal to you to the point of being clingy
but this gets real old real fast and the deeper
problems that it speaks to insecurities within that person a
normal healthy psychologically healthy man or woman will not be
clingy and constantly on call a healthy individual is independent
has his or her own life going has her own
job her own business um her own schedule you know
she's going to the gym and she's got this to
doing that to do so she's not going to be
always on call for you she's not gonna be always
answering every one of your text messages within five minutes
if she is that tells you that she's way too
clingy and that's going to come back and bite you
real hard in the end the the next red flag
is that if this person needs to see you more
than three times per week and demands to see you
almost every day or every other day or has to
call you or has to text you every single day
and expects the same from you otherwise they get pissy
and upset and worried and insecure if that's going on
then this is another symptom of clinginess and insecurity that
this person has basically what this says is that this
person doesn't have an independent life of his or her
own and therefore this person is completely trying to merge
their life with you and into this relationship and they're
trying to get all their fulfillment and love from the
relationship and this this creates codependency which is very dangerous
and it will come back and it will destroy this
relationship in the long run so watch out for that
the opposite of this red flag is the red flag
that is like this that this person is too busy
to see you at least once per week so they
give you excuses like oh I'm working too much and
you know I've got school and I've got this and
I've got that and you know I've got a business
and I've got to do this and I've got to
take care of this and all this stuff I mean
I've got such a busy life so I can only
see you once a month or twice a month that's
way too little if a person is not willing to
invest at least one day a week to see you
and to hang out with you for at least a
few hours per week then why are they in a
relationship in the first place that means that they're placing
this right relationship at such a low priority in life
that they're probably not willing to invest any energy into
it they're not willing to fix any problems that come
up which will of course inevitably come up as they
do in all relationships so this is not a person
that you can have a successful relationship with also you're
probably gonna be frustrated because honestly if you only see
a person once a month or twice a month you
know you probably want to see the more you want
to build something deeper than just something like that so
keep that in mind beware of their excuses especially busy
workaholic people give you a lot of excuses don't put
up with that you deserve better the next red flag
is that this person is unwilling to learn better communication
skills this is a huge red flag and I see
a lot of women that succumb to this red flag
so what happens is that a guy usually for example
their husband or their their boyfriend I doesn't want to
learn how to communicate better and he's terrible at communicating
and he refuses to do anything about it and so
he's just kind of stuck in his own place in
life and the girl has to put up with this
and she wants better communication and they're important issues in
the relationship that need to be discussed even the guy
knows they need to be discussed but he just doesn't
want to work on communication now listen I'm not even
telling you that the guy doesn't want to communicate I'm
saying not only does he have to want to communicate
he has to want to improve how he communicates why
is this such an important point because you cannot have
a successful long-term relationship without really high quality communication because
[ __ ] will come up guaranteed problems will come
up and one of the things that kills relationships the
most is lack of communication stuff gets swept under the
rug for so long that a few years down the
line it's impossible to do anything with that relationship they
become so toxic and so dysfunctional because nothing is getting
communicated and then it builds up and it's too late
not only that but then there's this habit established of
well we don't communicate and we're not going to learn
how to communicate better you want to start right from
the very beginning of your relationship to have very clear
authentic communication channels open and also you both need to
agree to the fact that hey you know we're a
team we got to work on the teamwork here teams
work on teamwork you can't be a successful team just
by looking out for yourself the other person looks out
for themselves and then there's no cooperation cooperation has to
happen the person has to be willing to invest energy
and time and resources into that is the person willing
to read a book on communication is the person willing
to take a seminar is the person willing to get
some coaching or to watch a video on YouTube with
you or whatever if they're not then I would suggest
ditching this person because this is not going to go
anywhere good also an additional point on this is that
if the person is unwilling to learn about relationships how
intimate relationships function if they're unwilling to watch videos or
read books with you or go to seminars or listen
to audio programs or discuss with you how to improve
the relationship if they're not willing to do this kind
of meta relationship work then release relationship will not last
and it will become a really toxic and dysfunctional relationship
in the long run right a relationship is like a
car you need to maintain it maintenance need to go
into it just like anything in life it deteriorates with
time unless it's maintained and even actively improved so if
this person has no desire whatsoever to do personal development
work on the relationship itself and to learn how relationships
function because most people have no idea how relations function
if people are not willing to improve themselves in this
area then there are very bad candidates for long term
relationships so that's a huge red flag another red flag
is lies to other people so do you see that
this person lies to others maybe not to you but
to others like maybe you're sitting in a restaurant with
your partner and then the waitress comes by and she
asks him something innocent and he gives her a lie
now I might seem like a little white lie is
not a big deal but the way that this person
interacts with others is how they will interact also with
you if you know that your partner lies in business
and lash his friends and lies to co-workers and lies
to random strangers on the street then guess what he's
doing with you guess what she's doing with you exactly
the same thing this is a really good way to
judge character and just see how this person interacts with
others another red flag is if this person likes to
lie by omission so this is a special case here
because sometimes what people do is that they get very
technical they get very kind of sneaky about it and
it's like well you know honey I told you the
truth but you know yeah I just held back this
one critical fact that changes the whole context of what
I told you so maybe factually what I told you
is true but then the context of it was somehow
hidden or somehow set in a way that made that
other person look uh you know innocent when they really
weren't so these are kind of like lies by omission
or kind of very manipulative use of truth like I
can be truthful in a very manipulative way or I'll
tell you certain things but that all meant other things
and then this gives you a perspective on the situation
that's very different than what it normally would have been
if you see this person doing it with you or
even just with friends or other people then that's a
huge red flag because what this tells you this purpose
this person has a fundamentally manipulative personality he or she
likes to manipulate others and guess what they're doing with
you they're manipulating you it just has to be that
way has to be that way you can't really fake
noble character you can't fake integrity if a person has
strong character and strong integrity uh that's like an honest
signal what they call an honest signal is a signal
it's very difficult to fake because they actually have to
have that integrity right so it's very easy to spot
people who have low integrity if you just watch them
for a little bit you know for for a couple
of weeks a couple of months if you see them
interacting you'll see it you'll see it just be self
honest with yourself about the fact that they are doing
this and you know be objective about it don't just
fall head and over heel and love with this person
and then just kind of think that they're perfect they
have no character flaws that's maybe the only place where
you'd go wrong with that another red flag is that
this person is always in an emergency situation there's always
something going wrong there's always they're in a car accident
then they break their foot then they then you know
they get fired then they run out of money then
it's this that it's that it's like never-ending emergencies with
this person watch out for that that's a huge red
flag tells you that this person is is unstable ungrounded
that they don't fundamentally know how to steer their own
life and it's a it's very it's very miserable to
be in a person in a relationship with a person
who's always in these emergencies because then he stresses you
out or she stresses you out you get anxious they're
always coming to rely on you you have to go
fix all these emergencies for them it's just a real
pain in the ass another red flag is a perfectionism
is this person hyper critical of everything are they critical
when they're driving with you in the car all the
time are they critical about every little thing that every
person does to them if they are then guess what
they're also hyper critical about you maybe they tell you
and they throw it in your face in that case
it's real obvious you know they're hyper critical of you
but a lot of times maybe they're kind of like
a quiet perfectionist where they're critical of everybody else but
then with you they don't really tell you anything critical
and you might think oh well that's okay he loves
me or she loves me but actually deep down inside
they're criticizing you so much they're going to destroy their
image of you and any possibility of a good relationship
except you're not going to know about it so you
have to be very careful about that and a perfectionist
he or she is never going to be satisfied with
you that's the problem they're never going to like settle
down with you they're never going to make a commitment
to you because they're always gonna be looking for something
better out there and as soon as they see it
they're going to go for another red flag is is
this person cutthroat in business maybe you're dating a guy
and this probably applies most to guys maybe you're a
girl and you're dating a guy and this guy's like
the you know the corporate CEO type you know Titan
of industry Wall Street broker something like this and this
guy's just cutthroat he screws everybody over you know he's
a real hard nosed negotiator he makes everyone bends over
backwards and you know he screws people out of deals
and he just puts the pressure on them he's very
litigious you know he Sue's people he's very quick to
threaten people in business this kind of stuff um that's
real dangerous I wouldn't date a guy like that because
this guy will turn on you what you're dating is
basically easier dating a a vicious dog and this vicious
dog it seems like all is it's pretty nice to
have a vicious dog because he's biting everybody else but
eventually a vicious dog comes back and bites the owner
too and that's the problem so watch out for that
is the person you're dating narcissistic are they overly driven
by money power and fame if they are that's a
huge problem first of all because they're never going to
be happy in life by pursuing money and power and
fame at the expense everything else also if they are
pursuing money power and fame at the expense of everything
else including their integrity then guess what at one point
in the future and it might not be too long
they're going to sacrifice you and they're going to sacrifice
this relationship in order to acquire more money more power
and more fame so you need to be a good
judge of the values of this individual what did this
individual value do they actually value relationships do they value
intimacy do they value love if they don't then what
are they doing in a relationship if their top values
are money power and fame that's not going to go
anywhere good and their life is going to be in
shambles within a few decades if you stick around so
don't stick around another red flag is that this person
is completely oblivious to the opinions of other people now
this is mostly a problem for guys so if you're
a girl and you're dating a guy and you think
this guy is really macho he's a really confident you're
just so in love with him because he's got this
uh like granite like confidence that nothing perturbs him at
all he doesn't give a [ __ ] about anybody
people criticize him he just doesn't care and because this
he looks very confident at first but be very careful
because like guy like this he's lacking compassion and he's
lacking empathy and that's gonna turn around and bite you
in the ass really soon because guess what he doesn't
care about anybody else he also doesn't care about you
this is kind of like what a narcissist is right
so be careful about that your guy should have a
healthy respect for other people he should still care about
opinions of other people he should be open to feedback
that's important don't just go with a guy who literally
doesn't give a [ __ ] because he certainly will
not give a [ __ ] about you the next
red flag is if the person is calling you foul
language names or is he yelling at you and raising
his voice or her voice at you so are you
being called names like [ __ ] [ __ ]
[ __ ] this kind of stuff any of these
kind of names watch out because that's getting into verbal
abuse you should not have any arguing to the point
where you two are yelling at each other if it
ever gets to the point of yelling and shouting matches
already that's like a that's a foreshadow of death to
this relationship it should never get to that point you
two should have a healthy respect for each other and
you should have very open lines of communication so that
it never gets to this point if you are in
the situation then guess what you're in a dysfunctional relationship
and you're going to have to leave this relationship sooner
or later or it's going to blow up in your
face another red flag is does this person snap at
other people do they have a hot short temper like
maybe the waitress brings you guys some food and the
order wasn't quite right and maybe your man gets pissed
off at this waitress and calls her a bad name
to her face or something like that gets real hot
tempered with her for something rather innocent this reveals a
lot about your man in this situation all right or
you woman whatever it is so guess what if they
have this hot temper it's going to be reflected back
on you probably sooner than you think does the person
that you're with break things throw things do they smash
doors do they punch holes in walls do they throw
vases and and flowerpots at you or at the wall
this kind of stuff this is completely ridiculous if this
ever happens to you even once in a relationship even
once immediate disqualifier guaranteed dysfunctional relationship guarantee that this is
not going to end well this should never ever ever
happen in a healthy relationship does the person that you're
with threatened you by telling you they're going to leave
the relationship so maybe you come and you communicate with
him and or with her and you tell them something
you're like hey baby I want to work on this
I want to do this or I have this grievance
or I want you to fix this or have some
criticism about how this is going I'm really upset here
whatever and then the person says well if you're upset
about it I'm just going to leave threatening the relationship
is an immediate red flag immediate disqualifier even if it
happens once it should not happen even once be very
careful about this because what's gonna happen is that if
the person leave threatens to leave and then you get
scared and you back down because of that then what
is going to happen is that that person will then
use that against you for the rest of your life
because they will know that you backed down and that
you're a more afraid of losing this relationship than they
are and so they'll just keep threatening you and threatening
you and end up bullying you for the rest of
the relationship and it's going to go real bad right
um be very careful about that one that's a subtle
one that one happens more than you might think and
most people will kind of tolerate that because I think
like oh it's not too bad it's not too bad
that they threatened me no it's quite bad another red
flag is if this person blames you for everything so
maybe you come to this person you say hey you
know honey I have this problem in early in our
relationship let's work on this let's work on that and
the person just points his finger at you and says
no it's it's your fault you did this and you're
doing that and it's all this and it's all that
and all my problems are here you know are your
problems it's all because of the way that you're acting
it's all because your behavior all because of your character
flaws and defects then um that's a big problem you
and your partner both need to take 100% responsibility for
your half of the relationship that means that instead of
blaming your partner first of all you blame yourself not
blame blames a bad word but more like take responsibility
yourself always take responsibility yourself always resist blaming the other
person and the other person should be doing the exact
same thing if those barriers break down and you start
blaming each other this is probably one of the most
common causes of destroyed relationships is a mutual finger-pointing and
refusal to take responsibility another red flag is psych medications
is the person you're dating on psych medications medications for
depression for anxiety for schizophrenia for bipolar disorder this kind
of stuff find out that's hugely important for you to
know if you're man or woman has psychological problems if
they're seeing a psychotherapist and/or a psychiatrist at a pharmacologist
whatever and they're loaded up on these drugs these drugs
create a lot of problems ah I really wouldn't be
dating a person who's on these kinds of medications it
will screw up their emotions they will not be clear
thinking it also shows me that they're not really willing
to work through their problems the hardware the hard way
they're looking for shortcut solutions you know know if it's
a little very temporary thing like their you know their
father just died and they're depressed and they need a
couple of months of medications to kind of hold them
over that and that's okay but if they've been on
psych meds for for quite a while then that's a
huge red flag another red flag is long-distance relationships be
careful about this one I'll shoot a whole video on
this in the future but what I'll say about it
now is that if you're in a long-term long-distance relationship
and the person is unwilling to move near you or
you're unwilling to move near them and you're you have
a plan for closing that gap then that tells you
that there's a huge problem somewhere in there both of
you are insecure on some level because otherwise you'd go
date people that are closer to you both of you
are probably needy maybe both of you don't want to
invest energy to this relationship or maybe one of you
doesn't like maybe you want to move closer to him
or to her but she doesn't want you to well
that's a huge red flag long-term long-distance relationships do not
work they don't last so if you're gonna have a
long-distance relationship for six months because you two are separated
because your guy or girl had to go and you
know work overseas for a short period of time for
the company's sake okay that's fine because there's a plan
that six months later you're going to close that gap
but if there's no plan and you're doing this long-term
indefinite relationship thing that's a huge red flag and lastly
if the person tells you I want to continue seeing
other people quote seeing other people if they ever tell
you this this is a huge red flag too this
basically tells you that they're not committing to you they
are not really in love with you they are keeping
their options open and they want to not be guilty
about doing it so watch out the for this one
a lot of times guys will do this to girls
so if you're a lady keep your eye open for
it and don't put up with it because you probably
don't want that and you probably deserve better all right
so a pretty long list now at this point you
might wonder okay Leo so my partner isn't perfect do
you expect me to have a perfect partner otherwise I'm
going to be lonely and miserable my whole life what
should I do and the answer is uh it's really
not too much to ask you might be thinking like
well Leo you're asking for too much I mean I
can't just ask for all you mentioned like 40 things
I can't ask all these 40 things of my partner
you know inevitably he's going to check off one or
two of them right or she will and the answer
is you know some of the red flags I mentioned
here are not 100 cent deal breakers a lot of
the bar honestly a lot of them are and it's
not too much to ask that a person can hold
down a job and doesn't cheat and doesn't steal and
is willing to work on you with communication skills and
you know doesn't constantly show up late and stand you
up and isn't narcissistic and power-hungry and cutthroat and business
it's not too much to ask for these things and
at the very least this person I'm not saying that
this person has to be flawless but at the very
least this person has to recognize his or her flaws
and be willing and open to work on them so
if you come to your partner and say hey you
know honey I think it's a real problem that I
feel like you know you're very power-hungry and eventually it's
gonna lead to the destruction of this relationship and the
person says oh [ __ ] you're right I think
I am power-hungry ah I need to fix that I'll
work on fixing it I'll make a plan I'll buy
some books I'll I'll get some coaching I'll watch the
videos whatever if that's the discussion then that's fine you
know the person can work on their their flaws in
the relationship that's good you can grow together but if
what they do is they just they just say no
I'm power-hungry what are you talking about you stupid [
__ ] you know if that's the discussion that's going
on there then that's um that's a huge red flag
the person has to be willing to grow in a
nutshell so what do you do if some of these
red flags are checked well basically you cut this person
out of your life that's the right option cut this
person out of your life and don't think twice about
it your life is too short to piss it away
on dysfunctional relationships that you know are dysfunctional and are
not going to work out it's nerve-racking it's apps your
happiness and energy it might lead to some really nasty
things in the future like abuse ah you losing a
lot of your money all sorts of bad stuff like
you don't even want to go there the fact that
you would even consider the possibility of leaving yourself open
to some of these really nasty consequences already tells you
that there's some deeper issues within you that you need
to work out insecurities perhaps low self-esteem a lot of
times low self-esteem is a real big cause of of
staying in toxic relationships but I think the biggest reason
that people are afraid to cut their partner out of
the relationship and just to flat out leave is because
they lack options with the opposite sex so this means
you create more options you'd have a reasonable chance to
land a new guy or a new girl otherwise you're
going to get very clingy and insecure in any relationship
that you're in if you feel like if you leave
this relationship and then you're never going to ever be
able to meet a new guy or a new girl
or it's going to take you another 10 years or
anybody that you find is going to be even worse
than this person that you're already with if you have
any of those kinds of thoughts then that tells you
that you lack sexual options you need to be meeting
more men or more women whatever is right with you
and you need to commit to creating more of those
options this is not an accident you can actually take
control of how many men and women you meet per
month in your life and the more of them you
meet then the less clingy and insecure you're going to
feel and less need you're going to have to stay
in this dysfunctional relationship people who stay dysfunctional relationships they
stay there because they feel like there's no other alternative
that they're never going to find something better so what
I want to do here now is I want to
wrap up with an exercise for you I'm going to
give you four sentence completions stems that will help you
to be more conscious and aware about what's really going
on here in your relationship right so take out a
piece of paper and a pen and write these down
and you're going to do is after you write each
one of them down is you're going to generate 10
answers for each one of these sentence completion stems so
here's the first one it goes like this if I
were totally honest my partners red flags are blank if
I were totally honest my partner's red flags are blank
then you fill in the blank and what you need
to do is generate ten answers from the top of
your mind without over analyzing them so literally they should
take you two minutes maximum you just ask the question
and then whatever pops into your mind immediately you write
that down without analyzing it or filtering it this exercise
helps to get wisdom out of your subconscious mind all
right don't be too calculating about what your answers are
just write them down is kind of like a mental
dump alright so going to do that then write down
this next step it goes like this the biggest thing
I fear about leaving my partner is blank the biggest
thing I fear about leaving my partner is blank and
again you're going to generate ten answers real quickly without
filtering yourself whatever pops into your mind so you read
the stem and then you write down the answer you
read the stem again you write down the second answer
and so on and so forth the third stem is
as follows if I took 100% responsibility for my relationship
I would blank if I took 100% for my responsibility
for my relationship I would blank okay and again you're
going to generate ten answers real quickly without over analyzing
and then the final stem is the following twenty ways
that I could create more sexual options are blank 20
ways that I could create more sexual options are blank
and for this one instead of 10 you're gonna generate
20 answers so really sit on this one you can
sit for a little bit longer you can actually brainstorm
and really think deep about ways that you could improve
your attractiveness to to the opposite sex or to the
same-sex if you're into the same section or whatever I
don't care how could you increase your attractiveness how could
you increase your exposure so that you're meeting more people
how could you be dating more whatever that takes right
down 20 ideas they can be little ideas they can
be huge ideas maybe moving to another city that might
be one idea maybe getting a new haircut new idea
uh maybe losing 20 pounds new idea maybe going to
AA to a networking event once a month new idea
you know come up with 20 of those and then
sit back look at all your answers reflect on them
all think about all these red flags be very self
honest here don't lie to yourself about what your partner's
weaknesses are you know your partner your deepest intuition knows
if this relationship really has legs if it really has
a chance all that I did here is I kind
of helped put you in touch with that all right
so act on it don't deflect it don't sweep it
under the rug if you've got a toxic dysfunctional relationship
fix it now and you know what your first step
doesn't have to be to go cut this person out
of your life the first step honestly should be to
go talk to this person about it and see if
they're receptive to fixing the problem are they willing to
work on communication skills are they willing to work on
relationship skills with you those are two key things right
there if they're not willing to do those things then
that's when you cut but if they're honestly willing to
change then you can give them that chance and see
if they're going to change all right that's it I'm
