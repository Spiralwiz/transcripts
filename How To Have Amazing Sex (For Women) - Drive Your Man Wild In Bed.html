hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm really excited to be talking about how to
have amazing sex as a woman so obviously this version
here is for the ladies all right ladies from the
guys perspective in this video you're gonna find out what
it's like to have amazing amazing amazing sex and what
this is gonna do for you in your relationship is
that basically it's gonna allow you to own your man's
heart if you want a really strong relationship then one
of the best ways to get into a man's heart
is through his pants because we're extremely dirty sexual men
and we want a girl who understands this so the
mindsets and principles and practical techniques that you learn in
this video are gonna put you in the top 1%
if not higher of all women on earth who know
how to have sex so you're gonna be the best
of the best if you practice what I tell you
here this kind of stuff I see very few girls
knowing how to do and this is gonna put you
in a whole new category whole new class so when
a man meets you he's gonna want to keep you
are you having trouble having sex with a man and
then he doesn't call you back well one of the
reasons is because you don't give him amazing sex and
amazing sex is a rare commodity these days so why
don't we get you up to speed now as a
caveat of course these are my own perspectives and opinions
other people might have different opinions and some men might
not like everything I'm telling you in this video so
you're gonna have to go through and practice play around
with it experiment and see what works and use the
stuff that works and said it doesn't work don't use
it but what I'll tell you is that I'm willing
to bet that 80% of men maybe even 90% of
men that you use this on will absolutely fall in
love with you and then those other 10% well they
want something else and you'll have to figure that out
so what is your job in the bedroom I have
a video that's actually similar to this one but it's
for men tells men how to have amazing sex and
there I say that actually it's mostly the man's responsibility
to produce amazing sex in the bedroom because he's the
one who's leading and he's known who's dominating and so
therefore it's his job to lead in to dominate and
therefore he's responsible for like 90% of what goes on
in the bedroom but nevertheless there's that 10 or 20%
that you as the woman are responsible for and what
exactly is this to me it's being feminine being girly
being dirty and surrendering in the bedroom this is what
your domain is in the bedroom and by the way
if you haven't guessed this already we're kind of talking
about the this as a dynamic where he's the masculine
one you're the feminine one now some people some women
are more masculine than some men so you know like
I said there's outliers here but we're generally assuming that
you're the feminine or in the relationship he's the masculine
one if that's the case this is gonna all work
really nicely so that's our assumption so your job is
that and also your job is to play up his
masculinity see amazing sex comes from this polarization that happens
he's acting very masculine you're acting very feminine and there's
like this charged this energy in the air that happens
this excitement this is what makes the most exciting type
of sex the most passionate kind of sex so that's
generally what you're gonna be doing if you just use
those principles right there already you can start coming up
with little techniques and tricks in your own mind for
how to play up your femininity how to play up
his masculinity and that already is basically gonna be the
source from which all of those techniques that I give
you going forward here are going to come from but
before we get into those techniques let's just start with
the basic foundation the basic foundation begins even outside the
bedroom and really as the woman for you it begins
with good nutrition and exercise and the gym this point
right here is perhaps the most important point of the
whole video if you only do one thing from this
entire video that will please your man the most it's
this right here good nutrition and exercise especially these days
this is so rare and a girl many girls I
say over 50% of girls these days are overweight they
eat horrible food they have no respect for their body
and they have no sense of proper nutrition and they
don't go and they don't exercise and basically they just
kind of coast on their good looks or on their
youth and if this is the case then basically as
the man well if you have a quality man he's
looking out for his body too and if we're gonna
looking out for our body we want you to be
looking out for your body quality man is gonna want
this because if you're coasting on your good looks right
now that's not gonna last forever and as men we're
sensitive to this kind of stuff so for example if
men are leaving you if men are having sex with
you but then aren't staying in a relationship with you
it's because they can see that you're not taking care
of yourself or you're not meeting some other long-term objectives
that they have men are just totally focused on sex
we also care about the long-term potential of the relationship
and because we do care about sex so much we
want that quality sex to last for decades right so
if you just do one thing take care of your
nutrition and go to the gym that right there will
turn your man on the most and if you don't
even do anything else but that and you just keep
your body in good shape that already will endear you
to your man's heart a lot of women have difficulty
with this and they think that well I shouldn't have
to be a certain way to please the man don't
think of it that way think of it as you're
improving your own health and your own nutrition and then
it's spilling over and you're also satisfying the man right
we got to be real here men are extremely visual
creatures we just are this is how we're wired we
can't help it so when we see a fit beautiful
hot woman we want her there's not even like a
question in our mind it is instant we just want
her so make sure that's you and not somebody else
also make sure that you're dressing sexy as a woman
this is one of the advantages that you have is
that you can take a lot of time to dress
nice and men appreciate a well-dressed woman what this means
basically I'm not gonna go into the details of this
because I'm no expert on dressing you'll figure that out
but just the key fundamental points are make sure you're
dressing in Nice stylish clothing so new stuff not stuff
back from college days or from high school with holes
and tatters in it and also make sure that you've
developed some sort of sense of style what's your style
whatever it is for you something that matches your body
type and that matches your personality right just get those
two things down and the last point of this basic
foundation is hygiene make sure you're cleaning everywhere make sure
your body smells nice make sure you shave and make
sure you wax well there's nothing worse than an otherwise
beautiful girl who doesn't take care of her body it's
like a waste and make sure that you take care
of everything downstairs so that you smell nice downstairs so
that you're shaven or you're waxed or you have a
landing strip or whatever but make sure that it's nice
and pruned so you don't have some giant Bush down
there or some weird fishy smell down there because nothing
turns off a man more than that and that should
be pretty easy to take care of so that's the
foundation now one other point that I want to make
kind of about the foundation that was kind of the
external foundation here's a point about the internal foundation your
psychology the psychology for good sex means that you can't
be neurotic and anxious if you're having neuroses and anxiety
you're not going to be able to have good sex
so there's three things that you really need to fix
in your psychology these are kind of like big obstacles
to having great sex one is prudishness two is the
inability to let go in the bedroom and three is
the inability to be present and in the moment so
let's briefly talk about each one of these prudishness this
means that you have hang-ups about sex you're afraid to
be dirty you're afraid to to look at yourself in
the mirror or you don't want to look at him
or you've got some sort of religious background or your
parents were very conservative and they taught you that if
you're going to have sex and you're a [ __
] and select as evil and all this kind of
stuff so I'm not gonna go into too much detail
about that here but basically you need to cut out
all this prudishness cut it out right we don't need
to pretend here we're adults it's okay sex is what
the most amazing aspects of life there's nothing dirty about
it there's nothing evil or sinful about it if you
do sex responsibly so the prudishness it's not necessary in
fact it's holding you back from some of the greatest
experiences in life and it's holding you back from that
intimate connection that you really want with your man the
more dirty things you share with him the deeper your
connection goes because honestly who else you're going to share
this dirty stuff with only your intimate partner nobody else
so this is like the unique bond that you developed
between you and your man the next point is the
inability to let go you need to be able to
surrender in the bedroom this is the woman's role in
the bedroom to surrender this means you need to be
able to get outside your head forget about your fears
and your stresses from everyday life forget about the kids
forget about the problems at work or whatever and be
able to let go to surrender to the man so
that he can dominate you this is the dynamic in
the bedroom so anything that's preventing you from doing this
make sure you get that out of the way and
also this is the next point but it's really similar
very closely related is the inability to be present and
in the moment great sex from comes comes from being
in the flow totally present not inside your head right
not distracted by other things if you're not able to
be present you might have difficulty even orgasming which some
girls have difficulty with so make sure you have fixed
this basic basic basic stuff I'm not even gonna touch
on it here maybe I'll have some other videos that
will help you with diagnosing and solving each one of
these problems but this is really outside the scope of
this video what I want to do next though is
I want to get you some of these techniques the
hot sexy stuff so the first point is study how
to give amazing [ __ ] now this is also
kind of outside the scope of this video I'm not
going to tell you how to have a maze give
an amazing [ __ ] I think you could figure
that out go watch a tutorial video go read up
on it buy a book at a bookstore or talk
to your girlfriend's about it or buy a information product
I don't I don't care how you do it but
figure out how to give amazing [ __ ] most
women do not know how to give an amazing [
__ ] in fact they give painful [ __ ]
don't let that be you and the way that you
learn how to give an amazing [ __ ] is
basically through experience and iteration so one thing you can
do is you can give a [ __ ] then
ask the man what he liked about it or didn't
like about it and have him be specific so that
he's not just giving you sweet little words of affirmation
but actually you ask him hey baby did you like
that or do you like this be specific and actually
get the technique down right get the technique down because
this is one of the gifts that you can give
as a woman to your man is giving him an
amazing [ __ ] and I find that few women
know how to do this well so when we as
a man when we find a woman who really knows
how to give a great [ __ ] it's she's
definitely a keeper she's a rare one you want that
to be you the next point is being [ __
] I want you to be more [ __ ]
in the bedroom and even outside the bedroom see one
of the problems that men face with women is that
women like to play coy all the time we men
were very sexual and we're usually pretty open about our
sexuality but women it's like they pretend like they're not
sexual a lot of times and also just from the
man's perspective we go through life chasing women initiating the
conversations trying to hit on women all this kind of
stuff and we get rejected a lot right and women
play coy a lot and it's very frustrating for a
man because sometimes our whole story in life is just
like I want sex I go look for sex and
I can't get it because I'm denied and these women
are such hypocrites because we know that behind the scenes
these women are having tons of sex but they're pretending
like they're not so this whole coy facade break that
down for your man I'm not telling you to literally
be a [ __ ] and sleep around with everybody
what I'm saying is with your man be extra [
__ ] that means want it all want his dick
want has come want to be tied up want to
have spanking want anal want to have sex outdoors want
to do a threesome wanna watch porn with your man
want to play with toys like there's so much room
to explore in in human sexuality there's so much stuff
you can try and do some of it's very tame
some of its really far out there now everyone has
their own comfort zone I'm not gonna tell you where
your comfort zone lies but basically you should be pushing
your sexual comfort zone be open to new things and
like show this to your man show it to your
man that you're open with sex and that you're kind
of a dirty girl but for him right we don't
want you to sleep it around behind our backs but
it's like for us we want you to be extra
dirt so don't play coy with your man and you
know sometimes just like a very simple way that this
can happen is you're just let's say driving in the
car now this is an example that I can remember
that really turned me on is a girl I was
with we were during the day we were driving to
Ikea or some place just in the middle of daylight
afternoon and I'm driving and what she does is she
just kind of playfully takes her her fingers and she
puts them on my knee and then she just kind
of like walks them up my knee like this towards
my crotch just like slowly and she has this little
cheeky smile on her face and she was kind of
like insinuating she's gonna unzip my pants but she didn't
really but like that right there that was that was
enough right like that's a rare thing that most girls
won't do because she was actually like putting herself out
there she was acting a little bit [ __ ]
but like it was it was awesome this is exactly
what we want as men as we want a girl
to be this way the next point that I'm gonna
make and this is gonna be a really big point
this is kind of like a whole theme so you
can remember this theme the theme of being feisty and
active in general women are too passive in the bedroom
we want you to be more active and more feisty
so I've already started talking about this right one way
to be feisty I'm gonna give you a whole list
here so if you want you're gonna write them down
and you can come up with your own ways to
be more active and feisty but number one is initiate
sex more initiate sex on the man this is hot
we like this like I said most women play coy
and a lot of women they just won't initiate sex
it's like if the man doesn't go and grab you
and undress you then you it's like you won't even
want sex we don't like that we like you to
like come up and rub yourself on us to grab
our crotch to squeeze our bi like put your hands
on on me that kind of stuff make sure you're
doing that some women are just way too passive and
this is kind of natural because like in the bedroom
your sir and you're playing that more passive role the
man it's like dominating you but don't let it get
out of hand we don't want you to be so
passive that you're like uh a limp fish just laying
there and taking it in the bedroom we want you
to be active surrender in an active way if that
makes any sense use your hands I think your hands
can be used very effectively especially because this is this
can be done very feminine Lee right like gently caress
your man his face his arms his chest his legs
his thighs squeeze him be active in that way that's
like a subtle way that you can be active use
your hands and interesting ways just like I was saying
you know with that girl she had this clever approach
of just kind of walking her fingers along my along
my thigh that was really cool so make sure you're
coming up a little techniques like that the next way
that you can be really feisty and active is with
the vocals vocals turn a man on huge huge huge
huge huge huge if if I just record a woman
moaning from sex on a tape recorder and then I
play it just for a guy who's sitting there working
he's in a totally logical headspace he's probably gonna get
hard and he's probably gonna start like dripping from his
dick so this tells you this turns us on a
lot right play it up - play it up make
sure you're purring make sure you're purring even when you're
outside the bedroom just like when we kiss you or
when we touch you kind of purr and moan give
this little girly noises that you make those are hot
and then of course when he's actually having sex with
you and it's getting really hardcore then make sure you're
screaming out his name and you're screaming out what you
want him to do and all this kind of stuff
this is amazing we want this and as men also
we've got a lot of ego tied in with the
way we have sex so it's almost kind of like
you know if we bring a girl home and we
bang the [ __ ] out of her all night
and she's yelling and screaming our name it's like and
then the next day our neighbors our neighbors like wonder
was having his place like that that meant that dude
is the man he's the man he's got his [
__ ] together like he's awesome right so we have
a bit of ego tied in with sex so give
that to your man all right scream your lungs out
make the neighbors jealous the next point is learn to
grind your hips grinding your hips strippers porn stars are
really good at this go to a strip club and
look at how the stripper uses her hips in this
like sensual belly dancing way you can also watch a
good porn to see how this is done but don't
just lie there in the bed or if you're in
doggy style just stick your ass up in the air
and then do nothing that's lame sex so what I
mean by being feisty is like move your body along
with the guy as he's having sex with you right
learn to drive your hips back and forth side to
side in circles in both directions that's super super super
I can't tell you how hot that is that that
right there can take sex that's like a 5 on
the scale of 5 to 2 1 to 10 sex
like mediocre sex out of 5 and like put it
to a 10 so you can you can double the
quality of a sex just by like grinding your hips
in a really sensual way the next point is dirty
talk and intimate talk I find that women can be
way too passive and shy about talking dirty in the
bedroom dirty talk is huge dirty talk can take your
sex to a whole new level dirty talk plus intimate
talk connected together that can double or triple or quadruple
the quality and intensity of your sex this is kind
of beyond the scope of this video I'll have another
video that talks about how to do more proper dirty
talk but just a couple of quick examples what's an
example of intimate talk intimate talk is talk that builds
a little bond connection between you to intimacy so in
sexual context what that might mean is something like you
come up to your man and say hey baby I
really love you come make love to me something like
that it said kind of sweetly and innocently and it's
bill that bond and connection for women this is naturally
easier than dirty talk I think dirty talks a little
bit harder but you should learn how to do dirty
talk too so what is dirty talk here's an example
hey baby I'm wet come banging my brains out hey
baby I'm wet come bang my brains out something like
that it's more hardcore think of it as like softcore
hardcore right now what you want to do is you
want to mix those two together so you've got that
intimacy and then you've got that dirty animalistic sex combined
together and make sure that you're saying these things to
him outside the bedroom during foreplay and then right when
he's having sex with you in the bedroom right also
when he's having sex with you you should be telling
him where you are in your orgasm so if you're
coming tell him that you're coming if you're about to
come tell him you're about to come if he really
turns you on tell him hey baby you turn me
on or I really like how you do this right
make sure there's like a dialogue don't have silent empty
sex silent blank that blank kind of sex where it's
just dead silence you two are having sex and both
of you are in your minds thinking stuff that's that's
not sex that's like a travesty of sex a lot
of women screw this point up they don't tell us
that they're coming this is a huge mistake than a
lot of women make you need to tell the man
that you're coming and you need to have like a
whole thing you can either turn into a huge deal
because as a man we take our pride in being
able to make you [ __ ] at least if
we're you know experienced in the bedroom and we're sexually
knowledge when we want to have great sex then we
want this so you're having sex and you're getting close
to coming well you should start telling your man that
hey I'm starting to come starting to come and start
to come and then when you actually start coming you
tell him that oh I'm coming I'm coming and you
keep saying it in whatever sexy way you want to
say it so that we know what's going on first
of all this helps us to lead the situation it
helps us to know what to be doing at what
time because we need to be leading but really it
turns us on right when you don't tell a man
that you came you're denying him like a huge important
chunk of this whole sexual experience because in our minds
if you don't tell us we're kind of like so
did you come didn't she come was that not good
enough we start questioning ourselves don't don't do that your
man the next point is lose control of yourself in
the bedroom and you can Telegraph this to your man
in kind of exaggerated ways so lose control of all
the different parts of your body lose control of your
hips start kind of moving them and flailing them around
lose control of your butt lose control of your legs
get weak in the knees throw your head back as
though you're having this like orgasmic moment I remember actually
that same girl that I'm talking about that was in
the car um another coolest thing that she did is
when I was kissing her neck she got so so
so turned on by didn't she kind of like played
it up and kind of exaggerated so when I started
kissing her neck she started like moaning and throwing her
head back and just like you can tell if she's
getting turned on she's going into heat and that's the
hottest thing for guys when we see a girl going
into heat this is like one of the best metaphors
right here so think of yourself as the Cat Academy
in heat like in heat who needs to rub her
wet dripping [ __ ] on her man like that
should be you in the bedroom and everything that comes
along with that with that kind of metaphor right losing
control of yourself you're surrendering that makes the man want
to dominate so so hot some porn stars are really
really good at this so you might want to check
out some porn and find a couple of porn stars
that are really good at playing up this cat and
heat metaphor the next thing you should be doing is
asking and begging for your man's come the [ __
] is like the most important part of the sex
for the man right blowing our load so you should
be asking for it if you're my girl I want
to hear you saying that you want my [ __
] inside you on your face on your chest on
your mouth in your mouth everywhere and anywhere right this
is we want to make you dirty right so get
comfortable with being dirty and want the man's come this
is so sexy there's a really big difference between a
girl who's kind of like do you have to come
on my face or like uh well aren't you just
like come over there somewhere like there's that kind of
girl or the kind of girl that just doesn't even
talk out she just kind of ignores it and wherever
the man does it she she's just kinda like oh
okay whatever and then the kind of girl who's like
a [ __ ] fiend like she lives on come
you need to think of come as though it's like
your lifeline right like if you don't get to come
then you're gonna die that's how I want you to
behave in the bedroom so make sure you're enthusiastic and
excited about me coming your man coming that's so important
I think it should go without saying but I think
it does need to be said because I've seen some
girls botch this part is that your man needs to
come when he's having sex with you I hope you
understand this right but if you two are having sex
and your man does not blow his load you don't
see him blowing his load that means he did not
blow his load it's pretty obvious with men we can't
hide it as well as you can women so if
this is not happening make no mistake your man is
extremely extremely extremely frustrated some women can have sex and
not orgasm and still be satisfied that is not the
case with men our biology is different if we're having
sex and we don't come and we cannot come for
all sorts of reasons for example condoms sometimes it can
be really hard to come with it can be hard
to come because if we're with a hot girl and
we have anxiety about our size or about getting hard
or about performing well or impressing you or whatever we
can you know have difficulty have difficulty coming sometimes we
try to make you come so much that we kind
of hold back our own orgasm and then that makes
it difficult for us to finally blow our load so
there's all these different aspects to why a man might
not be blowing his load you need to be aware
of this and you need to monitor this so that
if he's having sex with you and he's giving you
all the pleasure but then he's having difficulty coming then
you need to be patient with him and get him
to come by the end of the night so whatever
maybe you tell him hey baby let's just take a
couple of minutes of a break and we'll get back
into it and then actually get back into it or
if he's having difficulty getting hard or maybe the condom
for example is a problem I know that condom is
a real problem for me sometimes then what you do
is you say hey baby let me just give you
a [ __ ] you give him a [ __
] take off the condom give him a [ __
] and make sure he comes or give him a
[ __ ] actually with men it's kind of easy
so if for some reason he's having difficulty coming while
he's having sex with you then just give a [
__ ] or a [ __ ] and make sure
it happens right this is so important because if it
doesn't happen he's gonna get like blue balls he's gonna
be very frustrated he's not gonna have that release right
the man needs that release it's so important so all
of these things that I just said this whole list
of stuff this is all under the umbrella category of
being more feisty and active can you see how this
works so I want you to take this principle I
want you to brainstorm other ways that you can be
more feisty and more active that I haven't even thought
about here right you're the woman so you should you'll
know this stuff when you get in there and start
trying it out and experimenting so all the above go
ahead and try it out I'm almost confident than 95%
of guys will love that stuff just absolutely love it
because it's pretty rare to find a girl who can
do all of that pretty rare last points I want
to make point number one is that be ready for
multiple orgasms if you're having sex with a quality man
who really knows what he's doing in the bedroom he's
gonna want to give you multiple orgasms and sometimes what
I see is some girls they just get kind of
tired or whatever they feel like oh I got one
might want an orgasm and I'm good no you can
come a dozen times in the bedroom when I'm with
a girl I expect her to want me to make
her [ __ ] a dozen times right so be
ready for that multiple orgasms second point is want to
squirt squirting is super hot if you were the quality
man he's gonna want to make you squirt some women
are a little shy about it insecure about it but
actually I have a whole video how to make a
girl squirt which talks about that so I won't go
into detail here that teaches a man how to make
a girl squirt but if you have some sort of
prudishness issues about squirting you haven't done about it you
know done it before or you haven't even studied what
squirting is go ahead and read up on it get
a book on it or whatever watch a video on
it and want it with your man squirting is like
one of the peak experiences within sex that you two
could have it can build a huge intimate bond plus
it's super dirty and and sexy so want that I
love it when a girl like is asking me to
make her squirt when she's excited about it that's super
turn-on for me the next point is show gratitude and
respect to your man you women you're a lot about
love you like to be showered with praise and positive
emotions and love us men we're a little bit less
about love and we're a bit more about respect because
we have big egos this is how we're different than
you so a little gratitude and respect goes a long
way especially if the man is leading a lot in
the relationship and he's doing all this stuff and he's
doing all the driving and he's he's doing some shopping
and he's having sex with you in the bedroom and
he's like putting all this stuff together you know we
go to a lot of effort to plan stuff out
for you to be the leader in the relationship it's
nice when we can see gratitude that you're grateful for
that that you appreciate that and also some respect that
you pay to your man because you know hanging sex
with the girl is hard and tiring work like usually
by the end of the of the night we're just
like we're sweating we're tired we're exhausting we're barely breathing
that's how hard we were working so just like a
very simple example of how you might show respect your
man is if your man just did a amazing job
having sex with you all night and he's just totally
exhausted sweating profusely maybe what you want to do is
you want to just get up out of the bed
go get him a glass of water or go get
him a towel to wipe himself off just like a
little gesture like that right it's just about that clay
that little sense of nurturing that little feminine touch that
sense of I respect you I can see that you
know you're working hard for this relationship that's a beautiful
thing and the last thing I'm gonna say is that
some of you women will be watching this video and
you'll be thinking leo this all sounds amazing but you're
asking me to do all the suggest me to work
so hard to be this perfect girl for this man
and you might say there's two problems with this number
one is that it's not authentically me this is not
who I am I'm not this kind of girl number
two is that even if I was that kind of
girl why the hell should I work so hard for
this dead meat deadbeat man that I have I have
this man who doesn't even make me [ __ ]
once in the bedroom he doesn't even care about making
me come leo you're talking about this awesome man who's
gonna bang my brains out and and want to make
me squirt in all this stuff and give me multiple
orgasms but where do I find such a man and
you're right these men can be rare but here's the
thing you are putting this in the context of personal
development right remember this is all personal development I don't
see this as just a fun sex video this is
to me it's personal development personal development is living up
to your full potential self-actualization how do you self actualize
well in one way is by mastering the sexuality by
taking yourself to the highest potential within sexuality that's what
this video is ultimately about so you're not doing this
just for the man you're doing it for you first
and foremost see it that way see it as expanding
yourself expanding your sexuality experimenting growing and it really is
that way this is not a some hokey notion also
if you have a man who's kind of a deadbeat
man in the bedroom who can't give you orgasms or
isn't just isn't passionate about this stuff isn't trying to
be a connoisseur in the bedroom well I agree with
you there are a lot of men who are not
good at sex and don't really care about mastering sex
and that's something that I'm personally passionate about changing right
I shoot videos for men on how to have sex
and I want to convince them that squirting is amazing
giving multiple orgasms is amazing I'll teach them a lot
of amazing techniques and what I find is that men
are receptive to this stuff right it's just it takes
them a while to to get up to speed and
sometimes they feel like well if I need to be
told how to have sex it's kind of like you
know their egos in it and so they don't want
to be told they feel like they already know how
to have sex so then you need to humble themselves
a bit before they actually learn so let me work
on the men for you and I'll try to create
more men that are more responsible in the bedroom and
give you orgasms all that stuff as far as what
you're gonna do though you're gonna think about it like
this you're growing yourself into the ideal sexual girl you're
opening up your sexuality if your current man isn't accepting
of that that's okay you're still gonna grow don't hold
yourself back on his account what's gonna happen is that
either a couple things are gonna happen one is that
he's gonna see that you're growing sexually that you're putting
so much energy and attention into being more sexual that
he's gonna get the message in his mind is gonna
be like oh maybe I should learn how to have
better sex too and then you two can actually do
it together and that could be like a growth experience
that can be really fun so you just might have
you might be the leader in this way and get
him to get more involved with quality sex of course
some men they won't do it they just don't want
to change they're stuck in their ways in which case
you still want to grow because even if you're frustrated
now you know what this man you're with chances are
you probably won't be with him for long especially if
he's bad in the bedroom so the next man you're
gonna be with well you want to prepare for him
the chance that you're gonna stay with your man for
the rest of your life those are pretty small chances
chances are you gonna have many more men in your
future and that's okay and what you want to do
is you want to develop yourself higher so that the
next man that you find is also going to be
on a higher level when you become a connoisseur of
sex when you master sex you're going to be on
the lookout and you're gonna attract other men who Matt
who have mastered sex to when you have not mastered
sex then you're gonna attract men who have not mastered
sex so I think it's really important that you take
this seriously that you you study it buy some books
don't be shy about it watch some videos don't be
shy about it buy toys buy porn research this stuff
study this stuff you can buy even information products on
this stuff you can even go take a seminar a
whole weekend workshop on this stuff right so it's just
all about seeing why this is important seeing that it's
not just about sex it's really about taking yourself to
a higher level put this in the context of your
personal development all right well that was a lot of
information a lot of techniques and they're very practical stuff
that you can go implement right now today what I
recommend you do is you implement one thing at a
time and experiment and just see how your guy reacts
to it what you're gonna probably find is that he's
gonna react really really well and then over time over
the course of six months or let's say 12 months
you should envision yourself becoming this sexual goddess right and
it doesn't take a lot of sex to become a
sexual goddess the problem is that most people they have
sex but they're not learning anything in between and therefore
they have sex in a more improve what you want
to do you want to have sex then the next
day go read a book about sex then the next
day have more sex now you're improving applying the stuff
you read in the book then the next day maybe
watch a video then have some more sex again you're
improving and work on little aspects right get the [
__ ] down improve grinding your hips improve moaning and
screaming improve your dirty talk and prove squirting and all
this stuff you can improve every single one of these
areas and by the end of like 12 months if
you do this actively you're gonna be at a whole
new level and the kind of men that you'll be
able to attract and keep it's gonna really really change

is through his pants all right this is Leo I'm
