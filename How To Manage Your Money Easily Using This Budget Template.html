Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this video,
I'm showing you how to manage your money by creating
a budget. So let's help you to manage your personal
finances. That's what I want to accomplish with this video.
And it's going to be short and snappy and right
to the point, I really have one tool that I've
used in my own life, ever since I became financially
independent, really went off on my own after college and
started earning a living. And I've been doing that to
this day. So when I was making that transition from
not taking any more money from my parents, or my
family, and just going on, on my own, and always
having to worry about making ends meet. One of the
things that keep that kept me sane, through that time
and gave me a certain peace of mind and confidence
about my own personal finances was having this budget. And
what I'm gonna do in this video is I'm gonna
introduce and I'm going to give you a downloadable budget
worksheet for Microsoft Excel that you can download. And you
can use this and I want you to use this
to customize it, and then have your own personal budget.
And you can use this tool literally for the rest
of your life, just the way that I've been using
it for the last 10 years or so. And I
anticipate that I'll be using it till the rest of
my life because it's such an important tool. These days,
I see people having a lot of issues with money.
And it's not necessarily because they don't have a good
job, or because they're not earning enough, that's a matter
for another video, we'll talk about how to earn more.
But here, I just want to focus you in on
how to manage your expenses. And to know and keep
track of the money that you've got in your life,
where it's coming from and where it's going, especially where
it's going. That's the whole point here because this is
all about your expenses. And don't think that this is
going to be some sort of boring topic because actually,
this is not boring at all, what I've found by
using this worksheet, even though I'm not a guy who
likes to crunch numbers, I don't like doing any kind
of accounting stuff. In my own business i, I hate
doing that stuff. But this budget worksheet in my own
personal life has actually given me a sense of excitement,
and something to look forward to in my life. Because
I can use this and I can make kind of
future projections about where I want to be with my
finances. And that's something that I find exciting. So this
worksheet, if you're not a numbers person, don't be afraid
I'm not a numbers person, either, I think you'll find
that you're actually going to like filling this out. And
you're going to like working with it, not just doing
it once but working on it continually throughout your life
polishing it working on your budget, I think that having
a budget is just crucial. Because if you don't know
what is going on with your money, then you're almost
guaranteed to run out of it or lose it. Not
save enough of it basically have money problems. You have
to know what your expenses are. And these have to
be accurate estimates and calculations. They don't need to be
perfect, but they need to be accurate. So within 80%
90% accurate accuracy rating. If you're in the 50% and
below accuracy ratings on your monthly expenses, then you're probably
going to struggle quite a bit. So like I said
before, the reason you want to do this is because
it can give you peace of mind and also confidence.
And something that's even better than all that for me
is that that vision, that vision of where I want
to go with my life, and with my financial position.
And finances, for me are important. Even though it's personal
development. A lot of times people talk about, oh, don't
worry about the money, just follow your passion, and just
be spiritual, be in the present moment, all this kind
of stuff, all that is great. But in the end,
you want to have your finances really locked down and
handled. So you've got abundant finances to go out there
and one not worry so much. And to so that
you can finance the things that you want to be
doing in your life because living a powerful, extraordinary life
does take money, it takes resources, this stuff doesn't happen
on the cheap. So you want to keep an eye
on that all the time. In this worksheet, which I'm
gonna have a link that you can go down below
the video click on this link and download this worksheet
for Excel. I want you to download it and we're
going to do is you're going to see several columns
there. One column is going to have the current monthly
expenses that you're going to be estimating for your current
lifestyle. So just picture the current lifestyle you're living your
house, your the insurance that you've got, how much money
you're spending on entertainment, and on shopping and on food
and on groceries on electronics, on magazine, subscriptions, on cable
on electricity, all that kind of stuff. Think about all
those potential expenses that you've got, you're gonna list them
all in this one column. That's your current lifestyle. But
what's really cool is I have a second column here,
which is your ideal lifestyle. So if you're like most
people than what you currently have, the lifestyle is probably
not what you would hope to have in your dream
life. I think it's important to not only take a
look at your current reality, which for some of you
might be good, for some of you might be kind
of grim. But also take a look at where you
want to be. This is the component that gives you
that vision that you're gonna be shooting for. So there,
you're gonna fill out well, if I was living my
dream life, what kind of house or apartment would I
be living in? How much would that cost me per
month? And what kind of health insurance would I have?
And how much money would I be spending on fine
dining and my groceries? How would that affect how much
money I'm spending on entertainment, on dates, on the kind
of stuff and furniture I buy for my house, the
kind of electronics I own, the kind of traveling I
do, what kind of hotels I stay in, all this
kind of stuff. So you've got both those columns. And
then you've got one more column that just explains the
different expense categories that I have. And I have quite
a bit. So what I did in this budget is
I went through and of course, I looked at my
own budget, and I literally use this exact worksheet for
myself. And I've been doing this for for many, many
years, it's worked really well for me. But what I've
also done is I've actually expanded it out and added
more categories. Because all of us have different things in
our lives that we spend money on. And what's important
with this worksheet is that you go in there and
you start customizing it. I've given you the basics. So
rent, how much money you're paying for your car, and
groceries and food, and household supplies, all that kind of
stuff. You have to get very nitty gritty here and
get very realistic, what are literally all the recurring expenses
that are happening in your life. Everything, even the little
stuff, like in my recurring expenses, I list stuff like
contact lenses, because I wear contact lenses. So I'm spending
money on that every month. And if you have prescriptions
that you're paying for every month, even if it's just
$5 for a prescription at Walmart every month, write that
down, you have magazine subscriptions, are you spending money on
Netflix or Amazon? Do you like to buy books? Do
you have certain hobbies that require money to finance, maybe
you're an artist, and you need to buy new paint
brushes, or new watercolours. Or maybe you're someone who likes
to tinker with electronics, you buy lots of electronic gadgets,
maybe you'd like to decorate your home, so you buy
a lot of home decor type of stuff. So all
of this stuff has to be accounted for even things
like toilet paper, and paper towels, just like very basic
necessities that you're always gonna be spending money on probably
for the rest of your life, you're always gonna need
toilet paper, and you're always gonna need paper towels, you're
always gonna be buying drinking water, and you're always going
to be paying for electricity. So these kinds of things
you want to get all of this stuff accounted for.
And it takes you some time to think about this,
if you haven't thought about it before, it takes you
some time to sit down and ask yourself, Okay, what
are all the different categories of expenses that I have
in my life. So start with the ones I've got,
and if some of them don't apply to you, you
can either delete them or just put zeros as to
how much you're spending all those per month. And then
what's gonna happen is that all of those are gonna
get tallied up and at the bottom, you're gonna get
a number, and that number is going to be your
monthly expense. And also, you're gonna get an A second
number, which is your annual expense, basically, your monthly expense
times 12. That's your annual expense. So that tells you
basically how much you need to be earning per month
and per year in order to break even. So that's
like that magic number. If you're below that number, that
tells you that you got to start to either prune
some of your expenses cut down on them, maybe you're
being way too lavish and extravagant with your expenses. Or
maybe it's just that you have a bad job that's
not paying you enough and and that's another problem that
we're going to work on getting you a better paying
job. But that that magic number is what's really important.
Here's some tips for how to use this worksheets. I
already told you to go through and customize all your
expenses. Also, you're going to be as you're going through
every expense category, you're going to be in your mind
estimating how much does this cost you? Now, when you're
making these estimates, it's important to be realistic. It's more
to be pragmatic, and always prefer to overestimate than to
underestimate. Most of us don't know exactly how much money
we spend on toilet paper per month. We don't know
how much money we spend on the feed the movie
theater. We don't know how much we spend on groceries.
We don't know how much we spend on going out
eating at restaurants. Certain things are pretty easy. It's pretty
easy to average out, for example, your cell phone bill
over the year and you can know how much you're
paying per month for your cell phone bill. It's pretty
easy to know your rent your electricity to stuff you
can average it out. But some of these other things
will bit more difficult, especially stuff like for example, electronics,
because electronic purchases, those tend to be more like one
off type of purchases. So maybe you'll buy a TV
once every couple of years, maybe you'll buy a new
computer once every couple of years, maybe you'll buy an
iPod or some other gadget like that. With those types
of expenses, I still like to treat them as though
their monthly expenses. And what I do is I kind
of average out and I see okay, in a given
year, approximately, how much money do I spend on electronics?
How many TVs do I buy? How many computer keyboards
do I buy? How many stereo systems? How many iPods
how many keyboards, this kind of stuff. And it's a
little bit tricky to make these estimates, you don't exactly
know you have to make an initial guess. And what's
going to happen is that over the months after you
make this initial guess, over the months, and over the
years, you're going to fine tune that or you're going
to hold yourself accountable to it. And you're going to
ask yourself, is this an accurate estimate. And then you
can actually look at the receipts, and you can look
at your bank account statements to to verify that this
is correct. One thing that I don't like to do
with with estimating my expenses is I don't like to
include really big one time purchases. So for example, if
you're going to be remodeling your kitchen, and it's going
to cost you $5,000, you're probably only going to remodel
your kitchen once every five or every 10 years. That's
a pretty rare expense. And it might be very big
expense. So that's something that you wouldn't really want to
turn into a monthly figure. Or if you're gonna go
buy a car with cash, that's also probably not something
you want to turn into a monthly figure. But everything
else try to turn into a monthly figure even if
it's an annual expense. So for example, car registration, I
live here in Las Vegas, and it cost me about
$300 a year to do registration and license on my
car, it's a recurring yearly payment, what I'll do is
I'll break that down, I'll just divide that number by
12. And then I'll put that as a monthly monthly
expense. So try to account for all the details here,
you got to be detail oriented as you do this.
And be realistic. Right. If you think that you're spending
X amount of money on toilet paper, you're actually probably
spending a little bit more than you think. That's what
tends to be the case. That's why sometimes it's hard
to make ends meet. And sometimes you end up with
less money than you think is because your initial estimates
weren't realistic. So what I want you to do is
download this worksheet, go through, fill it all out, take
some time to think about your ideal life, and what
your ideal budget would be. And when you're thinking about
this ideal budget, also be pragmatic and realistic. You don't
want to sit down and say, Well, if I had
an infinite amount of money, then I would live in
a, you know, 15,000 square foot mansion, somewhere in the
Hollywood Hills. And that would cost me let's say $20,000
a month to pay rent on that house. I mean,
ask yourself, do you really need that? Do you really
want that? If you do, okay, put it down, but
have like a pragmatic, ideal budget, not just out of
this world utopian type of ideal budget. Because there isn't
an expense to going out there earning lots of money,
you know, earning money, even if it's easy. If you
put your life together in certain way we're earning money
is easy. Still, you have to like maintain that. And
a lot of people get trapped into this kind of
never ending hamster in a wheel syndrome, where they create
this lavish lifestyle, and then they spend the rest of
their life trying to maintain it. And maintaining even an
extravagant lifestyle, it usually doesn't give you fulfillment and happiness.
So make sure that whatever you're putting into your ideal
budget, then that's worth it to you. And maybe for
you, you'd rather spend a little bit more money on
entertainment and on fine dining or on travel than you
do on your rent. Or you do on your car,
that tends to be actually smart. Because when you're investing
money in things versus experiences, that tends to be a
poor investment. I mean, maybe a fee, like a car
can actually hold that value better than spending money on
a vacation. Actually, as far as your fulfilment goes, spending
money on some nice vacation to some place in the
world that you've never been to. Let's say you want
to go to Southeast Asia for a vacation. That's going
to give you more fulfillment spending, for example, a week
in Southeast Asia, then upgrading your car. Because your car,
you're gonna get used to it. Go into Southeast Asia
there, you're gonna have some interesting experiences. And you'll have
some revelations that will open up your mind you're going
to experience new cultures. So think about that. Think about
where you want to be allocating your money so that
you're getting the most happiness points for the money that
you're spending. So create this budget and then what you're
going to do is you're going to have it and
you're going to continue knew to look at it on
a quarterly basis. You don't need to spend too much
time. But every once in a quarter, take a look
at it at the end of the quarter and see,
how are you doing? How are you measuring up to
this have your expenses changed, sometimes prices rise, other times
certain expenses become irrelevant, sometimes new expenses get added on,
so that your budget is kept up to date. And
finally, and this is the real value here, if you
do this final part of this exercise, you're gonna get
so much value, you're gonna have this ideal budget, but
then you're going to actually spend the next 60 days
collecting every single receipt, and every single purchase that you
make, you're gonna have like a box and collect every
single receipt and put it in there, or track it
electronically, through your bank account, whatever you want to do,
but spend the next 60 days tracking all that stuff,
just collecting receipts, collect all the receipts that at the
end of those 60 days, sit down and actually categorize
all the expenses that you had. use Microsoft Excel or
whatever, categorize everything, so that you know how much you're
spending on clothes. How much did you spend on groceries?
How much did you spend on your cell phone bill,
break that down into categories, and then see what the
actual numbers are. And that's where the real value comes
in is, if you see your actual numbers, and then
you compare them to your hypotheticals that you had on
on this budget that are going to do right now.
And that's going to tell you how close you are,
and how far you are with your estimates. Hopefully, restaurants
are gonna be pretty accurate. If they're not accurate, then
you're gonna retool your estimates so that they actually reflect
what happened in in these 60 days. You don't need
to be doing this all the time. But I find
that doing it at least once this kind of 60
day exercise is going to be good because it keeps
you honest, it keeps you accountable. And it also gets
you have like a sanity check on whether your hypothetical
budget is really real. So once you have this budget,
then you're going to know exactly how much money you
need. Right now, you're also going to know how much
money you need going forward in the future shooting for
your ideal. This will help you to know how you
should be advancing in your career, maybe it'll give you
an indication that need to switch careers, maybe it'll tell
you that you need to start your own business. If
your ideal budget is very ambitious. It might also tell
you that you have some expenses that need cutting, right.
So a lot of people will waste money on credit
card bills, interest rate payments, or maybe you're spending a
lot of time or a lot of money eating out,
maybe you're spending a lot of money on dates, maybe
you're spending a lot of money on liquor. So when
you're actually looking at these numbers in your mind, you
can say oh, wait a minute, I'm spending way too
much on this thing here and this thing here. And
maybe I'm not spending enough on this here and this
there. So all of this is just to fine tune
and optimize your budget. And in the end, I don't
like worrying about money. To me money is like just
a necessity that I need to run my life smoothly.
So this budget thing is not about being an account
of your life. It's simply that when you do this
work once a quarter, what that does is that allows
you for the rest of the quarter. Or even if
you want to do it maybe only twice a year
for half a year, it allows you just to be
calm and grounded. Because you know that your money situation
is handled, you don't need to worry about it. And
it doesn't really take that much time, you can probably
fill out this worksheet in an hour right now, spend
the next 60 days collecting receipts that's a pretty easy
procedure, then spend a couple of hours categorizing those receipts
after 60 days. And then just at the end of
the quarter, spend another hour or so reviewing your budget,
and making little fine tuned adjustments. Nowadays, when I look
at my budget actually excites me. Because I have ambitious
goals for where I want to go with my business.
I have ambitious goals where I want to go with
my personal life, I have visions of me traveling to
cool places and eating new types of food and going
on cool dates, and spending money on new gadgets, new
electronics, new books, my own education, that stuff is exciting
to me. And I like looking at my finances and
saying okay, I can actually make this happen. Or if
I'm seeing that, well, I can't make it happen right
now, then that that kind of triggers my mind to
start thinking, okay, what can I do so that I
can make this happen in the next couple of years.
And that's a really exciting way to get your budget
and your finances handled rather than the way that I
see most people doing it, which is like, Oh man,
I don't have enough. And it's always jumping from not
enough, not enough, not enough struggling to pay the bills
and always being short. Like that's not exciting, that's miserable.
Instead what you want with your life is you want
to be comfortable with your money and you want to
have like more and one of the ways to do
that is by making sure that you account for all
your expenses. All right, this is Leo. I'm gonna be
