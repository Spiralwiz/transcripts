            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/f7NTB_Eq2S8' target='_blank'>Personal Development Blueprint - Top 5 Feelings</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Top 5 Feelings Concept Introduction</b>: Leo Gura introduces a revolutionary concept in personal development called the 'Top 5 Feelings.' This concept involves identifying the top five emotions we wish to experience consistently in our daily lives and then aligning our environments to foster those feelings. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Identifying Desired Feelings</b>: According to Leo, the prevalent culture of goal-setting tends to emphasize material or spiritual achievements rather than emotional fulfillment. This often results in disappointment as the individual achieves their set objective but fails to attain the desired state of fulfillment. Recognizing and focusing on the feelings we desire can prevent such dissatisfaction. 
</li><li><b>Core Desired Feelings and Goal Setting</b>: Leo reiterates the importance of setting goals in alignment with the core feelings we desire. The objective is to experience these desired feelings consistently throughout the day. He encourages viewers to evaluate their existing routines and emotions and then, based on this assessment, identify the feelings they truly wish to experience.
</li><li><b>'Feeling Survey' Introduction</b>: Leo introduces a simple self-analytic exercise named the 'Feeling Survey.' The survey consists of four questions aimed at understanding the important feelings for individuals and their frequency in daily lives. Through this survey, participants can identify positive feelings they want to cultivate and negative feelings they wish to avoid.
</li><li><b>Rating Emotions and Identifying Dissatisfaction</b>: By quantifying emotional experiences through a rating scale, we can comprehend our satisfaction and dissatisfaction levels comprehensively. Regularly rating our stress levels, alongside other emotions, helps to pinpoint areas of discontent in our life. Conversely, rating positive emotions aids in evaluating whether we are indeed experiencing the desired feelings.
</li><li><b>Creating Action Points</b>: To effectively shift our emotional landscape, Leo suggests generating practical changes, termed 'action points,' that would contribute to an increase in positive feelings and a decrease in negative ones. These action points should target each identified positive and negative feeling and operate as emotion-driven goals, differing from other goals created without considering emotional factors.
</li><li><b>Evaluating Fulfillment and Setting Goals</b>: Leo emphasizes the idea of setting goals directly linked to our sense of fulfillment. He encourages juxtaposing the list of identified feelings with the list of set goals to discern alignment. This exercise also helps in realizing if current goals genuinely correspond to the feelings we seek.
</li><li><b>Utilizing the Concept of Top Five Feelings</b>: Leo presents two effective methods to use the concept of top five feelings. The first involves aligning our tangible goals with our desired feelings, and the second involves manipulating our mood by harnessing the power of these desired feelings. The key is to ensure desired feelings are prioritized and factored in when setting goals and making decisions.
</li><li><b>Identification of Desired Feelings</b>: Leo suggests reflecting on the best memories of our lives to understand what feelings we want to regularly experience. This can be achieved by understanding and noting down the emotions we experienced at our happiest times, whether it was due to spending time with family, success at work, or engaging in adventurous activities.
</li><li><b>Feeling Survey Introduction</b>: The video then presents a Feeling Survey, consisting of four questions designed to help us comprehend our emotional needs better. The first question is about pinpointing five feelings we want to consistently experience. The next query focuses on identifying feelings we wish to avoid, drawn from our daily stressors and discomforts.
</li><li><b>Quantifying Positive and Negative Feelings</b>: In the third part of the survey, each identified positive and negative feeling is rated on a scale of one to ten based on consistency of experience. This quantification sheds light on feelings that dominate our lives and areas causing dissatisfaction.
</li><li><b>Creating Practical Changes</b>: The final section of the survey emphasizes the need for practical changes that can promote positive feelings and minimize negative ones. Changes could be based on personal priorities; for Leo, a fulfilling work day and a sense of accomplishment are tied to his sense of pride.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Multitasking and Focus at Work</b>: Leo explains that a hectic day of multitasking and lack of focus results in feeling less accomplished and proud. He encourages allocating time to tasks that cause excitement, such as creative pursuits or leisure activities, to increase the chances of feeling accomplished and fulfilled.
</li><li><b>Understanding Desired Emotion Sources</b>: Instead of multitasking, prioritizing focus brings feelings of accomplishment and fulfillment, so activities that increase focus on tasks can increase pride. For different emotions, such as excitement, activities that offer novelty or breaks from routine, like weekend trips or non-work related activities, can help cultivate this emotion. 
</li><li><b>Identifying Emotional Discomfort Sources</b>: Recognizing what in your schedule or life leads to negative emotions like stress or anger. This helps determine what changes need to be made to decrease these feelings.
</li><li><b>Creating an Action Plan</b>: From one's lists of desired and undesired feelings, extracting a point of action for each one creates a customized plan for eliciting more positive feelings and less negative ones. For personal emotional well-being, this becomes a more effective list of goals than typically generated ones.
</li><li><b>Generating Abstract Goals for Fulfillment</b>: Essentially, these action points or tasks, when carried out, connect directly to feelings of contentment, making them more impactful than traditional, tangible goals. They help to directly increase happiness.
</li><li><b>Incorporating Feelings into Personal Mission Statements</b>: The list of top five feelings becomes a part of the personal mission statement that should be constantly revisited. The feeling-oriented goals must align with what you really want to feel, maximizing fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Forcing Moods</b>: Brendon Burchard's proposed idea of enforcing the mood you want to feel on yourself and the external world. The idea is to target the top five feelings and actively work towards cultivating them on a daily basis.     
</li><li><b>Filtering Goals through Desired Feelings</b>: External goals should be filtered through your personal 'filter of feelings' to ensure they align with the emotions that are important to you. It helps to direct energy towards goals that truly enhance the desired feelings. 
</li><li><b>Sharing and Feedback</b>: Sharing feelings, the consistency of experiencing them, and discussing the exercise with others can be helpful and beneficial to all parties involved.
