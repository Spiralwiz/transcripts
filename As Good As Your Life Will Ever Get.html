hey this is Leo for actualised org and this if
this goes it gets that's the block topic for today
now actually I'm in a pretty gorgeous place right now
with this waterfall behind me so I can't complain it's
pretty nice right here but my point is that this
moment right now for you wherever you're sitting wherever you're
watching this video whatever it is that you're doing this
moment right now it's as good as that ever is
gonna get for you ever in your life this as
good as your life is gonna ever get now is
that true well not entirely right there's a lot of
things you can do to improve your life maybe right
now you're sitting there at your computer you're watching this
and you don't have the career that you want to
have or you don't have the fitness level that you
want to have or you don't have the relationship that
you want to have or whatever is missing in your
life that's something that you think that you're gonna go
out there you're gonna pursue you're gonna treat for yourself
and you can go out and do that and I
encourage you to do that that's what all all that
I'm about that's what this actualize that org is about
but there's another side to this whole equation and that
is that even if you get all that stuff right
now what it feels like to be you right now
is basically as good as your life is gonna get
now this is something that I've been telling myself as
a little affirmation or as a little reminder not to
look too far into the future expecting some sort of
climactic event to happen in my life where I feel
like oh you know I've got everything that I wanted
and now I'm at the top and now I can
just coast you know isn't that it's not kind of
like us that we're pursuing something and we think that
when we get it we're gonna get it and we're
gonna capitalize on it we're just gonna like lock that
lock that thing down and we're gonna sit on it
and we're gonna be happy and our life is gonna
be blissful but how often does that actually work for
you be honest how many times have you gone after
something that you really really really wanted and then in
the end you got it and then it's like what's
next and then what's next and then what's next and
you're always thinking like well I'm not happy right now
but as soon as I get that thing I got
that promotion I'll be happy as soon as I get
$100,000 in my bank account I'll be happy as soon
as I get medical insurance from my employer I'll be
happy as soon as I buy a house I'll be
happy as soon as I invested my 401k I'll be
happy or whatever it is right it doesn't really matter
the fact is that your brain is wired in such
a way that basically what it feels like to be
you right now it's pretty much how it's gonna feel
no matter what whether you win a million dollars whether
you have the best job in the world whether you've
started your own business whatever it is you know whether
you're you've got a six-pack and you're ripped if that's
what you're going for you know you'll think you can
have all those things you can pursue them but in
the end how is it actually gonna feel for you
do a little thought experiment just kind of imagine yourself
already having that thing that you want and just kind
of bask in it and you'll you'll notice that if
you really kind of get into it and do that
visualization that you still kind of feel the way that
you feel now and then that that feeling that you
have right now is is what's really crucial and if
you can get your head around that if you can
figure out how to be happy right now in the
moment that you're in just in your body right now
right without having to have anything extra added on to
it without having to have a career at it onto
it without having to be someplace without having to travel
to some exotic country or whatever if you can't just
be happy by yourself sitting alone in a blank kind
of bare sterile room then you're never gonna be happy
and that is why I pursue self-development is because for
me happiness doesn't come from without it comes from within
so I know that if I'm sitting there in a
room by myself and I'm not happy that tells me
oh I got to work on something in myself rather
than going out there and trying to put an external
solution on it because that external solution is just a
titillation it's a stimulation right it's something that's going to
distract you from ultimately what you're running away from and
what you're running away from is the fact that you
can't really stand to be yourself you can't stand to
be alone by yourself with your experience of of the
now and as long as you're running away from that
you're never gonna be happy because one thing we'll hope
will stave it off for a little bit then the
next thing that you acquire will stave it off but
you can't really keep that up and in the end
everything you acquire is gonna feel unfulfilled it's gonna feel
empty and it's gonna feel shallow and Hollow because you
haven't developed yourself from within to generate your own good
emotions and it's not like you need anything special to
do that you don't need anything add it on in
fact you probably what you need to do is you
need to take some stuff out you probably need to
take out some beliefs that you have etc etc etc
to get down just to the fact that you can
be satisfied just being yourself right now in the moment
in silence being calm just the way I am right
now and it's basically like a form of meditation right
that's why meditation is so hard do it do it
right now after you watch this video sit down for
twenty minutes and just sit in your room eyes open
without any distractions just in peace and quiet and see
if you can just if your body can and your
mind can tolerate that or are you gonna start to
feel antsy are you gonna start to feel Restless are
you gonna have to deal with with different thoughts that
are waging war on your mind if you can't just
be happy right now what makes you think you're gonna
be happy when you get something that you're that you're
thirsting after right now you know like a career better
career or you get your fitness in shape or whatever
else so this is something I like to tell myself
when I'm pursuing some sort of goal that I have
because I am very goal-driven and I have goals that
I am pursuing in my life and I do believe
that my life will improve so there's there's kind of
a paradox here it's on the one hand your life
is perfect as it is right now I gotta get
any better on the other hand you can make some
drastic changes to make it much much more improved right
how do you reconcile that well the way I reconcile
it is this is that I do pursue goals and
I do add some to my life that creates this
ecosystem where I can feel good about myself I can
go out and I can do traveling if that's what
I want to do where I have enough money to
buy this stuff I want to buy and I have
the comforts that I want to have but ultimately that
stuff is it's like the dressing right it's not the
meat and potatoes the meat potatoes is working on yourself
and just being able to be comfortable in the moment
right just being able to be comfortable in the moment
whatever it takes for you to do that and that
can be an involved process it's not something that you
change overnight this is something you develop meditation is a
great habit to take up to start to get you
comfortable just being in the moment without a lot of
titillation and stimulus from the environment because one of most
people do most people distract themselves with friends TV news
events that are going on shopping partying drugs food alcohol
all these things are ways to distract you and to
titillate you but all of them are also shallow and
if you've engaged in one of those to an extreme
you know that you can go out and party all
you want you can go drink all you want you
go eat all you want and that will give you
a temporary like a temporary good feeling but it's not
gonna be a solid sustainable good feeling so it's not
gonna lead to lasting happiness laughing happiness comes comes from
someplace deeper within yourself so whenever I'm pursuing a goal
and I pursue my goals very vigorously and I have
a lot of them so when I am pursuing them
sometimes it's good to just pause and I will tell
myself I'll just kind of pause and I'll say you
know what it's not gonna get any better than it
is right now and sure I'll get that goal I
know I'll get that goal if I work towards it
but like the inner experience the satisfaction that I'm feeling
it's just kind of when I say that it's not
gonna get any better than it is right now it
kind of brings me back he grounds me in the
fact that the moment is really the most important thing
and enjoying the moment and sometimes I'll have this tendency
where I'm thirsting after a goal I'm working towards it
and I work too hard and I tend to to
be so focused on the goal that I that I
produced track of the journey right it's that old saw
about life is a journey rather than a destination but
how many times do we forget that and we focus
on the destination so much that the journey becomes painful
the journey becomes a grind and so in those moments
when you start to feel down on yourself we start
to feel like stuffs not clicking for you not working
you know it's that's that's a good time to step
back and just say it's not gonna get any better
than it is right now so I can still pursue
my goals I can still do the stuff I want
to do but I can also pace it you know
stretch it out a little bit more give myself some
more time take the pressure off of myself so that
I can also enjoy the process because the fact is
that you might die tomorrow and if all you're doing
is you have your head to the grindstone and you're
always grinding away you're always driving away and you're always
working whatever it is that you're working towards if you're
always doing that you're gonna be resentful of the fact
that you're not taking in all the beauty that's around
you in the present moment and you don't need to
be out by a waterfall to have Beauty really I'm
out here but it's actually a good example is that
you don't need this to feel good about yourself you
should be able to feel everything that you can feel
here you should be able to feel that sitting in
a bare empty room all right so that's it for
this video on being in the moments and that this
is as good as it's gonna get for you it's
not getting any better you
