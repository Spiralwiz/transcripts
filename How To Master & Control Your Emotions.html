Hey, this is Leo for Actualized.org and in this video
what I want to talk about is how you create
every single one of your emotions. "There is nothing good
or bad, but thinking makes it so." Have you heard
that quote before? That's a quote from William Shakespeare, his
play, 'Hamlet'. Hamlet says this famous line. Now what does
this have to do with anything? What does this have
to do with creating your own emotions There's a very
fundamental idea in personal development, that I want you to
start to buy into and This is the point of
this videos to help you buy into it. This is
a very powerful paradigm to live from and it's the
opposite paradigm of the way that most people live. Because
most people think that the emotions that they experience the
way that they feel, their mood, their feelings, that this
is dictated by External circumstances. so Somebody says something to
you something bad happens to you something good happens to
you You get a promotion [you] get fired you earn
some money. You lose some money You create a successful
business or your business goes bankrupt, or you have a
good relationship, or you have a bad relationship That all
of this stuff is creating the emotions that you feel
right? Somebody pays you a compliment. You're feeling good, feel
very positive Something good's happening in your life. You're feeling
excited right something exciting is happening. You got a trip
coming up now, soon. You're excited. And the flip side
of that is that if negative stuff is happening to
you Then you feel down, you feel sad, you feel
angry, you feel frustrated, you feel stressed well The secret
really to life and this is a secret that the
ancients the ancient sages and wise men For thousands of
years have understood is that actually what's creating your emotions
is Not the environment. It's you it's how you think
about the environment that creates the emotions and That this
is something that's within your control. This is something that
can be changed Even when the external environment is against
you you can change how you're reacting to it How
you're perceiving it how you're interpreting it and therefore you
can gain emotional mastery, and this is a very beautiful
and very powerful thing because I can guarantee you that
if you're having a Struggle in your life if you're
having the kind of life where you're not getting the
results that you want the only reason that's the case
is because of the emotional difficulties that you're having It's
because of emotions It's because of the feelings because these
feelings they block you up and they keep you from
creating success in your life It's not the circumstances see
right now you think it's the circumstances that are keeping
you stuck in life But actually it's it's mostly the
emotions. It's how you feel about stuff. It's how you're
interpreting stuff and in this video I really want to
take you through a model of how this works I
want to give you a totally radically different paradigm from
which to work and View emotions and view thoughts we're
going to talk about how they all interact together How
you can use this to actually develop emotional mastery. At
the very end i'm going to give you a very
powerful exercise to help you to buy into this Because
that is the problem This thing is hard to believe
I remember in fact it was About five years ago
when I started my first business, and I was just
young I didn't know what I was doing I didn't
have any money. I just start my business and there
were... I've started trying to see a little bit success
there and What happened? Is that I started getting into
self-help? So one of the first books or material that
I bought from self-help was a Tony robbins CD Product
until I remember I was listening to this in the
car, and I loved everything He was saying and all
of his energy. I loved all the ideas He's thrown
at me, but then there was this one idea that
I heard of talking about it in his in his
CD And he was talking about how emotions and those
emotions that we experience those are all generated by us
You know by me. I was listening to this and
you know I understood what he was saying logically But
then I also said to myself, but Tony I mean
like what are you talking about here like for example?
I have this problem with money like I've had this
problem with my business [I] have this problem where I
don't know if my business is going to take off.
I don't know how to build it How is that
being created by me that's like a really frustrating problem
for me? So I'm getting I'm very stressed about starting
my business here It's my first time starting a business
so this stress and anxiety [I'm] feeling about starting this
business And you're telling me that I'm creating this like
no no [no], this is happening because I'm pursuing something
Ambitious, and this is happening because it really is a
a challenging [business] problem This is I've got some real
business [problems] got some money problems. So you know these
are real That's what I'm telling to myself, and I
told them I told kind of my own line [-]
Tony I'm like yeah, it'd be there these are nice
ideas But they're not very practical What's practical is? That
my business and money problems are causing me frustration That's
what's real if I can get rid of those then
my frustrations would be gone. [I] mean, [it's] pretty simple,
right? but as I've been studying more and more personal
development as I've really been working to expand my consciousness
and Understanding my own emotions building my emotional intelligence What
I've started to discover is more and more how true
it is what Tony was saying and it really is
the fact that The emotions are not generated by things
out there. They're generated in here and Most people don't
see this most people have a hard time believing it
even if I tell them you right now might understand
this on a logical [level], but you won't believe it
on a practical and emotional level Because what's going to
happen is going to watch this video? Then you going
to go off and you're going to feel angry at
somebody or you're going to feel stressed or anxious or
you're going to feel excited or happy and What's going
to happens that you're going to attribute that to external
environment you're going to say that person makes feel happy
[that] [person] makes me feel loved this person right here
makes me feel angry this situation right here makes me
feel frustrated this situation here makes me feel depressed or
What other kind of emotion you want to talk about?
but That's not really what's going on? Let me show
you what's really going on all right to really see
this let's Highlight a model here. I want to demonstrate
this model. So here's the model right now The model
that you're operating under works like this you have right
here Some sort of circumstance out in the external world
that happens to you Then that generates the emotion that
you feel right? So let's say you get a raise
at your job that makes you feel Then happy the
raise was [an] external circumstance Which made you feel happy
that's the emotion now when you have that happiness from
the emotion then you start taking some sort of action
Emotion leads to action so maybe you're going to go
and going to work a little bit harder now that
you haven't a better pay Okay, so you take some
better actions and then those actions of course lead to
results in your life, so if you work harder After
getting your promotion and getting your raise then maybe that
puts you in line for an even higher raise next
year, or maybe [that] puts you in [line] for for
some sort of a you know new career track or
it puts you in line for some sort of extra
compensation and That of course those results are then the
external environment that then feed back in and create even
more positive emotions So that's how you live your life
right now 99% [of] people do it this way, but
actually that's not how it really works Here's what's really
going on if you're conscious. It works like this What
you've got is you've got an external circumstance The same
one let's say you get a raise. Then what you've
got is. You don't have an emotion you [have] thought
see this is what most people miss is that you
have thoughts which create an interpretation filter, so the [rays]
the raw facts that you got to raise that comes
in and it Hits your ear or hits your eye
you see it or [you] hear it then it goes
into your brain Then you've got this filter of interpretation
that goes on a lot of times this happens very
quickly almost instantaneously And you're not consciously aware of the
thoughts that are shaping that because you're unconscious and so
that happens Your mind is kind of kind of like
Skips [Hulbert] really fast and it goes straight to the
emotion you feel happy or you feel excited or you
feel sad for some reason So you've got those emotions
now Those emotions seem like they're very natural and they
stemmed directly from the external circumstance, but we don't realize
[that] There's that filter there, so that happens you've got
this emotion and then of course you take Certain action
based on that emotion that part of the model is
correct and then based on that action you generate some
sort of results That [part] of the model is also
correct, and then that of course feeds back in here
And it gives you a new fodder for the mill
to interpret So that's a more accurate model now Really
notice here. It's this layer of interpretation This is the
key to life is this layer Because if you can
master this layer if you can gain consciousness over this
this filter that you have right here Then then [wow]
how powerful you can be how how much more successful
you can be how much better results you can generate
in your life, and how much more fulfilled and happy
you can be inside and If you are not conscious
of this filter, and you not take control of it
Then I guarantee you that your life is going to
be very miserable, and you're going to struggle, and you're
not going to very Create the kind of results that
you want because basically what you're doing is you're leaving
the interpretation of the chance You've got this amazing power.
It's almost like a superpower Which is to assign meaning
with your mind and assign interpretations to external circumstances with
your mind but [when] you don't use that power When
you say that you don't have it when you abdicate
that that control to somebody else Or you just leave
it in the hands of fate or God or whoever
else then what happens is that? You've got a lot
of randomness in this system Right a lot of ranma
Senor life a lot of Chaos and that Chaos is
unstable, and it creates bad results So this is what's
really going on now to help you to understand this
this filter process a little bit more So interpretations, what
do we mean by this [you're] thoughts thoughts create emotions.
That's the key message I want you to take away
from this thoughts create emotions the thought [that] your thinking
is generating the emotion So when you're feeling happy why
do you feel happy you get a promotion and you
feel happy about it? It seems like the two are
connected, but actually they're not the promotion in itself has
absolutely no meaning has absolutely no value The value and
meaning to it is assigned by your mind by the
thoughts that you're thinking for most people these thoughts are
Unconscious and automatic and so they will assign an automatic
meaning promotion [yeah] more money. You know and that leads
to happiness But sometimes it doesn't work in the way
that you want it to work. What if you have
a bad situation happen Let's say you're in a [relationship]
and you've got this nice long-term relationship things are going
great and let's say you're the woman in the relationship
and the man ends up going and cheating and Ruins
the relationship and now you you can't have a good
relationship with that person anymore, so the relationship is destroyed
Well now instead of getting a raise. You've got some
sort of negative event right Wrong you don't have a
negative event you just have an event It's the filter
of interpretation that you're putting on it. That's assigning positive
or negative value to it. That's the interpreting It's the
faucet going in your mind, so let's let's take a
look at this What kind of thoughts are? Necessary to
generate a negative emotion, so if someone cheats on you,
and you're feeling bad about it Let's say you're feeling
how do you want to feel let's say you're feeling
angry, and you're also feeling depressed both at the same
time So when you're feeling that way, you're probably thinking
you know that asshole how [could] he cheat on me
we had such a beautiful thing going and He broke
all our trust that we developed over the last Few
years Totally screwed it up now this amazing relationship that
I was really counting on to have for the rest
of my life Maybe I even wanted to sort of
family with this guy now. I can't do that He
really betrayed me and on top of this now How
else am I going to find another guy you hard
enough to find this guy? How am I gonna find
the next guy and what kind of asshole is he
going to be what if I die? miserable and Lonely
Without anyone to look after me or love me See
when you've got this kind of thought going on in
your mind That's the interpretation going on so the event
triggered those kinds of thoughts now those kinds of thoughts.
What kind of emotions they create Well, how are you
going to feel if you think that of course you're
going to feel depressed [and] of course you can feel
angry? at this person and Then what's the next step?
So you've got depression and Anger and what kind of
action will that create in your life? well if you're
feeling this This negative about it. Then you're probably not
going to take much action at all. You're probably gonna
be so depressed You're not Gonna want to date anybody
else You're not going to want to go look for
somebody else, and you're just going [to] wallow in that
pity [and] [maybe] in fact you're going to retreat and
you're going to kind of retreat into your shell not
interact with with men anymore because you're bitter about what
happened and So you're bitter now you retreat. That's your
action you don't really take much action and then what
kind of results Is [that] create well is that going
to lead [to] you finding another man a better man?
Probably not you're not taking any action then actually that's
going to it's going to shut you off even further
it's going to isolate you and that's going to make
you even [more] miserable because now what's happening here is
going and coming in and now Creating more negative emotions
because it's getting filtered a second time okay, so that's
pretty clear, but you might also say, but [Leo] I
Mean I hear you but it's all very logical it's
easy for you to stand up here [and] talk about
somebody cheating on you or You getting fired or something
bad happening to you, but what if something bad really
happened? For real, and you're in the moment. You've got
these negative emotions [going] on I mean if someone cheated
on you you'd probably be angry and depressed too wouldn't
you Well, let's take a look It's not a case
that everyone gets depressed when someone cheats on them and
I recognize that sometimes you get trigger That's what emotions
do is they trigger you emotionally, but it doesn't mean
[that]. There's no filter there You've still got the thought
filter which is creating the negativity Let's take a look
at a possible other scenario For how this might [work]
with exactly the same circumstances the only thing that's going
to be different is the filter The Filter is just
going to change So again someone cheats on you, that's
the circumstance But now instead of thinking those negative thoughts
let's think of some other thoughts. What if you thought
for [example] something like you know what I actually had
the suspicion that this person wasn't really right for me
and You know what it's actually kind of nice because
we've been together for so long I forgot what it's
like to to date other people and You know it's
actually nice. Is that I actually enjoy dating I'm going
to go out and I'm kind of excited to go
find some new people to date What if I find
someone who's an even better match for me? What if
I really find that person that I want to start
[a] family with that can really love me What if
I find a kind of kind of guy? Who's Gonna
enjoy some of the stuff that I enjoy a little
bit more? What if I can find a guy? Who's
really into cooking? I was one of the kind of
guy or what if I could find a guy? who
had a better sense of humor or Who was better
in Bed Or Whatever Else? [so] these are the thoughts
now notice how different these thoughts are different filter If
you're thinking these kind of thoughts, how are you going
to feel? You can't help but feel excited you can't
help but feel optimistic because now You're looking at the
prospect of going out there finding somebody better. You're looking
at actually this whole scenario is being an improvement on
your life rather than something that's Taking your life down
into the shitter So if you if you see the
improvement, you see the opportunity here Then you're going to
feel excited now the emotion of excitement and optimism What
kind of action will that lead to well in this
case this person will be excited on dating. So she'll
go out there She'll actually start dating people. Maybe she'll
go and she'll create line dating profile or whatever and
what kind of then? actions What kind of results will
those actions generate? Well if you're dating and you're looking
for new guys chances are you're going to find somebody
new maybe somebody better Which then of course feeds back
in here and creates more positive emotion So it's like
a cycle [you] get these either positive or you get
these negative cycles the question is what kind of cycles
are you creating for yourself and More importantly do you
recognize [that] you're creating the cycle and that? It's not
the cycle that's happening to you. Is that you're creating
it because you've got this filter here This is not
just my idea. This is really an idea that Has
been known about? By like I said the sages and
wise men for thousands of years and what I wanted
to hear [now] [I] want to read a quote really
poignant quote from From a real sage back from in
the day which [really] drives at home and here it
is If you are distressed by anything external the pain
is not due to the thing itself but to your
own estimate of it and This you have the power
to revoke at any moment This is a quote [by]
Marcus Aurelius Marcus Aurelius Was a brilliant roman emperor in
fact he's one [of] the only roman emperors. I believe
he's the only one from whom we have personal Written
records, we actually have his diaries and His own personal
philosophy and his diaries they've actually been compiled into a
book called meditations very powerful book Marcus Aurelius was really
all about emotional mastery. It was a stoic and he
was really interested about how do you create? happiness, how
do you live a virtuous life and how do you
How do you balance the philosophy that kind of Greek
virtue with the practicality? Because he wasn't just a philosopher.
He was an actual I mean [ah] [uh] He was
a roman emperor right so for him there was everyday
problems he had wars he had to fight He had
political problems he had a whole empire to to manage
And it was very interesting you can read his diaries
and see the way that he approaches this stuff And
this is one of the like the core fundamental principles.
This is kind of like like a superpower that you
have as a human being is to understand that you
have [the] power to Revoke your own estimate of things
whenever you want to so that means that when something
happens [to] you That is quote-unquote negative or that most
people would perceive as negative you can control how you
reinterpret that The kind of interpretation [you] assign to [it]
so that you can generate the kind of resourceful emotions
that you want which will then lead? To resourceful action
which will then lead [to] the results you want So
this is a choice that you have Now let's go
back to this example about the cheating because there's an
important point that I want to Not forget to make
and that's this you might ask yourself well leo Why
would I why would I choose to think? positive thoughts
When something negative happens to me isn't that unnatural why
would I do that? isn't it more natural if someone
cheats on me that I would think negative thoughts and
then those negative thoughts great sure negative emotions and the
whole Chain Well here's here's what you got to ask
yourself. This is where the consciousness component comes in Yes,
if you want to you can think negative thoughts about
[a] negative situation But if you also have a little
bit of intelligence as foresight, you can see what's going
to happen If you've got some consciousness, you can see
it Negative situation happens to you you say fuck it.
I'm going to think negative [thoughts], okay [you] think negative
thoughts you create negative emotions you create negative actions which
create negative results and Then that negative result comes in
goes through the another filter of negativity Creates more negative
emotions more negative actions more negative results and this cycle
continues so That's one [option] you [have] Okay, that's an
option what's an alternative option Alternative option is that you
have some that happen to you, but [you] recognize and
you see wait a minute Wait a minute. I'm smart
here if I think negative thoughts about a negative situation
If I interpret it in a negative way, it's gonna
create negative emotions negative actions negative results wait a minute
Do I want negative results in my life? Do I
want a negative life do I want to be taking
negative actions do I want to be experiencing negative emotions?
Okay, I don't want that Right do I have a
choice in the matter? Oh? Actually, I do have a
choice if I'm conscious I can see that my thoughts
dictate how this chain is going to run [okay], so
if that's the case then maybe I should think twice
before actually Giving [into] these negative thoughts and considering them
natural To hell with natural I want an amazing life.
I don't want I don't want what's natural if what's
natural as shit [let's] see this takes consciousness You might
say well this all sounds well and good leo, but
what about what it actually happens to you are You
gonna be [able] to do it? Well, that's why I
spend Hundreds and thousands of hours working on myself developing
my emotional mastery developing my consciousness building it up so
that when this does happen to me I Can decide
and I have control [over] this filter? Because I don't
want this negative chain of of nonsense to be ruining
my life. I want to be building up my life
Regardless of the circumstances outside of me, so if something
good happens to me I'll take it and I'll [make]
it better if something bad happens to me I'll take
it and I'll still see the good [in] it and
that means that I win no matter what and I
like those odds. I don't know about you, but I
like those odds. I don't like to gamble with my
life [I] don't like to gamble with the resulting in
my life. I don't like to gamble with my business
[I] don't like to gamble with my health. I don't
have a gamble with my finances I don't like to
gamble with my relationships [I] want amazing everything and The
only way I know how to do how to do
that how to design it is to say that I
have taken control I'm taking full control of everything. I
can I can't control everything. I'm not deluded but The
things that I can control and then I see that
I can the things that I see it I can
develop control in I sure as hell I'm going to
try to develop control in that so if I can
see an opportunity here with this filter to change the
filter I'm going to do everything I can to change
that filter Even if right now. I'm not a master
at it This is how I want you to think
It's very powerful way to think very few people think
this way and If you don't think this way then
they're going to suffering in your life Because [your] interpretation
is going to be automatic. They're going to be the
most Lazy interpretations and lazy interpretations tend to lead to
suffering which is why you have suffering in your life?
The only reason you have suffering [in] your life is
because [of] this it's not because of external circumstance per
se It's because of your lazy interpretations So what does
this mean let's cover some of the examples some of
the cases here? We already talked about cheating we talked
about promotion You can come up with all sorts of
objections about situations where you can't take control of your
filter [you]? [might] say well leo there are certain things
in [life] that are just inherently negative and evil and
bad for example if someone Starts a fight with me.
What if somebody does something unjust enough [fair] to me.
What if someone comes [and] steals my car? what if
somebody comes and Insults me just insults me out of
the blue. [I] mean aren't I justified and allowed to
feel bad about these these situations isn't it just natural
that I have this negative filter or What about a
situation where I you know I really screw up at
something What if I go to a job interview a
really important job interview and then at the [very] last
minute everything's going well? But then at the [very] last
minute. I just blow it because I say something stupid
Should not be disappointed with myself after that Should not
feel bad Isn't it? Justified that I feel depressed Because
I lost this amazing once-in-A-lifetime opportunity that I might never
ever get again You can do that if you want
we already talked about this Do you [want] [a] negative
Michael? Do you want negative results then continue to have
negative interpretations or Do you want to actually? Take your
life in your own hands and say to hell with
what happens I'm going to feel good, and I'm going
to generate the results that I want in my life
regardless That's the answer right the answer is that you
have a choice the problem. Is that most people are
making this choice? Unconsciously, and they're always choosing the worst
path The path that leads to the worst [result]. [I]
don't want that for you. I want you to develop
consciousness The next point that I wanted to cover is
I want to [only] take a look a little bit
about Why is this hard to believe? Why is it
hard to adopt this paradigm? It seems like we're talking
about two different paradigms here and most people Surely live
from the paradigm where they're running They're running their life
off of circumstance. They're just generating their emotions spontaneously They
feel like the circumstances dictate the emotions. So why do
people live this way then? There's numerous factors the family
you grew up in most the families we grow up
in they don't teach us this stuff Self-help is it
really taught in schools. It's not taught in the Media
Society doesn't really give this information [to] you not only
that but it's not just information This is something that
has to be practiced and developed and cultivate. It's like
a skill So if you've never practiced it and nobody
around you is practice that your friends or your family
and your culture doesn't really? encourage it then you're not
going to know about it and Because you've been living
your whole life since you were born [up] to now
which means that you're what? 20 or 30 or 40
or even 50 years old or even more? You've been
living so long And you've been operating under this mindset
that the emotions Just affect you and you have no
say over what they are and you have no control
over them that It's hard you know you've got you
condition yourself You've built up this habit, and so [now]
you have to wean yourself off this long long long
[Multi] [Decade] long habit of Letting emotions dictate your life
that can be challenging The other thing here is that
there's a lack of self-honesty going on There's just a
lack of consciousness and consciousness. It's not something that you're
born with consciousness is something that you develop and Right
now you don't appreciate just how little consciousness you have
and how much more that you could have? People who
are unconscious believe that they have all the consciousness that
they could need? but in fact what they're not seeing
is how much personal growth is still possible for them
how much they're not aware of the ego plays a
big part in this too is that You really don't
want to admit to yourself that you're doing this right?
I mean who wants to admit that [they're] causing their
own anger who wants to admit that they're causing their
own Suffering their own stress their own anxiety their own
panic attacks Their own depression Who wants to admit that?
Yeah, it takes it takes some courage to admit that
your ego doesn't want to admit [it] because as soon
as you do admit it That means that all of
a sudden you take on a lot of responsibility [now]
you have a lot of control about how your life
flows a lot of people They [don't] want to take
on that responsibility Because if you take on that [responsibility]
that means you have to work really hard to grow
yourself There's a certain solace that you take a certain
comfort in knowing In your mind that you can't grow
that you've kind of maxed yourself out Then you can
tell tell yourself and everybody around you that well, you
know what I try to do my best and now
I'm at the best that I could be and Then
everything else is blocked off to me all havanese are
blocked off I have no more responsibility than this and
so [you're] going to live your life the way [you]
are right now, but That's a lie right That's a
lie because you can grow yourself so much more than
you currently Have grown and you can take yourself to
enormous enormous levels as a human being in your development
But that's challenging to do that means pushing your comfort
zone and a lot of people don't like that They
would rather stay [in] their comfort Zone So what's the
takeaway from this video the takeaway? Is that I want
you to take 100% responsibility? For all of your emotions
every single one positive ones, but especially the negative ones
Don't blame it on circumstance Don't point your finger other
people Never say that somebody else is causing you to
feel a certain way Nobody is causing you to feel
loved [nobody's] causing you to feel happy nobody's causing you
to feel depressed That is you causing it Now here
is the final exercise that I want to give you
because while all this stuff that I said to you
is nice It's good. Theory, it's good philosophy and whatnot
if all you do is just [believe] in it It's
not going to is I can help you. This is
something you have to live and embody Here's how you
do it you need to raise your consciousness So what
I'm going to give you is the following exercise for
the next seven [days]. I want you to commit To
taking full responsibility for all your emotions what does this
mean that means for the next seven days you're going
to be extra aware extra conscious of when you have
a negative emotion Let's not focus on the positive ones
right now. Let's just really focus on the negative So
if you have a negative emotion let's say you get
angry at someone you get depressed about a certain situation
You feel lonely you feel stressed and overwhelmed or [anxious]
or you're worrying if you have one of those I?
want you to stop and Notice when you're in the
middle of that storm of emotions. I want you to
stop and notice and Take note of the thoughts that
you're creating [right] there in the moment you're going to
see it, so [if] somebody is making you angry [you]
[gotta] be a little more conscious and say oh wait
a minute Leo told me that this emotion of anger
[it's] not coming from the other person. It's coming from
my interpretation, so that's coming from thoughts, okay? What kind
of thoughts am I thinking right this second and you're
going to [notice] that? subconscious thoughts will then pop up
into your conscious awareness and the thought might be something
like I Can't believe that guy such an asshole. It
just might be as simple as [that] or maybe you're
having a thought like oh My God, what am I
going to do now? And that kind of thought might
make you anxious or you might have a thought like
oh Man, I'm never going to find another person again
like that, and that kind of thought might make you
feel lonely right So pay [attention] to these thoughts that
you're having Put awareness on them don't try to stop
your negative emotions let your negative [motion] just carry through
all I'm telling you to do is just be mindful
of The thoughts that are running the emotion and Try
to do that for seven days straight whenever you have
any emotions you're not going to be perfect at this
not even close [so] don't set that expectation you'll be
lucky if you can just catch a handful of negative
emotions consciously throughout these seven days So if you can
even get three of them four of the five of
them great, that's enough you got to start somewhere You're
going to notice if you do this exercise that when
you're having that negative motion and you become aware of
your thought process That's generating the negative emotion. You can
actually see it. You're going to make the connection in
your mind I'm going to say oh wow this is
this is really cool. I didn't I didn't notice this
before I can't believe I didn't notice about myself. That
is my thought About this situation [that's] creating the meaning
the interpretation, and then that that is affecting the emotion
that I'm feeling oh Wow, that's powerful Wait a minute
that means that if I change my thought does that
mean that I would feel differently Oh, wow, let me
try that and you're going to run off And you're
going to try [it] and then you're going to feel
differently then you're going to go whoa. That's powerful And
it is powerful so this whole video the reason I
went to a lot of depth here is because it's
important to Convince you of this idea because this is
a paradigm shift remember and your mind doesn't like paradigm
shifts doesn't feel comfortable it doesn't feel right you don't
want to believe it you have all sorts [of] objections
and excuses and and Various good reasons for why you
shouldn't believe this but what I'm telling [you] actually going
try it out test it out and see how it
works for you if You do this Man, you're putting
a very fundamental block building block into place for creating
an extraordinary life this is something [that's] going to be
critical for you if You want to do something big
with your life if you want a life where you've
a lot of passion? Or you have a lot of
success Where you have a lot of happiness? Because if
your emotions out of control what kind of happiness can
you have? Your happiness is contingent upon Randomness in life
and that is not a good way to be happy
