hey what's up this is Leo for actualize org and
today I really want to cover the topic of finding
permanent rather than superficial solutions to the problems that you
have in your life so whatever problem you might have
maybe right now you've got something that you're working on
with your health and your nutrition maybe you're working on
something that you're not satisfied with like your career you're
not happy at your job or maybe you've got relationship
troubles and you've got some problems there that you're trying
to sort out well all those things ultimately boil down
and there is this tendency that I see out there
and I'm not excluded from this at all myself is
to is to look for that quick fix solution which
will treat the symptom so to speak rather than address
the underlying cause it's pretty deep topic so I want
to I want to cover from different angles here but
the reason I started talking about this I started think
about this topic is actually because when I coach I
have this problem that I face myself is when I'm
coaching somebody how deep do I want to coach them
and I almost ask myself well how how far do
you want me to go with this how big of
a problem you want me to help you fix because
a lot of times people will come to me with
a relatively superficial problem but when you start when you
start getting involved in psychology start studying the self development
stuff you you start to get this this kind of
oh we're in the matrix kind of kind of vibe
going and you start to see that ultimately all of
your circumstances in life and all the problems you have
ultimately boiled down it can be traced down to very
root causes and all of those root causes are rooted
in you so it's you that needs to be worked
on if you're trying to really fix your problems and
fix them permanently whereas what a lot of people do
is they try to fix the problem on a superficial
level so let's give us a couple of examples so
that we're not all in up abstract land here specific
example let's say you want to drop 20 pounds right
that might seem like that's admirable goal right you want
to get fit you want to be healthy you want
to look nice the thing is that a lot of
times the reason people fail especially with these kinds of
health goals is because well the underlying problem seems like
it's that you're overeating you're not going to the gym
you're not counting your calories something like that something along
those lines but that's the superficial problem the underlying problem
is really in you and it's going to be your
mind sets about food or what you're using that food
to do for you so maybe you have a crummy
job as a result you get very frazzled at your
work you get a lot of anxiety from it so
when you come home in the evening you're so dead
beaten tired your work is so unsatisfying that now you're
using food as a way to to basically self-medicate and
to give yourself at least a little bit of enjoyment
in your day because your work was so miserable and
so you end up going for a tub of ice
cream or something unhealthy like that so in that situation
counting your calories and going to the gym and trying
to just willpower your way through and trying to eat
healthy just by using your willpower is not the ultimate
solution that is treating symptoms of something deeper and I
think this is this is very very human like is
to want to treat those those conditions those top level
symptoms rather than digging deeper and the reason for that
is well simply it can be scary to dig deep
like the way the analogy that I use here is
is like think of your problems as like a big
ball of yarn and a lot of times you take
a loose end in this big ball of yarn and
maybe it's your weight or maybe it's your job or
maybe it's uh something like a relationship problem like you're
hiring fights in a relationship and so that's kind of
like the loose ends that you want to snip off
and you want to fix well you start like pulling
on it you start tugging on it and then you
can just snip it off and it'll look like it
was fixed but the underlying cause wasn't fixed and so
what you got to do is you got to have
the courage to go in there and start unraveling this
little ball and it can be scary because a lot
of times what happens is once you start unraveling this
it ends up being a long thread so something that
seemed like an easy fix ends up being a lot
more work than you originally thought so like this example
we were talking about with the health well let's say
that that is the case for you and I'm not
saying this is for everybody but for some people certainly
the case that they use food as a way to
to basically compensate for other parts of their life where
they're not satisfied if that's the case then no matter
how many calories you count if you go to the
gym if you hire a personal trainer you do all
this stuff it's really not going to second to solve
that problem for you're always going to struggle with it
and and so a lot of people will get frustrated
because they tried these surface-level solutions they haven't gotten sustainable
results from it and it's just draining because what's happening
is you're putting more and more effort into it you're
worrying about how to fix it but you're not getting
any permanent solutions you're getting stuff like yo-yo diets and
you're getting you're getting phases in your life where you're
doing good with your with your nutrition but only when
you're very dedicated and using a lot of your willpower
and things are going great at work and then something
bad happens and then all of a sudden it drops
and you're back to where you started from and so
the solution there is to really start unraveling not yarn
what is the whole yarn and in this case it
might be like well you're using food to to compensate
for another part of your life so it's work so
really the underlying problem there is the work that you
have and so all the sudden now to fix this
problem if you really want to fix it you have
to have the courage to start to think okay if
I need to fix my work before I can fix
my nutrition then really to fix nutrition I got to
fix my work and so how do I fix my
work what's the real problem with the work and so
now you start to unravel that thread and maybe the
problem at work is that you have an overly demanding
boss who doesn't listen to you and again though that
is like a superficial problem because the underlying problem is
probably something deeper so in that case underlying problem might
be why are you get at that job in the
first place why are you tolerating an overbearing boss that
doesn't really value your input why do you have to
do that is it because you don't have the ability
to go out and get a different job maybe it's
that you might say well the economy's bad right now
I'm not expected to be able to just land a
new job that quickly and I have bills to pay
I have responsibilities so it's it's not like I can
just go and quit my job and that might very
well be true in your situation but then I have
to say if you really want to resolve the whole
issue then you got to address that problem why is
that the problem because it's certainly the case that their
jobs out there right now even if the economy is
not perfect the question is what is preventing you from
getting them or for applying to them or what is
it that's keeping you attached to this over overbearing boss
is it because you have some emotional issue where you're
not able to confront him and bring up your own
issues and bring up your disagreements with them so in
that case maybe it's something along those lines maybe you're
not feeling very confident yourself and so then that issue
needs to be addressed or maybe it's not that and
maybe it's simply just that your boss is being an
ass but you don't have the leverage to do anything
about it because you're at this job and you're afraid
of losing it you've got bills to pay and so
there's that problem and you don't have easy means of
going to a new job well then that is the
problem the problem is that you are so locked in
that it's really limiting your choices and things you can
do in your life so what you got to do
is then I would say the real solution is to
get that part of your life handled why is it
that you have so few job options when other people
around you can have potentially a lot more and they
don't have that problem well if that's the case then
maybe for you it's going to be something like you
don't have the skills to apply to a better job
or maybe you don't have the industry connections that you
need to apply or maybe you're afraid of going and
doing some some rigorous interviews and you don't like the
whole interview process and you're not you don't feel like
you're prepared for it your resume is not polished up
so all these different factors and again all those factors
can have deeper underlying causes so skills let's say you
don't have you feel like you don't have the skills
to get a better job than you currently have well
solution to that is to acquire more skills right just
keep on raveling that yarn so what you got to
do maybe you got to go back to school maybe
you got to take an online training program maybe you
got to start reading up by yourself and spending part
of your time at home when you're off of work
boosting up your own skill set so that you can
can shoot for those better positions you don't have to
tolerate your boss anymore and so you see it's like
a cascade and if you really want to solve the
problem permanently remember what we started off at was not
a career problem we started off with a health problem
but then that health problem was tied to your current
job and then your current job is really tied to
the fact that you don't have the right skills and
so therefore you need to go back to school that
might be the case that's just like one example but
then this this is I think this is illustrative of
a really pernicious problems that we tend to have in
our lives so whether this is with your health or
with your career with a relationship it always tends to
be like that and what I would submit to you
is that all of it ultimately boils down to you
so whenever you think you have a problem that's out
there out in the world maybe someone's being mean to
you maybe someone is not treating you nicely maybe you're
not earning the kind of money that you want to
earn maybe you're jobless maybe you're not having help that
you want to have or anything else like that thing
more permanent and and more permanent means what is it
about you that you need to change in order to
overcome that problem forever so what could you do so
that you would never have to worry about your health
does that mean fixing your job okay so then what
do you need to do to fix your job so
you don't have to worry about your health and your
job all the sudden that means you got to get
a better education okay so now you got to have
the courage to bite that bullet and I think that's
where it's really tricky is because well most of us
don't really want to unravel that yarn because of the
fear that that is there right and we we secretly
know that the answers a lot of times are more
involved than we want to admit that they are and
because of that that person that has a health problem
probably understands that health problem is somehow related to their
career or to their job and then it probably understands
that for some for some reason that's connected ultimately to
something even deeper which might be the lack of education
skills and maybe even that is connected to something deeper
like maybe you have a deep limiting belief about how
smart you are inherently or a limiting belief about how
good you can do if you go back to school
and so that is preventing you ultimately from getting this
whole chain of awesome things to click for you in
your life see the nice thing about unraveling that whole
thread even though it's it can be scary the nice
thing is that it also does usually involve multiple facets
of your life and when you start getting one thing
into place and then another thing into place and another
thing into place all of a sudden it's like everything
is firing on all cylinders for you and your solutions
are permanent so now that you let's say you go
back to school and let's say it's hard at first
right so you might need to invest a couple of
years to get some sort of degree so during that
time it might seem like you're not making a lot
of progress but once you do get that degree all
the sudden that base that foundation is in place so
now that opens opportunities for you now that's a permanent
solution and so what does that open an opportunity for
well now you can go and apply for better jobs
that's the next level and so you get that piece
of the puzzle in place and it might take you
six worth six years worth of apply lying that means
six years probably more like six months of applying to
get a good job so you can spend six months
applying you're going to go through that some of that
work in the labor involved in doing that and then
all of a sudden you land that nice job that
you like that pays you well and where you're also
treated right well and you have a job in a
position that you're satisfied with and so now all this
and that's in place and then the next element then
suddenly opens up to you and once you have a
job that pays you well and that you're happy at
well now all of a sudden your evenings are free
and instead of coming home from work dead tired and
emotionally drained you come home from work and you're energized
because you had a good day and now we'll the
sudden that allows you to to do other things all
of a sudden you don't have to rely on on
food to fix your your emotional issues at work and
maybe your relationship now improves as well because you're more
positive you're not bringing the negativity of work into the
relationship so that element improves and see all the sudden
by pulling on that one you want one thread from
that ball of yarn what we did is we went
through we found all the problems we fix them systematically
and now you've got a real permanent solution to all
those and I think that's what most people do not
do is they don't follow that kind of process because
let's be honest it takes a lot of work right
how much easier is it to to go and read
some sort of yo-yo some fad yo-yo diet like the
the six-week juste all juice diet in in Cosmo and
just follow that and use that as your solution to
the weight problem rather than thinking about all this stuff
trying to eliminate your limiting beliefs about how smart you
can be and how good you can be in school
actually going back to school paying for for tuitions to
school going through that whole process getting your degree finally
then going through the whole job interview market process again
finally finding a new job getting comfortable that job and
getting all of those place pieces in place and only
then maybe adding in elements like nutri proper nutrition all
this other stuff so how much more complicated is that
it's like a thousand times more work right that's true
so I'm not I'm not throwing any illusions out there
I think it does take more work to find permanent
solutions the nice thing though is that a the permanent
so that that work that you put in will let's
say amortize over time so it's it's something that you're
going to reap benefit from much later without having to
do a lot of work to maintain it so once
you've got that education you've got it all of a
sudden you can apply for new jobs and better jobs
for those of your life because you're you've got that
diploma you've also got the skills you learn there so
that's a nice thing when you got a new a
new job that pays you well well that kind of
bumps your salary grade up right and usually once that
salary grade goes up it's easier to maintain that grade
and then ask for higher salaries at other jobs or
even your existing job when when it comes time for
promotions that sort of thing so now all the sudden
you're earning more money as a result and that money
you might be earning for ten twenty thirty years so
you're just you're raising your standard of living and then
what is pasta made possible by raising your standard living
all sudden let's say you can now afford to eat
healthier food whereas you couldn't before and now all of
a sudden you can afford your gym membership and maybe
you can buy yourself an elliptical if you want to
exercise at home and maybe you can move into a
better apartment that's going to make you feel nicer about
yourself in some nicer city that has cleaner air and
so that's going to improve your health and so you
see all these things are put into place and as
you do that you start you're genuinely love your life
because these are elements that are important to you and
that are there and it's like you're building you're building
something real rather than just putting a little patch on
a problem here a little patch on a problem there
so quite involved right probably not what you wanted here
I think this is why often times you don't hear
this is because most magazines most books most bloggers out
there most self-development gurus motivational speakers they're not going to
tell you these things they're not going to tell you
the hard truth of this why well it's hard to
sell to you right would you rather get the the
seven-day diet that's going to help you drop 20 pounds
effortlessly or would you rather get the 2 year plan
to reform your whole career and your education in order
to prevent you from having to rely on food as
an emotional crutch you know if if you're comparing those
two super on a superficial level which most people tend
to do when they're kind of shopping around you're always
going to go for the quick fix and unless you've
tried a lot of those quick fixes then you probably
haven't been burned enough by them to start to appreciate
the the awesomeness and the value and the power of
finding permanent solutions you know I've in my own life
I've tried a lot of quick fixes I think I've
always been kind of intuitive and understood that a quick
fix is is not going to it's not going to
ultimately do it for me but there are there parts
in my life where I sure I've gone for quick
fixes because I didn't want to either admit that I
had a real problem I was burying my head in
the sand or I even did admit it but I
thought that there was an easier way just because you
know we're all trying to conserve energy we have a
limited time if there is a way to do something
fast and effective by all means do it but if
it sounds too good to be true and life experience
is telling you that it's probably not going to work
for you and that you need to dig a little
bit deeper go ahead and first of all go through
that digging process right really start to ask yourself well
what is what is it going to look like for
me to solve this permanently you know if I want
happy in my relationship what is it going to take
for me to solve this permanently if I'm unhappy at
work for whatever reasons what is it going to take
to solve that permanently probably is going to start with
some self-reflection so you have to start to think about
well what is about my relationships that's consistently not working
out maybe you have a string or a history of
unsuccessful really relationships and maybe you discover that it's communication
skills or maybe you discover your you have a bad
choice in in dating partners and so they're definitely resist
the to put the burden on the other person and
try to focus it back on yourself so it's like
why do I choose these people what is it about
me and then start inspecting your limiting beliefs start inspecting
your habits and getting those resolved because once you get
those resolved the rest will take care of itself right
I have this analogy that I talked about down below
in the article here about about like growing a strong
healthy tree if you're trying to do that then you
want to focus on the root systems because the root
system of the tree is what's ultimately creating the ability
for that tree to be big and towering and lush
and green and healthy because what if what you do
if you want a healthy green big strong tree and
what you do is you plant a seed and then
you neglect to to take care of its root system
and all you do is you prune the leaves and
you maybe spray it with some pesticides and you make
it look pretty that might superficially get you some some
immediate results but over the long run you're not going
to get that strong healthy tree to grow the way
that you want it to because if the roots are
damaged if the roots are not planted in the right
soil if they're not tended to then they're not going
to be able to take in the right nutrients that's
going to support the growth of that tree they're just
not going to be even be able to be strong
enough to to support the kind of bulk that you
want in that tree so there has to be there's
like a proportion between how extensive the root system is
and how big the tree can grow and the analogy
that I'm making here is that it's really the same
for your life and your life and all the circumstances
in your life I want you to see those as
branches and leaves and the tree is you so you
are the tree you are the root system and so
all your inner beliefs all your thoughts all your habits
all your patterns all your attitudes those are really the
core when you fix those when you start working there
then you start to see that you're developing a strong
nourishing support system for the rest and of course most
people discount the importance of the roots because they're not
very glamorous they're down there covered under the ground you
don't see them they're not pretty people are more focused
on the nice flower the nice fruit that you get
from the tree or the nice foliage but not what's
necessary to sustain that so think about where in your
life that's true and I encourage you to summon the
courage to start unraveling that thread and looking for permanent
solutions rather than quick fixes because if you're like me
and if you're like a lot of people out there
then you've probably tried the quick fixes and they have
not been satisfying they've not been effective and if you
do this even though it's more work ultimately you're going
to create a sustainably happy life and all that work
you put in it's going to be like dividends that
it's going to be paying off to you for the
rest of your life get your career in place get
your finances in place get your fitness in place get
your relationships in place and all of that means getting
yourself in place so fix all the problems within you
all the issues that you have to allow you to
fix those things and by no means am I saying
not to not to have what I call kind of
outer game solutions so obviously you're not going to just
drop 20 pounds just by getting a good career you're
probably going to need to actually go to the gym
as well and you're probably going to need to eat
healthy as well but those things will click into place
for you once you get other elements solved you
