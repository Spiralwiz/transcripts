hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're gonna talk about optimism okay welcome back so
let's crack into this optimism let's talk about why optimism
is important what optimism is some details about the different
aspects of optimism I think you're gonna find that very
interesting we can dissect it quite a bit this is
a topic that has been studied by by many researchers
in the positive psychology movement just very recently in the
last forty or thirty years and then we're gonna give
you some practical ways to start to actually build up
your optimism you want to be more optimistic yeah it's
awesome I love feeling optimistic I love being able to
look forward to my future so for me that's like
huge this exercise that I'm going to share with you
at the end of video it's gonna be huge so
stay with me it's simple but it's really powerful and
it's really gonna build up your optimism in a very
practical way all right so let's get into this so
first of all why is optimism something that we should
care about what's important about it well a lot of
the information I bring to here comes from dr. Martin
Seligman and he is one of the leaders the positive
psychology movement right now and he published a seminal work
I don't remember exactly what it was but it was
like 30 or 40 years ago he published this this
brilliant work and a book called learned optimism or what
he did is they he did a lot of research
about how optimism works and he looked at the effects
of optimism in business in the workplace and social situations
just in our private lives and he looked at all
the different variables that are involved he really broke it
down did the research found ways to actually build up
optimism and a lot of my information is coming from
there so one of the things that they found in
that research is they found that optimism is important for
success in life people that are more optimistic or just
more successful why is this the reason this is I
think ultimately we'll boil it down to here is to
distance when you're able to remain optimistic you're able to
stick with the process you're able to stick on the
path and you're able to bust past many more obstacles
that a pessimistic person would and you simply see more
opportunities you try more things and when that happens what
do you think does that make you more successful or
does that make you less successful right how could you
possibly be unsuccessful if you are super super persistent if
you're super super hopeful if you're willing to try every
Avenue if you're willing to do it all and you're
just willing to go all out and test it all
and still remain hopeful and still remain happy still remain
cheerful still remain confident I mean isn't that something that
you want to have as a personal trait I mean
I know that that sounds awesome I can just see
all the different places in my life where I failed
where I've fallen off track or I wasn't able to
to do as much as I wanted at the gym
or with my nutrition or with my job or my
career or some project that I started you know things
that I procrastinated on you can just see that if
I was more if I was more optimistic in those
situations I would have been able to push through a
little bit more just a little bit more and sometimes
that's all it takes is just a little bit extra
push one extra obstacle that you get through and then
you get a new resurgence like a second a second
wind of motivation and then that carries you through but
in the meantime you need that optimism so some of
the most successful people that you find in the world
and in some of the biggest corporations and companies out
there are extremely optimistic and they did Studies on this
and they actually proved it and a lot of companies
actually started to use this research and started to give
their employees tests when they were hiring employees they would
look and they would specifically test the employee not on
their technical skills but they would test the employee on
his outlook on life and on his optimism level and
they would hire the people that are more optimistic for
example they did this in the insurance industry in the
life insurance industry because what they found is that for
example for salesman optimism is one of the leading factors
one of the critical factors for their sales success and
what they found is that the people the salesman in
a life insurance company for example the ones that outsell
everybody else those are usually the most optimistic and why
is that because selling life insurance requires a lot of
optimism you have to do a lot of cold calling
you have to be out there talking with clients with
prospects and that whole process can be very demoralizing if
you go out there and you call one client and
that client rejects you and he says no I'm not
interested in life insurance and you get a second client
who says no and a third client and a fourth
client and then ten clients later most of us most
normal people would be so demoralized that we would say
screw this this this cold calling business doesn't work it's
too painful if like I get rejected too much and
so we would get so hurt by it that we
would quit because we would assume that because we got
10 rejections that we'll keep getting rejections but the optimistic
person he'll get 10 rejections and he'll say to himself
okay I guess Henry Jekyll's but this 11th one this
11th called this might be the one and then sure
enough he makes that 11th call and he nails it
he lands it and so he he gets his success
and then he just builds on it and builds on
it and builds on it and this is actually very
practical you can see this in sales numbers for the
top salesman in the country you've got to be very
optimistic if you're doing cold call sales so you can
just see how this might translate and apply to something
that you're doing in your life right how many projects
have you fallen off track with how many diets right
exactly how many things do you know you need to
be doing but you're not doing them because you tell
yourself that they're not going to work that you've tried
it but it's never gonna happen that's you being pessimistic
so being optimistic is great for your success level and
performance level I think it's also good because it just
makes you feel good when you're optimistic you feel better
you're more cheerful and it helps you avoid things like
depression depressive episodes nobody likes to be in those in
those holes right all right so what is optimism ultimately
you know if we define optimism it's basically a hopeful
outlook for the future if you think that your future
is gonna be better than today then you're gonna be
optimistic you're gonna be hopeful you know good stuff is
coming if you expect bad stuff to be coming in
your future then you're gonna be depressed you're gonna be
sad you're gonna be miserable you're gonna be afraid so
that's really the the bottom difference Martin Seligman one of
the brilliant things that he did in his research is
he said that optimism is explained and past him as
an adoptive is he really studied both sides of this
one coin he said that the difference is explanatory style
it's the way that you explain and the way that
you attach meaning so the things are happening to you
in your life so it's not that the you know
the pessimistic and the optimistic person they both face the
same challenge so they face exactly the same challenge but
the question is what kind of meaning do you assign
to it because it's it's all in the meanings that
you assign a thing's an optimistic person will get the
same bad situation he'll get that same flat tire on
the way to work but he'll assign a different explanation
and from meaning to it that a pessimistic person would
and there are there are three different types of explanatory
style that lead to either positivism or pessimism so let's
go over those the first is permanence how permanent is
the problem so let's say you get a flat tire
how permanent is that problem will the problem last forever
so an optimist will say well it's just a flat
tire I mean in the grand scheme of my life
it means nothing just a flat tire we'll fix it
in a few hours who cares tomorrow won't be an
issue what about the pessimist well the pessimist will start
to say oh my god I got a flat tire
flat tire how am I gonna fix this how long
is it gonna take to fix and in his mind
he builds it up as though this is gonna last
for his whole life it seems like it's something that's
gonna be permanent it's never gonna be fixed maybe a
flat tire is not the best example for that because
I think most rational people would say that yeah a
flat tire can be fixed pretty quickly but how about
something like a divorce or a breakup in a relationship
well an optimistic person would say yeah I broke up
I really loved that person it didn't work but you
know there's there's plenty of fish in the sea we'll
go out there this is just one relationship I'm gonna
have many many relationships in my whole life so in
the grand scheme of things it's not a permanent problem
the pessimist what does he do he looks at that
relationship and this is the end of his life he
sees that he's gonna become he's gonna be single and
miserable for the rest of his life he's probably gonna
die loan nobody loves him and it's just gonna be
that way forever right it's permanent when you think that
a problem is permanent you don't want to take any
action to change it you're totally powerless you're totally a
victim because now you have nothing for to look forward
to the optimist he looks forward to a nice relationship
in a few months the pessimist he looks forward to
being miserable for the rest of his life what you
know who's gonna feel better who's gonna go out there
and be more resourceful pretty clear right how about the
next point pervasiveness all right so this is the second
explanatory style pervasiveness and this basically asks the question of
you know will this undermine everything how pervasive is the
problem so if you get a flat tire how pervasive
is it how much does it affect every category of
your life an optimist will say well it's just a
flat tire all it really affects is right now today
so maybe I'll be late for work and I'll miss
something at work and that's just that's just work really
the rest of my life is unaffected my relationship is
great unaffected my my hobbies are great my health is
great totally unaffected so only this little category of life
is affected by this flat tire this you know my
job that's it and even there it's still limited it's
not like I'm gonna lose my job because of that
so that's the optimist what is the pessimist thing the
pessimist starts to spread this around like a cancer it
starts to spread so what should have been classified as
a local problem becomes a global problem now all the
sudden a flat tire well you start to think well
the flat tire means I'm gonna be late for work
and if I'm late for work I'm gonna get yelled
at there and that's gonna put me in a bad
mood then I'm gonna come home and then I'm gonna
be in a bad mood and I'm gonna be late
for dinner and then my wife is gonna yell at
me and we're gonna have a fight again and then
because of that I'm gonna miss the gym and the
kids are gonna be upset and then it added up
and it just kind of spreads out and basically your
whole life now has been tainted by a very local
phenomenon which was a flat tire we can also see
how significant this is right how much more resourceful is
the optimistic person when they can limit the problem and
contain it within a small little area it literally is
like a cancer if you can contain that cancer you're
much better off than letting it spread through your whole
body okay and the third point of explanatory style is
personalization what the optimist does is whenever there is a
problem he tends to say that he is not responsible
for the problem and if there's something good that happens
he tends to take credit for it right so in
the situation if there's a flat tire what he'll say
up just bad luck i I drove over a nail
and got a flat tire no biggie it wasn't my
fault if something good happens to him like he gets
a promotion then he's gonna do the opposite he's gonna
say yeah that promotion I got that promotion because it
was me I went out there I worked my ass
off for a whole year I I beat my sales
figures now I got this awesome promotion that was me
that was all me that's what an optimist does what
does a pessimist do a pessimist does the inverse of
that that means that when there is this flat tire
the pessimist is gonna look at it say god dammit
I should have been like why wasn't I more careful
I should have been more careful and not driven on
that nail and in his mind he blames himself and
then the reverse of it is when he asked something
positive happened he tends to be humble and like he
gets that promotion he says well yeah I got that
promotion sure I worked for a year but in the
end anyone could have gotten that promotion it wasn't really
me it was it was a company the company needed
someone and I was the only one who fit the
bill so really I can't take credit for that promotion
it was it was really the right timing the right
situation nothing to do with me so he's not he's
not invested in positive stuff this is this is a
really you know another really big distinguishing factor between positive
positive thinking people and negative thinking people and you can
see how how much this affects your willingness to go
out there and take action in the world when you
think that you're responsible for everything that's good and not
so much responsible for anything that's bad then you want
to go out there and you want to act and
you feel like hopeful and if you're thinking the opposite
and you don't want to act you feel miserable you're
beating yourself up you're feeling guilty all the time so
the question is ultimately what is your explanatory style you
can actually get tested on this there are tests out
there that will assess you on the different levels of
your explanatory style and you can actually do things to
improve it a little bit too much to get into
here getting all into all the tactics there but the
question is you know how how optimistic are you about
your future what do you think about your future right
now are you hopeful for the next month are you
excited about all the stuff it's gonna happen to you
in the next six months how about in the next
year how about in the next decade are you excited
for the next decade of your life if you're not
then you're not being very optimistic and that is something
that can be tweaked this is something that can be
worked on with a few little techniques and actually I'm
gonna give you a great technique right now that is
gonna help you turn this around so if you're not
optimistic this will help you and if you are optimistic
this will take you to the next level if you
do this exercise so the key point that I want
you to take away here is that optimism can be
stoked up like a fire you know you've got a
campfire and it's got a dying down and then you
can blow air on it you can put some more
kindling on it and then it'll spark up and flare
up well that's what you can do with your optimism
so right now maybe you're just feeling kind of at
a at a at a baseline level where you're not
too pessimistic about your future but you're not too excited
either so what I recommend you do is you do
the following exercise I want you to take your journal
piece of paper something or you can write and I
want you to write out and list 30 things that
you're most excited about in the next year that you're
gonna do 30 things that you're super super excited about
maybe it's that vacation you want to take maybe it's
that relationship that you hope to get into maybe it's
that promotion at work you know you're gonna get maybe
as having all your credit card debts eliminated maybe it's
starting that new business of yours or starting that dream
project or losing some weight whatever it is but start
writing it down and be as specific as possible 30
things that you're excited about achieving in the next year
that really really motivate you try to focus on the
ones that get you excited this is simple like that
this is all this is the the whole exercise sit
down actually do this take 20 minutes or whatever it
takes you to write all this stuff out what and
notice notice how you feel notice how you feel right
now notice how you feel before you do the exercise
and then I want you to notice how you feel
after you finish it if you're like me you're gonna
feel so much more optimistic you're gonna feel energized you're
gonna feel happier going to feel alive you're gonna feel
like there's something to your life because your future now
is bright and it's right here before your eyes you've
articulated it you're you've laid it out very clearly and
it's right before you I recommend you do this exercise
more than once do it right now but also continue
to do it throughout your life continue to do it
do it at least once a month do it even
once a week because it's gonna get you connected back
to the stuff that's exciting to you and it's also
gonna you know your mind is gonna brainstorm and come
up with new stuff to put on that list and
you can be brainstorming about what you're gonna be doing
for the whole year but you can also localize it
down and you can you can shorten the time frame
to something like the next month or even what you're
gonna be doing over the next week or even today
even today you can do it just like what are
five things you're gonna be excited about doing today if
you do that exercise in the morning just for five
minutes what are the five things you're gonna be excited
about doing today they'll probably even take you just two
minutes to do that you're gonna feel you gonna be
much more excited about your day and you're gonna be
much more optimistic alright so this is what I've got
