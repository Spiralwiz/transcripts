            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/iwE4NhPv8aQ' target='_blank'>10 Important Things You Don't Know You Want</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Desire for Existential Magic</b>: Leo Gura discusses the desire for a rejuvenated perspective on life. This perspective is about recapturing the sense of magic and wonder one had as a child when every aspect of reality, even the mundane, seemed fresh and exciting. Gura explains that this magic often gets lost as we grow older due to social conditioning and acclimation to reality. He emphasizes that we now take reality for granted and are disengaged from the inherent magic it holds. He argues that the ability to see the world anew, with childlike wonder and appreciation for the simple things in life, is a deep desire that many of us are not consciously aware of. Yet, it is something that can immensely enhance the quality of our lives if realized.
</li><li><b>Mindset aligned with Desires and Life Strategy</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes how crucial it is to be clear about one's desires when one is trying to accomplish anything, particularly in terms of self-improvement. He warns that not knowing or being mistaken about what you truly want can lead you astray and make you waste years of your life pursuing things that do not bring true fulfilment. Leo explains that our desires form the foundation of our life's strategy, and, therefore, misguided desires can result in a flawed strategy. He encourages viewers to question their wants and ensure they are truly aligned with their authentic selves.
</li><li><b>Desire for an effortless life</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that people want their lives to flow naturally and effortlessly, without any resistance, guilt or rules. He suggests that this is an achievable goal through self-development and people should start strategizing towards this.
</li><li><b>Value of authenticity</b>: Leo suggests that people deeply desire to behave authentically, in an uninhibited, spontaneous way. They want to act without fear or reserve, to interact authentically in relationships, at work and everywhere in between. Leo differentiates between the desire to be authentic for manipulative or neurotic reasons and being truly, unconsciously authentic. Unpacking this complex desire, Leo acknowledges that there's work involved to understand and achieve it.
</li><li><b>Authentic vs. inauthentic desires</b>: According to Leo, everyone has both authentic and inauthentic desires. Inauthentic desires such as craving money, relationships, sex, success, or knowledge may dominate one's mind and block their authentic desires. Recognizing one's true desires and then striving towards them is key.
</li><li><b>The dispassionate mind</b>: Leo discusses the desire for a dispassionate mind, which isn't unemotional or robotic, but detached and even-handed towards everything. Unlike the usual craving for passion and extremes, this mind treats all aspects of reality, good and bad, evenly. Achieving this state might be counterintuitive and challenging, but Leo suggests it's worth striving for.
</li><li><b>Being unattached from ideology</b>: Leo identifies the deep desire for intellectual freedom and detachment from all ideologies, theories, and belief systems. He suggests this state of open-mindedness is hard to achieve as people usually fiercely defend their pet theories and beliefs. Realizing the unnecessary suffering caused by clinging onto ideologies can bring someone closer to reality.
</li><li><b>Sobriety and lucidity</b>: Leo suggests that people truly desire to be fully sober, not from alcohol or chemicals, but from unconsciousness. This state of heightened awareness and consciousness, similar to lucidity during a dream, can potentially offer powerful experiences and new reality perspectives.
</li><li><b>Desire for Mind Silence</b>: Leo Gura highlights the desire to experience reality without any thoughts, judgments, or theories, saying that we wish for total mental silence. He mentions that most people's minds are continually active, creating a series of thoughts. Experiencing reality without a single thought, as per Gura, can be incredibly powerful and fulfilling, but this might only be realized after years of self-development.
</li><li><b>Desire to be Nobody</b>: Gura emphasizes that people inherently desire to become nobody, discarding all personal history, attachments, identities, and societal labels. This concept is regarded as counterintuitive since most people believe that self-development is about enhancing ones identity. But Gura suggests that what people truly want is to shed all aspects of their identity, even the ones they like, and return to a blank state, just like they were during childhood.
</li><li><b>Understanding Samadhi</b>: Gura introduces the concept of Samadhi, a Hindu term that refers to a state where observers merge with the object they are observing or perceiving. Explaining it as a direct experience, not an intellectual endeavor, he underlines that these experiences feel amazingly fulfilling. However, he notes that achieving Samadhi requires significant concentration, meditation, and mental development.
</li><li><b>Pursuit of Truth</b>: Gura asserts that one of the core desires people have, but do not realize, is the pursuit of truth. Suggesting that most people are lost pursuing comfort, security, and success, he states that what they genuinely want is a life committed to truth. However, this is difficult due to a lack of understanding of what truth is and the prevailing belief that most people already possess the truth.
</li><li><b>Desire for Truth</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the significance of truth in one's life, which is not referring to beliefs, philosophies, or ideologies. Truth is about stripping away all preconceived ideologies and not setting conditions upon it. He explains that understanding truth is a personal journey, and once it's found, it could diminish the false desires that dominate one's life.
</li><li><b>Desire to be a Benevolent Force in the World</b>: Gura suggests that deep down, everyone has a desire to contribute positively to human society and realitythe desire to be a force of compassion, giving, and love. He points out that becoming a benevolent force is a personalized journey tied to one's life purpose. Whether it's through art, teaching, or medicinethere's a unique path for everyone.
</li><li><b>Shifting Focus from Taking to Giving</b>: Gura highlights a desire to shift from a life of taking to a life of giving, pointing out that while most people obsess about taking things for themselves (money, career advancement, status), actual fulfillment comes from being an outpouring force of benevolence. 
</li><li><b>Desire for a Simple and Natural Lifestyle</b>: Gura concludes by discussing the deep desire for a simple, organic, and natural lifestyle, devoid of the usual clutter and noise from modern culture and technology. He encourages paring down and simplifying one's life, focusing on healthier living, connecting with nature more, and eliminating unnecessary distractions.
</li><li><b>Reiterated Importance of Authentic Desires</b>: Leo further emphasizes that what we think we want (pleasure, success, status, material possessions, and knowledge) do not truly fulfil us and act as distractions from the ten core things we genuinely desire. He accentuates being mindful of the false, hedonistic wants that do not lead to true satisfaction or growth, indicating that pursuing them can backfire. 
</li><li><b>Inability to Recognize Misdirection</b>: Leo asserts that many people are so deeply lost in pursuing their delusional and arguably harmful goals that they often don't realize they are lost and in denial. He criticizes that most people are attempting to navigate their lives based on poor understanding of their psychology and consciousness, thus leading to repetitive and predictable mistakes.
</li><li><b>Purpose of Real Self-Development</b>: Gura explains that true self-improvement does not involve enabling one's delusions but helping them realize their goals may be neurotic and immature, leading them in the wrong direction. He aims to challenge people's actions and existing life choices, encouraging them to question their priorities, desires and strategies in life.
</li><li><b>Fear and Resistance towards the Real Wants</b>: Leo contends that people are often scared of realizing and achieving their real wants due to fear and resistance. He suggests the necessity for a deep understanding of oneself and acknowledges that it may involve years of denial and resistance before recognizing the actual paths to self-improvement.
</li><li><b>Reliance on External Solutions</b>: Leo criticizes to impact a reliance on future external solutions like a pill to solve people's myopia can have, rejected this as it rejects self-accountability and growth. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Staying on Course</b>: Leo encourages viewers to sign up for his newsletter to stay on track with self-actualization, asserting the need for consistency in personal growth and the importance of avoiding complacency that could waste decades of their lives.
