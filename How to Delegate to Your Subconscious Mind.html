hey what's up this is Leo here for actualize org
and right now since I'm standing in this deep chasm
I want to talk about the chasm of your subconscious
mind and how you can structure the things that you're
trying to master the skill sets that you're trying to
master your life and all the areas of your life
that you're trying to master how to take that and
delegate it from your conscious mind into your subconscious mind
so you get much better results but you're much less
stressed about it all right so what am I really
talking about here I've been thinking a lot lately about
this topic of the subconscious mind and I've been contemplating
and meditating on this idea that in fact I do
have a subconscious mind and also conscious mind and that
the two workings handle but as I thought more and
more about this I started to realize that there's really
an illusion at play here and the illusion is that
everything that we do is very conscious and is self-directed
and is willed right when in fact most of the
stuff that happens in your life most of stuff that
you were the cause of is really stunning from your
subconscious which has been programmed and conditioned through years and
years of repetition and experience right and it's that repetition
that is the mechanism by which you get stuff from
the conscious to the subconscious and this is a very
brute force type of process there's not much thinking that
you can going into it really anything that you repeat
over and over and over again will bubble down from
your conscious into your subconscious and then will become habitual
become instinctual become easy for you the reason I also
started thinking about this is because I was thinking about
my public speaking skills right now I'm trying to work
on that trying to get honed down trying to work
on my vocal tonality try to make sure that when
I'm talking I'm talking without any filler material like words
like arms and hands and you knows and kind of
and so I've been working a lot on that and
I would knew that by going through to Toastmasters and
as I'm doing that every week I'm slowly saying that
my skills are improving and improving and improving and what
I'm also noticing is that there's there's like a baseline
level of stuff that I do when I speak that's
just there and this is the stuff that's stemming from
this from the subconscious so for example the hand gestures
that I tend to use the types of language that
I try to use certain expressions my vocal tonality the
emotion that I put into things just the way I
even stand and carry myself the way I move around
stage the types of things that I like to talk
about a lot of these are subconscious so this is
like the base of my public speaking skills so if
someone just calls me up at random to go and
speak I don't have a lot of time to prepare
there's going to be that baseline level on top of
that though there's that extra conscious level this is the
intent that you have so when you're going up to
speak this is the stuff that you want to be
working on or the stuff that you want to get
across so maybe when you're speaking you want to make
sure that this time as you're giving your speech you're
using a lot of different vocal tonality right you're you
have pauses you have quiet quiet expressions you have loud
expressions you have emotions maybe that's something you're working on
and so you bring that conscious intention into the delivery
of your speech but the thing that I've noticed is
I've been putting a lot of emphasis on this idea
that everything I do is really conscious and then I'm
putting a lot of effort into it so it's like
if I don't get it done it won't get done
that kind of thinking right so I'll prepare a lot
for the speech when I go up there I have
all these different points in my mind that I want
to hit things that I want to work on so
I want to work on the vocal tonality and then
I want to also work on my body language and
then I also want to work on moving across stage
and then I also work on work on the content
that I'm delivering so all these different things and then
what it tends to do is it tends to make
your mind go crazy because your conscious mind can only
handle so much and what I found with public speaking
is that what you got to do and getting good
at something like public speaking is really a process of
bringing conscious ideas down into the subconscious that's how you
get good at it and you do that by repetition
so maybe you go out you give 10 speeches in
a row and all those tense features focus on vocal
tonality as you do that what's going to happen is
you're going to put a lot of intention into your
vocal tonality you can actually be monitoring as you're speaking
you're going to be thinking yourself oh I use such
a tone there I use such a tone here after
the speech are going to be analyzed you're going to
do it all this consciousness analysis and as you do
that as you think about it and you keep doing
it over and over and over again what's going to
happen is you're gonna start to ingrain and internalize that
stuff so that ten weeks later after you give ten
speeches if you're giving one per week what's going to
happen is you're just going to come up on stage
and all of a sudden naturally you're going to start
to get the tonality correct because what's happened is you
don't need to consciously think about anymore it's bubbled down
you just repeated it so much now this is an
example with public speaking but I think this applies almost
any skill or any part of your life that you
want to master whether it's the gym or your career
or a business that you're starting or anything else so
what is the trick here the trick is I think
and the point that I'm trying to make is they
it's okay to delegate stuff to your subconscious you don't
need to think that you hold everything up in here
you have ideas of where you want to go these
are your conscious intentions these may be your goals your
visions for yourself that's great but then also have trust
that ultimately stuff is going to bubble down and of
course it's not just going to bubble down automatically it's
only going to bubble down if you repeat it it's
repetition that's the mechanism of how to get stuff from
your conscious into your subconscious now this can be it's
such a simple point right there's not much to it
but a lot of people I think overlook this I
have a tendency to overlook this as well anything that
you want to get good at what I've discovered from
thinking about this is repetition repetition repetition anything you want
to get good at ask yourself are you am i
doing it repeatedly am i doing it every single day
am i doing it every single week am i doing
every single month right depending on what it is there
might be a different amount of repetition that you need
to do but it's just like memory if you want
to memorize something you got it drill it into your
head again and again and again and again and eventually
it will become unconsciously easy to recall and at that
point you have no problem right it's like your phone
number you just know it your phone number is in
your subconscious it's not in your conscious mind anymore or
like the multiplication table if I ask you what's two
times ten you know what it is you're not doing
some sort of mental arithmetic you're not calculating anything you're
not doing any kind of proof it doesn't even have
to be true you were just drilled in grade school
that two times ten is twenty and you just know
it right and you know that seven times seven is
forty-nine it's just been drilled into you but what is
13 times 13 you don't know probably because we've only
been drilled 10 up to 12 times 12 right so
this is an example of the power of your unconscious
mind and the Epiphany that I've really had is that
everything that I want to be good at like I
want to be good at public speaking I want to
be more confident I want to be better just better
socializer in social situations that aren't necessarily business-related I want
to be better at coaching I want to be better
shooting these videos all this stuff I realized that if
I want to get really good at if I want
to master it I just have to make sure that
I'm repeating it over and over again on a consistent
basis and if I'm doing that then I can take
the pressure off of myself and say okay great I'm
doing it I just trust that it'll get bubbled down
into unconscious because it will if you do something long
enough it will happen on the other hand if you're
not doing these repetitious types of practices with whatever you're
trying to get good at then you're going to struggle
because what's going to happen is you you're going to
try to keep that stuff in your conscious mind and
that's not going to give you the performance that you
want right think about an athlete think about like an
Olympic an Olympic athlete it's sometimes all inspiring to look
at them right maybe you look at a a world-class
football player or baseball player or a world-class gymnast or
like a tennis player or an Olympic lifter you know
any one of these are like a snowboarder if you
look at them and you see the kind of ability
that they have what's interesting is that ability is so
amazing to us as laymen because we don't we don't
do it we don't have that ability to do some
sort of quadruple backflip off some halfpipe on us with
it with a with a wooden board screw to our
feet right if we're snowboarders we can't do that but
on the other hand these people that have practiced this
consistently over and over and over again are able to
do it and not only that but they're able to
do it effortlessly and in fact their best at executing
that stuff when they're in the flow and they're completely
in the moment and they're not thinking about it and
if they start thinking about it that their performance actually
decreases that's why a lot of times athletes stress this
importance of getting in the flow getting in the zone
well how does this work it works again because it's
it's drilled into their subconscious and the way that they
do that is through massive massive repetition and if you
know anything about how athletes become world-class or how you
know how Olympic gymnasts train or how snowboarders train or
how world-class tennis champions train it's like it's it's insane
the drills that they go through they just drill again
and again and again and again they drill thousands upon
thousands of times until their mind just relents and it's
no longer conscious it's all subconscious it all bubbles down
and it's so automatic so instinctual so effortless for them
that they're able to go out there they're executing they're
having fun doing it because they're not struggling with it
consciously and they're also getting this amazing performance that top-class
so I think that this principle of just drilling and
repetition can be applied to to ordinary life most of
us are not a little big athletes and we don't
care to be but we want to be better in
our business we want to be better in a career
we want to be better in our fitness whatever it
is right you probably have some skills that you're working
on maybe a public speaking or whatever and the trick
there is to start thinking about delegating to your unconscious
mind and be grateful for the fact that most of
the stuff that's happening right now in your body is
being handled for you I mean how how freaking cool
is that right like right now I'm standing here my
heart is beating my lungs are pumping in oxygen while
I'm talking to you delivering this content I'm delivering the
content on the fly I haven't prepared any of this
stuff so it's just coming out my hands are moving
my body is balanced and my body knows how to
balance itself so I don't fall down at one point
all of this stuff was really tricky right when I
was when I was a couple of years old I
couldn't do that I couldn't walk I couldn't stand I
couldn't balance I couldn't talk the link the language that
I'm that I'm spouting out you right now I didn't
understand and now all of that is just completely effortless
and where is it all coming from it's all coming
from the subconscious and it's it's pretty interesting when you
think about this stuff they can get a little bit
spooky because you start to realize just how little of
yourself and your behaviors in your life you actually control
a lot of it is so much of it is
delegated you're like the CEO of this massive organization of
trillions of cells that are in your body doing all
this stuff and it's on one hand it's kind of
spooky that all this stuff is happening without your attention
being put on it on the other hand it's kind
of cool because it gives you the freedom to now
take that conscious awareness and focus it on the stuff
that you really want to focus it on and I
think that's the trick to being successful in life also
and be really good at personal development is figuring out
where are you going to put that conscious focus that
you've got those resources that you have where you going
to put those are you going to spend that on
on worrying about potential problems are you going to spend
that on fear are you gonna spend that on anxiety
are you gonna spend that on gossip that's going on
around in the office are you gonna spend it on
that kind of frivolous shallow pointless negative kind of thoughts
or are you going to focus that on creativity and
basically creating the kind of life that you want on
improving your fitness or your business or your career or
whatever it is that you want to improve and focusing
on that and feeding your mind with valuable information that
it can use to then produce the kind of results
that you want and ultimately when you do it enough
it all bubbles down to the subconscious and you become
awesome and that's something that like nobody can come take
away from you because the conscious stuff you know if
you're nervous if you're scared that stuff will just like
that that's something that when you're performing if if you're
trying to keep a couple of points in your mind
there's only a couple you can keep in there you
can't give a good performance when you're trying to keep
it all in there consciously but if you train and
train and train and train you can go out there
and effortlessly give an amazing performance unconsciously be in the
flow enjoy it and people are going to be really
satisfied with the kind of results that you deliver anyways
that's it this is the topic of how to delegate
from your conscious and subconscious so trust that that delegation
process will happen if you use repetition to drill it
into your mind you
