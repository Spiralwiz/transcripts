[Music] there's an isomorphism or similarity that i've noticed between
modern branding strategies and abusive intimate relationships especially ones that
women tend to fall into so this is just a
short little insight for you that might make a few
things click in your mind all right so here's how
this works so what do i mean by modern branding
a lot of people unless you've actually studied some marketing
don't realize what's really going on in sort of the
marketing ecosystem these days marketing has evolved quite a lot
in the last 50 years and it's gotten pretty advanced
and sophisticated to the point where there are like entire
ais and teams of of pr people who are crafting
these various marketing campaigns and different brands and so basically
in in the modern business and marketing world everything is
about branding it's all about creating a brand whether you're
selling a service or a product you got to create
a brand and this brand is not just about having
a logo but it's creating a sort of an identity
then marketing this identity making it popular amongst people creating
fans and subscribers to this identity whatever it is might
be an apple identity it might be a tesla identity
it might be a video game franchise like call of
duty or league of legends or or halo or elder
scrolls or it might be a movie franchise like star
wars or lords of the ring or game of thrones
or basically anything it might be a brand of toothpaste
crest toothpaste uh and so the point is to create
this brand the brand is supposed to be a marker
for the quality of this product relative to its competitors
in the industry so when you see a nintendo logo
at the store on a video game you expect something
from that more than just some generic studio you've come
to expect quality a certain quality from nintendo most of
nintendo's games you can reliably trust they're gonna be high
quality nintendo's doesn't really release buggy games that are incomplete
with bunch of gimmicks and loot boxes and things like
that to scam you and that if they keep doing
that they maintain the quality of their brand and then
you like that because other products and lesser brands in
the industry that are that they're competing with they're lower
quality they don't have that same level of integrity they
try to scam you rip you off in various ways
sell you defective products they don't honor their warranties or
their refund policies or the the product is incomplete when
you buy it something's wrong with it you're unhappy with
it etc right you've been burned by bad branded products
sometimes you buy a product with no brand on it
and it's okay it's no different than one with a
brand and it makes you even wonder why you even
care about brands but then sometimes you buy a no
brand product and it's garbage and then you realize oh
yeah i should have spent a little bit more for
the brand because that product would have lasted me for
a lifetime but this garbage i have to replace it
next year so this is a real thing notice yourself
encountering this in your life with cars games movies websites
and so on and so really modern businesses is about
building a brand developing a brand launching the brand popularizing
the brand and then ensuring the integrity of that brand
but you see what's the connection here what's the isomorphism
between that and intimate relationships toxic relationships well you see
there's really a trick that these companies are playing on
you the name of the game for most these companies
is to build this brand get you to become a
fan of this brand to fall in love with this
brand and then once you're hooked and once you fall
in love now they're going to exploit your love they're
going to milk you dry and the quality of the
brand will get diminished more and more and more and
more and more but because you're in love with it
you fell in love with its original state that it
was in slowly you end up being boiled alive like
a frog the proverbial frog in the boiling water you
don't even notice that this is happening and in fact
for many companies this is a a deliberate strategy that
they have whether consciously or unconsciously they're using this strategy
to extract as much money from you as possible and
this is very much what happens with abusive relationships because
when a woman and i mean men can also get
into abusive relationships but more common with women when a
woman gets into an abusive intimate relationship it doesn't start
out abusive it starts out romantic and beautiful and the
two of them are in love in all of this
but then over time once she fully falls in love
with him after sleeping with him a dozen times she
fully falls in love she commits to him and then
he uses this against her because he starts to sense
that oh well this woman is weak she has low
self-esteem she's attached to me now i can get away
with stuff now i don't have to treat her as
well i can insult her and be abusive to her
and she'll still stick around she'll justify it in her
mind as uh as just all that you know that's
just how he is i have to accept him as
he is i have to be more loving i'm not
being loving and accepting enough and so he keeps pushing
it and pushing it and pushing it and how far
he can push it is directly proportional to her level
of self-esteem and her boundaries and her respect for herself
because you see a woman with high self-esteem and high
boundaries and high self-respect as soon as you do that
to her once she'll tell you about it and she'll
call you out on it and as soon as you
do it two times she says if you do it
again i'm leaving and if you do a third time
she actually leaves and the man he senses that he
senses how serious she is and how willing she is
to enforce her boundaries in a relationship he sort of
tests the boundaries to see what he can get away
with how selfish he can be and if she lets
him he keeps he keeps uh being more and more
selfish and she keeps being more and more of a
doormat and then this can become very very toxic in
its most extreme forms so notice the similarity here what's
really happening is that the man is exploiting her love
and attachment to him in this situation and the the
company or the brand is also exploiting their customers loyalty
and love and attachment for the product or the brand
to to also be as selfish as they can get
away with so these brands are going to try to
be as selfish as they can because they're most these
companies are trying to maximize profits up to the point
where your cust their their customers will allow it and
tolerate it so let's give an example because this is
still very abstract so let's say a really good example
this is like with with disney and star wars so
the star wars fan base is one of the most
loyal fan bases in the world which is why it's
such a good example like star wars fans the true
hardcore fans they are so deeply in love with star
wars because of the original high quality of the star
wars brand stemming back from you know the original episodes
with george lucas sort of the vision behind them the
originality the novelty of them the execution the special effects
like it was groundbreaking visionary genius type of cinema work
back in the 70s and 80s um and then it's
it's kind of gone downhill from there but but the
fans they're living for that nostalgia and so now george
lucas has sold the brand off to to disney for
a couple billion dollars now disney owns it um and
of course doesn't it does disney really have a vision
first for for star wars do they really care about
the star wars universe per se no nobody no ceo
at disney gives a [ __ ] about the star
wars universe and he doesn't give a [ __ ]
about the fans either he cares about the money he
cares about extracting maximum money and so do the stockholders
and so do most of the advertising and pr people
that work for disney they don't give a [ __
] about the actual brand or the quality or the
stories or han solo they don't care all right um
but you as the fan if you're a hardcore star
wars fans you really care you're like you're invested in
the story you're invested so much you're willing to cry
over it it it pulls on your heartstrings just like
with with a woman in an intimate relationship when she
falls in love right she's not thinking logically or rationally
about the relationship she's not sitting there and doing a
kind of a cost-benefit analysis a cold starch logical left-brained
analysis of like well does this guy treat me well
could i find a better guy who's maybe going to
treat me better and be nicer to me and blah
blah blah no like no she she's fallen in love
and she has a sense of uniqueness and scarcity about
this guy she feels like well but he's the he's
my one true love and i won't be able to
find a replacement no other guy is as good as
this guy those other guys have their problems they're inferior
to this guy this sort of fantasy is built up
in your mind when you fall in love this sort
of illusion of uniqueness well the same thing happens when
you're a star wars fan you also start to rationalize
yourself like well yeah the the latest star wars you
know movies they're not they're not very good but hey
you know it's it's better than watching star trek or
something else and you know maybe maybe i have hope
i i hope that um that some creative visionary they'll
disney will hire some creative visionary that will come along
and we'll revitalize the star wars universe and we'll bring
it back to its glory days and recapture some of
that nostalgia and this nostalgia is this love really it's
like a drug you're addicted to it like a drug
you've literally as a star wars fan you've become a
drug addict and the drug is star wars and disney
knows this and they are the drug dealer and they're
going to keep they're going to keep supplying you and
tempting you with little bits here and there but the
drugs that they're giving you are these the purest highest
quality drugs no they're cutting these drugs with fentanyl and
other garbage because hey that gives them more drug gives
them more money and ultimately they don't care about you
they care about the prophets because they're selfish and they
were never in it to begin with for the love
they were in it for the money their love has
been corrupted by money what they love is money not
the art see what you want them to love as
a fan is you want them to love the art
of the story of the universe and so forth but
the people running these companies are not artists they're not
even creatives these are business people these are mbas who
have been taught how to extract and milk money through
modern marketing methods see so you see this also like
for example in the games industry latest example of that
would be cyberpunk the launch of cyberpunk a really really
good example because the cdpr the studio who made cyberpunk
um fan base you know comes from the witcher series
and people people loved the last witch or witcher 3
and so you know they sell millions and millions of
copies of this and and then people just sort of
developed this fantasy of cdpr is this this this non-sell
non-sellout high integrity company that is willing to make the
game that's you know the best for the players and
they don't care about money they're not like ea they're
not like blizzard some of these other companies who have
you know gone corrupt these the cdpr you know these
are like one of the last bastions of you know
of studios for the gamer and then of course they
they publish cyberpunk and everybody is shocked and surprised but
of course it's not shocking or surprising at all this
is exactly what you would expect them to do as
they grow bigger they lose track of the original passion
and love that they had and it becomes just about
profits and just success for the sake of success numbers
for the sake of sales numbers and then the brand
loses its original quality and value but if you're a
loyal cdpr fan and you're uh you know you're thirsting
you're just thirsty for any kind of deep sci-fi rpg
like you see that trailer for a sci-fi rpg and
then you see keanu reeves and you're just oh you're
a matrix fan and all this and you're just you're
in love you see you're hooked to it like a
drug that's what attachment is that's what neediness is when
you're needy whether with star wars or with sci-fi or
with a certain movie franchise or with even a certain
brand of food or in an intimate relationship usually what
ends up happening is that the other party senses this
and exploits it for his own advantage it's only natural
because the human psyche is wired to extract value and
to be as selfish as it can possibly get away
with and so if if you're not willing to stand
for your own values and principles and if you don't
have a spine against exploitation you will get exploited in
life that's how life works so it might seem here
that we're talking about trivial stuff like star wars and
cyberpunk you might say leo what is this got to
do with with spirituality or personal development um but it's
got everything to do with it it's attachment we're really
talking about attachment and how companies are using this to
exploit and abuse you just like some men might use
this to exploit interviews just like some women some women
can use this against men to exploit and abuse men
see like if you're a man who's deeply insecure about
his physical appearance and other things about yourself that you
don't like and you struggle with attracting women but you
have money let's say you have a good job like
you're a programmer or something you're earning low six figures
or high five figures and uh you find some woman
and she knows your weaknesses and she starts exploiting them
and she starts asking you for gifts and for vacations
and for fancy restaurants and she knows you'll pay because
you're so socially inept that you you feel just lucky
to have her and uh and so she'll exploit you
that way and she'll keep exploiting you that way and
in general women will keep exploiting you that way until
you develop some standards some self-respect you cure your insecurities
and attachments and then you become detached and then when
you become detached that's when you become powerful that's when
the situation reverses so really this is a lesson about
attachment versus detachment um neediness versus an abundance mindset you
see if you want to keep your favorite brands honest
and high quality you have to be willing to leave
as soon as they start cutting corners when bethesda publishes
fallout 76 you leave you don't be a desperate little
[ __ ] and keep buying their stuff and keep
talking about how you love the elder scrolls and you're
going to buy the next elder scrolls no you need
to have a level of detachment where you say [
__ ] bethesda and [ __ ] fallout and [
__ ] elder scrolls let's say let's see how their
next release does without my investment i'm gonna go play
other games now that's difficult to do because many of
you gamers that i know i'm a gamer i've been
a gamer i've probably played more games and studied games
more than most of you have i was a professional
game developer for a while so i know how this
works and i know that i know the passion that
games um inspire in people and you know many of
you listening to me right now you know you're you're
saying oh my god leo but but the next elder
scrolls i want it so badly i've been waiting for
it for a decade since skyrim where's my next elder
scrolls i'm gonna buy that thing i'm gonna pre-order that
thing well that's exactly what's gonna make the next elder
scrolls terrible probably when bethesda knows that they have 30
million loyal fans that will buy their next elder scrolls
no matter what is in it can you really be
surprised when you get disappointed by it when it comes
with loot boxes and gambling mechanics and advertisements and in-store
purchases and upsells and skins that cost 20 a piece
and other sorts of nonsense like this that is just
dumbed down where the actual soul of elder scrolls it's
the soul of elder scrolls has been lost years ago
these are some of the trade-offs and costs of mass
success and the bigger the corporation becomes the more uh
they chase after mass success and then the spirit of
the art and the work that you as a fan
fell in love with is lost this is sort of
the tragedy of the success of many companies is that
they do their best work when they are starving and
barely on the edge of survival when they get too
comfortable and fat and lazy they stop doing good work
because they don't need to anymore now they've got an
established brand they've got millions of customers that will buy
anything and kiss their ass and so of course they
can be lazy now they can cut corners and the
tendency of the human psyche is to always optimize for
energy conservation and to basically be as efficient as possible
so if your mind thinks you can get away with
being lazy in life it will be lazy and this
happens in relationships too you get into a comfortable groove
in a relationship and then you start to become lazy
you stop shaving you stop putting on makeup for the
other person you stop putting on perfume you stop taking
your loved one to dinner the way you used to
you stop giving her gifts she stops giving you blow
jobs and it just and then it deteriorates more and
more and more until eventually it's like you you are
both locked in this laziness spiral each one outlasting the
other not putting any effort anymore into the relationship and
then is there any wonder that you're disappointed with it
so one of the keys to life is first of
all develop detachment don't let anyone have anything over you
which means don't need anything too badly if you need
a video game too badly if you need a movie
series too badly if you need a certain brand of
food too badly you've already screwed up if you need
a job too badly you've already screwed up if you
need a girl or a relationship or sex too badly
you've already screwed up if you need a man too
badly if you need a marriage too badly you've screwed
up if you go into a business negotiation or you're
negotiating with an employer for a salary the one who
loses the negotiation or if you're buying a house or
you're selling a business the one who loses the negotiation
is the one who's most attached to closing the deal
and the one who wins the deal and gets the
best value is the one who is willing to walk
away without any worry of losing anything that's real power
learn that lesson and cultivate it across your whole life
become independent don't hinge your happiness or your feelings of
love on any external source because as you do that
source will then you'll become a slave to that source
whether it's a drug or alcohol or food or desserts
or soft drinks or cigarettes or video games you're going
to become a slave to that thing maintain your poise
detachment and independence and to do that you need to
all of those attachments into something deeper within yourself and
that's what spirituality is about you see spirituality is a
very practical thing if you're deeply grounded in your own
consciousness and you're able to love yourself and you're able
to love the world without attachments to various things and
various biases this leaves you in a perfectly poised centered
place from which you can act maintaining your own integrity
enforcing your own values having a high sense of self-esteem
and you're able to be very effective in dealing with
people and when people cross your boundaries you quickly enforce
them and you put them in their place and then
you don't get exploited and abused by people not by
salespeople not by family members not by lovers not by
your children people need to know that you're serious people
need to know that you've got values and standards and
you're not going to compromise people need to know that
if they cross you once you they'll get a warning
if they cross you twice they'll get a serious warning
and if they com if they cross you a third
time that's it three strikes they're out you cut them
out of your life you're not going to be giving
them fourth and fifth and sixth and tenth chances to
redeem themselves you're you're a busy person you got a
life to live you got a life purpose you got
you got something going on in in your life you
got values that you're trying to live by and people
need to sense that that's what makes you strong and
powerful and then people will look up to you because
they'll see you like this rock or this anchor this
is what makes you a powerful leader and it's difficult
to do that because a lot of times we fall
into this notion of sort of a false feminine compassion
where we are just compassionate to everybody even when they
are abusive to us no that's not what love means
there is a higher love the higher love is what
i'm talking about is maintaining your poise at integrity and
sometimes that means putting someone in their place cutting them
out of your life not shopping with a certain brand
or company anymore because they've crossed the line and not
taking [ __ ] from people not being a doormat
that is a higher love that is a love and
an honoring of your own highest self allowing you to
maintain your autonomy and power which you need to live
the highest most loving way in your life you think
you're being maximally loving by letting all of these people
exploit you and walk all over you no that is
not the highest love and it's also not serving them
because when you put them in their place when they
cross you when you enforce boundaries this actually wakes them
up because they realize ah i can't keep acting like
a selfish [ __ ] i can't keep exploiting people
it's not an effective strategy and then that forces them
to rethink their ways whereas if if you're going to
be bending over backwards for this person that's not going
to help them to wake up that's not going to
help them to find love within themselves that's just going
to make them exploit you in lazy ways make sense
contemplate this and think about all the ramifications this has
across your life this goes way beyond star wars or
game of thrones or whatever favorite franchise you have this
is some this is some deep stuff and this will
save you lots of money this will save you heartbreak
this will save you from terrible divorces and abuse and
current artists exploiting you there are a lot of people
who have had their lives completely ruined because all they
did was just naively tolerate others gradually exploiting them more
and more and more and more whether it was their
lovers or their family even their family members even your
family members can do this to you or within business
within finance or your employer can do this to you
how do you get a good salary and a good
position with your employer you have to have some backbone
you have to be willing to negotiate and challenge them
on your true worth how much does your employer really
value you or are they lowballing you and trying to
pay you as little as possible and give you as
little as possible while you're slaving for them like a
dog see and this takes courage and this is difficult
i know because by my nature i'm a very non-confrontational
person i really don't like confrontation if i'm given the
choice between a confrontation and just walking the other way
i'll just walk the other way and i was that
way for a long time in my life [Music] but
also you live that way and you start to realize
the the downsides of that and that sometimes confrontation is
important and if you're not willing to ever get into
a bit of a confrontation then really what that shows
you is that you're too much of a coward you're
too scared what others think of you how others judge
you you're too fearful of standing up to authority or
to others who are stronger than you and when you
do that people don't respect you and they exploit you
even further and then you stop respecting yourself too and
then you start to feel bad about yourself and you
start to feel unworthy so this is about raising your
standards and pushing yourself growing yourself if right now you're
sort of a people-pleaser person and you've been very non-confrontational
in your life what would really help you to grow
is to get into a few confrontations now of course
you have to be careful about how you do that
i am not giving you a license to be an
[ __ ] or to abuse others because you can
certainly swing it in that direction you got to do
it carefully with certain restraint and moderation but sometimes the
confrontation is what's necessary that's not a license for violence
or for name calling just the ability to confront somebody
on their [ __ ] or on them exploiting you
or manipulating you without being just completely triggered and angry
flying off the handle in a rage but just in
a sort of a calm grounded way calling someone out
on their [ __ ] is a very powerful and
important life skill and it's difficult to develop that if
you're a non-confrontational person by your nature just by your
personality type or whatever the way you were raised you
were taught to be polite and so forth um but
think of how much this is holding you back in
your life and so really the most important reason that
you should actually start to get a little bit more
confrontational play around with it test it out is because
actually this is something that is missing in the core
of your personality this is something you have to develop
you have to be willing to stand up for your
values for your highest ideals for what you know is
right for your intuitions and don't let others [ __
] you or bully you or fool you with their
stories and excuses because that's what will happen a lot
of times is that people always make excuses and rationalizations
for their behaviors and then you start to buy into
it because sometimes you're you're actually a decent person and
you want to give somebody the benefit of the doubt
you want to be merciful but then they exploit your
mercy and your kindness so by all means be kind
be merciful these are these are actually very powerful qualities
they're going to become all the more important as you
grow spiritually but don't be so naive about them that
you think that love and kindness and goodness and mercy
means that people just do anything and you put up
with it that's not what love means there is a
higher love a more nuanced a more complicated love such
that like for example with with children you know you
might think well if my child wants some candy the
most loving thing to do is just to give him
candy all the time but that's you know you know
that's not the most loving thing to do if you
really love your child then sometimes you gotta deny him
the candy and he might cry and get angry at
you but you got to be strong enough in your
conviction that you got to be able to hold that
poise and hold what you know to be right and
true now of course you could be wrong in certain
situations and so how do you know if if you're
doing it out of an arrogance and stubbornness or you're
doing out of a genuine integrity well that's very difficult
to to make that distinction for that you need to
really be deeply grounded in in your own values and
you got to be wise and mature and you got
to do a lot of spiritual work personal development work
as well to make those distinctions and you could still
be wrong so there's also a fine balancing act you
got to do between enforcing your boundaries and also being
too perfectionistic and too dogmatic so the balance is very
important you have to you have to allow people their
imperfections and you have to allow people to make mistakes
so you can't expect everyone to to always live up
to your standards too that that also becomes a problem
in a different way but but in this episode we're
specifically concerned about those situations where people are abusing and
exploiting you see and then really the biggest payoff you
get out of this out of all this if you
if you work on this and you actualize it is
that you get a strong sense of self-esteem and a
sort of a security in life you feel secure because
you know that even if something bad happens you'll be
able to face that challenge whereas if you fall into
a sort of a cycle of always avoiding and avoiding
and avoiding and avoiding confrontation that makes you more and
more fearful it makes you feel weaker and less and
less effective and more like a victim and this can
get very very bad where you can really spiral into
a into a deep black hole of victim mentality and
learned helplessness and then you lose your agency and sovereignty
in the world and you're not able to build and
to create your life the way you want you're not
able to express yourself the way you want and by
doing that you sell out your soul and then you
become a zombie and then your life doesn't go so
good then you get depressed then you start wondering why
life is so bad and unfair well you got to
take responsibility for this stuff right and it all comes
back to taking responsibility for your own weaknesses the reason
this is happening to you is because there are weaknesses
inside of your psyche that you refuse to confront and
take responsibility for and to correct and life is giving
you signals as to where you're weak you're weak in
relationships you're weak when confronting people you're weak when you're
being sold to by some marketer on the phone and
you're too afraid to tell him to [ __ ]
off and so like a sheep you just listen to
him and listen to him and then eventually you buy
his product that you know you don't even want but
you just buy it anyways just to be nice just
to get them off the phone so one of the
biggest misconceptions about spirituality is people people construe spirituality as
just like the turning of the other cheek all the
time and being very meek and letting others have their
way with you the problem though is that when you
let others have their way with you really what you're
allowing is you're allowing the flourishing of unconsciousness and devilry
in the world if you don't stand up to the
devils in the world who will is that really aligned
with the highest love spirituality requires courage and strength a
lot of courage and strength is required against the opportunism
and conveniences of pure pragmatic material survival in your life
there will be forces pulling you in 10 different directions
trying to corrupt you within business within art if you're
an artist within school within the education system within academia
within the nonprofit world within relationships within your family there
will be corrupting forces pulling on you these forces will
be beckoning you and luring you with sweet promises of
easy money sex and love and pleasure and comfort and
convenience and if you're not deeply grounded in yourself and
in consciousness and in wisdom and in truth you're going
to be tempted into all of these sorts of shortcuts
we might say these are shortcuts to happiness hey just
take this drug or hey just let's let's scam our
customers a little bit next month or like let's cheat
on our taxes or let's uh let's uh let's cut
the quality of our product switch to a lower cost
supplier the customer won't know but this catches up with
you eventually the customers catch on eventually your partner catches
on they leave you they stop doing business with you
it ruins your reputation and ultimately you've debased yourself you've
lost your poise and now you can't even respect yourself
it's very easy because we're such social creatures to get
tugged in all these different directions by peer pressure your
responsibility is to be grounded in yourself and to maintain
your poise grounded in truth and consciousness and love independent
of what other humans are doing around you because the
majority of humans around you are going to be doing
devilry of various forms they're going to be engaged in
group think and ideology and mob mentality and every fiber
of your being is going to is gonna beckon you
to jump on the bandwagon onto some new stupid trend
whether it's some new cryptocurrency that everybody is hyping up
and buying or some ponzi scheme that somebody is selling
or some get rich quick scheme and you got to
be wise enough to see that none of these things
are the genuine deal these are fakes these are houses
of cards they're lies they're deceits designed by the ego
mind to perpetuate itself and that you are going to
commit to grounding yourself in something deeper and then you
live from that place and then this is what makes
you a remarkable human being because almost no human being
actualizes this in their life because they're just living down
the path of least resistance you
