hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about how to deal with
difficult and toxic people so let's talk about how to
deal with people in your life who are bringing you
down these are people that I call either difficult or
I like the word toxic so what's the secret with
dealing with these types of people because these types of
people can destroy your life there's really a spectrum a
spectrum of toxicity of other people in your life sometimes
you have mildly toxic people who are just more like
an annoyance or frustration but then it can get so
bad on the other end on the other end of
the spectrum that it really gets into abusive territory just
feel like very dysfunctional territory and one of the things
that's really key to understand about your life is that
you are like a sponge and no matter how personally
developed you are how successful you are how happy you
are how optimistic you are if you are living in
a negative environment whether it's a negative physical environment but
here we're talking about negative relationships if you're living in
this kind of negative relationship environment then this is robbing
you of your potential and it's making basically making you
miserable and these people they're dragging you down because they're
constantly feeding you with negativity and pessimism and limiting beliefs
and maybe anger or other things and these are rubbing
off on you right because you're the sponge so you're
soaking it all in and it's affecting your psyche and
you have to work really really hard to counteract these
effects so in this video what I want to do
is want to cover some of the ways that you
can go about handling these kinds of people and it
give me different techniques and strategies basically my philosophy on
this is really simple it's the philosophy that life is
too short for dealing with difficult and toxic people I
mean like why why make life more difficult for yourself
life is already pretty challenging you're already working really hard
on your own life on your ownself why are you
bringing yourself down with these with these toxic people there's
like there's no reason for it right so my strategy
here and my solution ultimately is to get rid of
these people out of my life I want to live
a life where the people that are in my life
are supporting me encouraging me bringing and positivity they're building
they're building something with me rather than going against me
and so that's kind of the the ultimate solution Iowa
I really want to get to like the root cause
of it here because a lot of people what they
do what I see them doing is they're so stuck
like in the social matrix they're so worried about being
relied relying upon various social relationships that they're not willing
to get rid of these stalks of people out of
their lives and what this does is it just it
creates this like spiral of negativity that goes down and
down and down and it brings you with it and
there's no need to live a life like that in
fact what I'm gonna argue is that you can't really
self actualize you can't really create a powerful and happy
fulfilling life if you're surrounding yourself with these types of
folks Jim Rohn love Jim Rome has a lot of
great wisdom one of the most wise things that he
said was that you are the average of the top
five associates that you hang out with what this means
is that if you take and make a list of
all the people in your life and you write a
number down for how many hours per week you're spending
with with each one of those people and you then
rank everybody according to the number of hours you spend
with them the top five people that you spend the
most time with these are the people that have the
most influence on you it's a very simple theory basically
whoever you hang out with is we are going to
absorb into yourself and you kind of become the average
of all that well if this principle is true then
who do you want to surround yourself with positive empowering
people or negative disempowering people if you do this exercise
you actually write this out you actually tally up the
numbers you might be shocked to discover that you hang
out with some people a lot more than others you
might also be shocked to discover that some of those
people that you hang out with and spend five or
ten or even twenty hours a week with that those
are super negative super pessimistic super miserable and depressive anger
prone type of people and maybe that's why you're not
getting the success you want on your life is because
you're around these types of people all the time you're
stuck in this kind of environment if that's the case
then we'll help you sort that out right now let's
talk a little bit more about the types of people
that we're talking about here I want to get very
specific take the abstract bring it down into the concrete
so here are some of the people that qualify as
being toxic basically it can be anybody but here are
some categories that you really want to look out for
your boss your co-workers and/or business partners that you have
these are people that usually spend a lot of time
with because you put a lot of time into your
work so if these people are negative you really want
to watch out for that next is clients or customers
that you have if you're self-employed you're working with clients
and customers or if you're even working for somebody else
you might be working with clients and customers that are
toxic wanna watch out for those of course you want
to watch out for your friends what kind of circle
of friends are you keeping around you you have a
lot of choices about what kind of friends you keep
next is of course your intimate relationships girlfriend boyfriend wife
husband you got to really watch out for that because
of course you're you submit relationship is your most intimate
relationship so that's where you get the closest to the
other person it's also probably your relationship that you spend
the most time in or one of the most so
toxicity there is very is very damaging and finally and
this is the most difficult one really it's it's family
your mom your dad your brother your sister aunts uncles
cousins and of course your own children so this category
is a pretty broad and there's a lot of stuff
in here and it's difficult to deal with it because
family issues tend to be the most like sticky and
thorny issues because these are the people that are the
most difficult to cut from your life these are the
people that you grew up with these are the people
that you probably want to keep around for a long
long time to come so those are the categories right
and anybody that these categories didn't cover other types of
people they they can also be toxic basically anybody could
be toxic but these are the categories are the most
important to look at and then the next thing that
I want to get really clear on is what do
we mean by toxic what is toxicity actually mean because
this could mean different things to different people it's a
pretty subjective term let's break it down a little bit
here's what I consider toxic and these are the things
you really want watch out for one is depression people
who are very depressed feeling really down on themselves -
is negativity limiting beliefs there can be people that aren't
per se depressed but they're always pessimistic they're always casting
doubts they're always talking about how stuff can't happen stuff
won't work they're always playing the victim role and they've
got all these sorts of beliefs about how life can't
allow them to do what they want to do and
how it can't allow you to do what you want
to do see it like it starts to rub off
on you next is really dogmatic and close-minded people so
these are folks that are just like really really set
in their ways right they have certain sets of beliefs
maybe religious beliefs political beliefs business beliefs life beliefs and
they just they just have to have it that way
and they want you to fit into that one particular
mold that they're playing so they're playing a role they
want you to play the same role like really close
minded people next is anger prone people and violent people
so anger anger could be a spectrum you can have
mild forms of anger and then you can get worse
and worse and worse and really devolve into a full-out
violence or fights throwing objects like that kind of really
toxic stuff after that comes drama dramas horrible drama you
know those people there's always there's always something happening in
their life doesn't matter what the circumstances are they always
make it dramatic they always take a molehill they make
a huge mountain out of it it's always up and
down and up and down like it's predictable these people
just have a very turbulent dramatic lifestyle and that's just
like how they live but that's not how you want
to live and finally criminal activity maybe your friends are
involved in criminal activity maybe someone in your family is
maybe your someone at your job maybe your company is
involved with some sort of shady activities that you don't
wanna be sucked into but criminal activity is a really
dangerous one because once you have those types of people
around you you tend to get more and more sucked
into that and then you're prone to get involved with
that even if you didn't intend to from the very
beginning and those people can be like real leeches on
your life because their life is so upside-down that it
can't help just like rubbing off and infecting you so
that one is really important to consider as far as
Texas City goes and lastly I would say people with
addictions it could be hardcore addictions but even softcore addictions
so of course if you have people around you who
are using drugs and really involved with something pretty heavy
like that that's obviously very toxic but even more milder
forms of addictions maybe your friends are addicted to television
or addicted to video games and they suck you into
it too or maybe they're addicted to food they go
out and eat all the time maybe your family is
addicted to food I know that's how my family was
so that stuff can be really toxic to you and
keep you from from progressing and breaking out of those
negative habits so what's the ultimate solution we talked about
the types of people we talked about the talk of
specific types of toxicities what's the ultimate solution for how
to deal with this problem it's actually pretty simple it's
to cut people cut people out of your life it's
so simple that sometimes people forget that this is an
option right literally what you do is you take a
scalpel and you cut that person out of your life
like a tumor you excise a tumor from your body
this is a very apt metaphor for what you're doing
because this is what's happening because of this sponge-like effect
that your mind has and it soaks everything up because
of this averaging law that we talked about from Jim
Rohn it really is the case that once negativity seeps
into your system and just kind of like builds and
builds and it metastasizes like a cancer and it just
like spreads throughout your whole body spreads through your through
your mind and then sooner or later it starts to
infect your habits and affects your behaviors and infects your
ways of thinking it really colors your perspective of the
world and so this can be a dangerous thing as
it if it happens like over prolonged periods of time
months and years go by so what you really got
to do is you've got a you got to build
up the courage to cut these kinds of people out
of your life just simply cut them out one of
the things I want you to kind of acknowledge to
yourself and admit to yourself right now is that it
doesn't matter who if someone is violating your standards your
principles and your values in life then that person can
be cut and it doesn't matter who it is bosses
and co-workers friends customers they can all be cut and
even family can be cut this is where sometimes people
have trouble is with family they'll say but Leo family
like you can't cut family and maybe they you might
even say something like well I have this really good
friend old friend from from middle school I've known him
for four decades now I can't cut him I can't
cut her I can't cut this client it's a really
important client I can't cut my boss off my work
off so there's all these sorts of excuses and stories
about who you can and can't cut and why there
are certain people in your life that you can never
cut you got except that everyone can be cut you
have to have boundaries you have to have principles the
human being you hold yourself to principles you hold other
people to principles this doesn't mean you have to be
like a stickler and just for any stupid reason you
cut someone off that's not what I'm saying I'm saying
what something really violates an important principle of yours they
get cut of course the closer the person is to
you the more important they are then the more a
little more leeway you can give them but even with
people like your mom your dad your brother your sister
even your own children you still have to have boundaries
because if you don't set any boundaries subconsciously people realize
that you have no boundaries and even people that are
really close to you what they'll do is they'll basically
just kind of like they'll see what they can get
away with and will get away with more and more
and more and more especially these toxic people they're not
really self developed people they're not doing their operating from
a place of high consciousness they're just kind of like
really running their life almost like an animal it's very
like an animalistic type of lifestyle very low consciousness just
kind of like doing the easy stuff in life and
that is a type of person they'll tend to just
like demand more and more and more life out of
you right and it'll be a bigger and bigger and
bigger drag so I find that with those types of
people boundaries are even more important so right now acknowledge
yourself that there are circumstances under which you will cut
anybody right even someone that's really close to even a
child of yours at some point if your child starts
to behave in such a ridiculous way just doing some
like totally wrong things after a certain while you have
to set set some boundaries and you have to enforce
those boundaries those boundaries have to have teeth you can't
just be issuing like idle threats because people quickly learn
that it's just it's just like empty threats and then
they just keep breaking and breaking those boundaries of yours
so some people you're gonna cut as a last resort
that would be your family other people maybe you'd be
less you know less you have less reservations to cut
how do you cut someone out of your life it's
actually pretty simple there's depending on the type of person
how close they are to you how important they are
to you you know there's different situations but here are
some ideas one is you sit down with the person
you really tell them the problems that you have with
them and then you tell them that that's it it's
over don't contact me anymore I'm not contacting you and
just like draw a line the other thing you could
do is you could simply like delete the person's number
if it's someone that's more of a casual acquaintance just
delete their number don't contact them anymore block their number
block their emails block whatever means of communication there is
just like literally block it or stop responding to them
if it's the case that you're in a relationship and
it's like an intimate relationship that you're dealing with then
break up with that person breakups are really tough but
sometimes you got to do them even when they're really
tough if you're in a marriage and the person is
really toxic consider divorce that can be a long and
nasty and ruling process but hey it's better than sitting
through a toxic marriage for 10 20 30 years you're
not gonna be able to sit in that for a
long time it's just gonna like it's gonna rot you
it's gonna rot your soul so you gotta like you
gotta cut it off before it gets even worse than
it is if it's with a career and in business
consider quitting your job or changing jobs or transferring to
a different department doing a different type of job within
the company if you're in a if you got in
a bad department if you're the boss or you're self-employed
and you're you have employees then consider consider firing bad
employees if you have contracts with customers or clients that
are bad cut off those contracts say no to those
contracts even if they are gonna bring you business and
if worse comes to worse and you're in a really
negative environment maybe you're in a really bad part of
the city really bad part of the state part of
the country maybe you're in a in a very dangerous
or like toxic country even somewhere in the third world
then consider relocating worse comes to worse find a new
new part of the city or go to a new
city or go to a new state or go to
a new country if if you have to do that
because your environment is very influential on the kind of
life that you have the kind of emotions you in
a feel and the kind of success you get so
take this stuff seriously of course you don't need to
cut everybody sometimes you it's possible to do a roof
like a reform like a reformation you can sit down
if somebody's really violating your values if you've had enough
you're like fed up with all the text toxicity and
negativity and anger and all that stuff then you can
sit down with that person and you can lay out
what your boundaries are what your principles are what your
expectations are it's going to be a difficult talk but
you can have that talk and then you can see
what happens sometimes that kind of talk will really change
that person it'll be kind of like a light bulb
when there they'll say oh wow I didn't even realize
I was hurting you so bad I didn't realize I
was I was messing up your life with my toxicity
and my negativity let me see if I can change
something and sometimes they'll do that because they value the
relationship and they know that you'll cut them off if
you don't right there's that like seriousness to you but
then of course some of these people there's so there's
there's such a low consciousness state that they can't help
themselves maybe they're addicted to stuff maybe they're chronically depressed
maybe they're just like so negative maybe they have a
lot of bad habits and maybe they don't want to
change maybe they don't care about changing this is actually
probably gonna be the most common case they these people
simply don't care they don't want to change they're not
going to accommodate you and they're gonna keep repeatedly violating
your values they're not really gonna listen to you even
if you sit down and talk to them they'll just
continue running on autopilot and continue breaking and breaking and
breaking your boundaries you have to be smart about this
you have to become a good judge of character right
this is something you develop as you grow older the
human being is you get like a good eye for
who's a good character in life and who's a bad
character you know according to your own values it's not
an objective thing it's a subjective thing but you get
a good eye for that and then you can see
what kind of people will keep on those bad habits
because usually human beings we run on patterns we're very
very like simple minded creatures when we're stuck in a
bad loop of habits we just kind of keep going
and going and going down that road and it gets
like worse and worse and worse and some people they
just like can't help it they're they're incorrigible you got
to look out for those and then when you see
that that's that type of person and you think like
there's no way that guy's going to reform then steer
clear those are the people you got to cut and
then of course if your boundaries keep getting broken repeatedly
then you just decide to cut that person off okay
so that's as far as cutting goes what happens if
you can't cut the person can't cut them off why
would this happen here's a metaphor for you I think
it's a good metaphor it's a chess metaphor imagine that
I'm playing white you're playing black we got sport like
this in chess they have a scenario that you can
get yourself into it's really kind of a pickle of
a scenario and it's called a skewer what is a
skewer so you're the black player I'm the white player
let's say your king is in the middle of the
board right here your queen is here in the corner
and it's on a diagonal from from your king now
I've got a bishop a bishop is a piece that
moves diagonally I'm white what I do is I put
my I put my bishop here in the corner and
it's diagonally right across and it checks your king and
your queen is right behind it this is called a
skewer why is it a skewer because what happens is
that because your king is in check now you have
to move your king but if you move your king
then I can take your Queen because now your your
queen is vulnerable and the Queen is the most important
piece but you can't move your Queen first because your
king is in check basically in this situation what happens
is that you really exposed yourself you left yourself very
vulnerable and now because you did that strip from a
strategic standpoint now I can just position my my Bishop
right here and I basically got you by the balls
and so this is ultimately the the most fundamental reason
of why you can't cut people from your life so
easily is because you've exposed yourself and you've put yourself
strategically in a bad position and so now you're you're
there and they've got you by the balls so what
does this mean well one solution to figure out how
to deal with toxic people when you can't cut them
out is kind of a long term solution and this
is to actually sit down and redesign your life so
that you're no longer vulnerable you're no longer exposed and
you're no longer relying on these people then you can
cut them off because here's some problems you might have
maybe you want to cut off that person over there
but you can't because you're relying on him financially he
literally pays your bills or he pays your rent he
pays for your food so what can you do you
can't really cut them off because you got to eat
you got to pay the rent you're not financially independent
basically what about with intimate relationships they're the thing that
could have you by the balls is you either want
love or companionship or sex and so that's the thing
that you want and you feel like you're getting out
from in this relationship and so you can't cut her
off or you can't cut him off because you need
that exchange that's going on there you don't really have
relationship abundance you don't have sexual abundance that's the problem
you have there what about with with work with employment
situations well maybe you're relying on somebody who is giving
you employment opportunities maybe you're relying on somebody who is
helping you to grease the wheels for your business and
make stuff happen there and so that's important to you
and you don't want to just cut that person off
because you'd lose something that's very valuable there well that
shows you that you're relying on bad characters and business
and you're not independent with your business or with your
employment what about with your friends sometimes your friends you
really like your friends you have a whole history built
up with your friends sometimes your friends are like a
good shoulder for you to cry on so they give
you kind of like emotional stability so that might be
something that keeps you attached to a friend who's being
toxic to you and there again you're kind of putting
yourself in a compromising situation and also with business you
might have a client or customer maybe you have a
big client somebody who's going to give you millions of
dollars to to make something happen but this person is
also toxic and so on the one hand you don't
want to do it on the other hand you do
want to do it and so you're in this bind
which you really don't want to avoid as you're thinking
about how to re-engineer your life is these kinds of
binds and skewering situations so long term the root of
this of this problem is solved here is you think
about how do i make myself independent how do I
make myself have financial independence and abundance how do I
myself have a relationship and sexual abundance so I'm not
needy there how do I get myself abundance in my
business and abundance with my friends once you build up
all this abundance then actually it's very easy you can
enforce your boundaries very easily because you don't need any
particular individual in your life that's a powerful place to
come from so this is not something you can create
immediately but this is something you start to work on
so if you have a situation where you feel like
you're trapped the the bright side there is that you
can sit down and say okay I'm trapped now but
over the next year or two I can untrap myself
let me see what kind of steps I need to
take to untrap myself and then go ahead and take
those steps the next thing you can do is if
you can't cut a person simply limit your exposure to
that person sit down and ask yourself how many hours
a week am i spending with this person is it
five hours 10 hours 20 hours well if it's something
like 20 hours let's say maybe with a co-worker you're
spending 20 hours that's 20 hours of toxicity that's quite
a lot of time if you can reduce that to
15 hours or 10 hours or even 5 hours that
would be pretty good that means you may be you
can't cut that person off entirely you don't have that
authority not your job he's a co-worker okay but maybe
you can do what you can do is you can
just like limit your time and exposure with that person
cut it in half it's gonna have your toxicity it's
pretty like simple kind of obvious thing and you can
do with my little creative ways about how to limit
your exposure even to your family even to your kids
if they're really toxic to your life even to your
spouse even to your girlfriend or boyfriend you know for
now at least two whole things over hopefully in the
long run you're kind of working to solve that stuff
more at the root like I was talking about just
earlier the other thing you can do is you can
add more positive people into your life so let's say
you've got someone who's really negative in your life you
can't cut them out for whatever reason you're in a
bind but what you can do is you can add
more positive influences into your life this could be people
but also the next thing is that you can add
influences that aren't just face to face people they could
also be like digital media so for example listening to
self-help videos so I'll help audios reading high-quality books going
to seminars it's kind of stuff this can be one
of your associations when Jim Rohn is talking about those
five associates you hang out with the most well if
you spend a lot of your time reading or if
you spend a lot of your time watching these videos
or somebody else's videos you know stuff that is positive
and uplifting and aspiring to you then that's a that's
like a that's like a virtual associate that you have
and that can help you to kind of like pull
you out from a negative situation that you're in face
to face with somebody so if you can't cut the
negative influences at least raise the positive influences good so
those are some ideas for if you can't cut somebody
and lastly what I want to cover here is what
do you do in the heat of the moment so
let's say that you're dealing with a toxic person and
of course everything we've talked about now is kind of
like a long-term strategy but what if somebody literally like
blows up in your face let's say you're sitting there
at home watching TV clicking through the channels and somebody
let's say your spouse or your girlfriend or boyfriend they
burst through the door it's a it's drama it's anger
the fruit they're throwing stuff they're yelling at you like
this is happening right and now you're like in the
heat of the moment what do you do how do
you handle that situation well the problem here is that
you allowed yourself to be in this situation in the
first place so I really want you to realize that
this problem has to be fixed much earlier in life
right you got to ask yourself like why am I
in this situation in the first place why am i
allowing this kind of person to be in my life
but okay let's say it's too late for that now
you should have thought about that before but let's say
you didn't so now what do you do well really
this these types of people the best thing to do
and this is difficult there's not to engage them don't
engage them don't engage them mentally and definitely don't image
them physically try not to engage them verbally either because
what you're going to do if you engage them is
you're going to get into like a mudslinging contest and
because they're in a low consciousness state and you get
into a low consciousness state it just starts to devolve
into something nasty and nothing good ever comes from that
you're not gonna get any piece of gold or you
know some beautiful piece of wisdom from that kind of
interaction with somebody that only comes from all like a
high consciousness type of interaction so the best thing to
do there is just try to like distance yourself as
much as you can if you and walk out walk
out of the house walk out of the car walk
out of the office walk out of the building right
just like leave if you're on the phone call hang
up the phone if you're getting text messages like block
the texts if you're shooting emails like cut off that
email thread it's like very simple very obvious but a
lot of people what they do is they could just
I get triggered and triggered and triggered into it and
it's difficult because you're trying to work on yourself you're
trying to do the best you can this person comes
in maybe they're totally in the wrong they're violating your
standards and your boundaries maybe you've already talked to that
person a lot of time a lot of times about
it and they still keep doing it so you're very
frustrated obviously and this is going to take this is
going to take the most from you to maintain that
kind of a equanimity or evenness of mind and that's
that's the best way to handle this situation is to
not react emotionally at all to be detached from the
outcome totally emotionally unreactive just like cool collected and practicing
mindfulness this is where mindfulness practice really helps where meditation
helps I have a lot of different videos out there
that tell you how to deal with stress how to
deal with anger how to deal with with negativity from
other people and how to like calm your own emotions
there are very different techniques that you can use just
like to calm yourself down in the heat at the
moment and of course if you practice meditation every morning
like you're supposed to be doing and you've been doing
that habitually for for weeks and months every single day
then that makes you grounded that makes you more even
keeled that makes you easier to it makes it easier
for you to deal with kind of difficult people simply
by not reacting to them and you see that when
you don't react to them a lot of times these
people just kind of like they settle down or even
if they don't settle down at least you don't feed
into their anger and their their negativity it's a lot
of times that's the worst thing is when you start
to feed into it and it creates like a this
cyclone so practice walking away and practice mindfulness don't engage
these people also don't be too judgmental of these people
a lot of times what will tend to do is
we see someone doing something very wrong in our life
and we'll say oh how could he how could she
what are they doing what are they thinking and then
we start getting too this kind of judgment mode that's
also a low consciousness trap that you don't wanna get
caught in in fact I have a video called how
to exploit people to grow yourself which tells you kind
of an advanced technique that I've learned about how to
reframe in your mind these situations where people are doing
stupid stuff stuff that isn't right according to your values
how to reframe that instead of judging them use that
to actually build yourself up to develop wisdom and see
okay so they're doing something weird there how am i
doing something similar my own life and basically what you
use you do is you use those people as a
mirror to show you how you could improve yourself because
you always want to be focused on yourself versus focused
on trying to control and manipulate and sticks other people
because that tends to backfire a lot so these people
that are toxic they can actually be important reminders for
you of your own personal development needs so if you
keep all that in mind then I think that's gonna
help you a lot to fix some of these toxic
people cut them out or to minimize their effects on
your life alright this is Leo and be signing off
