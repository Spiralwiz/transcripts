[Music] the advice in this episode is going to transform
your life if you really listen to it and you
actually apply it so what I want to talk about
here is real yoga what is real yoga many Westerners
don't really understand what real yoga is because we hear
the word yoga and what do we think of immediately
we think of of course hatha yoga the yoga that
you see at the gym the yoga that all the
women and girls are into that is not real yoga
that's a Western bastardization of yoga which has very little
to do with actual yoga so the sad fact is
that 99% of people in America and in Europe who
practice these Western style of hatha yoga that you see
at the gym that they don't know what real yoga
is or what the purpose of it is what I'm
talking about real yoga here is I am talking about
the schools of yoga and there are many of them
which are not intended for physical exercise but for meditation
and ultimately for union and that's what the word yoga
actually means it's a Sanskrit word goes back thousands of
years the origins of yoga probably go back earlier than
5,000 years ago into ancient India and that word yoga
it means the union what does union mean of course
it means non duality it means the union of subject
and object the realization of the collapse of all distinctions
in all dualities such that everything is unified into one
so the real purpose of yoga is enlightenment its Awakening
its liberation or moksha as this otherwise known and here's
a really simple rule of thumb to see if the
yoga that you're doing is real yoga or not if
your yoga is not collapsing the boundaries of reality for
you if your yoga is not erasing your sense of
existence and your sense of reality then it's not real
yoga because that's the true purpose of yoga now why
am I talking about this you might wonder well Leo
but what about self inquiry what about all the meditation
stuff you talked about what about all this all this
other stuff you talk about why do we need yoga
for enlightenment coz you've you've never talked about it before
well that's because yoga is a pretty technical subject and
I wasn't really quite sure how to approach this subject
and also I was researching it I was researching various
schools of yoga trying out various techniques and you know
one thing you should know about me is I consider
myself a researcher like to test stuff out so I
don't discriminate I don't play favorites when it comes to
spiritual techniques or personal development techniques I am very open
mind I try out all sorts of techniques crazy ones
ridiculous ones new-age sounding ones just to see what's actually
gonna work cuz you don't know until you try this
stuff and I've tried self inquiry for many years I've
tried meditation for many years various forms of meditation from
mantra meditation to to labeling and mindfulness meditation and do
nothing Zen style meditation so what I'm seeing with yoga
is something that I really want to bring to your
attention if you've been following actualized I don't work because
I think it's a really powerful tool which is why
I said at the very beginning that this this episode
will transform your life if you've been practicing some various
forms of meditation or self inquiry to attain enlightenment and
you've been struggling with those and you haven't been getting
good progress I know how that feels I've been there
for many years that's where yoga can really help you
I think what's unique about yoga is that Yoga is
more powerful than traditional meditation it's more powerful than Zen
it's more powerful than just sitting it's a specific series
of techniques that you practice which are similar to meditation
but more effective because what yoga does is it brings
your physical body into the equation of awakening whereas traditional
meditation self-inquiry is you sitting in your head either trying
to let go of thoughts or just being aware or
just focusing on nothing or focusing on something or whatever
you know you're doing if you're focusing on your breath
or you're saying a mantra those can definitely work but
the problem is is that for most people they need
to sit there and do that for 10 or 20
years before they start to get some profound experiences and
what's amazing is that even if they sit and do
that for 10 or 20 years they still might not
have a complete awakening and there's lots of degrees to
awakening and there's also awakening sort of intellectually in the
head but then there's also awakening your entire body so
yoga I see as a more holistic method which tries
to awaken you not from your head but actually from
your body so it's like you're awakening from your body
into your head and there are a lot of benefits
to that which I'll discuss as we keep going so
what is the purpose of yoga the purpose of real
yoga is to still your mind to profound levels to
really still your mind not just to relax but to
still your mind so much that you are able to
be conscious of the absolute and ultimately you merge into
union with the absolute and you experience various states of
Samadhi these are mystical states and they're their various depths
of Samadhi and as you enter into these states and
you go through these various yogic techniques what they do
is they gradually purify your body and your mind so
that your mind is able to really deeply relaxed and
calm down and ultimately experience these profound mystical States and
I think that it's way more effective than just traditional
meditation which is why I'm bringing it to your attention
another purpose of yoga is to clear your chakras there
are seven chakras in the body traditionally that's what it
said although they're actually different yogic schools which disagree about
that some say there are twelve chakras or some other
number of chakras so the number is not important but
the the general idea behind it is important what's important
to understand is that a lot of the stuff that
holds you back from actually awakening and the reason that
maybe your meditation practice or your self inquiry hasn't been
working for you is because you have blockages in your
body physical blockages emotional blockages all the trauma that you've
experienced throughout your whole life since you were kid all
the bad habits that you have all their emotional triggers
and reactions you have all that stuff which constitutes your
ego constitutes yourself it that's the thing you're trying to
get rid of well just doing self inquiry doesn't necessarily
get rid of those things see so with yoga one
of its purposes is to is to purify energy channels
in your body in your spine the chakras are located
along the spine there are seven of them from from
the very base of your spine moving up to your
knee to your to your navel and then to your
heart and through your throat and various chakras in the
head and so you're gonna be clearing all of these
and what she'll be noticing as you're doing these exercises
is that these things clear up and open up and
you're gonna see releases of tension of energy of emotions
and you're gonna be channeling Kundalini energy up your spine
from the very bottom to the very top ultimately with
the goal of opening your crown chakra which then leads
to permanent awakening you see and it's not just awakening
but also like opening your heart chakra for example makes
you more compassion makes you more loving opening your throat
chakra and navel chakras and all this releases energy it
it helps improves the flow of energy throughout your body
and a lot of the diseases that people have especially
the subtle ones that aren't very obvious that Western science
doesn't know how to how to diagnose and treat very
well for example thyroid problems chronic fatigue problems depression a
DD all sorts of stuff like this which isn't well
treated by Western science a lot of these can clear
up simply by working through purifying these various chakras one
thing you notice as you get deeper into a personal
development work is that all of your emotions they don't
reside in your head they reside in your body and
so becoming more conscious of your body is a very
powerful thing and I'll be talking more about that in
the future but one of the huge benefits of yoga
is that it can help you to do that and
also one of the things yo can do is it
can it can unlock spiritual powers called cities and these
are various paranormal abilities from clairvoyance to telepathic abilities to
all sorts of other interesting and weird and incredible things
and those usually get unlocked when you get to the
very advanced levels of practicing yoga so I don't recommend
you go chasing cities I recommend you focus on awakening
yourself and purifying yourself and opening up all your chakras
and then if cities do come to you well that
will be a bonus but that's not something you want
to get distracted with so that's the purpose of real
yoga now here's what's not the purpose of real yoga
and this is where we get the fake western style
yoga and by the way what I call it fake
that's just to contrast it with the old-school Eastern yoga
you know if Western Yoga is helping you to to
get more energy to feel better and to be healthier
by all means keep doing it that's fine I think
it's just it's really important to contrast it with the
meditate meditative style yoga that that I'm really focused on
talking about here but you know Western Yoga usually why
do people do Western Yoga for stretching and improving their
flexibility for exercise for stress reduction for relaxation for maybe
weight loss as a substitute for a cardio or weight
lifting or to have a sense of community because you're
doing it in a group you have friends whatever stuff
like that right um none of these are the purposes
of true yoga true yoga is focused on something very
profound it's focused on metaphysical understanding its primary focus is
not health although it can give you health its primary
focus is not energy although it can give you lots
of energy and it can clear up energy blockages its
primary purpose is metaphysical understanding consciousness awakening there are dozens
of schools of yoga of real yoga and of course
there are dozens of schools of hatha yoga as well
so hatha yoga that's the western style physical yoga that's
really just like one branch of all these different various
yogic schools that has become particularly popular in the West
because it's very easy to market you see in the
West we're very materialistic so in the West when you
start talking to people about metaphysics and about collapsing their
reality and about dissolving the south and about awakening Westerners
don't care about that [ __ ] what Westerners care
about is they care about oh how do I relax
how do I become more flexible how do I exercise
how do I join a fitness class at the gym
or how do i how do i stretch and that
sort of stuff you see so the reason I call
Western yoga bastardization is because it's stripped out very specifically
it's stripped out the metaphysical aspect the most important aspect
of yoga it's stripped that out threw it away so
what I'm advocating is that you pick up a school
of yoga which actually has that there and this kind
of yoga is a lot less about having weird twisted
pretzel poses it's not nearly physically as demanding as western-style
yoga because it's not done for exercise it's primarily mental
exercises various meditative techniques and visualization techniques that are used
to channel energy in your body and send it up
into your crown chakra to get you awakening and to
quiet down your mind so there are dozens of schools
of yoga I'll just mention a couple of the biggest
branches and the most popular kinds there's ashtanga yoga or
raja yoga those are both two names that point to
the same kind of yoga there is Gyana yoga which
is actually the path of knowledge and this is very
similar to self-inquiry there's bhakti yoga which is the path
of devotion which is a form of yoga where you
devote yourself to a deity that you worship and it's
like a real serious form of worship like you really
worship the hell out of that deity with the ultimate
idea being that you surrender yourself so completely so completely
to this day 'ti with such devotion you pray to
it you visualize it you basically treat this deity as
a personal god of yours until ultimately you actually fuse
with the deity and so you attain union through devotion
so try to imagine what level of devotion is required
for you to actually physically surrender yourself and your body
in this process of devotion so that you merge with
the physical world that's a pretty heavy level of devotion
which very few people especially in the West are inclined
to doing in India that works pretty well for many
people but in the West I don't think that's a
very effective method most of us just just are not
capable of doing that here it doesn't really fit our
personality type it doesn't fit our mind type it doesn't
fit our culture so I'm not a big fan of
bhakti-yoga then there's karma yoga Karma Yoga is yoga through
action so this would be a path where someone commits
themselves so fully to their life purpose speaking of life
life purpose as being a spiritual practice you commit yourself
so fully to your life purpose that you actually surrender
yourself to the life purpose to serving other people and
so it's basically the path of selfless service and you
serve so selflessly that through this process of action and
service that you are in theory is supposed to surrender
yourself and again attain a certain union again I think
in practice that's quite difficult to do you know I'm
all for life purpose I think that's very important I
think there are spiritual dimensions to life purpose but I
think to actually attain enlightenment through through a Karma Yoga
path I mean I'm sure some people in history have
done it but I think it's pretty rare and it's
it's quite indirect there's also Kundalini Yoga you might have
heard that one there's Kriya yoga which is Yogananda's school
of yoga if you've heard about Swami Yogananda he was
a very famous some Indian yogi about a century ago
then there's Tantra and there's a Shive ism now don't
confuse Tantra with sex Tantra has nothing to do with
sex really again it's a Western bastardization of what Tantra
really is Tantra is a series of elaborate visualization exercises
which is just another school of yoga basically whose purpose
is again union with with the absolute so those are
sort of the major branches you can experiment with those
and find one that you like and of course each
one of these has many sub schools so if you
take Kriya yoga there's many sub schools of that and
of course all you different sub schools different lineages and
sub lineages they all disagree with each other and fight
back and forth over techniques so there's quite a lot
of kind of like bickering back and forth as you
expect with all spiritual traditions they all fracture they all
splinter and then they all fight against each other that's
how it tends to go down so my point here
is not to advocate any one particular school of yoga
above others it's just to introduce you to this idea
of yoga and the possibilities that are out there and
the benefits that this can have for you and to
really study and understand all the nuances of all these
four schools you know it's complex stuff you have to
be a scholar to basically to read all the scriptures
and to make sense of them all so I'm not
asking you to do that I'm just giving you sort
of a broad overview if you're a westerner this is
this is just a broad overview sort of like yoga
101 an introduction now let me talk about why I
think yoga is superior to meditation self inquiry I've already
touched upon this point but let me be very explicit
about it first I think it's because it clears the
chakras in a way that meditation and self inquiry cannot
it can purge trauma and emotions which can be otherwise
very difficult to deal with and that often times meditation
self inquiry do not address I think it produces a
more holistic awakening it awakens not only your mind but
also your body and it can heal your body at
the same time and a lot of us you know
we we live very unhealthy lives we've eaten very unhealthy
food for most of our lives and we are addicted
to media and to all this stuff so we need
a more holistic approach to awakening than just working with
the mind through something like self inquiry so these ancillary
benefits I think for many people they can be a
lifesaver maybe you have some kind of disease that's holding
you back like some sort of chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia
or some sort of digestion problems or insomnia or or
you know bad terrible PMS symptoms or whatever you have
that could get cured while you're doing these practices in
a way that for example self inquiry probably would do
and then that will free you up to then have
more energy and more capacity to go deeper into your
practices because I found that you know you can do
self inquiry for years but then you're stuck in your
quiet isn't this working well it's probably because you're a
complex human being and this self inquiry was designed for
a very narrow purpose and sometimes we were trying to
solve a larger problem you just can't solve it with
one kind of tool you need an assortment of tools
which is why people get stuck when they just subscribe
to one spiritual technique oftentimes it doesn't work for them
I think also that yoga is superior because it's more
potent it requires much less time whereas regular meditation might
require you to to take retreats where you spend hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds of hours thousands of hours meditating
your ass off and just seeing little puny results with
yoga practices you don't need that much you could invest
just 60 minutes a day and you can see some
pretty huge improvements within a year or two also I
think it's superior because it teaches you proper breathing and
don't dismiss how important that can be because again as
Westerners will not really taught how to breathe properly we
have very shallow breathing we're breathing deep in our chest
rather than deep in our belly our breathing is slow
is quick and shallow rather than slow and deep and
so yoga will completely transform how you breathe and the
reason that's important is because your physical vitality and energy
comes from your breath comes from the oxygen that you're
taking in so that's one important component and also the
way your mind acts is very much related to how
you breathe when you're breathing is screwed up and shallow
and quick your mind is gonna be shallow and it's
gonna be scatterbrained when your breathing becomes deep diaphragmatic into
the belly and very slow such that you're taking maybe
just one or two breaths per minute then your mind
becomes very still and very powerful and very concentrated which
is exactly what you need to attain some of these
mystical states and to get your awakening a lot of
people in the West well we have a DD even
if you're not officially diagnosed with a DD you basically
still have a version of a TD because you're using
your phone you're using the Internet you're completely media addicted
so I think that the reason that self-inquiry and traditional
meditation doesn't work for many people is simply because our
concentrations are so poor and that's something that yoga can
help you to develop I think yoga is superior because
it can help you to develop cities or these paranormal
abilities I think it's also superior because it can help
to eliminate intellectualization which tends to be a problem with
self inquiry that's something I've run into that I've noticed
and I bet you that if I succumb to that
problem then you because you listen to me also succumb
to this problem of intellectualization as you do self inquiry
and that just gets you chasing your tail in circles
without really having progress so you might wonder Leo how
do I start real yoga sounds complicated where do I
turn to well I'm gonna give you a very simple
and clear solution but here are some questions that are
probably on your mind when your thing about starting yoga
you might wonder like do I need a guru and
if so where do I find this guru what kind
of techniques do I need to be learning how do
I select the best school which school is best for
me and what kind of results can I expect and
how quickly can I expect them from this practice well
the problem is is that most yogic techniques are secret
most of them are not written down in books because
traditionally a yoga school requires that you find a guru
that you resonate with this guru that you sort of
surrender yourself to this guru and you go through an
initiation process you take vows of secrecy and then the
Guru hands you some techniques and then you spend years
working these techniques and once you've mastered them a little
bit he hands you a few more and a few
more and a few more in this process takes texts
decades and he gradually hands out techniques to you that's
traditionally how it works a couple of problems with this
one is that it's not very easily accessible to most
people because you probably don't know a guru and you
certainly probably don't know one who is physically close to
you and and so where do you go to find
one and also the problem with gurus is that you
have to trust the Guru you need a good guru
it's very possible that you find the wrong guru a
corrupt guru a guru who teaches you the wrong techniques
or who abuses his power and abuses his position or
a guru who asks you to accept a bunch of
dogma that he believes in and so because of the
Guru the disciple relationship then you're gonna end up believing
in all that dogma and again as Westerners we oftentimes
don't like believing in all sorts of dogma and religious
hocus-pocus type stuff that often comes with these techniques and
you can't come to most gurus and just say it
and just say to them okay tell me the techniques
and strip out all the dog muster about all the
religious stuff just tell me the strict techniques and I'll
just do them you got to play by the Guru's
rules so that's something I don't really like so what
I'm gonna offer you here is sort of a westernized
version of how to do real yoga it's very powerful
it's very direct it's very straightforward all you got to
do is just follow the steps and this will work
for you and you don't need to subscribe to any
gurus including myself so of course you can explore the
different yoga schools and I am NOT gonna say that
one of them is better than the others but what
I will offer you just for sake of simplicity and
clarity here is a particular school which is very effective
and that's Kriya yoga this is the yoga of Yogananda
except I don't like the way that Yogananda teaches it
well he's been dead for over a hundred years so
the problem is that his Institute the self-realization fellowship which
still exists a hundred years later and it's based in
Los Angeles you can go to them and you can
subscribe to them you can visit them and they will
teach you these techniques you can go through their initiation
but what I found and I've heard from various sources
that I've that I've talked to about this who are
in the know is that it's quite corrupt and a
watered down and so what I have for you is
I have for you a way to learn Kriya yoga
without having to go and subscribe to their watered-down corrupt
techniques and to not be part of any organization because
actually see Kriya yoga is not designed to be a
communal effort it's designed to be practiced solo that's how
it was originally intended be practiced and actually Yogananda learned
it from his teacher Sri Yukteswar from his guru and
his guru learned it from the prior guru which is
a man by the name of Lahiri that was his
last name Lahiri I don't remember his first name and
it was Lahiri who really was the master and formalized
all these techniques and he had the most non watered-down
versions of these techniques and then gradually over the time
they walk got watered down even when Yogananda was teaching
it supposedly it was already watered down so wouldn't it
be nice to be able to go back all the
way to beginning to the teachings of Lahiri and learn
it strictly from him well of course he's been dead
for over 100 and like 30 years now so how
do you do that well luckily I found a book
which reveals every single technique that Lahiri has ever taught
and it explains every single technique perfectly in complete detail
such that you can follow this book and you can
practice all these techniques not only that you don't just
get the techniques in this book but you actually get
worksheets and an exercise plan which takes you step-by-step for
building a Kriya yoga practice from the very beginning to
the very advanced stages there's dozens and dozens may be
nearly a hundred different techniques that you can slowly use
to build up your practice this book is available on
my book list if you already purchase my book let's
just log in and you can find it there search
for the word Kriya and you'll find it if you
haven't purchased my book list well this would be a
good reason to this one book could transform your entire
life why am i recommending this book because to me
it's the most straightforward way to practice yoga real yoga
authentic yoga it's direct it's powerful it's safe and its
gradual and it's very easy to follow it's very doable
it's all laid out for you you don't need any
gurus you can just sit down and start doing it
starting tomorrow and that's it well I make this stuff
more complicated than it needs to be I've been using
this book myself and I've been practicing this this yoga
myself and I'm already starting to see benefits and so
right now I'm gonna put in a year worth of
my time to experiment with this yoga to see what
comes out of it and so if you want to
do that along with me well here's how you do
it it's very easy to start first of all I'll
go purchase that book I didn't write the book it's
written by some other author I'm just recommending it because
I found it so useful then make a 100% commitment
to mastering this yoga and then commit to practicing it
every single day you're only gonna need about 30 to
60 minutes per day for this practice initially it's gonna
be about 30 minutes and then as you build and
gradually add more techniques to your stack of techniques it's
gonna grow to about 60 minutes and maybe a little
bit longer than that if you go beyond one or
two years of practice so for now it's a pretty
easy commit 30 to 60 minutes not a big deal
and what I recommend is that you commit for a
minimum of one year to actually try this out and
to see what benefits this could have for you what
can you expect from this practice well you can expect
a significant quieting of your mind a transformation of your
breathing much more consciousness and awareness of your spine that's
what I've been noticing and believe it or not that's
an important thing because right now your spine is just
like so dead inside that you're walking around like a
zombie you're not conscious of your spine and your spine
contains a lot of important nerve endings and some might
even say that your spine is like your second brain
it controls your body and it integrates your body with
your mind and that's a very important part of of
personal development because what are you developing you're not just
developing your mind and your personality you're developing your body
all of it has to come along together in a
holistic way you could expect an improvement in your health
especially if you have energy problems if you get fatigued
easily like I do and after twelve months of practice
I think you can start to expect Samadhi states profound
mystical experiences and your chakras starting to open progressively and
then how long will it take you to actually get
your awakening well who really knows can't be said it
all depends on where you're coming from in life what
your life experiences were what your you know how long
have you been practicing meditation how long have you been
practicing self inquiry have you done psychedelics what kind of
things do you understand about the metaphysical nature of reality
you know so it all depends on kind of where
you are but nevertheless even though this will probably take
a couple of years for you to start to experience
some of these deep things I still think it's much
faster than traditional meditation now you might wonder if your
scientifically minded and rationally minded then you might say well
leo is this really scientific I mean where's the proof
you're talking about chakras and Kundalini and awakenings and you're
talking about mystical States and all these yogic schools but
isn't just this religious mumbo-jumbo just a bunch of New
Age stuff how do you know these aren't just hallucinations
in your mind how do you know it's just not
a placebo effect this yellow guy that you're doing look
what do you really mean by the word science you
have to be very rigorous here traditionally when we say
science in Western culture what we're talking about is we're
talking about the kind of science that is done collectively
by organizations in universities and academia research labs and in
medical institutions and stuff like this but that that modality
that external materialistic modality while it works great for the
rest of the world it cannot work on your inner
self even psychology the study of psychology you might say
oh well Lea with psychology is the size of the
psyche by definition so it does study the inner self
no you have no idea yet because you haven't spent
as many years and read as many hundreds of books
that I've read about this subject of personal development and
spirituality non-duality and psychology both west and east you don't
understand how pitiful Western psychology is understanding of the human
psyche and consciousness really is and that's precisely because they've
adopted this brute force external materialistic approach yeah when you
take that approach then you're gonna have a very weak
understanding of how the human mind really works what I
am interested in is I'm not interested in academia I'm
not interested in studies what I'm interested in is actually
mastering myself from the inside mastering my own emotions feeling
good mastering my own happiness my own depression my own
my own emotional triggers and becoming more conscious and all
of those things you can really only do effectively when
you go from the inside out not from the outside
in so yoga is a science it is one of
the earliest signs is we have it's a 5,000 year
old science it's the science of consciousness it's a science
of the metaphysical nature of reality which of course is
very different sort of science than physics or chemistry or
biology or even psychology this is a science that stems
from direct experience from deep mystical states if you haven't
experienced these mystical states these are some of the most
extraordinary things you can possibly experience in your life they
will have you questioning all of Western science and all
of Western medicine and everything you've been taught in school
and everything that you assumed about yourself in the world
and your family and your culture and society and everything
else that's how deep these mystical States are but you
can't appreciate that until you start to experience them for
yourself so in the name of science if you're skeptical
I understand but also understand how skepticism is supposed to
work a scientist can be skeptical about all sorts of
stuff but ultimately he has to be practical and he
has to say okay I have to run some experiments
to see whether this thing or that thing or this
other thing whether any of this is true so I
have to be open-minded enough to be able to run
the experiment which costs time and energy so when I'm
asking you to invest six or twelve months into running
these experiments on yourself by doing this yoga practice what
I'm asking you to do is science on yourself you
will be doing these visualization techniques and these breathing techniques
and these meditative techniques and then you will be assessing
at the end of each session what's happening with your
consciousness with your body with your energy with your chakras
and all this stuff you might not believe in chakras
I didn't believe in them either that's where radical ob-
comes in you're not being asked to just believe it
as a dogma you're being asked to just take this
system and use it and see if it will produce
the results what she'll discover if you practice this stuff
earnestly is you will discover that there is enormous wisdom
contained within these various yogic schools and yogic techniques if
you're using the right ones the ones that haven't been
corrupted they're very powerful it will shock you that human
beings have known about these techniques for thousands of years
and only now are they becoming widely known it'll shock
you it'll shock you that this stuff wasn't taught to
you from first grade because this is this is the
stuff that will improve your life the most not money
not relationships not business not any of that this yoga
these techniques but you have to be open-minded enough to
try them and when you're thinking about chakras or Kundalini
energy or any of the sort of stuff I recommend
that you don't think of it as the way that
a materialist might you know a materialist might challenge me
here might say olio but these chakras can you prove
the chakras exist like if I cut open the spine
well I see a chakra in there what does it
look like how much does it weigh how many centimeters
across is it what happens if I hit it with
a hammer don't think of chakras in that way you
can think of them as a model you could think
of as a tool you could think of it as
a pragmatic thing you could think of it as aspects
of your subtle body and of course you would say
well Lea what is the subtle body can you prove
that there is such a thing as a subtle body
what is this thing if there is a subtle body
how comes Western science hasn't proven it with its experiments
because Western science only studies gross materialistic aspects of reality
in a nutshell and it doesn't admit to anything else
because it's closed-minded because it's a circular paradigm the paradigm
says there's nothing but gross material things and so therefore
the paradigm doesn't look for anything but gross material things
and anytime there's an anomaly that says that all look
this might be a immaterial subtle thing the paradigm says
to itself but there can't be subtle things because everything
is gross in materialistic as we've assumed from the very
beginning and so it ignores that anomaly you see and
so it just goes around in a circle you Andy
be more open-minded I'm not asking you to believe anything
in these yoga teachings but just to do the practices
and notice the results the results are all that you
want if it gets you the results what are you
complaining about and the results that it will get you
are not just gonna be subtle placebo effects the results
are gonna be way beyond that way beyond that you're
gonna experience a breakdown of your reality so much that
you're gonna probably want to stop doing these techniques at
some point you're gonna experience powerful emotions coming up in
spiritual purging and all the sorts of stuff stuff that
could freak you out stuff that I've talked about in
my episode called the dark side of meditation because when
you do advanced techniques which are very powerful one of
the ways you know they're working is when all those
dark side of meditation facets and aspects start to come
up all those symptoms start to come up that's how
you know it's working that's spiritual purification in the same
way that when you go into a psychiatrist's office and
you start doing psychotherapy and you start talking about some
very painful experience from your childhood where you got abused
or bullied or or humiliate or something like that that's
painful you don't want to talk about that and that's
precisely what tells you that that's what you need to
be talking about because that's how you're gonna heal you're
not gonna heal by just talking about how your day
went and what you did at work today that's not
gonna heal you you got to talk about the stuff
that's really deep that's buried deep inside you you're the
skeletons in your closet that's what you got to talk
about so the same thing is happening here except it's
not happening through talk therapy it's happening physically and physically
is much more powerful than talk therapy because you know
you can go to talk therapy for four five years
and really not be much much more developed and more
mature than you began but if you do yoga for
five years man you're gonna be a totally transformed human
being now some people might wonder here at this point
but Leo don't I need a guru aren't you just
teaching me some bastardized version of yoga shouldn't I go
and just find the Guru and it that way the
old-school way well you could you could but my guess
is you're gonna have difficulty finding that guru and also
there are limitations with gurus as I talked about gurus
can be corrupt gurus can be dogmatic yogic schools entire
schools can be corrupt and a guru could be just
a a tool of that school and then you're gonna
become his tool and then you become a tool of
that school see and so it's just dogma perpetuating dogma
so there is that problem for example if you go
to the self-realization fellowship that you'll get on to started
then you're gonna get watered-down techniques is that what you
want just so that you have a guru I'm not
really into gurus personally what I'm into is a do-it-yourself
approach I want to be my own guru and actually
Kriya Yoga is perfect for this because originally the way
it was taught it was taught as a solo practice
it was taught that you and the universe itself is
the Guru and all you need to do is just
do the right techniques and that will take you to
everything that you need to become conscious of if you're
if you're serious if you're committed to the path and
you're doing it and you're following the techniques that's all
you really need you don't need some father figure to
a door or to love you or for you to
love him to play into all these social dynamics nor
do you need a school or an ashram to go
to or community to hang out with that's all mostly
just distraction anyways it's just gossip and social stuff you
don't need that just do the techniques and you don't
need Dogma and you don't need religious rituals here just
do the techniques what's great about Kriya yoga is that
it's open source all the techniques are available you could
read them in a book you can do it all
yourself and it's free what more could you ask for
it's really the best of all worlds now what I
recommend is that you don't let Kriya yoga be your
only tool it's a powerful tool use it but also
I recommend you combine it with self inquiry and contemplation
I recommend you combine it with meditation with labeling that's
a very powerful tool nevertheless I recommend you combine it
with psychedelics those are incredibly powerful tools which will man
which will totally blow your mind and totally open you
up and I recommend that you continue studying theory reading
non-dual theory studying personal development applying various personal development techniques
as you've been doing reading books doing journaling keeping your
commonplace book and all that sort of stuff that still
all applies so don't get to one minded here with
Kriya yoga it's just one tool in your tool belt
I think if you really want to go far if
you really want to develop yourself and take a multi
path approach a multi tool approach synthesize all this stuff
together and as you're practicing this different stuff you will
start to resonate more with one technique another technique or
one approach versus another approach and you will kind of
your mind will know which thing you need more of
and which thing you need less of and you'll sort
of calibrate and adjust and you'll see how things go
but by combining all those together I think you're gonna
get the best of all possible worlds so that's basically
it that's old-school yoga in a nutshell you now understand
kind of what it is what its goal is and
you even now have a concrete way to get started
on doing it if you're into a Western yoga hatha
yoga the gym style yoga I mean by all means
keep doing it if it's helping you if you're getting
benefit from it but also understand that that's not gonna
awaken you not even close not even close you're missing
out on like 99% of all the beauty of yoga
you're missing out on it because you're subscribed to this
western style yoga so maybe keep doing it but also
incorporate this yoga this Kriya yoga technique or practice as
well or maybe ditch it all together and just go
for the Kriya yoga remember that the ultimate goal of
yoga is I would say the following three things three
three ultimate components to yoga one is ultimately you want
to reach a state of sahaja Samadhi which is permanent
Samadhi you're walking around with Samadhi all the time you're
in a permanent state of union with your environment two
is a realization of the absolute or infinity understanding that
reality is infinity that you are infinity you become identified
with infinity that infinity is God it is your true
nature it is the only thing that exists and you
are perfectly conscious of everything as being infinity including all
they're human beings that and the third thing is a
purification of all your karma and your ego what I
mean by a purification of all your karma is all
the bad habits that you have that you've accumulated over
your life and certain yogic traditions say even from your
past lives I don't know about that I don't know
about past lives I haven't experienced it personally myself but
just from this life I know that I've accumulated a
lot of karma stuff you've done and habits you've built
modes of thinking and modes of acting and emotive and
all this sort of stuff trauma all that stuff that
I talked about that needs to be purified from you
because that is all the stuff all the junk and
garbage that's holding you back so Yoga is sort of
like defragmenting your hard drive except here you're defragmenting your
body and your mind that's what we mean by purification
of karma so that you can let all that go
so that you become a more perfect vehicle for the
embodiment of the absolute and then for living a selfless
life and that's the happiest you can be as a
human being as if you're able to do that that's
sort of the ultimate goal that's where all personal development
is ultimately pushing you towards but of course so few
people get there and and so few people even know
that that's what they're doing when they're picking up a
self-help book or when you're watching a self-help video or
something like that they don't they don't connect all the
dots so don't really know where they're going to so
I want to make sure that you understand these ultimate
goals so that you you have the full picture the
full map of what we're after here with all these
techniques because when you know the destination then you can
figure out different ways of getting to the destination you
see so it's not so much about the techniques about
understanding the destination and why you're going there and then
your mind will figure out how to get there when
you really understand how powerful and amazing the destination is
which of course most people don't all right so that's
it on yoga I hope that's inspired you to get
started again I just want to reiterate this one episode
can transform your entire life think of the difference think
of the radical divergence that could happen right now in
your life think of scenario a where a person listens
to this episode and just says okay yeah that sounds
cool that sounds interesting and then just goes back to
watching more YouTube videos as though nothing happened and then
person B who actually registers the importance of this is
ah ha all these techniques are really powerful they're especially
powerful let me test it out if it's true this
can change my whole life isn't that worth me taking
it seriously buying a book reading it studying it and
maybe committing myself to some of these techniques oh yeah
maybe it is and then that person gets serious about
it and starts doing it starting tomorrow and then five
years from now person a and person B are are
so far apart and then 10 years up from now
you can't even tell these two people began in the
same place anymore it's gonna be a complete difference a
complete difference and all at the cost of just 60
minutes per day of practice think about that think about
the significance of this stuff connect the rubber with the
road so you start to get traction with this information
so it's not just information it's not just theory but
