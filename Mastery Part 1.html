welcome so I guess now we've played around with this
camera seems to be pretty good as long as there
is light not really good for shooting outdoors if I
want to shoot outside at night I need a much
better camera but this will do for indoors as long
as they're well lit anyhow what's the idea here I'm
just going to be practicing right now doing public speaking
talking about self development topics getting comfortable in front of
the camera just doing stream of thought three of consciousness
just making it look at sound professional or at least
somewhat decent without being too a mature about it getting
the angles right getting the lighting ray getting the mic
the audio right because right now I am knew this
and this would be an interesting experience from a vocal
tonality that's something I definitely have to work on his
voice a I'm talking to you so I just need
to be more comfortable in front of the camera and
then and then I'll be able to integrate all the
self development stuff that I'm doing and make some cool
video blogs and we'll see where it goes life coaching
and seminars and all that good stuff but just yeah
getting comfortable talking to myself to the camera to you
guys out there will be listening to this hopefully maybe
yeah that is that so self development what can we
talk about in self development we talking about the idea
of mastery there's a great book by George Leonard mastery
kind of a self-development classic and it's a shuttle tome
just knit 150 pages or something like that quick little
read but it's a general book the basic idea there
is that our culture has saturated us with this concept
of the magic pill or the get-rich-quick scheme or the
fast short-term results rather than long-term effort people no longer
really care about investing in there in a career in
the future it's all about quick results and if you
look at media for example advertising just perpetuates this you
know get your car fast low monthly payments free financing
available low interest rates so that you can get your
gratification now and not really have to work for it
you know get your degree as fast as possible get
it online etc etc so what is the problem with
this well the problem is really that in America now
there's no longer a culture of of mastery like you
know in other cultures mastery was highly regarded as something
beautiful something that people would take a lot of time
into to really hone their skills so for example in
Japan a lot of a lot of traditional a lot
of traditional career paths you know traditional professions like martial
arts sushi making things like that really a craft I
heard I heard what once on the Discovery Channel there
was documentary about about sushi chefs and they said that
for the first two years the first two years of
a sushi sushi chefs career what he does is he
just learns to properly rinse the rice rinse and prepare
the rice just regular steamed rice but apparently there's so
much nuance there so much to be learned that this
worthwhile for that was spent two years really mastering it
and what George lender talks about in this book is
that there's really a universal process of mastery and that
process of mastery really involves a certain growth curve and
it's an exponential growth curve that starts out very shallow
and then then rises up but the trick is that
it's not just what a night person would expect like
for example let's say you take off a new a
new hobby you take up or a new sport let's
say you take up tennis George Leonard uses as an
example so when you start tennis if you're kind of
a newbie and you come in there with IEP expectations
you expect it your progress your skills are going to
develop in a linear fashion so the more time you
put in the better your skills are going to be
you expect this linear curve but then you're kind of
disappointed when you're on that field and maybe at first
you're doing pretty good job you're you're learning to hit
your basic swings and things are going fine but then
all of a sudden you your first plateau and that's
really what Leonard talks about in this book is the
idea that the learning curve is is just full of
plateaus in fact most of the time when you're mastering
a new skill whether it's a sport hobby something like
chess tennis martial arts a new career whatever it would
be dancing singing all of these things as you're mastering
the most of the time is spent in the plateaus
not progressing or advancing upward so really what the curve
looks like is it moves forward and upward but like
a stair step and the stairs are long see that's
the plateau part and this is really what discourages most
people from success and mastery at almost any skill set
is the idea that once they hit those first few
plateaus they stop seeing progress and they lose faith lose
confidence they realize this as much a much harder thing
to master than they originally expected the problem with this
is that they quit and if you quit one thing
soon enough you're gonna quit the next thing especially when
it comes to mastering skills or you know achieving some
something really meaningful in your life so adding added a
new set of skills to to your repertoire and still
a lot of people stagnate as a result and a
lot of people dabble which is they start on that
curve they progress a little bit they hit those first
few plateaus and then it's like well it's too hard
I'm not advancing as fast as I wanted to I
thought I was going to master this in a couple
of weeks turns out that it's going to take me
years people don't realize the curve the mastery curve is
what it is and really the solution is to understand
the level of commitment that you're making when you're starting
up developing a new skill set but also developing a
love for being on the plateau because that's where going
to spend most of your time you're not going to
spend most of your time advancing it's not going to
be easy you're going to be on those plateaus and
what does that mean that means you can't be after
it for the instant gratification you can't be after it
for that that rush when you get from from progress
you have to just develop a love for the practice
for the day-to-day the minute to minute grind if you
will of whatever it is you're doing but obviously you
don't want to feel the grind of it because see
that's the problem is that if if it feels like
a grind to hit the Save tennis serve hundreds of
times over and over again then you're never going to
be good you're never going to master it in fact
is that the master is the one that loves doing
the fundamentals over and over again and you know as
the classic rule says eighty percent your results come from
twenty percent of your effort so the fundamentals are really
where where it's at and mastering those is the key
to mastery in general so I thought this was a
brilliant concept helped me because a lot of times a
big problem I notice and self-development is just when you're
undertaking a new project or mastering your skill set or
some new endeavor that you're doing look one of the
biggest problems is just setting setting the right expectations you
know having realistic expectations for what your progress is going
to be like how much effort you have to put
in the the level of commitment that you're going to
make one classic kind of classic self-development gym for success
is goes like this basically quote you have to know
what you want see it vision it and then accept
the cost before you can achieve it so the idea
behind that is that you need to know what the
cost not only do you need to know exactly what
it is that you're aiming for that's always the beginning
of any of any of any journey is to set
those goals to set that vision that inspires you but
then to understand that it doesn't just it doesn't come
for free so if you want to be a tennis
master you want to be a great tennis player maybe
not a world ranked player but just you know a
really good player a great player not professional but someone
that can they can play the game well against you
know tough opponents then you have to accept the cost
of what it takes to get there and you know
for various skills going to be different things but in
the case of tennis it's going to be you know
hitting hundreds if not thousands of shots forehand shots backhand
shots serves volleys lobs all of it practicing it again
and again until you develop a mastery for it and
the best way to do that is to cultivate a
love for the process in just the practice because that's
where most your time is going to be spent if
you don't enjoy that if you don't love that that
is going to feel like a grind and you're not
going to take any pleasure in it and you're going
to quit so that was the big lesson of mastery
is to develop a love for the fundamentals practicing the
fundamentals think it's uh it's a really good concept it's
simple its traditional but you know what that's exactly what's
missing in today's get rich quick quick fix culture that
wants magic pill for for every magic pill I'm a
quick solution for every problem but you know what the
really valuable things the things that are be happening in
here the development of your mind that is not going
to come quick I'm going to come easy as done
through massive repetition that's really what mastery is and that's
why you spend so much time in the plateau and
that's why you need to love the day-to-day minutes emitting
act of what you're doing is because you're repeating the
same thing over and over again and developing these slight
little distinctions you're seeing the nuances even though even though
on to the casual observer to the outside observer what
you're doing might seem the same you know hitting the
same serve again and again and again while you need
to hit that a hundred thousand times well really what's
happening behind the scenes is that you're noticing that the
little distinctions and you're calibrating and you're adjusting and your
hardwiring those motor responses deep into your brain so it's
going from from your conscious understanding of how to do
it from going from your prefrontal cortex it's going and
it's getting hard wired into your motor coordination system which
is ultimately the cerebellum the behind brain like the reptilian
brain which makes which gives you unconscious mastery so that
you automatically instinctually know when to make the right hit
I'm going to make the right serve how to adjust
to serve how to get the ball to go exactly
where you want it to go because all those are
little adjustments that you have to make in your swing
and and that's really what master knows how to do
is make those little adjustments whereas to the to the
layman to the newbie those distinctions aren't clear because to
him he hasn't practiced enough times to see them it
seems like well a service services serve a shot as
the shot as a shot or as for the master
there's so much more depth there and once you start
seeing that depth that's really where you develop a love
for that process is in doing it over and over
again and seeing the nuances so I think an eye
for detail a love with the detail for kind of
perfecting perfecting everything every every move every part of your
skill set is is important although it's also important not
to start off as a perfectionist because that's actually one
of the common pitfalls to mastery is is getting in
there and expecting to not screw up which is exactly
the opposite you have to not worry about that in
fact you can't become a master without screwing up hundreds
thousands of times because each other you fail you learn
something new that's valuable reference experiences that you're accumulating and
then you will be using that to become more perfect
or better than you were previously you will never become
perfect and you certainly cannot expect to do a perfect
serve the first time you do it or the perfect
shot that's just that's just recipe for failure because if
you go in with that mindset then again your expectations
are out of whack with with just how reality works
the fact is that the best way to master skill
set is to go with their humble and willing to
learn and willing to look ridiculous and do whatever it
takes it's not about being a perfectionist that comes automatically
with loving the process putting it over and over again
and learning and not being afraid to look stupid once
in a while or in the case of newbie that's
our starting off most of the time so those are
some of the lessons from mastery and I think I'll
wrap it up there but that was a pretty good
blog
