            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/jETH9SI2zNQ' target='_blank'>Resume Writing Tips - The Secret Mindset For Writing a Perfect Resume</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Mindset for resume writing</b>: The mindset for resume writing is understanding what the employer wants and needs.
</li><li><b>Employer perspective and needs</b>: An employer wants someone who is reliable, talented, affordable, and speedy. They need someone to handle a specific task or part of their business, such as developing a website or handling marketing or sales. The task must also be performed quickly and efficiently.
</li><li><b>Specific problems to solve</b>: For example, an employer might be creating a website but does not know how to implement a shopping cart into their website and would prefer to hire someone else to do this task. This is a specific problem that an employer wants to resolve.
</li><li><b>Employer's specific criteria</b>: The employer has specific criteria, such as what type of shopping cart they want, the payment options, tracking orders, and affordability. They want to find someone who can handle these specific challenges and at a reasonable price.
</li><li><b>Finding the right employee</b>: The employers focus is to find someone who fits their criteria perfectly and at an affordable price. They don't want to spend a huge amount on hiring a professional for a task that could be relatively simple.
</li><li><b>Filling the position quickly</b>: The employer wants to fill the position as soon as possible because they've identified a business opportunity or challenge that they need help with.
</li><li><b>Understanding the employer's perspective</b>: Understanding and empathising with the employer's perspective makes writing a resume easier. Competitors applying for entry-level jobs are unlikely to understand this perspective.
</li><li><b>Employer's perspective on hiring</b>: An employer considers both value and skill when hiring. They seek professionals who are affordably priced, talented, and skilled. The candidate needs to demonstrate proficiency in the necessary languages and show reliability. Besides, having versatility in numerous languages and prior experience in the required area enhances their appeal to the employer.
</li><li><b>Employer's reluctance to hire generalists</b>: Employers tend to be uninterested in hiring generalists who have no specific experience relevant to the job description. For instance, they would prefer a specialist shopping cart programmer over a generalist one, as the former can ensure quicker and more efficient delivery, given their specialized experience and knowledge. 
</li><li><b>Strategic resume writing</b>: Job seekers should hence write their resumes emphasizing specific skills and experiences that align with the employer's needs. Overstating credentials or fluffing up resumes with jargon or irrelevant information can harm credibility. The ideal resume comprises a precise bulleted list of skills, specializations, what can be offered to the employer, past experiences, and personal attributes that would contribute to success.  
</li><li><b>Importance of showcasing work</b>: Backing up skills and claims with a substantial portfolio or relevant experience examples can greatly increase a candidate's chances of getting hired. A strong portfolio can, at times, outweigh everything else in a resume. 
</li><li><b>Resume structure</b>: The resume should be concise, sparse, and straightforward, focusing on what job seekers can provide to employers. Flowery language, subjective philosophies, or irrelevant details should be avoided. 
</li><li><b>Understanding the secret to resume writing</b>: The secret to effective resume writing lies in understanding and adopting an employer's perspective. This shift in perspective can empower job seekers to independently figure out the best strategies for their resume presentation, resulting in a more compelling and desirable resume.
