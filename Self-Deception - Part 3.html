[Music] you let's wrap up this series on self-deception by
completing our list of self-deception mechanisms I promised you a
list of over 60 of them we're gonna cover about
30 of them here today picking right back up from
where we left off with part 2 so I got
a really big one for you to begin with which
is ignoring one's own conflicts of interest oh man talk
about a self-deception mechanism this one is huge and under
it this is such a big one that there are
some sub topics which I include double standards as other
self deception sub mechanism here self justifications and excuse making
backwards rationalization confabulation and wanting or needing a thing to
be true so let's talk about all of these but
let's begin with this central point about conflict of interest
what is a conflict of interest and why is it
so deceptive well think about a tobacco company executive who
has built his entire career on climbing the corporate ladder
for 20 years and now he's the CEO of this
tobacco company and let's imagine this was before there was
a lot of good scientific evidence which conclusively proved that
tobacco caused cancer so back then in his own mind
it was iffy you know he might have suspected that
cigarettes aren't really the healthiest thing but it wasn't conclusive
but then what starts to happen his ass he's CEO
all this evidence and all the science starts coming out
but of course this presenta huge conflict of interest because
his entire career and his entire identity and the way
he feeds himself and his family the way he puts
his kids through college depends on him being this great
executive of this successful tobacco company so is he going
to really listen to that scientific evidence when it comes
out is he going to be objective very very unlikely
and of course we understand how this works in these
sorts of situations we understand when politicians act with conflict
of interest we even have laws against conflict of interest
where judges or attorneys or certain heads of government are
supposed to recuse themselves in a situation where they have
a conflict of interest because a judge can't judge a
situation when his own interests are involved like financially for
example but this is a much bigger thing than just
politicians and judges and CEOs this goes to all of
us and it especially applies very strongly in areas of
how we make our living although of course there can
be other kinds of conflict of interest but especially where
you make your living because it's precisely the place that
you get your livelihood from that you are most likely
not to question if there's something there which isn't completely
true or authentic and so a lot of people build
their entire careers on inauthenticity and falsehood and unconsciousness and
even though the back of their mind they know this
they can't really ever admit it to themselves because hey
how am I gonna survive you see the reason it's
so closely tied to someone's career is because career isn't
just about going to work it's actually your survival it's
how you bring home the paycheck and in modern society
bringing home the paycheck is equivalent to an animal hunting
for food it's sort of like you're taking away the
Lions ability to hunt for antelope of course the line
is not going to stand for that because it's very
survival is on the line so this becomes a very
potent self-deception mechanism and of course I don't exclude myself
from this and in fact actualised org is a significant
conflict of interest for me as I pursue the truth
and as I do spirituality because hey you know when
you start to get successful you sort of develop a
reputation you you start to release courses and you start
to earn money for what you're doing the way that
I do then sure yeah there's a pressure there's a
pressure like you you need and you want things to
come out a certain way because that helps your business
for example what if the truth happens to not help
your business what if it actually starts to erode your
business what are you gonna do are you gonna side
with the truth or with your business with your success
with your career so that's tricky that's something I've had
to navigate for a few years now and I still
have to navigate that I have to I have to
walk that path very carefully and that's that's always been
a challenge for mixing spirituality with money that's why a
lot of people don't like to do that a lot
of teachers will say oh you shouldn't charge money for
teaching at all because if it's a true teaching then
I should be free and generally I'm on board that's
why most of my videos are free just a little
bit ads but of course there's also the reality that
you need money and you need energy in order to
fuel something so if someone's doing this full-time putting a
lot of their time and energy into it then it
also it also becomes a way of making a living
so it's tricky it's tricky to navigate that there's no
like clear and cut answers for how to do it
so the next sub point is double standards and this
one I find really interesting to observe in politics for
example where it's very crystal clear and the hypocrisy there
is incredible it's just stunning how much double standards exist
within politics for example we're seeing it nowadays with Republicans
and with Democrats and there's a double standard on both
sides so one of the double standards with Republicans and
conservatives is that when one of their politicians gets accused
of lying or immorality or some sexual scandal or something
like that which traditionally no they like to they like
to be the party of morality then of course they
ignore it and they don't really take it seriously because
they have a double standard they expect morality from everybody
else but really from themselves but then of course you
got the same sort of problem happening with liberals with
the Democrats because nowadays with all the sexual scandals coming
out Democrats want to take a firm stance on sexual
abuse but then of course the Democrats have a lot
of instances of sexual abuse in the in their in
their past with their politicians especially Bill Clinton for example
and so you know where were where were the Democrats
and where where was their outrage about sexual scandals and
sexual abuse back in the Clinton era so see of
course they turn a blind eye to it because it's
all about how your mind is able to push through
itself agenda so really the thing if you're a part
of a political party that you care about is that
your political party is winning that's the same thing as
your ego winning so of course you're gonna use and
manipulate whatever evidence or facts come your way for your
own benefit and you're gonna ignore and cherry-pick all the
stuff that doesn't serve your agenda and that's why you
see so much hypocrisy within politics and a lot of
people are disillusioned by that of course but that doesn't
just happen in politics that happens within yourself as well
you should start to notice double standards that you hold
in many areas within your life scientists hold a lot
of double standards you might think scientists are supposed to
be the objective ones but of course that's not quite
quite true right because you might take a hard-nosed scientist
like a physicist or something and you might start talking
to about some religious topic or some spiritual topic and
he'll say oh but there's no objective proof for God
or for any of this religious stuff so I can't
take any of it seriously right so that's one standard
but is he applying that same standard to himself and
to science is there objective proof for example that there
exists an external world of course not there never was
and there never will be because the objective were the
external world this is a conceptual construction and there can
be no proof for it and if horse science has
never proved it but do most scientists accept this do
most scientists really question the existence of the external world
no not at all because that just comes to them
as part of the dogma of the scientific paradigm so
of course how do they get away with it by
having the double standard so people who are very rational
and skeptically minded they often have a very strong harsh
standard that they apply to spiritually minded people and New
Age people and they like to criticize and dismiss the
New Age people because oh the New Age people they
have such lacks standards of evidence and criteria they're not
really hard-nosed enough well what about the scientists what about
the rationalist what about the materialists do you actually have
conclusive proof that the universe is rational that is material
see do you have conclusive proof that there exists a
self why do you believe in a self have scientists
seven prove ever proven the existence of a self no
of course not all this stuff is just taken for
granted and then a double standard is applied to a
bunch of other religious stuff which of course is a
gross hypocrisy but the mind doesn't see it precisely because
it sets up these standards and it doesn't know that
it's setting up these standards to the mind it seems
like no this is just reality is just truth and
we see a lot of double standards very interestingly within
spiritual traditions and communities so for example you might go
to the Buddhists as one community or you might go
to the Neo invitin stew as another community and you
ask them ok so if I use your spiritual techniques
or your meditation technique or your self inquiry technique so
is this gonna like produce all the results for me
is this gonna make me enlightened Interlaken me or whatever
and grow me and of course the Buddhists will say
yes of course our techniques are the best and then
you ask the Neo advance what about your techniques are
they the best and they say yeah of course our
techniques are the best the boot techniques they're not so
good see and every group you noticed does this and
then if I ask the Buddhist group okay so how
good are your techniques really objectively like what if we
compare them with the Neo invitin techniques and one of
the Buddhists gonna say the boots are gonna say oh
those new inviting techniques they don't really enlightened people they
they produce half-baked indictments and they're not really as good
and strong as our techniques but when you actually take
a look at any school and you objectively evaluate how
good their techniques are in truth what you discover is
that 98% of all spiritual techniques are utter failures and
all the students who go to all the workshops and
all the seminars and all the bypass and retreats and
all the Sat songs and all of that do they
ever become awakened do they ever radically transform their consciousness
no of course not because that's true across the board
across all spiritual traditions across all spiritual techniques so the
trick though of belonging to one school is to turn
a blind eye to all the people who fail using
your own techniques so what the Buddhists will do is
though say Ollie oh but look at all these people
who have become enlightened through Buddhist teachings and techniques yes
of course but you're ignoring the even greater number who
never did and never will and so the Buddhists will
point to the new invite ins they'll say oh look
at all the people who fail at neo-advaita yes of
course but look at all the people who also fail
at Buddhism just as many if not more and of
course that's true of neo-advaita and have a very other
tradition basically it's really quite amazing at the double standards
that these that these schools have and why is that
because the loyalty of the person who belongs to one
of these traditions or schools is of course the school
comes first that's like the new ego that's being defended
and so there's no objective analysis that's actually happening or
objective comparison of which techniques are actually the best objectively
speaking that's never actually done these people don't go out
and they don't try 20 different techniques they try a
couple of techniques within their tradition and then they become
staunch defenders of that self justification and excuse making of
course serves to enforce these double standards so these double
standards are never acknowledged to be double standards they're always
excused away the mind always comes up with a good
excuse for why there should be an exception for Buddhism
or for neo advisor or for something else so of
course it'll cherry-pick evidence to make its case and also
it'll employ the tools of backwards rationalization and confabulation and
this is a really powerful phenomenon psychologists have called it
confabulation it's when actually they've pinpointed it to the left
hemisphere in the human brain there are modules in the
left hemisphere which are extremely good at backwards rationalizing or
confabulating a story which explains a situation after the fact
to fit a particular narrative or agenda that the person
has and there are some remarkable cases with with people
who have brain disorders which very clearly illustrate just how
strong confabulation can be and I'll actually shoot an episode
that I plan in the future about brain disorders and
all the interesting stuff that goes on with those and
there I will talk about some amazing cases of confabulation
which will utterly blow your mind people who backwards rationalize
the most incredibly false things and trick themselves into believing
that it's actually true because they they fail to take
into account that when the mind is rationalizing it can
rationalize almost anything it wants in the same way that
an attorney a really good attorney can argue for almost
any case and a good attorney can stand there in
a courtroom with a big smile on his face and
legitimately defend rapist or a murderer or some politician how
does he do that precisely because he's using his left
hemisphere to do this sort of confabulating building a strong
case through cherry-picking of evidence and having these double standards
and the last sub component here is wanting or needing
a thing to be true for whatever reason maybe you
need a thing to be true because your relationship hinges
on it or are you having sex hinges on it
or you not upsetting your child hinges on it so
what you're gonna do in that case is because you
don't want to upset your child or because you want
to have sex or because you want to maintain your
relationship or because you want to keep your career you
are going to say to hell with the truth of
course dissolve done subconsciously so you don't consciously say to
hell with the truth but subconsciously you say to hell
with the truth I'm gonna go with what's gonna serve
me the most and so you do and so then
that's how these self-deceptions get enforced the next self deception
mechanism is unwillingness to do personal investigation into matters not
being willing to actually put in the time and energy
to do research this is a big trap that I
see people falling into because I might present some technique
or some abstract philosophical idea for example through my content
and then some skeptic will post to me and say
all leo but where's the proof for that well the
proof is you going and actually doing the research but
then of course they say ABBA Leo why should I
do the research give me the proof for why the
research will be useful for me to do but you
see that's of course sort of a catch-22 if you're
looking for proof for why the researcher is going to
be valuable then you're not really serious about doing the
research to be a really good researcher what you need
to understand is that research could lead to a dead
end and that not every single path that you pursue
within a research project is necessarily going to lead to
gold and in fact most companies who do research like
pharmaceutical companies or technology companies military research all the sort
of stuff what happens with their research projects most of
them end up going nowhere most technologies never come to
market most new drugs that are being tested will fail
the approval process and you might say oh that's a
huge waste of money yes but the whole value of
research is that you take multiple paths you pursue multiple
avenues and then you have a shot at discovering something
big striking gold but you can't do that so long
as from the very beginning you need to be guaranteed
of the result you see and it's the same way
with with personal development research I research a lot of
stuff and not all of it pans out I try
and dabble with different techniques and not all those techniques
work for me or produce the kind of results that
I want but then once in a while I strike
on a technique that's really amazing and really powerful and
I would never have been able to stumble upon it
had I not had this mindset of being a researcher
and being willing to try stuff and having it fail
but see to be a good researcher that requires that
you don't judge things too harshly from the outset you
need to be open to the fact that your mind
can be changed that's why you're doing research you would
be a very bad researcher if you assumed the result
the end result of your research before you actually did
the research if that was the case you wouldn't need
to do research to begin with because you'd already know
what's true and what's the best but the whole point
is that you don't know what's the best and what's
true therefore you need to keep your mind open it
would be sort of like imagine that you're fat and
you've never been to the gym and then I tell
you hey you know you can get really buff you
can get like one of the one of those little
weightlifter bodies by going to the gym and doing squats
and doing the treadmill and all this sort of stuff
but you're very skeptically minded so you say aha leo
but where's the proof show me the proof and I
say well the proof is in the doing go to
the gym do it and get your results but you're
so skeptical that of course what do you say you
say ah Leo but okay fine fine fine you convinced
me you've convinced me I'm open-minded I'm gonna go for
one week and I'm gonna try it and then I'll
prove you either right or wrong so you go for
a week you try it and then you say aha
Leo look I went for a week I tried it
and look I proved you wrong I'm still fat I'm
still not the weightlifter that you know I don't have
that weightlifter body that you promised me yes of course
because you're still fundamentally closed-minded see what's required for this
case to succeed is you have to be much more
open-minded than you are you have to try it for
a whole year maybe for two years and you have
to be serious about it you can't half-ass it it's
the same thing with personal development techniques and with spiritual
techniques you can't just go meditate for a week half-assing
it and then say okay if I don't get my
results that I'm quitting well if that's your attitude you
might as well not go do it at all you're
just wasting your week there it's not enough to be
5% open-minded as in these failed cases you need to
be a hundred percent open-minded so that the situation could
actually work on you and transform you but see the
self-deception that a lot of people get themselves into is
is with this sort of false sense of of open-mindedness
they're unwilling to actually do personal investigation into existential matters
or into personal development into spirituality or any this kind
of stuff and then they complain that all there's not
enough evidence there's not enough evidence Leo about self-help only
because you haven't bothered to get off your ass and
do the personal investigation and of course not because you're
lazy and because your mind wants to stay stuck in
its all tools paradigms and all its old habits to
actually do real research real personal investigation into things that
is emotionally challenging and it's actually gonna transform you and
it's gonna kill you in various ways to various degrees
and that's of course something the mine doesn't want the
next self-deception mechanism is assuming rigid dualistic categories or distinctions
and this is something that's plagued Western thought for over
2,000 years ever since Aristotle who came up with all
these categories for reality and what do I mean by
these dualistic categories or distinctions well the mind loves to
think of reality as having these fixed categories like science
versus religion as though these two things are totally separate
and either you're scientific or you're religious or how about
the category of good and bad either something is good
or something is bad or is evil or subjective versus
objective either something is objective or subjective or mind versus
body or physical versus immaterial or life versus death and
there's hundreds of others of these dualistic sorta categories a
really good example might be natural versus artificial this is
one that trips a lot of people up a lot
of people will use this argument of like Oh Ally
oh this thing here is good because it's natural and
that thing there is bad because it's artificial but what
they don't understand is that they're assuming this this category
somehow fundamentals or reality but it's really not this is
just a conceptual category and science has been plagued by
this for for a very long time and it still
is to this day many scientists just assume that these
sorts of categories are true of reality that they are
objective when in fact the notion of objective is itself
one of these categories the truth is that all such
categories ultimately collapse when you explore them broadly and deeply
enough only when you have a very narrow perspective can
one of these categories hold up you know in many
situations in life such a category does hold up like
you can say that an item or a food is
artificial or natural and loosely speaking that can be true
and that that can be a useful distinction to make
but you always have to keep in mind that there's
nothing fundamental about it and that ultimately if you explore
this question of which foods are natural artificial you should
understand and you should expect that that's gonna collapse and
break down and it's never gonna be so simple as
just categorizing this piece of fruit or that vegetable or
that piece of meat as being artificial or or natural
because there are no sharp boundaries within reality there's always
just these fuzzy edges and that's what we find with
science you know a science investigates things deeper and deeper
and deeper they see that all of these sorts of
simplistic categories that we used to have for example the
Aristotle came up with 2,000 years ago that all of
them ultimately collapse including for example the category of matters
versus energy which is something that was discovered by Einstein
and by quantum physicists over a hundred years ago now
is that there is no such category even though simplistically
speaking yes we assume that there is a difference between
matter and energy but also now we know that you
can convert one into the other that's what nuclear reactions
are about or how about with light being a particle
or a wave see early scientists thought that it must
be one or the other because they assume that it's
just this is a just a rigid categorization scheme and
that nature must fit into one box or another box
but then they discovered it's not so simple as just
light being a particle or a wave it's got properties
of both another self-deception mechanism is being overly logical and
rational I've talked about this in the past hopefully you
can see how this becomes a self-deception mechanism because logic
and rationality is not something you can assume is going
to deliver truth to you not necessarily there are a
lot of rational logical people in the world who are
deluded so you got to wonder what's the difference what's
really running the show is logic and rationality may be
a tool of the mind to actually maintain its power
why is it that law that lawyers can use logic
and reason to argue for all sorts of silly things
and philosophers have used logic and reason to argue for
all sorts of silly things as well so how can
you rely on logic and reason is it rational and
logical to just take on faith that reality can be
fully understood through logic and through reason or is that
just a dogma is that just a personal pet theory
of yours that you're clinging to another closely associated self-deception
mechanism with this one is thinking bias something I call
thinking bias it's when a person thinks that thinking is
the only way that one can understand reality and that
thinking is the best way and if there is nothing
beyond thinking and that if I can't think it then
it can't be true or it can't be real and
that anything that is true or Israel must be thinkable
but what if there are other ways of interacting and
understanding reality other than thought such as for example intuition
or such as for example direct consciousness see people who
are very logical and rational don't take these other modalities
very seriously because they're just stuck on thinking all the
time and the mind of course loves to think so
of course that's a conflict of interest that it has
since it loves to think it loves to think that
thinking is the best and that thinking is all that
there is but how do you know that you can
trust all the thinking that your mind does that's the
very thing that we're questioning here so we have to
be careful not to use our thinking to justify our
thinking you see because that just creates a vicious circle
another related self-deception bias is what I called analysis bias
or self-deception mechanism rather is analysis bias what is this
this is the tendency of rational and scientifically minded people
to want to analyze the world to death thinking that
the best way to understand the world and to arrive
at truth is through analysis or a sort of a
reductionist philosophy where we take everything we just split it
apart slice and dice it and by doing so thinking
that we're gonna get to the most fundamental elements and
of course this is something we see for example within
science within the physical sciences it's like if you take
a cell and you break it apart into its little
molecules and stuff then you get chemicals and if you
break those chemicals apart then you get atoms and if
you break those apart you get quarks and so we
say okay so we just uh D quarks then we're
gonna understand everything about reality but of course it doesn't
work this way this is another bias that the mind
has which is fragmentation the mind just assumes that if
it can just break everything apart into little pieces that
it will understand because see the mind can't deal with
big stuff it needs to simplify things down break it
down into little pieces because it can't hold the whole
but what's interesting about reality is that just taking some
pieces and arranging them together doesn't produce the whole the
most interesting phenomenon in life are emergent phenomena phenomenon that
is greater than some of its individual parts see you
take a bunch of little bouncing around plutonium atoms and
if you have a small number of them they just
bounce around they vibrate but you have enough of them
and you trigger them and then you get a chain
reaction now you get all sudden a nuclear weapon that's
very different that's a that's a huge qualitative shift there
when you get past that critical mass and a lot
of other things in life work that way so fragmentation
is a is a poor way of generally speaking understanding
reality especially if you care about the big picture and
this analysis bias you see a very prevalent throughout our
universities and in academia because their people become hyper specialized
within a sub-domain of some science and they become technical
masters of that sub domain and they learn about some
very niche esoteric topic like molecular biology or some subfield
within algebra or calculus and then they think that because
they have that they now they they've they've understood the
world but of course they haven't what they've gotten sucked
into is small picture thinking really if you want to
have a true understanding of the world what you're looking
for is looking for wisdom and you're looking for big
picture thinking and you're looking for holism which is actually
the opposite of analysis and fragmentation you're looking for synthesis
you're looking for getting a like a Gestalt of the
entire thing which is difficult for the mind to do
it's difficult for the logical mind to do this actually
it can't this sort of holistic understanding requires more intuitive
capacities which many people are out of touch with and
so this sort of analysis and reductionism ultimately can lead
to a lot of self-deception because it might seem like
when you're analyzing everything to death that you're understanding it
all but actually you are just investing a lot of
your time and energy understanding of the minutiae of life
but missing the most important parts which is why you
can have a scientist who's a brilliant mathematician or a
physicist or something like that but he's not gonna have
wisdom he's not gonna have an understanding of what reality
is or what emotions are or how to be in
a relationship and you might say oh Willy oh but
that's not his job yeah exactly that's the whole problem
is see when you define your job as a very
narrow thing then that's what you become you become this
technical technician this little technical robot and then you're not
happy with your life you're depressed your life doesn't go
well because for your life to go well you need
to be more of a generalist with life rather than
a technician and this is especially a problem in universities
because universities put a lot of pressure on intellectuals to
become hyper technicians and you would think that well in
a university we should have our smartest people in society
would be the professors and academics and the doctors and
the PhDs but actually turns out to be oftentimes quite
the opposite don't go to a university to find wisdom
that's the irony of it the next self-deception mechanism is
what I call impossibility bias it's assuming that your intuition
of what's possible and impossible is correct how many times
have we seen throughout the history of science or humanity
where people have made bold predictions about things that aren't
impossible powered man flight is impossible uh-uh nuclear explosions are
impossible ex is impossible why is impossible this thing is
impossible that thing is impossible and then what happens is
that usually within a hundred years and oftentimes much quicker
these people are proven to be wrong why is this
how could they have deceived themselves so for example there's
a famous example of Lord Kelvin who is over one
of the top respected scientists in the late 1800s and
he made a famous pronouncement that powered man flight will
never be possible to scientific impossibility and that was just
five years before the Wright brothers created and flew the
first plane that was rather a huge embarrassment for him
he all he also famously said that x-rays are a
hoax and that they are also impossible and then he
was very quickly proven wrong so how could this be
the case well because the mind gets arrogant and it
takes the limits of its imagination for the limits of
reality and we see this time and time again it's
not just with Lord Kelvin you see this with very
many intelligent people throughout Western intellectual tradition it's quite remarkable
how easily they trick themselves one thing that we have
discovered throughout human history is that the future always surprises
us in radical ways and new things end up being
possible which we could have never have conceived of you
know just go back 500 years and tell them that
you're gonna have a smartphone which has streaming video on
it that you can use all over the country without
any interruptions and service and you can talk to your
mom across the world and it all works seamlessly and
they would have they would have called you out as
a heretic and as as a sorcerer if you said
that even scientists would say you're deluded because what you're
is completely unscientific that's completely impossible you're talking about some
kind of magical wireless technologies non-physical immaterial technologies delivering radio
waves and all this stuff this is hocus pocus that's
what they would have told you because we mistake our
own limited imaginations for the limitations of the world that's
a powerful lesson you can learn from history another self-deception
mechanism is mistaking truth with proved ability again many intelligent
and rational and scientific people mistake these two things the
notion of truth improve ability these are two different things
and the domain of things which are true is much
larger than domain of things that are provable whereas many
rationally minded people think that these I do Menor I
dent achill they think that if a thing is is
true it must be provable and if it's not provable
that means it must not be true that's actually false
and it's actually been proven for example curt girdle actually
proved that within mathematics the domain of truth must always
be much larger than the domain of proof ability and
that was within a hard feel like mathematics not to
mention ordinary everyday situations so a lot of people make
the mistake of thinking that Ollie oh well if you're
saying something and it's very profound its true that means
you should be able to easily prove it to me
no not at all in fact the most profound things
are often completely unprovable because the truth doesn't care about
prove ability prove ability is something that you do in
a sort of formal way like a self-help technique might
be very helpful for you it might calm your emotions
certain meditation techniques can get you to all sorts of
interesting mystical states and like that stuff like that but
proving it is much harder because proving it is like
you have to pay a lot of money to set
up a double-blind clinical study in a laboratory those usually
cost tens of millions of dollars they usually take up
a lot of time making take many years to do
they require large sample sizes a lot of you know
careful controlling of all the variables who's gonna pay for
that do you think science just goes around and proves
everything that's true no science cherry-picks what it goes after
these experiments are very expensive so science has to be
very selective as to what its gonna fund and what
it's going to research and of course it mostly does
the research on stuff that's gonna earn money which is
how science is biased by business and by marketing another
related self-deception mechanism is expecting the truth to be thrust
upon you and proven to you overwhelmingly against your own
resistance so some skeptics will take this position of like
Oh leo well if what you're talking about is true
then you should be able to prove it beyond a
doubt such that I am convinced no matter how much
of a devil's advocate and a skeptic that I play
no of course not in fact the truth is such
a delicate thing that if you are not willing to
surrender yourself to it completely then you're never gonna see
it this is a big mistake that people make people
assume that the truth is just so overwhelming that it'll
it'll convince and persuade anybody no it's just the opposite
of that it will only convince the person who is
willing to surrender to it which means that you have
to be willing to to meet the truth halfway you
can't sit in your little corner with your ears and
eyes shut and expecting me or somebody else deliver the
truth to you it just doesn't work that way another
self-deception mechanism is assuming that reality is simple intuitive and
obvious and because it is so we can use linear
Aristotelian logic to understand reality and this linear Aristotelian logic
is sort of like a thing is either a or
it's B or it's C or D but it can't
be a combination of all the above or it can't
be that a is part true and part false and
B is part true and part part false see linear
air-sealing logic says it no it must be either a
is true or B is true and most things in
the world aren't that simple aren't that black and white
which leads me to the self-deception mechanism of black and
white thinking this is something that's very tricky and produces
a lot of self delusion for example well here's a
good example for you with personal development is that people
do personal development but only here about enlightenment and then
say well Leo what's the point of personal development doesn't
enlightenment mean that all persons of ailment is false and
then it's all useless and see what that is that's
black and white thinking no it's not like that why
would it be that way why do you assume that
why do you need things to be so black and
white why can't it be the case that you can
pursue enlightenment and even after you get enlightenment that there's
still value to doing personal development that there are personal
element techniques that are just independent of enlightenment that can
still improve your life and that you probably want to
learn for example just because enlightened you're enlightened doesn't mean
that you understand nutrition and how to feed yourself properly
or just because you're enlightened doesn't mean that now your
relationships are gonna be smooth because you haven't learned how
to relate to human beings and that's a separate issue
but of course see people don't like that sort of
complexity and they don't like the complexity like well just
because you're enlightened they think it all down all the
sudden life purpose is pointless and it's stupid no because
after enlightenment you're still gonna have to feed yourself you're
still gonna have to have a job unless you're already
a millionaire so what's your job gonna be is it
gonna be working at McDonald's are you gonna be happy
with that or would you rather create the kind of
job where you're actually doing something that you find meaningful
something that you can be passionate about see these things
aren't at odds with each other the way that people
like to think sometimes another example of black-and-white thinking is
some people here this topic about self-deception and they say
Oh leo so that means everything is a self-deception see
they become indiscriminate whereas before they heard about self-deception they
thought nothing was a self-deception now they hear me talking
about all this stuff it's obviously all okay so let's
swing the pendulum completely the opposite way now everybody do
is deluded every emotion that I have every thought that
I have everything that's going on with me is complete
self-deception and what does that turn out to be Pope
just more self-deception no the whole point is that self-deception
is subtle it's not black and white it's not the
case that everything is self-deception you do have genuine motivations
and desires within you and you have certain values that
you shouldn't just throw out because you assume that they're
lies you have to actually carefully introspect and look in
there and learn how to distinguish between what's true and
what's false within you otherwise you're just gonna get yourself
stuck because once you start to think that everything is
a self-deception including yourself deception to self-deception including everything I'm
telling you is a self-deception including all enlightenment teachings are
self deceptions so you're so wrapped up in this idea
of self-deception that now you've deceived yourself into complete inaction
so now what you do is you do nothing and
what you get is you get the exact same life
that you've always gotten which is largely one based on
selfish and that just continues and perpetuates which is the
opposite of what we want what will go on here
is we want to help you to jailbreak your mind
and that requires nuance not black and white thinking about
the next self-deception mechanism I call it paradox bias this
is a general bias that I noticed that most rational
minds have and have had throughout Western intellectual tradition since
the very beginning of avoiding paradox and avoiding weirdness they're
scared of the paradoxical or weird or strange facets of
reality it's like the human mind the rational mind wants
reality to also fit it's sort of rational agenda so
it tends to only look at phenomena which fit that
and it tends to not look at the paradoxical edge
cases and actually I find the paradoxical edge cases to
be the most interesting aspects of phenomena to study it's
in those gaps or in those cracks that you find
the paradoxes from which you can learn the most about
the ultimate nature of reality sure it's easy to look
at reality and to cherry-pick the phenomena such that it
fits your rationals paradigm but that's not the whole picture
that's a partial picture that's a partial picture that fits
your rationalist paradigm and I'll actually shoot an episode in
the future well at where I will present evidence for
how many great Western intellectuals have actually been scared to
death of paradox and have gone to great lengths to
eliminate all traces of paradox from feels like logic mathematics
and the hard sciences and how that ultimately got them
into trouble and into epistemic blunders so that's for our
future topic the next self-deception mechanism is taking hard-won knowledge
as obvious a good example of this is for example
we just assumed these days that it saw Deus that
a surgeon should wash his hands before doing surgery especially
after he's just finished operating on another patient you think
what could be more obvious than that and yet 300
years ago if you proposed the idea that surgeons had
to wash their hands in between surgeries they would have
laughed at you they would have criticized you for daring
to to say that they're unclean doctors and they would
have actually kicked you out of the hospital which is
actually exactly what happened with the very first doctor who
started to propose the idea that washing hands is important
for sanitation and actually a lot of deaths were caused
by not washing hands do you think that his ideas
were accepted by doctors no of course not they were
totally rejected because this is not an obvious thing the
way that we assume and this is just one example
of of a ton of other pieces of knowledge like
this which to us these days in the 21st century
seems totally obvious but actually many people had to die
and overcome a lot of dogma and resistance hundreds of
years ago for us now to be able to take
this hard-won knowledge as obvious now it appears that it
never had to be hard-won no one had to actually
fight for it when in fact people died for this
knowledge and we are just like standing on the shoulders
of giants these days and taking a lot of it
for granted and the reason that this produces a self-deception
is because this also gets people to think about the
wrong way about how our knowledge will progress because if
we had to fight so hard to get most of
our knowledge nowadays you have to assume that we're gonna
also have to fight that hard to keep advancing our
knowledge into the future people just have to assume that
knowledge just comes easily because the truth just reveals itself
and everybody agrees to it no that's not how a
knowledge works worshiped you costly have to fight and push
and battle against all sorts of self-interest and entrenched interests
and dogmas and people's prejudices so that later after all
that fighting is over people can say oh of course
that's so obviously we knew it already everybody knew that
no they didn't they only say that after the victory
has been won another sub deception mechanism is what I
call mindfuck bias it's the tendency of very intelligent and
rational people to look at a trend and expend the
expect the trend to just keep going in the same
direction they can just extrapolate it out and they assume
there's not gonna be a surprise reversal somewhere in that
trend and what this does this sets them up for
a mindfuck and the reason I call it mindfuck bias
is fundamentally these people underestimate the possibility of mind [
__ ] within whatever thing they're studying because they think
that uh you know if you think the trend is
just going this way it'll just keep going this way
like if population is just rising it's just gonna continue
rise if computer processing powers is growing every year is
just gonna continue to grow no not necessarily you always
have to be open for a mindfuck for a surprise
reversal because reality is nonlinear another self-deception mechanism is what
I call pragmatic bias that's the tendency of people to
only care about things which they see as obviously useful
to them and then what they say is they say
well leo if it's not useful then who cares why
should I care about it and this becomes a great
source of self-deception because of course the stuff that's useful
to you is the stuff that directly serves your your
ego serves your survival but what if there are things
out there that aren't immediately useful or aren't useful at
all but nevertheless are true you would miss out on
those things because you're always so pragmatic that you're only
looking for the stuff that's gonna immediately help you to
advance yourself you see but what if life is more
than just about advancing yourself what if life is more
than just success or technology a lot of people these
days confuse success and technology with truth but these are
actually poor indicators of truth just because something is successful
doesn't make it true in fact often it's just the
opposite some of the most successful people are complete frauds
and just because the technology works doesn't mean that it's
based on knowledge which is necessarily true for example we
have a lot of technology that we've built based on
Newtonian mechanics but we know that mccanna Newtonian mechanics is
technically false but it's still very useful it's a useful
approximation it's not the truth a lot of rationally minded
people place their faith into technology and I think that
all technology will deliver us from all the problems of
society and if we can just get more success that
will Leo that will obviate the need for truth who
cares about truth and we could just become so rich
if our economy can just keep growing and our technology
can just keep it increasing then truth doesn't matter anymore
but what they're doing there is there they're overlooking the
subtle value of pure truth of truth for truth sake
and it is it's tough it's really difficult to take
a person who's pragmatic and to convince him that hey
you know why don't you lay your pragmatism aside and
maybe you can just pursue truth for truth sake for
a while and see what that does for you and
see how that might surprise you because the pragmatical person
will say what but Leo what's in it for me
is it gonna make me richer is it gonna make
my ability to make new technology better No maybe it
won't but maybe what it will do is it'll get
you to see a bigger picture maybe they'll get you
to see that life is more than just about pursuing
value and just being a pragmatic robot which is the
whole problem with pragmatism is that you just become a
robot always just chasing success that's the problem with value
scanning everything all the time you're putting a value on
everything but then you don't appreciate really anything because you
look at a beautiful sunset and I tell you hey
look at this beautiful sunset look at this beautiful painting
and you say oh but what's the value of it
how much does that sunset really worth what's the dollar
sign on it what's that painting really worth oh it's
worth a hundred million dollars because it's a van Gogh
oh yeah that's interesting I can appreciate that but of
course there you're not really appreciating the the painting itself
you're appreciating the dollar sign behind it because you treat
everything as a tool for advancing your personal agenda but
then that backfires on you because when you're living your
life pragmatically all the time you're actually missing out on
the most fundamental aspect of life which is the appreciation
of the inherent beauty of everything of being you're missing
out on the beauty of being when you're being pragmatic
because you're just using the being as a tool towards
something else and something else and something else is so
it just becomes a never-ending rat race and you're never
fulfilled by that and then you don't know why because
you're too pragmatic that's why other self deception mechanism is
under estimating the influence of business marketing and culture in
influencing your worldviews and your beliefs and your desires this
is huge I've talked about it before I'll just mention
it briefly here but people just don't understand that modern
business and marketing literally manufactures our culture the kind of
music that you like the kind of movies you like
the kind of jokes you like all of this has
been completely influenced by business and by marketing and this
leads to great self-deception because you're just buying into the
culture which has been shaped by these companies but then
this culture is designed by these companies so that you
do what so that you buy and do business with
them and so then your life becomes about doing business
with them and you don't even know that that's what
your life has become about because a lot of this
stuff happens on sort of a subconscious level and people
don't realize it people are playing video games and watching
movies and all this and they think oh it's just
good fun yeah it's just good fun on one level
but on another level it's just them milking you for
money and then what kind of information and what kind
of values are these movies and these video games and
so forth instilling in you are they instilling values that
are actually make you appreciate life more or values are
gonna make you addicted and coming back for more to
buy more from those companies skewing your entire worldview see
it's not just like oh yeah they're selling me a
movie no they're skewing your entire worldview in a very
subtle but also significant way such that you're addicted to
it and that you actually come to it for all
your satisfaction in life but fundamentally it's hollow it's sort
like they're selling you sugar you consume the sugar but
then you're ultimately unsatisfied on the inside and your whole
picture of reality is wrong as well that's the the
sort of the hidden cost that they don't tell you
about the next self-deception mechanism is Authority and credentials this
one is big a lot of people just trust in
authority and they just leave questions about reality up to
the experts they leave it to the academics or the
doctors to the scientists to the gurus as though they
have the answers and they will figure it out for
us and we'll just listen to them and we'll just
take on whatever they tell us this happens both real
with religious people it's a problem because religious people believe
in all sorts of gurus and authorities from the Bible
or from some other group it also happens with science
just as much you think science isn't built upon Authority
and credentials it totally is it's all about what kind
of position the scientist has in the university how many
peer-reviewed research papers does he have how many citations does
he have how many books has he written have those
books been on the New York Times bestseller list has
he got a Nobel Prize has he gotten a PhD
how many PhDs has got published in in certain journals
and if he hasn't then we're not gonna take this
scientist seriously but if he has we're gonna take it
everything he says and we're just basically gonna accept it
unquestioningly that produces huge self-deception there's also a mechanism that
I call a morality bias which is an interesting one
it's people who are very attached there to their moral
judgments and convictions and so whenever for example somebody presents
a truth to them something new that they should learn
or become conscious of what they do is they compare
that truth against their system of morality and they say
well does this truth conflict with my ability to judge
and Mura lies about people and if it does that
means this truth has to be false which is completely
backwards because the way it should go is that you
should consider the truth or the the wisdom being presented
to you on its own merit and then you have
to think about the consequences of that and then you
have to apply it to your existing system of morality
you have to say oh well does that mean that
now maybe I shouldn't judge rapists and I shouldn't judge
Nazis and I shouldn't judge those people because I used
to judge them and I thought they were evil but
now this truth that I'm being presented tells me that
I can't judge them anymore Oh No what do I
do do I stick with my morality or they give
it up and see these people they stick with their
because they think their morality is first and everything else
comes second which is completely backwards and a similar sort
of phenomenon involves this next self-deception mechanism which is called
I call it political ramifications bias same thing you have
a political ideology and then some truth or some wisdom
is granted to you which you have to consider on
its own merit but people don't the way they do
it is first is in rather than send me on
its own merit is that they compare it to their
political ideology and they see is this truth or piece
of information compatible with my political ideology if it is
I'll accept it if it's not then it must be
false because they're using their political ideology as like the
touchstone against which everything else is measured when it has
to really be the opposite first discover the truth discover
the highest wisdom then ask yourself how should that inform
my political ideology and what you'll probably be shocked to
learn is that man it completely erodes my political ideology
and of course most people don't like learning that another
self-deception mechanism is historical meta-narratives we're taught history which gives
us a context for how we think about life as
a whole here's just one example for you is that
generally most rashly scientifically minded people believe the following little
story or myth about human civilization they believe that 10,000
years ago humans basically lived like savages like cavemen before
the advent of Agriculture and before science came along before
rationality came along we just basically live like savages like
barbarians we believe in all sorts of silly superstitions but
then what happened is that technology came onboard we got
agriculture and then we got the rise of Greece and
Rome and then we had the rise of reason but
then quickly that all collapsed because Christianity came to power
and all this religious superstition it sort of squelched reason
for for many centuries and then we went to Middle
Ages in the Dark Ages and their humanity was floundering
and nothing was really happening until the Renaissance when the
Middle Ages ended and we had a resurgence of Reason
and we had the Scientific Revolution and then we had
the European enlightenment and so from that we got all
the way to today and today we have science which
is taking over and it's it's defeating the last remnants
of religion and now science is winning and rationality is
winning and so now finally we're free and we're gonna
advance ourselves to some new promised future this is what
I mean by historical meta-narrative it all sounds good but
is it really true or did you cherry-pick that evidence
from history actually there's a lot of evidence coming out
these days if you study history beyond what they taught
you in middle school and in high school and in
college is that you actually see that this entire story
starts to smell very fishy what if it was actually
the case that before the advent of Agriculture humans actually
lived very consciously they weren't savages and barbarians they were
actually conscious and they weren't just superstitious and mythological they
actually had genuine mystical insights into the nature of reality
and they had they made some very profound and advanced
discoveries just using their direct consciousness yeah they didn't have
a lot of fancy science back then but nevertheless they
were very knowledge about about plant life animal life how
to manipulate stones and do stonework and then they built
some amazing monuments like the the ancient Pyramids of Giza
and the Sphinx and these stone henges and other kinds
of ziggurats and pyramids that are found all over the
world that date back to sometimes five ten thousand years
ago maybe even older I mean that these people actually
lived probably quite high-quality lifestyles compared to what happened late
when agriculture came about because with the advent of Agriculture
we had these cities these cities have started going to
war now there's famine there's plague there's war there's infighting
there's egos now there's governments that are rising that take
over their totalitarian governments and all that still basically persists
to this day and really what we've ended up doing
is we've ended up domesticating ourselves and contrary to what
people think that we're out of the Dark Ages actually
maybe we're still in the dark ages it's just that
these Dark Ages have become technologized you have your smartphone
your internet all this sort of stuff but you basically
live in a cube you live in a little prison
you go to work you punch the clock you come
back home jerk off to some porn and what is
all this you think this is a good life what
if this is just you being an animal in a
zoo you see so these sort of meta narratives are
tricky things they can get you to sort of believe
that all everything is going peachy but really maybe it's
not maybe the world is on the brink of extinction
with nuclear holocaust and all these other problems that we
have who knows I'm not saying one or the other
is necessarily true I'm just saying gotta watch out for
these historical meta-narratives because they can really trick you and
this is just one example there could be many other
kinds of historical metod narratives that you use to sort
of ground your understanding of reality and to justify your
behaviors or to justify society's behaviors another self-deception mechanism is
tribalism you probably know about this one it's big it's
very broad I mean tribalism with that comes racism as
an example that for example nationalism nationalism is an example
of that all sorts of infighting of course part partisanship
and political infighting creating various kinds of factions that fight
against each other these become huge sources of self-deception this
also happens within spiritual communities you get various tribes that
form this sort of us versus them mentality another self-deception
mechanism is groupthink groupthink is when you surrender your mind
to a group of people like in your company or
in your spiritual circle or within a university or something
and then you just let them think for you without
using your own mind because using your own mind is
challenging you gotta burn calories you got to sit there
and contemplate stuff but but then what most people do
is they just they just surrender they outsource that they
let other people think for them but then of course
the problem with groupthink is that the group has its
own agenda so then not only do you have your
own layer of self-deception that's got to watch out for
cuz it's active and running but now you've got the
groupthink and the group's ego is self agenda and it's
also rotting its own separate mechanism self-deception so those synergize
to make a very bad combination you'll get very diluted
there the next mechanism is assuming that everyone has the
same brain chemistry and that everyone has the same basic
access to reality and that reality is the same for
everybody I find this to be a very core assumption
that I see almost everybody making almost every teacher almost
every book almost every school you learn from what do
they do they just basically assume that everyone has the
same brain chemistry but we know that's not the case
we know that we have strong introverts we have strong
extroverts we have left brain people we have right brained
people we even have for example sociopaths and Psychopaths we
have schizophrenic s-- we have people who are autistic and
all of these different people have literally different brain physiology
they think about the world differently they feel the world
differently and then you wonder why people act weird or
why they disagree with your beliefs or why they have
access to different mystical states are different consciousnesses well that's
because they literally do because they have different machinery you
see different capabilities not everyone is able to learn the
same things or think about the same things in the
same ways think about how many different body types exists
across human beings you've got skinny tall people you've got
short and stout people muscular people lean people hairy people
bald people there's a lot of variety within human physical
bodies now imagine that that same kind of variety is
also reflected on the inside and then think about what
that means for how you think about relating to other
human beings you can't relate to them as if they
were identical to you you can't expect them all to
understand the same stuff you understand you can't expect them
all to have the same strengths or the same weaknesses
as you have and now all the sudden you can
open yourself up to the possibility like oh yeah we
need different ideas we need a diversity and techniques we
need to be more open-minded we need to be more
tolerant of other people but see generally most people just
assume that everyone is like me and then they're confused
when they see that hey if everyone's like me then
why is everybody acting so weird so different than me
well maybe it's because they're not like you another self
exception mechanism is a preoccupation with the subsection of other
people watch out for this one sometimes people like to
point out to me my own self deception as if
I don't see my own self deceptions here's the thing
with self-deception the most important person you got to worry
about being self deceived as yourself don't get too preoccupied
about pointing it out to other people it's everyone's job
to take care of their own self-deceptions because you're the
only person who can do it if you are spending
your time and energy pointing out my self-deceptions to me
and then I spend my time and energy pointing out
myself exceptions or your self deceptions to you then you
see what's going on here neither of us is actually
taking responsibility for fixing our own problem we're just pointing
fingers at each other wouldn't it be nicer for the
person who can actually change it to be the one
who was pointing it out to himself such that every
human being on earth took their finger and pointed it
at themselves and then look the prom is fixed because
everyone's gonna fix themselves rather than pointing our fingers at
others because if everybody points your finger at somebody else
guess what collectively nobody is actually changing it's just gonna
be one giant finger pointing contest so don't get too
distracted by other people's self-deceptions and it's tempting because you
see a lot of deluded people out there in the
world I know how that feels it's very tempting but
then actually what you should do is you should use
that to remind yourself of like oh yeah so that
means I'm probably guilty of those very same sins so
let me go inside and look for them myself rather
than wasting my time arguing about other people trying to
convince other people of their deceptions like if you're in
a relationship don't spend so much time convincing your your
lover that they are self deceived look for your own
self deceptions first besides when you point out the sub
deceptions of another to them do they accept it and
change themselves or do they become defensive and actually they
start to confabulate and they start to justify their self
deceptions and they get even more entrenched so it kind
of has the opposite effect the next self-deception mechanism is
talking and knowing versus embodying have you noticed how much
easier it is to talk and to know about wisdom
and personal development and consciousness versus actually embodying it hopefully
you have it's a lot easier to talk it's a
lot easier to think about it intellectually it's a lot
harder to actually do it yourself so watch out for
this trap don't spend so much time talking about with
your friends or on online forums or intellectually knowing it
and collecting all these pieces of information intellectually in your
commonplace book some degree of that is important I'm not
saying you should throw out your commonplace book but make
sure that you're you're really putting your feet to the
fire and you're your number one priority is the embodiment
not the talking and knowing another self-deception mechanism is when
you think that you have the upper hand on the
situation for example when you think that oh I figured
the situation out and now I'm not deluded anymore I've
got the truth I've reached the end of my journey
and just when you think that is precisely usually win
there's an additional layer of self-deception that you have yet
to discover so what I often find is that when
I think I have the upper hand on a situation
actually that's usually when the situation has an upper hand
on me and that can be a very humbling experience
watch out for that trap and the last self deception
mechanism I'll mention is just plain old-fashioned arrogance arrogance is
something that you just have to feel within yourself as
it's happening notice yourself being arrogant in your speeching in
your speak speaking in your your behaviors in your manner
in your attitude in your opinions and in your ideologies
arrogance puts you up on a sort of pedestal from
which it's very easy to fall down the truth tends
to slap you real hard after you get arrogant and
I know how to be into this at all I
know that I'm arrogant in certain ways and I see
that in myself and that's something that I work to
to improve and of course you guys are always there
to hold my feet to the fire calling me out
for being arrogant or or smug or something like that
and all that I know that's in there inside of
me and I felt that like since um really since
I was a teenager I felt this sort of like
intellectual arrogance in me and I know that it's there
and I've definitely whittled it away it used to be
much worse trust me it used to be much worse
and I know there's still a lot more in there
but what I find is that as you're going through
this process of unraveling the self deceptions of your own
mind that you you're you're also noticing your arrogance mourn
you're you're letting it go and you're realizing how much
this arrogance actually holds you back from from enjoying life
so that's it for this list we're done with all
the mechanisms as you can see there are a lot
of these mechanisms a lot of these traps to fall
into this is not merely a discussion about how to
attain enlightenment it's much more nuanced and more complex than
that self-deception exists in many domains of life in fact
in almost every domain of life it exists and I
could shoot a video on every single self-deception mechanism so
that would be like over 60 videos I could shoot
on all just this entire list that I gave you
and that would take me over a year to shoot
all those videos and there would be a lot to
say about every single topic so you might think that
I've covered this topic at nauseam and I've covered everything
in depth but man there's so much more to actually
be said about all this stuff I feel like I've
only skimmed the surface of it here so I hope
you can appreciate just how deep and rich this field
is and it's precisely because the field is so complex
so nuanced and so broad that it's so deceptive if
it was just one or two sub you have to
keep in mind that would be easy the way the
self-deception makes itself so powerful is precisely because it's so
diverse it's so broad and infects everything it's a total
corruption of of of every facet of life and so
of course it takes time it takes work to unravel
these deceptions and it takes nuance just as awarding as
I'm wrapping up here I want to make sure that
I emphasize this one final trap which is that just
because you know about self-deception just because you heard all
these mechanisms don't trick yourself into thinking that now you've
escaped them all yeah knowing about them is important you're
in much better shape than had you not known about
them at all but that doesn't mean you've escaped them
now is not the time to get cocky now is
the time to actually get serious and say okay now
I know them but now I have to actually navigate
every single day of my life and be mindful of
all this stuff and try to avoid it and that's
something I have to keep a constant vigil about and
lastly remember that I'm not immune to any of the
stuff that I talked about so of course just because
I'm aware of some of these mechanisms and I because
I talk about them doesn't mean that I am gonna
escape them all I know that I'm deluded in certain
ways I know that I deceive myself in certain ways
I know that it's a process and I know that
I can't just drop all my self deceptions in one
day doesn't work that way you kind of slowly work
through them you slowly gain emotional leverage over them because
just because you see a mechanism working within you doesn't
mean you can just drop it a lot of times
you're not ready to drop it you might need to
play it out for a year or two to see
all the bad consequences that come from it only then
will you become emotionally convinced that okay now I got
to let it go see so there's hypocrisy here I
know that I'm guilty of many of these sins myself
and so actually shooting these episodes makes me more aware
of it and shows me how much more work that
I got to do and hopefully it does the same
for you all right we're finally done so please click

of interesting resources for you there that will totally change
your life if you start reading those and just stay
tuned actually what will be coming in the future probably
not immediately next week but in the weeks to come
and the months to come I'm gonna shoot some deeper
topics about a couple of self-deception mechanisms from this list
which are extra important I'm gonna talk about self bias
I'm going to talk about self justification and I'm going
to talk about the self deceptions that are found specifically
within science all of these will be really juicy and
profound topics so make sure you stick around for those
