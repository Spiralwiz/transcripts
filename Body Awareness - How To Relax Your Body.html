[Music] when I was in sixth grade I started getting
irritable bowel syndrome terrible stomach cramps diarrhea having to run
to the bathroom and I would get this mostly in
school such that he would start to disrupt my my
school days I'd have to go to the school doctor's
office and oftentimes they couldn't really help me they didn't
know what was wrong with me so they sent me
home or called my mom or something like that and
this was not just a once or twice type of
thing this lasted through all of middle school and all
of high school all the way to the first year
of university so for over six years this lasted and
sometimes it was excruciating it was very painful it was
also embarrassing it was also very inconvenient having to run
to the bathroom and I had no idea what was
going on why this was happening was the food that
I was eating or what I tried various kinds of
of stomach medicines but none of them really seemed to
address the root issue until one day six years later
I was driving to university I remember this very vividly
in my car in the morning I'm driving there and
I had some big tests like I usually do because
I was really into academics getting good grades and I
felt nervous I felt anxious and for the first time
in six years I had an insight and the insight
was could it be that my stomach aches are related
to how I'm thinking about this test could it be
that I'm causing this rather than that is something that's
happening to me and in that moment while I was
driving I just kind of experimented with relaxing my mind
letting go of thoughts about this test and relaxing the
stomach muscles and breathing deep and slow and I just
did this for a few minutes while I was driving
and in those few minutes my cramping and they need
to go to the bathroom it all completely resolved went
away and I never had the problem ever again that's
the power of body awareness and relaxation it's a very
powerful thing that many of us don't really understand it
took a lot of suffering for me to come to
the insight that I was causing this thing because nobody
taught me nobody told me that there could be a
mind-body connection in my mind it seemed like my body
was one thing it was like this physical thing I
didn't really have control over what happens with my body
when I get sick when I don't and my mind
was a separate thing these are two different things until
I had the insight that actually they could be connected
and that's what they call the psychosomatic mind-body connection when
the way that you think causes problems with what your
body does so in this episode we're going to talk
a lot about developing body awareness and how important it
is and how to relax your body so let's start
to demonstrate this because this is one of these subjects
where you can't get too theoretical you need to actually
feel it for yourself for it to work this is
something you need to practice so there's gonna be a
lot of emphasis here on practice so let's do an
exercise this is just going to be about a five
minute exercise so get comfy in your chair sit back
and close your eyes keep them closed until I tell
you to open them so as you're sitting there I
want you to place your awareness on what's going on
inside your body try to sit still and don't move
and don't change the tension in your muscles anywhere in
your body keep it as it is what I want
you to do is I want you to just scan
your body up and down from head to toe and
get a baseline of what's going on there I want
you to especially pay attention to muscle tension don't relax
anything yet just pay attention for muscle tension and I
want you to be particularly aware of the following areas
scan your face the area around your eyes your forehead
your mouth and especially your jaw notice that there's any
tension there also your hands your fingers your palms keep
them still and just put your awareness into them and
feel for tension your arms especially your forearms your feet
your legs especially your calf muscles your abdomen and stomach
area your butt your sphincter and also your back and
your shoulders what do you feel there there's there's no
wrong way to do this just feel into it whatever's
there is whatever's there just notice it notice that there's
probably a significant amount of tension in your body this
tension is there all the time this tension is unconscious
that's your first key lesson here is that tension and
unconsciousness go together and conversely relaxation and consciousness go together
now what I want you to do is I want
you to put your consciousness or your awareness into each
part that had tension and melt that tension away relax
each area and the way that you relax is by
sending a signal to that area to let go let
go of that area you were unconsciously holding on and
just let go let go of your face let go
of your hands your arms your feet your legs your
belly and anywhere else let go of your entire body
and in order to do this you must also let
go of your mind so relax your mind it's actually
impossible to relax your body if you can't relax your
mind and the way to relax your mind is again
just send the signal to let go this signal is
not just something you do once you can keep sending
that signal constantly to some part of your body or
to your mind and the more you send that signal
the more that part will let go and relax deeper
and deeper and deeper so keep doing that right now
keep sending that signal and relaxing deeper and deeper and
just get very comfortable in your own body very at
ease within your own body and just make a mental
note of the difference of the before this exercise in
the after and just to make this really stark and
clear without moving your body tense all the parts of
your body that I mentioned before tense them all put
tension into them but don't do any jerky movements just
tense tense tense tense and just keep it tense keep
it tense and now just let go let everything go
and just pay attention to that difference that contrast good
now open your eyes so what you got there is
you got a little bit of a taste just a
little taste of what this work entails of course different
people have different levels of tension in their body but
the majority of people are very very unconscious of what's
going on inside their body and this presents a big
obstacle for reaching higher levels of consciousness and even just
being satisfied in your own life how are you ever
going to be happy in your life if you can't
be comfortable in your own body I mean you're doing
all this self actualization work this personal development work this
enlightenment work and most of it is going on inside
your head but what about the rest of the body
are you bringing it along for the ride if your
body is filled with tension how is that ever gonna
work how are you ever gonna be satisfied in life
it's not possible you see so what this reveals to
us is that this this body awareness stuff is a
core pillar of you being a fulfilled human being absolutely
essential and the vast majority of Westerners are really really
poor at this see what happens is that stress and
emotions get carried in the body and people don't even
know about this emotions are not just things that happen
inside your mind they're not just feelings that accost you
for random unknown reasons know all of this stuff is
happening for a purpose and it's all carried inside it's
carried in your arms in your legs in your abdomen
in your shoulders in your jaw in your face it's
all being carried there and it's stored there over years
over years and decades it gets stored in there and
locked in there such that you can't even tell what
it's like to really be at ease in your own
body anymore because of all the fear anxiety anger sadness
and resistance that you're carrying around with you and various
kinds of trauma especially if you had various kinds of
physical trauma or serious emotional trauma PTSD type stuff abuse
when you were younger as a child or even as
a young adult this stuff gets locked in and carried
in your body and it can lead to serious disorders
not just mental ones physical ones because there is a
real link between your mind and your body these things
are not as separate as you thought or were taught
in school this body tension sometimes it can be very
heavy but oftentimes it can just be very subtle subtle
it might just take you a few days of experimenting
with feeling to your body just to start to notice
that's subtle body tension that's always there that's robbing you
every single second of a little bit of your energy
but since this is happening at a very low grade
level throughout your entire day in your entire week these
little tiny amounts of energy that's being used to hold
all this tension all these emotions they are draining you
because a lot of us are so disconnected from the
truth and from our emotions what we do is we
lock them up in the body because we actually use
our body as a way to deny and to resist
and to repress emotions and for many people who live
an unhealthy lifestyle and by unhealthy I mean of course
the food you eat and how well you take care
of your body physically but of course also psychologically emotionally
you know what kind of work are you doing what
kind of [ __ ] boss are you working for
you know who are you manipulating with your work who
are you hurting what kind of suffering you're causing in
the world all that stuff you know your mind isn't
blind to that it tends to repress it under the
surface and it gets carried in your body so our
job is to now start to turn that around it's
gonna take some time it's going to take some practice
so two really important key ideas I want you to
understand I'll repeat them again is that unconsciousness equals tension
to have tension in your body you must be unconscious
of that tension and conversely consciousness equals relaxation so when
you're maximally conscious you're going to be relaxed in your
body or if you're gonna apply consciousness to some area
of your body that's gonna relax that area an unconscious
person is uptight anil rigid jerky Stern resistant numb high-strung
maybe you know some of these types of people maybe
you're one of these types of people it's actually very
easy to tell the level of consciousness that a person
has just based on how he moves how rigid he
is all these little subtle cues when you become really
good at exploring your own consciousness and you've done it
for many years you do lots of meditation you do
lots of this body awareness practice you start to become
very sensitive to this and it's very easy then to
pick out why someone has a problem and also it's
very easy to pick out masters who are deeply conscious
those people you can tell these people have mastered their
minds and also their bodies because you can't really master
your mind without mastering your body and this conscious type
of person is you can tell they're loose they're relaxed
they're flowing they're surrendered they're comfortable they're at ease they're
not easily agitated they don't fly off the handle body
awareness is not something that's taught in school in the
West almost at all - almost a shocking dysfunctional neurotic
degree Western culture has really been all about the mind
all about the head and while rejecting and marginalizing the
body but what this does is this creates a schism
between the mind and the body and we see this
in Western culture we have a very unholy sztyc fragmented
understanding of the mind-body connection you see this within academia
you see this within intellectuals you see this within science
many of these academics what they've done is they they've
they've cut their head off from their body so to
speak such that they're only living inside their head but
then they have all these disorders and conditions of the
body and they don't understand that there's a connection there
and they say alia well Leo you're just talking about
the placebo effect just the placebo effect no no it's
not just a placebo effect the placebo effect is a
real serious thing the placebo effect can have a stronger
effect on how you feel or whether you cure a
disease more than a drug which is why they have
to do very careful studies to find high quality drugs
because the drug has to out-compete placebo that's not easy
to do that's how strong your mind is most people
in the West because we're operating under this materialist paradigm
this mechanical view of the world and we have this
old old old ancient Cartesian idea of the mind in
the body the mind-body problem this mind-body duality there's these
two substances the physical stuff and the mental stuff there's
matter and then there's consciousness and that these are two
totally different and we don't even know how they're connected
but they must be connected somehow but well nobody knows
can't figure it out and so they're just two totally
separate distinct things and this is generally the view that
science takes towards this stuff and it's like you have
these rationalist people who say oh well Leo there's the
facts and then there's just emotions and it's like I
don't care about the emotions I care about the facts
this whole idea this is a very neurotic and limited
paradigm which causes a lot of people within Western civilization
to to literally become numb to their own bodies because
they're biased against feelings as though feelings are somehow the
enemy feelings and emotions from how bad or wrong or
they make you weak they make you like a like
a girl or like a woman and you know no
no man is supposed to be emotional no man is
supposed to be in touch with his feelings that's whew
New Age girlie stuff that's generally the attitude that Western
civilization has taken towards feelings and emotions and this is
really a shame really a shame because actually your emotions
and your feelings drive your rationality and your interpretation of
facts far more than the other way around you know
in the in the late 1900s early twentieth century there
was this phenomena happening in Europe called hysteria and this
was a problem that that afflicted women Victorian era women
who of course were so proper and so uptight that
they never had sex and so they had these problems
and they went to these psychologists and psychiatrists and it
was just a budding field psychology and psychology psychiatry at
that time Sigmund Freud and folks like that who would
take care of these women and what do they do
they just masturbated these women in their office that's literally
their their entire practice consisted of this this is mostly
what psychiatrists and psychologists that's how they made their living
is masturbating Victorian uptight women who didn't get sex from
their husbands and going crazy because their body craved for
it all right well we're not that bad today we're
a little bit better today our culture has loosened up
but it's still there the remnants are that are still
there spiral dynamics stage blue and spiral dynamics orange are
very uptight they're very much stuck in their minds blue
tends to be very puritanical and is afraid of getting
in touch with their emotions and their feelings and tends
to be kind of sexually repressive that's that whole Victorian
hysteria thing phenomena and then orange orange tends to be
so intellectual and rationalistic and so into this idea of
facts over feelings that they also repress feelings and emotions
and then as you evolved out of those spiral stages
into stage Green Green is the first one that starts
to realize the significance of the mind-body connection but of
course to stage Orange a lot of times that looks
like whoo New Age stuff Deepak Chopra type stuff that's
just because you haven't really experienced what it's like to
become conscious of your body and to integrate your mind
and your body and how powerful this is how life
transforming this is it really will change your whole life
for some people it will literally save their life that's
how important this topic is one of your goals in
life one of your personal development goals with all this
self-actualization work is recalling it should be to permeate your
mind and also your body with consciousness that's really what
all of this stuff that I'm talking about is about
mostly I talk about the mind because the body is
sort of its own category there's a lot that can
be said about the body and you know also I
have a bias because I'm very intellectual as well so
I of course I I suffer from these problems myself
which is why I'm speaking about them but you want
to permeate your mind and your body with consciousness you
want to become very comfortable in your own body ultimately
as you become really conscious you will start to realize
more and more that actually your body is made out
of consciousness it is made out of mind there is
no boundary whatsoever between mind and body there's no metaphysical
difference between the thoughts and ideas that you're having inside
your mind and the the substance out of which your
hands my hands are made my face is made it's
all exactly the same substance just manifest it in different
ways that doesn't mean it can do the same stuff
but but it is all made out of exactly the
same stuff and you will realize this you will realize
that your body is made of pure spirit as you
go deeper into this work and go up the spiral
stages you will realize this but it'll probably take some
practice to get there so most people are walking around
with very unconscious and unaware bodies very numb to their
bodies and why do we make ourselves numb well it's
because often times in life were faced with tough situations
where we have to survive and we're put under pressure
and of course that makes us fearful makes us have
all sorts of negative emotions that cause us to suffer
and rather than opening ourselves up to the fear into
all these sorts of emotions what we do is we
do the opposite the the exact opposite of what needs
to be done is we we closed our self down
and we try to suppress the pain and the suffering
and the emotions by blocking it off ignoring it sweeping
it under the rug so to speak and so for
your mind to sweep an emotion or a problem or
situation under the rug what it does is it actually
sweeps it into the body into some part into your
forearms into your hands and your shoulders into your stomach
into your feet and it creates these sorts of habits
these tension habits were you just every time you're working
on a difficult project you're tensing your hands every time
you're you know making some sort of important phone call
you're scrunching your feet or your you're scrunching up your
stomach muscles and you just get used to doing this
and so every time you're going to work you're making
these calls or you're you're on the computer you're doing
whatever you're scrunching up and so your body tightens up
and it closes stuff off and that creates problems and
also this happens because we avoid facing tough truths truth
can be difficult to stomach sometimes literally we don't develop
proper conscious ways of dealing with truth and with difficult
situations in life so we end up repressing in their
bodies and a lot of times you know your body
is a very sensitive and complex and very intelligent elegent
instrument intelligence is not just something that's happening in here
intelligence having all through your body your body is constantly
sending you signals the problem is that most people aren't
sensitive enough to those signals because they've made themselves so
numb but your body is sending you signals and a
lot of times your body is sending you deeply intelligent
signals which are telling you that you need to stop
doing something for example you're living a kind of lifestyle
that is damaging to your body and your body's feeling
and trying to send you those signals but because your
ego just wants to keep living this unhealthy lifestyle what
it does it just tells the body to shut up
and just sort of cuts everything off from the bottom
of the neck down and then what this does this
just sweeps it under the rug it just creates a
festering wound for later which will ultimately come back to
bite you what do I mean by a damaging toxic
lifestyle well of course the the food you eat the
the stuff you smoke the stuff you drink the the
kind of career you have how many hours you work
what you do with your body you know physically are
you over stressing yourself overworking yourself over exercising under exercising
putting your body through the wringer physically emotionally you know
what are you doing with your body your body is
sending you all these signals but sometimes we get so
attached to our lifestyle that we're forced to repress for
example someone who's working on Wall Street and you know
he really wants to succeed at Wall Street so he's
just one of these new young guys who just got
out of law school or something and he just got
his university degree and now he's going to work for
Goldman Sachs and they are they're making him work 80
hours a week you know to you know to get
his internship and then to to get his first paid
job so he's working his ass off and you know
he's drinking down coffee and a bunch of diet cokes
five diet cokes a day and maybe doing some drugs
here and there and then going to party late at
night with the with the friends and doing all this
right so this this kind of toxic lifestyle will his
body sending him signals that that that's not gonna fly
you can't keep working 80 hours a week but of
course because he's so ambitious and he needs to you
know he needs to succeed at Wall Street because somehow
he got programmed with that idea in his mind well
um he's gonna keep pushing he's gonna push it to
the limit he's gonna repress and cut off everything that's
going on in the body and then that Lulla come
back to haunt him of course if you had any
kind of emotional trauma or physical trauma in your past
that that's also there it can be a lingering problem
and then that keeps a that keeps coming back up
and that that trauma was never fully dealt with so
there it is locked in to your body a lot
of ailments come from poor body awareness including things like
heart attacks stress muscle twitching twitching in your face swishing
in your in various parts of your body back pain
premature ejaculation shyness lay zena's OCD fatigue anxiety irritable bowel
syndrome cold hands and feet cramping mmm low self-esteem low
energy and mood insomnia this is just a tip of
the iceberg of various kinds of conditions that can that
come from poor body awareness and now of course it's
very important to to qualify this I'm not saying that
all of these are gonna be cured just purely through
body awareness you could have one of these you know
conditions and these conditions usually can have multiple factors so
you know you do need to you know your heart
attack is not just totally dependent on your body awareness
probably your diet and exercise have important factors as well
but but some of these conditions can be completely eliminated
just by increasing body awareness or significantly improved here are
the areas that you want to focus on relaxing as
you're gonna be practicing relaxation which I'm gonna have you
do as a homework assignment you're gonna be focusing on
relaxing your face especially your mouth and your jaw your
hands and your forearms especially your feet and your calves
and your lower legs especially your stomach and your anal
sphincter your neck and your back you're also going to
focus on uncrossing your arms and legs what you'll notice
is that when you become very conscious and you become
very free and relaxed in your body your body tends
to open up and it tends to go symmetrical and
you tend to sit like this with open arms open
legs whereas when you're tense and you're anxious and something's
not right and you're a feeling quiet you start to
scrunch up like this and if you're laying in your
bed and you're sleeping you're kind of scrunched up you're
not open and you're twisted and your legs are sort
of twisted up like this and this creates tension and
that tension is robbing you of energy when you're keeping
that tension in there like that so you're gonna have
to learn to uncross your arms and legs and practice
that you're also going to work on your breathing and
start to breathe deeper into your bell slow down your
breathing as well although breathing breathing is such an important
topic that really deserves its own episode which I will
shoot in the future but but yeah breathing is something
you can you can learn to be much more conscious
of and that's very important if you want to get
to the higher levels of of self-actualization and then of
course remember to relax your mind practice relaxing your mind
because you're not going to succeed at relaxing all these
other parts of your body if your mind is anxious
all the time and the to effect each other so
it's like a two-way street by relaxing your mind you're
going to relax your body and by relaxing your body
that's going to help you to relax your mind also
your breath plays into that so by relaxing your mind
and your body you'll notice your breath will slow down
and deepen or conversely if you slow down and deepen
your breath that will help you to relax your body
on your mind so all of these play into each
other now what are the best times to practice this
if you're going to be practicing this basically throughout your
entire day your entire week but there are specific times
where I want you to pay attention to to this
body tension that you're carrying when you're in your bed
sleeping or getting about to sleep notice what's your sleeping
position like and how tense is your body oftentimes owners
myself tensing up especially with my hands the way I'm
placing my hands near my face or near my head
to prop myself up almost like a pillow and then
this creates tension so relaxed when you notice that in
your bed you you want to relax it and kind
of open your body up and you're gonna practice this
and when you first start practicing this it's gonna feel
uncomfortable is gonna feel weird it's gonna feel weird to
uncross your arms and cross your legs if you're used
to doing that for twenty or thirty years right so
this is a practice you can just keep going with
it also during work it's very important that you become
more conscious of how you tense yourself up during work
I noticed that during work I tend to tense up
a lot especially my hands and feet especially when I'm
working on some kind of challenging problem and I have
some anxiety around that when you're sitting start to notice
how you sit and where you carry tension in your
legs and but when you're sitting so maybe you're sitting
on a couch on a bench at some lunch table
at work start to notice that even during meditation when
you're meditating you might think you're relaxed when you're meditating
maybe you're not double check feel into your body and
especially with meditation make sure that you relax your face
and your jaw super important and that's one that many
meditators just simply miss also during stressful emotional times so
when you're some sort of heated argument with your spouse
or your family member about something and you're getting angry
or upset or annoyed frustrated that's an especially important time
to notice what's going on inside your body of course
that's very challenging because you're getting so distracted by these
external circumstances and the emotions that are coming up and
the arguments but that's when you need to remember to
focus inwards just to feel where am i carrying that
tension that anger is it in my jaw in my
face in my eyes in my arms and that can
be a huge shift for you if you start doing
that also during sex when you're having sex it's really
important to relax a lot of guys struggle with premature
ejaculation problems or difficulty getting it up a lot of
women struggle with having an orgasm because they're so they're
so tense and so nervous stuck in their own head
when they're having sex so with sex it's actually really
interesting to have really good sex you need to relax
you need to be really comfortable and really kind of
organic and natural and get out of your head and
so the way you do that is by using that
letting go technique and also just noticing how your body
feels during sex you know sex is really fascinating because
sex is usually very exciting so again usually when you're
about to have sex all you're sort of attention your
mind goes into your partner and thinking about maybe how
sexy they are her attracted you are whatever and so
you just get into it so quickly and so kind
of like rough and dirty that you actually forget to
actually feel into the best part of sex which is
the feelings and the emotions of it and then it
goes by way too quick and also you don't get
that full satisfaction in the full release and for guys
you come too fast and for girls you don't come
at all you know what sex is actually interesting if
you want to delay your orgasm the best way to
do that is just to relax relax your groin area
relax your stomach area it becomes very difficult to orgasm
if you notice for your body to orgasm what has
to happen is there's a sort of tension a really
strong tension that builds up in your in your hips
and in your stomach and groin area both for men
and for women and then it finally culminates in this
big climax now that that tension is is good I
mean that's what you need to have a climax but
if you're a guy who's trying to last longer for
your girl then you got to learn to relax that
all those muscles and of course for a girl that's
very important as well because for a girl to to
come she needs to be really fully surrendered and fully
relaxed so there's really kind of two tensions that happen
during sex there's there's the the important and good kind
of tension which is necessary for the build-up of the
climax and you free to finally come that so that
that's that's important if you want to come and and
then there's the bad kind of tension which is the
additional tension that you add that you create that's not
necessary which is actually creating resistance and distraction in your
sex so start to become much more mindful of that
go really slowly next time you do it maybe you
can talk to your partner and actually try to do
it together try to have more mindful sex and you'll
see how big of a difference it makes hey I
mean just when you're when you know you're getting up
from work and you go to take a piss when
you're standing there sitting there taking a piss relax relax
your arms relax your legs relax your butt relax your
face when you're eating notice the tension that's there and
relax it away when you're doing public speaking or maybe
you have a presentation that you need to give at
work to your boss or to some team members or
something like that and you're getting ready to get up
on stage and deliver your PowerPoint presentation notice the tension
in your body you probably have a little bit of
anxiety about speaking to a group of people but it's
not just anxiety in your mind of course it's a
lot in your mind but also notice where it is
in your hands and your feet and your stomach and
so forth and relax that away if you're one of
these guys who does pick up and you're chatting up
girls at nightclubs and you want to be more effective
at that you know most guys when they start pick
up what's their biggest problem approach anxiety what is approach
anxiety see pickup has you so oriented on external techniques
and stuff that's going on with the girl how to
trick the girl how to manipulate the girl how to
say something cool to the girl or whatever to get
her to sleep with you but much more importantly is
actually what's going on inside your body when you're in
the nightclub and the loud music is blaring and hot
girls are running around everywhere and you see the one
that you like and you want to go flirt with
her but what are you feeling inside your body see
most pas are completely disconnected from what's going on with
their emotions and in their body so during those moments
that's exactly where you need to put more focus into
your body then relax that away and be at ease
and really if you want to get the hottest girls
to be attracted to you how do you do that
is the girl is she gonna be attracted to a
guy who's uptight and rigid and anal and stuck in
his own mind or she gonna get attracted to the
guy who's loose and chill and free-flowing and just spontaneous
and relaxed I see consciousness is actually a strength of
calm I mean a signal and on a signal of
of confidence Todd isn't confident people when they're truly confidence
not just a macho front that you're putting up but
it's real confidence it actually comes from a sense of
being at ease in the world you feel very secure
you feel very grounded your feet are planted and you
don't have a lot of tension you're not high strung
and women can pick that off women pick that up
there they're really good at reading these sort of subconscious
body signals and cues from guys so that's something to
work on if you're out in the field and it's
also gonna make the your approaches much more enjoyable if
you're standing in line at the grocery store or at
the ATM or you're just waiting you got nothing to
do notice the tension where it's at in your body
and relax it away when you're walking walking to work
walking to school walking wherever taking the trash out notice
the tension relax it away when you're talking when you're
in a conversation with colleagues at work by the water
cooler whatever you're just talking [ __ ] are you
talking to your boss notice the tension that's there and
relax it away so you can find all these and
many more areas in your life that happened on a
habitual regular basis every day every week every month where
you can practice this stuff and you will need to
practice it over and over and over and over and
over and over and over and over and over again
this is stuff that you can't just practice once or
twice like you got to pummel this thing with repeated
practicing day in and day out so your practice is
very simple you just feel into your body you find
attention relax it away that's it it's not rocket science
very simple but you're gonna do this for the next
few months and really for the next few years of
your life you're gonna keep doing this you're gonna remember
this is gonna be in the back of your mind
every night you're going back you're going to sleep you're
gonna relax every time you're taking a piss you're gonna
relax every time you're sitting down to work you're gonna
remember to relax of course you're not gonna be perfect
you're gonna forget probably 90% of the time and that's
okay but that 10% of the time you will remember
and that will be enough to start to give you
a little bit of leverage over the tension that's in
your body and you're just keep doing this and doing
this and doing this and over time it's gonna transform
how your entire body feels but it's gonna take you
some work to build up that momentum just gotta keep
applying that awareness keep relaxing and doing it over again
now a really important distinction that you need to make
here to do this Phillie is you need to distinguish
between thinking about feeling and actually feeling those are two
different things it's one thing to think about feeling your
body like I could tell you right now think about
feeling your hands and you can think about feeling your
hands now that's very different from actually feeling your hands
the feelings that are actually there right so you see
that distinction so what we're doing in this practice is
of course before you can relax the area you need
to be able to actually feel into it and it's
gonna be a little bit tricky because your mind has
an image of sort of like your hands and what
they feel like but your image and your memories of
what your hands feel like are not what your hands
actually feel like right now and also the feelings in
your hands they're always changing for example if you place
your feelings your the place your awareness into the feeling
in your hands and you keep it there the longer
you keep it there those feelings are gonna change they're
not always the same you can sit there for 5-10
minutes feeling your hands and it's gonna change if you
sit there for an hour straight feeling your hands that's
gonna change so that's the difference being feeling and thinking
about feeling that's very important get stuck in your head
now you might ask Leo but how do I feel
maybe there's a certain part of my body where I
just can't feel it at all I feel numb or
it just feels kind of empty or there's a blank
there's nothing there well the reason it feels that way
is simply because you don't have enough practice so there
is no shortcut to feeling because feeling is already direct
feeling is already immediate there's no how-to method for how
to feel you just feel you just do it now
of course when you first start doing it probably because
you haven't done it very much in your life it's
gonna feel like an atrophied muscle you're gonna feel very
very weak and you might not be able to feel
certain parts of your body at all and the way
that's resolved is just by practicing it more placing more
and more awareness and attention into that part of your
body and you know at certain times certain parts of
your bodies you might feel nothing at all like take
your feeling right now and put it in the very
back of your head do you feel something there maybe
you do maybe you don't so whatever is there is
what's there you don't need to make stuff up it's
about just feeling what's actually there so here you're trying
to be truthful and honest you're not trying to make
anything up when you're just feeling just feel what's there
there's no right or wrong way to feel just do
it and keep redoing it now your greatest enemy to
this practice is going to be forgetfulness you're going to
forget to do it very very easily so the solution
to that that I have for you is you need
to get some sort of wristband device like this something
colorful preferably something that doesn't cut off circulation to your
wrist so you can wear it for a long time
you're gonna actually put this on and wear it for
a whole month for this homework assignment stick this on
and wear it every time that you notice it let
it be a reminder it's a visual cue to remind
you that oh yeah let me feel for tension and
let me relax it away and that's it that's gonna
help you a lot without this wristband you're gonna forget
really easily I mean even with the wristband you'll forget
but but the wristband really helps so put that on
and do that for the next 30 days and that
will get the ball rolling of course 30 days is
not gonna be enough to solve this problem it's just
the beginning but after 30 days of doing this you
will start to program your mind and your body you're
gonna start to change the habits in your in your
body and at that point you will just naturally start
to remember doing it even without the wristband now there's
also a lot of other techniques that you can use
to work on this what I've talked about so far
is just a very general baseline developing body awareness technique
I wouldn't even call it a technique all you're doing
is just you're just feeling and you're relaxing so that's
sort of like the foundation of this work but then
there's a lot of other stuff you can do that
I want to just point out for you give you
ideas here so there's hatha yoga which can be very
effective at developing body awareness this is the kind of
western yoga you see it everywhere in gym class is
all around the United States and in Europe and so
forth so these are really popular these days of course
when you're doing hatha yoga it's very important that you
do it very mindfully with the intention of becoming more
aware of your body and relaxing your body because some
people what they do is when they do hatha yoga
they're just like routine monkeys so they just go there
they follow the instructor like a sheep and they just
go through the motions but going through the motions is
not necessarily gonna mean that you're doing it mindfully and
actually developing body awareness so make sure you add that
intention to your hatha yoga practice if you're gonna do
that another really effective technique is Tai Chi Tai Chi
is this ancient Chinese method where you are doing this
sort of like these flowing movements slow flowing movements with
your with your hands you could do with your eyes
closed or your eyes open and the idea there is
that your your your focusing on how your body is
moving of course Tai Chi is a whole art you
can find videos on YouTube and on google for how
to do Tai Chi you can find long sets short
sets five minutes that's ten minute sets this is really
good for starting develop body awareness there's also something called
the body scan meditation technique and you can also find
YouTube videos of this and audio recordings online that you
can download for free and play for yourself and they
can be five minutes 20 minutes 30 minutes an hour
long however you want and what they do is they
just they guide you through scanning through your body so
usually you close your eyes and you scan from the
very top of your skull all the way to the
very bottom of your feet and then back up you
slowly scan every vertical millimeter of your body and as
you do it you become conscious of that part of
your body and then you melt it away and you
relax it so that can be super effective another method
you could try is shamanic breathing which I've talked about
in a separate episode that's a really powerful method for
getting in touch with your emotions and really sort of
activating and energizing your body it could be very exhilarating
all sorts of interesting traumas and latent hidden emotional blockages
can come up through that technique and very powerful technique
so you can try that you could also do deep
tissue massage and there specifically you could go and schedule
a deep tissue massage once or twice a week and
when you're getting it make sure that you're actually not
just chatting with the masseuse or just daydreaming about stuff
or flipping through your phone but that you're like you're
fully feeling into that deep tissue massage and it can
be very painful sometimes but also it's that that mindfulness
when you get that that full mindfulness and you're feeling
into your body that can be very powerful you can
also try hot baths and saunas also there when you're
doing it make sure that you incorporate that mindfulness component
so when you're getting into that sonnet or in that
hot bath take it very very slowly don't daydream but
actually fully feel into how the water feels how the
sauna feels and all that and the effect it has
on your body another powerful method could be using psychedelics
specifically with the intent of developing body awareness so this
is something that probably many people who trip don't really
um try but this can be really powerful especially on
something like mushrooms what you could do is you could
take some mushrooms with the intention to just purely work
during that trip for the next four hours on body
awareness and so like you can actually do Taichi on
mushrooms or you could even try to do a little
bit hatha yoga on mushrooms of course don't hurt yourself
and you probably don't want a very high dose of
mushrooms maybe just 1 or 2 grams 3 grams something
like that such that you still have movement of your
body and you're not just totally out in Fantasyland tripping
on balls on something you know just flat on the
floor but but rather you're actually able to move and
just like get in touch with your body especially with
mushrooms I noticed they make me feel very animalistic very
monkey like in a good way so it's sort of
like you feel like you're a monkey in the jungle
and you get to just like explore your body and
feel it it's as though you're feeling your body for
the first time and you're seeing the miraculousness of your
body and how intelligent it is and how amazing it
is and also you realize how much you abuse it
and how much you take it for granted so that
can be very powerful spiritual experience that can really get
you some deep insights into the power of of body
awareness you can also develop self confidence in your body
so if you feel like your body is sort of
closed off and you're one of these shy meek type
of people that stand in the corner all the time
and you don't really open your body up you don't
take a lot of space up with your body because
you're you you just have bad self-esteem you don't like
how you look whatever you know quirks and issues you've
got self-image problems a lot of those just have to
do because you're not you're not conscious and connected enough
with your body your body is a beautiful organism really
beautiful machine even if you think that you don't like
your looks you have a big nose or you think
you're ugly or whatever and that's that's that's mostly because
you're stuck in sort of the cultural ideas of what
beauty is like to really get in touch with the
beauty of your body you got to take some mushrooms
or some LSD and really look at your body then
you see the full beauty of your body you see
it as this incredible machine no matter what you look
like it's still an incredible machine and it does incredible
things and you start to really appreciate of course for
women a really effective way to develop body awareness might
be dance for men martial arts you can also use
one of those vibrating massager thingies too you could buy
one of those and then you can vibrate various parts
of your body and and as you're doing that vibration
you can you can apply mindfulness to it you can
also buy a massage chair and practice getting those massage
chair massages and also at the same time mindfully doing
it so there's all these different methods so what I
want you to do in addition to wearing the wristband
you're gonna wear there's this wristband of course for the
next month but I also want you to commit over
the next month to trying at least two of these
techniques that doesn't mean you have to do it every
day just try two of these techniques that you've never
tried before so if you've never tried hatha yoga go
do a couple of hatha yoga very mindfully if you've
never done the body scan go download a few body
scan audios and do that a couple times if ever
done Taichi go look up some Tai Chi videos and
do that a couple times if maybe you want to
do the psychedelic body awareness thing try that a few
times or go get a couple of deep tissue massages
mindfully a few times alright so pick your thing and
then schedule it if you need to find a place
that offers massage just go to Yelp comm and search
there for deep tissue massage in your area and they
will give you all sorts of masseuses with high 5-star
ratings that you can then go set up sessions with
you could also find on Yelp local yoga studios even
tai chi classes and what else dance classes martial arts
studios you know saunas hot baths and spas so all
this stuff is available there you just got to do
a little bit of research so that's basically it that's
the whole idea here there's not much to say theory
wise you just got to practice this and it's really
important I hope I've communicated to you the importance of
incorporating some of these body awareness practices into your entire
self-actualization plan it's very important you have at least a
couple of these because otherwise you're gonna you're gonna develop
very lopsided Lee all in your head and not enough
in your body and see the problem is is that
when you don't develop your body that means that you
can never really develop true emotional mastery because your emotions
are in your body for the most part so how
are you gonna develop emotional mastery if you're not conscious
of your body and emotional mastery is one of the
most important things that you can develop for increasing the
quality of your life and reducing your suffering and making
you better a better performer at whatever you do whether
it's sports public speaking relationships business you know all that
stuff is deeply influenced by your inability to be conscious
of your emotions to to be masterful with using your
emotions so it's utterly imperative that you do body awareness
let me warn you against the danger of rituals rituals
like yoga routines and maybe even a Tai Chi ritual
where you just go through mechanically going through mechanical rituals
is not the same thing as developing body awareness the
only thing that builds awareness is awareness so the only
way you'll develop awareness is by doing something with awareness
not by doing it mechanically unconsciously if you do things
unconsciously even if there supposedly powerful spiritual techniques given to
you by gurus and masters who are the most enlightened
but you do them mechanically they are not going to
make you enlightened and they're not going to develop your
consciousness so be careful with that trap especially this is
a trap that religious people fall into they just go
through their religious rituals mechanically and then of course they
don't become more aware of anything they don't really grow
and also I want to I just want to point
out that there are many degrees of relaxation you can
relax your body very very deeply so this little bit
of relaxation that you experienced today at the beginning of
this episode with the closed eyes exercise that was just
a tip of the iceberg when you practice that repeatedly
over and over and over again your body starts to
relax more and more and more and more your entire
body starts to transform that's a process that usually takes
months and years but but it's very powerful and it's
a little bit difficult to explain just how powerful that
can be because most people don't have any experience of
that all you have maybe the most you have is
just an experience of letting go for five seconds but
try sitting there and letting go for a full sixty
minutes or two hours straight just letting go progressively just
letting go and letting go and letting go and you'll
see there's a very big difference between letting go for
five seconds and letting go for two hours right and
so and then that accumulates to the point where then
you you get to a point where your entire body
starts to just become very free and very open and
rather than being heavy and rigid and very material feeling
your body's gonna start to feel like like it's a
spiritual thing it's gonna start to feel like it's consciousness
like you're pure consciousness and then at one point in
your development you will get to the point where you'll
be able to look at your hands and you will
be able to realize and be conscious that your hands
are not made out of any physical material stuff that
your hands just actually are pure consciousness to remain out
of mind stuff they're literally mad at the exact same
stuff that my thoughts are made out of right I
can be conscious that right now and it's a pretty
cool feeling you start to feel like you're just like
getting like in this kind of like spiritual mystical space
all the time and that's because as you do spiritual
practice and you do consciousness work and awareness body awareness
everything starts to kind of like become airy and fluid
where before it was very rigid and dense and you
felt like it's like you're locked in this physical box
into this physical world well that starts to all change
for you the more that you practice this stuff so
get cracking on that all right that's it I'm done
here please click that like button for me don't forget
and then come check out actualize that org I've got
some exclusive resources there for you my blog where I'm
posting lots of exclusive videos lately and I will be
in the weeks and months to come so don't miss
those some of my I think some of my best
insights come from my vlog videos also the the forum
the life purpose course and the book list and speaking
of the book list I have not that many but
I do have one or two books on my book
list but they're really good books that deal with body
awareness there I have a little category for body awareness
and I have some other books in the emotional category
section where sorry in the emotional mastery section where they
talk about the mind-body connection and also how emotions tie
in with the body and all that so um read
up on that this is a deep field and we've
only scratched the surface of it here and and the
last thing that I'll say is that you have to
understand and actualize that org has a certain bias I'm
a very intellectual and cerebral and conceptual kind of guy
so most the topics I talk about they are of
course very intellectual and I sometimes get criticized for that
but it's not like you know I'm ignorant of of
this bias there is this bias and I'm not too
worried about it because actualize that org it's not supposed
to be your only source you are supposed to go
to other sources and I'm not an expert on body
awareness you know that's a very deep field very deep
topic you can spend the next 40 years of your
life mastering that topic and there are other people out
there who can teach that to you much better than
I can so I view my job as just pointing
out that this field exists it's important now go out
there and find the resources you need from other people
that are going to help you whether it's books or
courses or classes or workshops you know it's all out
there you just gotta get off your ass and do
some searching and then you'll find a whole new world
and that will change your life and that's something I
would be focusing more on in the future because you
know what I found with my own development is that
when you begin development most of your development starts to
happen mostly on the intellectual level because you're reading books
and you're trying various techniques as you become more advanced
and more advanced in your practices you start to realize
just how important direct experience is direct discovery personal awareness
and just how little you really get from just having
beliefs and just ideas about all these things that I
talk about so then to get the really powerful results
you start to see that all you got actually like
practice all this stuff and get a first-hand experience with
it not just believe it and so therefore you're moving
out of the conceptual realm and into the actual practical
realm and and at that point you start to realize
how important it is just to spend time feeling into
your body and I'm seeing that more and more of
course I have a lot of work to do on
myself in terms of consciousness of my body because my
greatest strength is my mind and using my mind and
so I tend to of course use my greatest strength
and that's what you see with actualize that org that
doesn't mean that I don't have weaknesses that I need
to work on see and and maybe you're like that
as well maybe you're very intellectual and maybe that's why
you follow me and you like this content you resonate
with it but for you then especially you need to
develop some of these body awareness practices otherwise you are
going to kind of paint yourself into a corner and
at some point you're going to hit a glass ceiling
with this work because the bottleneck will be not your
knowledge of spirituality or anything like that but just simply
your lack of sensitivity and feeling of all the stuff
that's going on in your body especially your emotions and
all the the tensions and the way that you repress
things so take this topic seriously and stick around for
more you
