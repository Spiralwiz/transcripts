            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/3I7qR4NO8Ag' target='_blank'>How To Relieve Stress - Scientifically Proven Stress Relief Techniques</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Self-Created Stress</b>: The video explains that stress is self-created and comes from the self, despite feeling as though it comes from external factors. Highlights that one can take ownership of one's feelings and thoughts and realize that the struggle faced in life is created by self-image and ego. 
</li><li><b>Taking Ownership</b>: Emphasizes that reactions to circumstances, not the circumstances themselves, are the source of feelings. Responsibility for both the good and bad life experiences are self-created. This context doesn't mean that one is guilty or blame-worthy, but acknowledges the choices made so far and the capacity to make changes if needed. 
</li><li><b>Self-Opportunities</b>: Suggests that the recognition of self-created stress can open up opportunities for self-improvements or change in areas that seem problematic. This can lead to the pursuit of goals like peace, personal time, leisure activities, or even starting new projects.
</li><li><b>Good vs. Bad Stress Relief</b>: Introduces the distinction between good and bad ways to relieve stress. Good methods are empowering and enriching, while bad ways are temporary solutions that may rob one's potential and create more stress in the long run. 
</li><li><b>Exercise and Physical Activities</b>: Suggests exercises, physical activities and sports as empowering and enriching ways to relieve stress. Exercise can release brain chemicals and shift focus away from self-consciousness.
</li><li><b>Reframing Struggles</b>: Advices reframing one's struggles as choices rather than external burdens. This shift in perspective can bring significant change in oneÂ’s experience of stress. 
</li><li><b>Changing Habits</b>: Encourages viewers to consider their habitual choices, such as career, relationships, and daily habits, that might contribute to stress, and to make changes if necessary. 
</li><li><b>Inner-outer World Distinction</b>: Reiterates the concept of inner-outer world distinction wherein external circumstances are not what create feelings, but it's one's responses to them. 
</li><li><b>A Challenge to Typical Thinking</b>: Challenges viewers to reconsider the common notion of attributing stress to external sources and separating situations into "good" and "bad". Argues that such distinction only exists in the mind.
</li><li><b>Engaging in physical activity</b>: Engaging in sports leagues, mentoring youth, or even just strolling in nature can alleviate stress. Physical movement releases brain chemicals that naturally reduce stress and anxiety.
</li><li><b>Reading more</b>: Reading educational, high-quality books can help distract the mind from stressors and impart knowledge.
</li><li><b>Meditation and Yoga</b>: At first, these practices may prove hard to form as habitual but their long-term benefits in stress reduction are significant.
</li><li><b>Music and Family time</b>: Listening to soothing music and spending quality time with family can slow down the mind and provide stress relief.
</li><li><b>Cultivating a Creative Hobby</b>: Learning a new instrument, crafting, writing, or working on a personal project is an excellent means of relieving stress and increasing happiness.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Unhealthy coping mechanisms</b>: Habits like gambling, impulsive shopping, smoking, drinking, drug usage, excessive playing video games, and over-usage of the internet or television can cause increased stress. Although they may seem to provide temporary stress relief, these habits often contribute to other stressors such as guilt, laziness, procrastination, and decreased productivity.
</li><li><b>Taking action</b>: To alleviate stress, it is essential to identify its root cause, commit to a stress relieving activity, and recognize and eliminate any negative crutches.
</li><li><b>Subscription to Actualized.org newsletter</b>: This subscription offers exclusive resources including a 19-part video series on overcoming limiting beliefs and opportunities for monthly lifecoach sessions, in addition to weekly development articles. The platform provides support in areas of stress management, career development, life purpose, and self-mastery to individuals aiming for a fulfilling life journey.
