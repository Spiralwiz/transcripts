Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm gonna be talking about concentration versus meditation. This one
key distinction will revolutionize your entire meditation practice and take
your meditation results through the roof. I am not kidding
when I tell you that this one tip that I'm
going to give you here in this episode, this one
practice will revolutionize everything you think you know about meditation,
it's that important. It's extremely important. If you're a meditator,
this is like the heart of becoming effective at meditation.
This is the difference between having a little flimsy meditation
habit that gets you rather mediocre results and having an
industrial strength, meditation practice that takes you all the way
through to the end, to the deepest levels that you
can get with this practice. If you don't have a
meditation practice already, man, I keep saying this over and
over again. But this is the number one most important
self improvement habit is meditation 20 minutes every single day,
if you could install that one habit into your life,
this one most important practice, this will completely change the
rest of your life. But then when you add on
top of it, what I'm showing you here today, we're
talking about ridiculous levels of growth that you would never
expect would be possible from something so simple as this.
So go ahead and put that in place. If you
do have it in place, then great. Let's move on
to the distinction. The distinction here is between concentration meditation,
these two things can sound similar, which is why we
need to be very clear about distinguishing them. Because this
is where we can really get amazing results. concentration means
you select an object, whatever the object is, you could
have a lot of different kinds of objects, and you
focus on it like a laser beam consistently. very smoothly,
you focus on it over and over and over again,
until your concentration period is done. Without letting your mind
wander at all. Until you reach a state of absorption
you become absorbed in the object that you're concentrating upon.
And this builds your concentration muscle or your concentration ability.
Meditation. Meditation can also include concentration practices. But generally, most
meditation especially how it's taught in the West, is not
building your concentration muscles. Most meditation, when we tell you
just kind of sit, relax, quiet your mind or just
let go surrender, maybe you're doing the Do Nothing technique,
this sort of stuff. Maybe you're just kind of like
loosely following your breath. But you're not really concentrating on
it very hardcore. This is all kind of standard different
meditation techniques that you might have been taught. But this
is just the mind letting go. And that's the difference
between concentration meditation and meditation, you basically just let the
mind go and you sort of surrender. And it can
be very relaxing and peaceful. But also your mind can
wander around as you let it go. And as you
surrender, all sorts of weird thoughts can come up. And
generally your mind is going to be all over the
place. Unless you've done decades of this kind of meditation,
and you become really good at it. With concentration, you're
forcing your mind is a discipline, you're disciplining your mind
to focus on one subject. So that's the key difference.
And why is this important now? Well, it's critical, because
really, the best results come when you enter something called
Access concentration. That's where your best meditation results come from.
See, surrendering is nice. The do nothing technique is very
powerful. If you've been doing that I've talked about in
previous episodes, okay, great. But you also need the ability
to stabilize your mind and to focus in on one
thing, because without this, you're basically fucked. You're fucked because
you can't really meditate seriously. You can't self inquire seriously,
and you can't contemplate seriously. And I've talked about all
these different techniques in the past, so you know how
important they are. And it's even worse these days because
today, the age we live in right now is the
worst time in human history for developing concentration skills. Because
we have so many distractions and If we're not taught
concentration abilities, nobody tells us an important ability. Even your
meditation teacher might not have told you that this is
an important ability. Maybe even the person that you're learning
self inquiry from, for enlightenment hasn't told you that concentration
is a critical ability. There. You see, today, people have
terrible concentration because of video games, because of TV shows,
because of movies because of virtual reality, all this stuff,
all the amazing entertainment that we have developed in the
last 50 years is getting better and better every year,
in the sense that he's getting juice here. And juice
here is appealing to your most basic instincts, your animal
instincts. So it's very hard for you to take your
eyes off the TV screen, off your smartphone, and so
forth, right? The media, politics, all the entertainment stuff, all
the gossip, all the celebrity stuff, all the tabloids, this
is killing your concentration abilities, not to mention, of course,
your smartphone and all the text messaging you do and
all that sort of stuff, the emails, all this right,
this is killing your concentration, your concentration is terrible. I'm
willing to bet if you're like me, that it's hard
for you to even focus for one minute on a
single thing. At the quality that I'm talking about here,
so when I'm talking about concentration, I don't just mean
like, oh, yeah, selecting an idea, I just focus on
it for for five minutes, sort of loosey goosey fashion?
No, I mean, like, when we're talking about concentration, that
means you're concentrating on that subject without wavering every single
second, for the duration for let's say, for five minutes,
or 10 minutes or for however long. You see. And
that is an ability, well, you can test yourself on
that and see how will you do, you will be
quickly surprised to learn that you're not very good at
it. And that, in fact, it's very painful for you.
Not only do you suck at it, but you don't
even have a sort of like inner desire to become
good at it. Because you sort of have sold yourself
on this idea of multitasking and your mind wandering around
is that being the good thing. I know this because
this is what happened to me, my concentration skills are
really bad. And one of the reasons that is because
I have a very creative mind, and my mind tends
to wander a lot. So I tend to be intuitive
in the way that I think and I think about
a lot of stuff at the same time. And I
get some amazing insights from that because my mind tends
to interconnect all these dots. But this is killing my
meditation ability. And I didn't realize the importance of this,
because I've been meditating now for three or four years,
I'm trying to lose track of how long. And what
I overlooked is how important the concentration is. For me
to meditate effectively. I've been getting some amazing results from
meditation nevertheless. But I think that if I put in
place a concentration practice from the very beginning, four years
ago, man, my meditation would be 10 times better than
it is right now. So I feel like I wasted
a lot of time. Because I didn't realize this critical
distinction. I only learned about this distinction recently. It's not
that I didn't know that there was the distinction said
I didn't understand the significance of it. And just how
much of a difference it can make your meditation practice.
So lately, what I started to do is I started
to really put the screws to myself, and force myself
to develop the concentration. And I've been seeing that just
within the last month of doing so it hasn't even
been a month yet. My meditation has been going through
the roof, my self inquiry has really been becoming much
more powerful and strong. And I can only see this
getting better and better because my concentration abilities are still
quite weak. But here's a technique for how to develop
them very quickly. So how do you develop concentration? It's
so simple. That is very, maddeningly difficult. That's the trouble
with this. It's so simple, that your mind is going
to want to do everything but simply follow the technique.
Here's the technique, you sit down with a digital timer,
make sure you have a digital timer with an alarm.
Let's say you set it for five minutes to start,
then you select an easy and clear object that you're
going to concentrate upon. This object can be almost anything.
In a minute, I'm going to give you a list
of various ideas for what your concentration objects could be.
But let's say for this example, it's just going to
be the the pressure between your thumb and your index
finger. So you hold these two together and you feel
like there's a sensation there a certain pressure, you don't
need to press real hard, just lightly and you just
focus on that pressure and you sit there and you
focus on it on that sensation alone. Excluding all other
sensations, all thoughts, all mental imagery. And you just focus
on that. And you get very clear about what your
one object of content Question. So in this case, it's
that sensation. So you kind of specify that sensation to
yourself, you get a good real, a real good feel
for it. And then you tell yourself, okay, that's what
I'm focusing on for the next, let's say, five minutes.
And then you sit there and you feel it. And
you force your mind to focus just on that. And
you do not allow it to waver, you leave no
wiggle room. This is not a practice where you get
to slack off. Here, you're disciplining yourself very harshly. That's
why you want to start with a very short period
of time, like five minutes, because for five minutes, you
can stand it, right, so you just force yourself for
five minutes. And as your mind, white wavers off, you
bring it right back, and you force yourself even harder.
You just keep forcing yourself and forcing yourself and forcing
yourself until your five minutes are done. With the objective
of hitting access concentration. What is access concentration? How do
you know that you've gotten there? Well, basically, if you
focus on a sensation, or some object for a very
consistent, steady period of time, at some point, you will
hit access concentration, which means that you will go into
this flow state and you'll feel it, you'll feel like
something has shifted your attention or your focus has shifted
in some way, where now all of a sudden, it
became a lot easier to focus on that object. And
to exclude all the distractions is sort of like all
the distractions just kind of melt away in the background.
And you're just rather effortlessly focusing on this target that
you selected, you still need to maintain an effort. So
it's not completely effortless. But it's a lot easier than
it was before. And it might take you a while
to build up to that. That depends on how good
your current concentration skills are. And many other factors, right.
So you want to start slowly and build yourself up,
you want to start with a short duration, like two
minutes, or five minutes, and then build up from two
minutes to five minutes, to 10 minutes to 20 minutes
to 30 minutes, and so forth. And the more you
can get there, the better. And you want to make
sure that you're staying very consistent, and don't increase your
time, unless you're seeing that you're able to stay consistent.
So for example, if you can't stay consistent with two
minutes of your target, and your mind is wavering off
a couple times here and there, then don't bump that
up to five minutes yet, become good at two minutes,
then bump it up to five minutes, become good and
consistent at five minutes, then bumped that up higher. You
see, because when you're practicing concentration, the most important thing
is that you're not letting your mind have any wiggle
room. Because as soon as your mind wiggles off the
target, you're losing that momentum that you're building, and you're
never going to hit access concentration. You see, and this
is something that I've been struggling with in my meditation
practice, I noticed that in retrospect, is that because I
wasn't hitting access concentration, meditation was just kind of like
floundering, you know, just kind of like going back and
forth. And it's not really going anywhere. So that's the
idea. What you also want to do in order to
help you to attain access concentration, is to smoothen out
the object that you're contemplating. And what I mean by
that, for example, if you're following your breath, that's another
potential target for your concentration. If you're following your breathing,
like in, out, in, out in, right. There's a lot
of different sensations involved with your breathing. So you want
to smoothen them out and create a singular object out
of the entire breath. And just stay with that single
object of the breath. You're gonna sort of conceptualize the
different sensations and lump them all together into this new
conceptual creation called your breath, and you're gonna focus, you're
gonna get absorbed with your breath, or you're gonna get
absorbed with a sensation of your fingertips or you're gonna
absorb, get absorbed with whatever target you're, you're after. You
see, so if your target is a little bit more
complex of a target, then you're gonna want to smoothen
it out. And then you just kind of like, let
yourself get absorbed into it. How long will it take
you to get access concentration, like I said, that's difficult
to say depends on your skill. Some people are more
skilled than others. Some people are already pretty good. Others
are basically at zero or even at negative, right. So
it depends where you start. But um, might take you
a few weeks, might take you a few months. That's
assuming you're doing a daily practice and you're being very
rigorous with this. With this, starting at two minutes, bumping
yourself to five minutes to 10 minutes to 30 minutes.
You know, it might take you 30 minutes of practice
to get there. Maybe it'll take you five minutes of
practice. But you know for a whole All month to
get there. So you're just gonna have to wait and
see practices daily, every single day, and maybe even multiple
times a day, because your practice is going to be
so short when you start that you can have multiple,
like you can do two minutes in the morning, two
minutes at lunchtime two minutes before bedtime. That would be
the ideal. For example, if you really want to develop
your concentration very quickly, something like that. Be very careful.
And don't just say, well, I want to develop my
concentration really quickly. So what I'm gonna do how to
do a half an hour of concentration, right from the
beginning, that's not going to work. Because you can't will
yourself to just focus steadily for 30 minutes straight, it's
just you're not going to do it, you need to
build up to it in the same way that if
you go to the gym for the first time, you
can just go and try to benchpress 500 pounds, it's
not physically possible, it doesn't matter how much willpower you
have, you're not going to be able to do it.
Your mind is very powerful like that, just like your
body is very stubborn. And you know, if it's weak,
it's weak. You can't just fix it in one day,
your mind if your mind is we can't fix Saturday,
either. The habits of your mind are very powerful, and
they take time to shift. So the more practice you
can get in the better. The higher the quality of
your practice, the better. Really when you're blurting concentration, stress
the quality of your practice over the quantity. That's why
the short durations, it might seem like well, Leo, I
can already meditate for 30 minutes. So let me just
try my concentration, let me just start it from 30
minutes. That would be a mistake. Because you're under estimating
the difference between concentration and meditation abilities. Even if you're
a pretty decent meditator, your concentration probably still sucks. So
start slow, start low. And, and then just notice what
your mind does and how it feels. At the end
of that period. What I noticed is that at the
end of my 20 Min. Right now I'm doing 20
minutes, at the end of my 20 minute period, my
mind really quiets down, because when you're concentrating the monkey
mind is not allowed to do its thing. And what
I noticed is, I'm sort of like in the center
of the hurricane, after 20 minutes of concentrating, it's just
like the world becomes very still, my mind becomes very
still. And I can see that already. I'm in a
meditative state just from doing 20 minutes of concentration practice.
And then sometimes I do 20 minutes back to back.
So I'll do 20 minutes, followed by another 20 minutes
was 40 minutes total, but I break them up into
two segments. And then by the end of that, I
can really meditate quite nicely. So that's the power of
the concentration. What the concentration does, is that it has
some sort of like, amazing synergistic effect for your meditation.
If you do even just five minutes of concentration practice,
right before your regular meditation practice, let's say you do
30 minutes a day, you'll notice that your meditation practice
can become twice better, just from those five minutes of
concentrating. Because otherwise, what you're doing in meditation is you're
just most your meditation is wasted on monkey mind, your
monkey mind is just kind of jumping back and forth
and back and forth. If you put the screws to
the monkey mind for five minutes, really discipline it, and
then let go and then you can surrender, you'll notice
that the monkey mind it still wanders around, but it
generally behaves a lot better. You gotta slap it around
a little bit, and then it'll behave. That's how your
mind tends to work. Now, this whole process is quite
painful when you first start, which is why I resisted
it for a long time. Because when you first start
that first week or two of concentrating, it's going to
be very painful, because you can't even concentrate for one
minute. So you're not even going to be able to
successfully complete your two minute concentration exercise because you're gonna
screw it up halfway through, the only thing you can
do is just push through it. Yes, you're gonna make
mistakes, just push through it, do the best you can.
And just be very rigorous and disciplined with yourself here.
And just try to tough it out for those five
minutes or whatever. however long you're doing this for. Now,
let's talk about the different objects or targets that you
could select for your concentration. So already, we already talked
about a couple we talked about mudras which is basically
this different gestures or configurations of your hand that you
can make. So these come from classical Hinduism, and the
eastern meditative and concentrated traditions. They have mudras mood because
we're basically different hand positions. So a very basic one
is just your thumb and your index finger like this,
or your middle finger and your thumb like this. There's
other various exotic configurations. So just pick something simple. And
then what you do is you just focus on that
sensation. And you concentrate on that. And that's your target
the whole way through. We already talked about the breath.
Now with the breath, there's really two different ways you
can do the breath. One is the tip of your
nose, it's just the air coming in and out your
nose, especially your nostrils. And that's the only part of
the breath that you're focusing on. So you're very laser
targeting that area. And there's still multiple sensations that are
happening there. And there's like an in breath, there's an
out breath, there's a period of silence there, a pause
at the beginning, and at the end of those inhales
and exhales. So what you do is you, you smooth
and all those out into a single sort of conceptual,
breathing object, and you focus on that. The other possibility
is that you follow your entire breath. So not just
the nostrils, the nose, but also the throat, and the
chest, the lungs, and even the belly, all of that,
if you pay attention to it, then you notice there's
a lot of different sensations going on there, it's hard
to even focus on all of them at the same
time. So what you want to do is you want
to smoothen them out into a single object, this is
going to be a conceptual creation, that you make this
sort of object, all the different sensations throughout your lungs
and your entire breathing apparatus. And then you're just gonna
focus on that, as it breathes in and out, including
the pauses to the pauses will be included in this
conceptual object, that's gonna be your entire target. Another possibility,
if you're more of a visual person is to pick
a physical object to actually look at. This could be
a candle flame, could be a apple, an orange, a
pencil, something simple a simple object, and you just keep
your eyes open, and you just focus on that object
for your entire duration. The trick with that is that
your eyes can get dry, sometimes your eyes are sleepy,
you'll want to close them. But you can't do that
with this particular target. So there's some limitations to this
one. I know for me, my, my eyes get dry
a lot, especially if I'm doing this in the morning
or at night. So I don't like that 1/3 Possibility
is a mental image, which allows you to close your
eyes. A mental image can be any physical object, a
simple physical object that you can imagine in your mind's
eye. For example, close your eyes and imagine an orange.
And then that orange, I don't mean the color orange,
I mean, the orange orange of fruit, imagine that or
an apple or something. And then just keep that image
in your mind's eye for the duration, and that's your
target. Another possibility is to select a color. This is
pretty cool, I have experience with this one in the
past. Take a color like red, blue, or white. Close
your eyes. Picture that color in your mind's eye. Like
for example, let's select color white. So I'm picturing White,
I'm focusing on it. And then I remove all of
the distractions, and that's my target the color white. So
you can try that one. If you're sort of an
imaginative person and you're visually oriented, you have a vivid
imagination, you can do that. Another possibility is mantras, which
is a sound that you repeat to yourself, which has
no verbal or linguistic meaning. So a mantra might be
something like dum de dum, dum de dum, dum dee
dum, it's just like, some random words or syllables. And
then you say to yourself, not verbally, but in your
inner voice. Don't be Don't, don't be Don't, don't be
Don't, don't be I mean, you just say that over
and over and over and over again, you focus on
that mantra in your mind. And you say, 1000s of
times, and you just concentrate on that. So that's a
possibility. And the last one is the repeating sound. So
for example, if you're sitting there, have you ever meditated,
and maybe you had a buzzing air conditioning unit, and
then you could actually discover that you could meditate on
that buzzing sound of the air conditioning unit. But then
the problem is that the air conditioning unit turns off,
right, it turns off the sound ends. And then what
do you do, you lose your target of concentration. But
what you can do is you can create a deliberate
repeating sound, which is what I'm going to demonstrate to
you in a second here. So the point that I'm
trying to make with giving you this list of different
concentration objects, is that I want you to select whichever
one you're comfortable with whichever one you're most interested in,
whichever one If you want to really focus your concentration
on what I found, if I select a bad target
to concentrate on, then my mind doesn't really want to
stick to it. And then I wander off really quickly.
So it took me a while to find one that
I really like. And that's what I'm going to share
with you here. So this I think, works beautifully. What
I have is I have my phone, and on this
phone, I downloaded a metronome app. A metronome just keeps
a rhythm, like tick tock tick, tock, tick, tock, tick
tock, that's what a metronome is, right. It's used by
Muse by musicians for creating rhythms and beats. So I
got this app on my phone. It's a metronome app
free app, you can find a bunch of free metronome
apps for whatever phone you have. So it doesn't really
matter what the particular app is. And it allows you
to select a beats per minute. And then once you
select it and you click the play button, you hear
that? So it's like a tick tock, tick tock, if
you couldn't hear, it's just like, tick tock, tick, tock,
tick tock. And then what I do is I sit
there on my couch in a relaxed position, I close
my eyes, and I just listen to it. Go Tick,
tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, and I follow
every tick, and every talk with my mind very carefully.
And I watch when my mind wanders off. And as
soon as it does it, bring it right back, and
I discipline it. And for me, this, this right here
has worked really, really well. So if you want to
try that one out, feel free to do that. Or
if you want to focus on your breath, or mudra
or something else, then go with that. The key though
is that you select something, then you stick with it.
So that in the middle of your concentration practice, you're
like, Oh, why wish I chose something else. Because that's
gonna screw you up to completely, right, make sure you
select one thing you can expect with a different variety
of things. But then you select one of those, and
you stick to it and you commit to it. And
that's going to be the one that you use for
a good long while to come. All right. So that's
how you build concentration. Now let me answer a few
questions and answers before I wrap this up. So the
first question might be BillyOh, how can I focus and
discipline my mind? If I don't have free will? You've
said in the past that we don't have free will
free will is an illusion. So in this case, now
you're contradicting yourself, because you're asking me to now exercise
my free will in order to focus. This is a
question that is born out of a misunderstanding of what
is meant by no free will. No Free will means
that there is no doer in life who is doing
everything. But stuff still gets done. Including focusing and concentrating
and making decisions. So no free will does not mean
that you can't make decisions, you can make decisions, it's
just that you don't have free will to make your
decisions. But the decisions still get made. It just means
that the illusion that you are making the decisions that
that's an illusion. See, same thing with concentrating. Just because
there's no free will doesn't mean you can't concentrate, you
can concentrate, it's just not you who's concentrating the universe
or your body or your mind is concentrating for you
in a sense. Or if it fails to concentrate, then
it's failing to concentrate, you see. So this idea of
no free will does not preclude anything, all actions. If
you want think about this way, all actions that did
happen in the past, still do happen in the future.
Under the idea of no free will, is just that
you realize that it wasn't me. I wasn't personally doing
all this stuff. The stuff still gets done. A lot
of very complicated intelligent things. get done. Even self discipline
gets done. So when I say there's no free will
that does not excuse you from self discipline. Is the
DAS for a lot of people get this idea wrong
is they think well, if there's no free will, that
means that hey, you know, when I choose to just
slack off and not go to work tomorrow. Hey, that's
just you know, that's because I don't have free will.
No. If you did go to work. That doesn't prove
freewill. You went to work without freewill. See, so make
sure you're very nuanced about your understanding of what no
free will is because your mind will easily abuse this
notion to backwards rationalize, whatever kind of lazy behavior it
wants to. Speaking of lazy the next question might be
but Leo, this sounds so trihard I mean, isn't the
point of spirituality to just surrender? That's what meditation is
about. and it's just surrendering. We don't need to discipline
ourselves here, you're really forcing your mind is full of
sounds like a very neurotic sort of technique. Again, this
is a misunderstanding of spirituality, spirituality, some of the most
disciplined and most rigorous practices that you can find anywhere.
It's not about just surrendering. Yeah, you'll surrender in the
very, very, very, very end. But to get to that
ultimate point of surrender, you will have to try very
hard. This idea that spirituality means that you don't have
any desires, it has spirituality means that you don't try.
And you don't work hard, towards enlightenment, or towards certain
meditative states, or certain attainments. This is ridiculous. This is
the stupidest idea ever. Every single hardcore spiritual teacher and
master will definitely tell you that working hard and having
desire towards enlightenment and towards spirituality is very important. Very
important, doesn't matter what tradition. If you're a Buddhist, if
you're a Christian, if you're a Jew, if you're Islamic,
it doesn't matter. All these traditions have very hardcore practices,
and they all emphasize the importance of your love for
truth. What do you think that is? That's a deep
desire for truth. Your desire for truth should be so
deep. Your desire for God should be so deep, that
you are willing to discipline your mind, and also your
body, and also your desires and many other things. But
when they talk about desires, they're they're talking about shallow
materialistic desires, and then see people many, many people misunderstand
and think oh desires, that means all desires bad, including
the desire for enlightenment. No, without the desire for enlightenment,
you're gonna get nowhere. What does the average person have
no desire for enlightenment. So if you remove your desire
for enlightenment before you're lightened you're gonna be just like
the average person. So be careful with that. Again, it's
your mind misusing, misinterpreting some of these these spiritual truths
and actually justifying its own laziness. And people who just
tell you, hey, just be in The Now these sort
of people generally aren't very aligned. They're not set many
for Eckhart Tolle. But then for every one Eckhart Tolle,
you have a million, who say what Eckhart Tolle says,
but who aren't actually enlightened, you see? So yeah, he
can say that, because he already is. But if you're
not yet you got to try. You got to work
real hard at it. Another objection or question might be,
but Leo, enlightenment is not a state. So it sounds
like what you're doing here is you're advocating that people
attain mystical experiences or states of concentration. And that they
will confuse this with genuine insight or enlightenment. So again,
we got to be nuanced here and careful. I'm not
saying that you will concentrate your way to a state
that will then equal enlightenment. I mean, it could happen.
But most likely, with concentration, the more you concentrate, the
better you get at that, you'll get into absorb absorption
states, you'll have Samadhi experiences, these can be beautiful, mystical
experiences. They're very rewarding and powerful. And they can, they
can create some real spiritual growth, but generally, they're not
going to enlighten you. There is a difference between concentration
and insight. Which is why a lot of people can
say that they've had experiences of mystical union or oneness,
or God or whatever you want to call it. Ultimate
Truth. They've had little glimpses of it, right? You have
a glimpse of it for five seconds, and it's gone.
And then you come back and you start crying about
oh, how do I get it back? Well, that's because
you, you are concentrating and you got somewhere you have
some sort of nice experience. But that's not ultimate liberation.
ultimate liberation can only happen through knowledge or insight. But
don't underestimate how powerful concentration can be for gaining insight.
So that's the connection here. You're developing your concentration to
build the capacity to focus with that capacity, then you
can do really effective self inquiry, or really effective meditation
or really effective contemplation. And any one of those can
lead you to deep insights about the ultimate nature of
reality. absolute truths about yourself others, the world and life
and all of existence and from that you can attain
enlightenment. And also other various more minor insights, which are
still incredibly valuable for your growth and development. So I'm
not saying that the concentration alone is sufficient, you will
still want to maintain self inquiry practice, you will still
want to contemplate once in a while upon things or
a lot upon things, et Cie. So don't take this
as concentration is now the only tool in your toolbox.
This is just one tool out of many other tools.
So keep things in perspective here. If you go and
you only do concentration practices and nothing else, you will
very likely curb your own growth. And you will not
attain the highest deepest insights into ultimate truth. So be
careful. With every tool, there are traps. There is no
tool without traps. Because the ego always finds a way
to misuse this knowledge. Because that's the egos, modus operandi
is trying to protect itself, it will do that through
any means possible, especially by CO opting spiritual techniques and
spiritual ideas and principles to its own purposes, distorting them,
twisting them around, and then using them to get deeper
stuck in itself. So be careful. The last question I'll
answer is, solely, does this mean that I should now
replace my meditation practice with a concentration practice? And the
answer, of course, should be no. Maintain your meditation practice,
if you already have one. If you don't have one,
start one. Even if it's only for 10 minutes, start
one, but also add into your daily routine concentration practice,
if only just five minutes of concentration, you definitely have
five minutes every day. So it's not a matter of
being short on time, it's a matter of, do you
really care about it? Do you see the long term
potential that it's going to have for transforming your life.
And if you do, you'll find a way to make
it happen. It's really not that difficult. I just want
to reiterate how significant this can be for transforming your
life, you might think five minutes or five minutes a
day, I'll just skip five minutes here, I'll skip five
minutes there, I'm tired, I don't want to do it
today. All Tomorrow's a holiday, I won't do it tomorrow.
You know, this sort of stuff, the sort of slacking
off. This is not the attitude of someone who is
serious about developing themselves or someone who is serious about
attaining ultimate truth or enlightenment. If you care about those
things, you will discipline yourself to make these small little
changes in your life. And then to build on them
periodically, every single month. ramp them up a little bit.
Challenge yourself. Discipline yourself a little bit more discipline is
important here. If you slack off, what's gonna happen is
you're just gonna go with the flow of your environment
and your culture. And I'm willing to bet that your
environment and your culture is not going to support you
in automatically developing yourself growing and spiritually purifying yourself, that's
not going to happen. Not in our current time. This
is a must do technique for sages. For people who
are seeking enlightenment. For serious meditators. And you're serious about
self actualizing, you must develop concentration ability. You must, it
will make such a huge difference for you commit for
the next month to practice this every single day, maybe
even twice a day, build yourself up from five minutes,
or maybe even just two minutes, from two minutes to
five minutes to 10 minutes to 20 minutes so that
by the end of the month, you're at 20 minutes
in addition to your meditation practice, and then just see
the synergistic effects that you'll experience. It'll be amazing. And
then you can build more and more on that to
come. And I'll have more episodes in the future that
will talk about various absorption states that you can reach
through deeper and deeper concentration ability. But for now, this
is it. I'm signing off, please click the like button
for me. Post your comments down below. Share this episode
with a friend and lastly come check out my website
right here at actualize that org. This is where I
have some good resources for you. I have a book
list. I have a life purpose course. I'm working on
a new course. I have the actualized. Org forum where
people can come and help you with your questions. So
if you have questions about it, if you feel lonely
on this journey, go there and find some community support.
Make use of that resource. We're also developing resources and
guides It's, so there's my guide to practical guide to
enlightenment is there. Other people have great posts there, they
share resources, videos, books, and so forth. So go check
that out. And the last thing that I'll tell you
is just stay tuned with me for more future episodes.
Because this work that we're doing here is the most
meaningful work that you can do in your life. This
gets at the heart of what it means to be
a human being. It might seem like I talk about
disparate topics, I'll talk about some enlightenment topics, and I'll
talk about some concentration topic, some meditation topics, some talk
about the topic about emotions, you know, I'll talk about
these various topics. And at first, it might seem like,
well, this is very scattershot, I'm not sure what I
should be doing, or why he's talking about all this
stuff in all these different ways. How does it all
come together? What does it all mean? What it means
is, these are the building blocks of self actualization. And
these are the building blocks of mastering life and being
a human being. You see, you were born into this
world, in a society that never really told you how
to be a human being, how your emotions work, how
motivation works, how life purpose works, how truth works, how
paradigms work, how your mind works, right? Nobody taught you
this stuff, by and large. Mostly, what they taught you
is they taught you ideas and beliefs about how to
function in the world. On a sort of, like utilitarian
level, like they taught you how to do math, they
taught you how to maybe earn a little bit of
money, or they taught you how to, you know, be
polite, when you're going to a dinner party, they taught
you that sort of stuff. They taught you how to
be a member of society, but they didn't talk teach
you what it is like to be a human being,
what that really means the deep principles of it. And
to learn that you have to listen to the theory,
which is what actualized org offers us a lot of
theory, but also you have to start doing these practices.
The only point of the theory is to get you
to change your behaviors, and to install some of these
habits. So if you're not doing that, then you might
as well stop watching the videos. It's time to install
some of these basic habits. Once you do, you're gonna
feel a lot better about yourself. Believe me, I know
how painful it is to sit there and watch video
after video, read book after book. And then what happens
months go by you take no action on anything you've
learned. And then that just that weighs you down. That
makes you feel guilty and bad or man, it's not
a good feeling. So just bite the bullet. Install a
couple of these simple habits that I keep talking about
over and over again in my videos. And you'll start
to see the results. And then your life is going
to start to transform and you'll start to feel great,
and you're going to build the snowball effect. So get
started on that build your concentration practice. And I'll see
you next week with more
