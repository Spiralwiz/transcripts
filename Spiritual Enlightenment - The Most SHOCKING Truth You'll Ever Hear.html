hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I want to talk about the most advanced the
most profound the most important and the most challenging concept
that I've discovered in all of my personal development research
and that is spiritual enlightenment warning this video will cause
you emotional distress including anger depression and confusion there is
a profound truth that virtually no human beings on the
planet understand and this includes you and this includes humanity
at large and society at large and science at large
this truth is so rarely known that just to give
you an idea out of the seven billion people that
live on earth on this planet and we don't know
for certain but we can estimate perhaps ten thousand of
these seven billion understand this truth and the rest do
not they're clueless to it completely clueless to it and
what's worse of all is that this truth is fundamental
to your happiness and emotional well-being in life so this
is not some abstract philosophical truth but this is a
very practical very important the most important and the most
profound truth that you can understand as a human being
the problem though is that this truth is also extremely
nuanced and delicate and to understand this truth takes something
really extraordinary of yourself it takes extraordinary open-mindedness extraordinary self
honesty and extraordinary commitment to the path to discover this
truth because this truth is not discovered through a simple
video or reading a book it takes a lot more
than that but in this video what I'm going to
do is I'm going to put you on track towards
this truth this idiot will not give you this truth
this video will tell you about the truth and tell
you how you can undertake a journey to discover this
truth for yourself if you should choose to do it
I want to start off by giving you a sense
of what I mean by the need for open-mindedness in
this investigation and what also I mean by nuanced truths
because as we go through society as we're raised and
we go to through school and go to College and
we're off in the business world all these different places
they don't really teach us to deal with new Oz
with nuanced truths very well and even if you are
an intellectually rigorous person you went to a university and
you did a research there still that's not going to
be sufficient to do this investigation so what we're going
to show you here I want to show you a
an experiment right now that's going to help to open
your mind to the possibility that there could be something
that's true right before your eyes right under your nose
but yet you're not seeing it so this truth we're
talking about it's not going to be some hidden dragon
or mystical unicorn or some deity out there somewhere that
you're never going to get to see it's right before
your eyes you can see it right now except you're
not aware of it because you haven't developed your psyche
far enough along so that you can see it now
it's not immediately clear that this is even possible that
something could be so obviously there but then you're not
able to register it so to give you a taste
of that I want to show you an optical illusion
to start to open up your mind so in a
second here this screen is going to change and what
I want you to do is when the screen changes
you're going to press the pause button and then you're
going to look at this optical illusion now here's the
instructions for what you're going to do you're going to
put your face up towards the screen not too close
maybe a foot or two away from the screen and
you're going to focus your eyes hold your head steady
focus your eyes on the little dot right at the
center of the screen there's going to be a little
dot I'm going to focus on it you're going to
keep looking at it and just look at it and
look at it and look at it hold your head
straight and see what happens what's going to happen is
an interesting phenomenon with your visual awareness I'm not going
to spoil the surprise so go ahead and do that
right now then we'll talk about it when you come
back this is not what spiritual alignment is but it's
a little bit of like an analogy of what it
might feel like to experience spiritual enlightenment in the sense
that there could be something right there that appears one
way to you under certain circumstances in a totally different
way under slightly different circumstances in fact though the facts
of the situation haven't really changed and that's what this
truth is it's a truth that's kind of hidden out
in the open it's hidden in the open so much
that when you find out and discover the truth for
yourself is going to shock you just how obvious it
was the whole time and how obvious it should be
to everybody else and yet nobody knows about it I
want you to consider as a possibility that a truth
can exist that cannot be communicated can you open your
mind to this possibility this is very important for you
to be able to understand what are we talking about
in this video that a truth can exist that cannot
be communicated now think about that why would that be
the case if that could be possible how could that
be the case well our communication is a system after
all and this system has to function in certain ways
so could it be that this system functions in certain
ways that produce blind spots so that as we're communicating
and by the way communication also involves thinking right so
sometimes people think that thinking is separate from communication but
actually these two things are very closely related because in
your own mind you communicate with yourself all the time
and the way in which you think is basically a
form of self communication so we're including communication of thinking
together here so now imagine that this communication plus your
thinking in just the way that it's built and designed
can produce blind spots and if you're not aware that
these blind spots can exist within the way that you
communicate within language and within the system of thinking even
logic itself then you might not see things that are
right there and really really obvious could that be possible
just in theory can you allow that to be a
possibility also consider additionally what if your psyche your very
psyche and how you rationalize and think about the world
what if this system also was designed in such a
way that just to get it running up and running
it had to be based on certain assumptions and certain
mechanisms and that these mechanisms and assumptions also produce blind
spots and that in fact for your psyche to exist
at all in the first place for there to even
be a psyche because what is a psyche a psyche
is not a simple thing we might look out into
the world we might say a tree is a is
a simple thing a rock is a simple thing but
I psyche what is a psyche we don't even know
if this is a physical object so consider that this
thing we call a psyche that for it to even
exist that it might have to be founded on something
that's fictional that's not true can you open your mind
to that possibility good and we're going to continue building
on this but before I get into the actual meat
and I'm going to tell you in this video exactly
what spiritual diamond is in a very clear-cut way so
I'm not going to beat around the bush but I
want to before I tell you I want to setup
your mind so you can understand this truth because this
truths like I said it's so delicate and so subtle
that it's very very easy to misunderstand it so the
first thing I want to say is that this video
is designed for rational people if you consider yourself a
rational scientifically minded serious intellectually rigorous person that's perfect that's
how I was before I discovered this truth and I
spent a lot of my time early in my adulthood
in my early adulthood discovering and researching what is actual
truth how do I get to the bottom of things
not just believing what people tell me thinking independently for
myself and really doing serious research to discover this not
taking it for granted that we already know what the
truth is so that's good this video is not for
New Age hippie dogmatic people there's not going to be
any New Age stuff in this video there's not gonna
be any hippie notions or not going to any Dogma
there's not going to be mysticism we're not going to
be talking about gods or philosophy or conspiracy theories or
deities or mythology or religion so all of that is
going out the window here so if you don't like
that stuff great in this video what I'm going to
help you to do is I want to help you
to start an empirical investigation into this truth yourself because
this truth can only be discovered through a personal empirical
investigation you have to start doing the research and start
doing the looking and finding the evidence in the facts
for yourself generating your own proof because remember if this
truth is actually in communicable it can't be communicated that
means that I can't give it to you nor can
a teacher or a professor or a spiritual guru you
have to find it for yourself so this empirical investigations
can be very important and what I mean by empirical
is that you're going to be using your own faculties
the things that you know the best your own sight
and sound and feelings and emotions and your own consciousness
and your own thoughts you're going to using all of
this to discover the truth for yourself you're not gonna
have to rely on other people telling you things you're
not going to believe people another thing you should understand
is that this investigation that you'll be doing is going
to be very different radically different than anything you've done
in your life even if you've done scientific research before
even if you come from a university background or whatever
your background might be this is a very different investigation
that you're used to and if you're a spiritual person
this is different than any kind of investigation you've done
in your spiritual work as well so be open-minded that
you can be using a process here that's different something
that you're not comfortable with using and that's okay you
have to learn along the way here's a couple of
things you're going to need to make this journey successfully
even to begin the journey just to understand what I'm
tell you in this video you're going to need these
things open-mindedness to the ultimate degree complete open-mindedness ability to
embrace paradox that means that if something is paradoxical or
contradictory to you after I say it you need to
be comfortable with holding that paradox and embracing it for
potentially a long period of time not just hours and
days but potentially months and years can you embrace a
paradox for years before you're able to get it to
resolve it will resolve in the end but it's going
to take patience with you from you and it's going
to take a willingness to want it to resolve you
have to work for it the third thing you're going
to need is you need to desire for truth truth
with a capital T you can have to really want
to know what the truth is not because it serves
you or because it's pleasant or because it's interesting or
because you can come up with some theory and you
can now justify certain actions that you do in your
life with this truth but simply for the sake of
knowing the truth itself and the four thing you're going
to need is you're going to need to be completely
objective as you do this investigation and also as you
listen to me and also a healthy dose of skepticism
here to be skeptical about the things I'm telling you
but also be skeptical about the things your mind is
telling you because while I'm talking your mind is talking
and you have a tendency to be biased towards what
your mind is telling you and that's the whole danger
of discovering this truth it's very very tricky because your
mind is going to play games with you to prevent
you from seeing it and I'll talk more about that
a little bit later this truth is going to scare
the [ __ ] out of you and that's not
an exaggeration it's also going to confuse you it's going
to confuse you especially if you've been following some of
my other videos the more normal videos that I do
on personal development topics it's going to confuse you it's
going to confuse you if you're a religious person it's
gonna confuse you if you're a scientific person it doesn't
matter who you are it's going to confuse you and
doesn't matter who you are but it's going to scare
the [ __ ] out of you and it's going
to emotionally disturb you why is this the case it's
necessarily the case because this is how the the psyche
remember we're talking about the psyche well this is how
the psyche protects itself and protects its own structure and
to discover the truth we really need to break down
the structure of the psyche which is not a comfortable
thing for most people in fact if you're a Christian
if you're a Muslim if you're a Buddhist if you're
a spiritual person the things I'm telling you in this
video if you actually take them seriously they will crush
your models of reality they will crush you if you're
an atheist if you're a scientist if you're an academic
if you're an agnostic you will also be crushed by
the things I'm telling you why is this so because
the models you've built up over your entire lifetime no
matter how true you feel that they are well these
models we're going to be challenging them here these models
are built on some of these assumptions that we're going
to be questioning and you do not like questioning these
assumptions and the end result of this journey will be
the dissolution of your models of reality if that doesn't
sound scary trust me it will be when you start
doing it and you start feeling it in practice but
also realize that when you are feeling this fear you
have to be very self honest and ask yourself why
is there a fear here why do I fear going
in this direction why do I fear doing this investigation
after all I'm doing it very objectively and honestly and
yet there's so much fear there what is the psyche
hiding you see you have tons in it you have
a very firm mental model of who you think you
are you as an entity in this life you have
assumptions that you've made about yourself that you've never really
questioned and what we're doing in this video is we
want to challenge some of those assumptions and start to
question some of those so you need to be open
to questioning this stuff if you're close to that then
you might as well turn off the video the problem
is that even if you say to yourself and you
say to me yes leo I want to do this
investigation it sounds interesting let me do it the problem
is that you don't appreciate just how psychologically tricky your
psyche is going to be here you're going to be
psychologically manipulated and sabotage by your psyche to prevent you
from seeing this truth now you might wonder well why
is that the case it sounds very nefarious call most
like a conspiracy theory and we'll talk more about that
as we continue for now though what I want you
to do as I'm about to tell you this truth
I'm getting to the truth I'm going to tell you
right now point-blank I want you to watch extremely carefully
for an emotional reaction in you your psyche will produce
an emotional reaction right now so I want you to
watch for it and I want you to just observe
it don't react just observe your emotional reactions okay so
here's the truth and to get you to really understand
it we need to get your mind around what we
mean by the concept of you so when I talk
about you in this video I want you to be
very clear about what we mean by you so right
now I want you to stop everything that you're doing
focus right now on what I'm saying I want you
get really comfortable in your seat relax get your back
up straight I want you to close your eyes right
now as I'm speaking and follow along now what I
want you to do is I want you to get
in touch as your eyes are closed I'd like you
to get in touch with the present moment feel yourself
breathing gently in and out feel the sensations in your
body that you weren't really aware of before the pressure
of your butt on the seat the pressure on your
feet feel your hands get in touch with the present
moment also notice that there's their thoughts there's like an
inner dialogue that's happening inside your mind it might be
saying any kind of random thing notice that there's a
thinking going on inside and notice that there's an awareness
inside of you an awareness of life an awareness of
being of existing of living of all these feelings even
the colors that you see through your closed eyelids notice
that now what I'd like you to do is I
want you to get in touch with you who you
know that you are the most true thing that you
know about yourself which is that you exist get in
touch with the evidence of your existence so maybe you
think it's your thoughts the foster that are being thought
or the feelings in your body or maybe you say
your name whatever your name is you can say it
and that that's me or maybe you can think of
some memories from your past which are you but most
fundamentally who you believe that you are is this thing
that's experiencing life right you're like at this at the
center of life life is happening to you it's your
life you own this life get in touch with that
right now get in touch with it you got it
you got that sense okay now the truth keep your
eyes closed focus on that focus on that feeling the
truth that I'm going to tell you here the truth
is that there is no such thing as you in
reality what you're feeling right now is an illusion and
that does not exist in physical reality so that thing
that you think you are that feels most true about
life that in fact that's false or I go ahead
and open your eyes so that's the truth it's a
very very simple truth but the problem is a that
you can't believe this truth it doesn't sound plausible to
you and be even if you do believe it the
problem is that you don't actually have an experience of
it you would just have a belief even if you
took what I just said it on my word let's
continue working with this truth because there's some more stuff
I need to tell you about it so let me
give you another taste of what we mean by you
so when we mean you I'm pointing at you right
now in your mind you're registering this that I'm pointing
at you I'm talking to you I've been talking to
you this whole video so that you that I'm talking
to that I've been talking to that you we're saying
that that that you doesn't exist not theoretically not philosophically
not poetically or figuratively but literally physically physically and literally
everything I'm saying here is literal all right I want
you to register this what I'm telling you what I'm
telling you I want you to open your mind and
register as a truth and remember also watch for that
emotional reaction keep watching for that emotional reaction I'll talk
about it a bit a bit later here so now
let's continue I want you to take your hand put
your hand in front of you like this so that
you're looking at your hand right I want you to
look at your hand and I want you to notice
and register in your mind and ask yourself who is
looking at this hand and get in touch with the
feeling that you some sort of entity which we call
you is looking at this hand and seeing this hand
right this this hand is being seen by someone right
okay you've got that feeling that you're seeing this hand
good now the truth is that you're not seeing this
hand there is no entity looking at this hand or
seeing this hand now this is a pretty freaky and
mind-melting notion it's hard to even understand how this could
be possible but let me start elaborating a little bit
what we mean here is that who you think you
are this entity experiencing life also the body and the
mind and thoughts you think of all this as you
that that sense of this is my self this is
a personal self that's owning life that's a that's an
illusion now this doesn't mean that the body doesn't exist
the body clearly exists and reality clearly exists but your
notion of ownership over this reality over this body and
over your thoughts don't exist that's a fiction also you
believe that you're a perceiver that you are something perceiving
objects so we have this kind of model that we
use the way we basically we assume about life is
that well there's agents in life and then there's objects
and so agents can perceive objects so conscious beings like
animals and humans supposedly we can look at the world
and see things and then other things can't see can't
see anything and we think that we are these entities
that are seeing stuff and so we call ourselves perceivers
and then we we call our perceptions perceptions well what
we're saying here is that there is no perceiver and
then you might wonder well then what is there what
there is is simply perception itself without a perceiver so
the hand that you're looking at here look at your
hand again this hand is real it's a hand what
we're saying is that it's not your hand it's just
a hand no different than any other hand is just
a hand not yours and moreover no one is seeing
this hand the hand simply exists as a perception what
you would call a perception it just exists a perception
without a perceiver of it and the feeling that you
have that you are perceiving it that that's an illusory
feeling and that you can come into a realization that
that in fact is not the case you can come
into a realization that you are not a perceiver so
what you currently believe that you are what you think
you are right now you what you think you are
right now is you think that you're a body and
this physical entity but actually what you really are without
knowing it is that you're a thought not a physical
entity that's who you currently believe you are see there's
kind of like a false self and a true self
the false self is who you currently believe you are
so if you think that you're the body or the
one perceiving things then that is actually not a physical
entity but that's a thought which is telling you who
you are this physical body but this thought is false
so this is the very very core of spiritual alignment
is this truth there's also though a few other corollaries
to this that i want to mention in some details
i want to fill in so want to tell you
exactly what spiritual alignment is the term what it means
when people say spiritual enlightenment a lot of them are
confused but the ones that actually know the one that's
actually experienced it this is what they mean firstly they
mean that who you think you are right now is
a thought not a physical entity secondly what they mean
is that you are not the body or the mind
of course immediately the question comes up but then if
that's the case what actually am i and that's the
truth that can't be communicated you have to actually experience
it for yourself to know but we can say some
things about it to give you a little bit of
a sense like a story about it so I'll talk
about a little bit the truth is that there is
no you perceiving anything reality simply exists and that's the
end of it there's no need for a perceiver of
reality which we assume that we need actually that that's
not necessary also the notion that we have about matter
we think about well there's perceptions and like colors and
tastes and stuff but there's also like hard physical matter
well this distinction is a false distinction too because what
we call matter doesn't actually exist in reality what we
call matter is a conceptualization by us what exists in
reality actually is a field of awareness a field of
awareness so what you call matter is actually a field
of awareness and this field of awareness you might say
okay well I can kind of by that notion maybe
but then isn't this field and where it's localized within
me so isn't it me who's aware of the world
and what we're saying here is know that that's an
allusion to the field awareness that reality is this is
a non localized field awareness think of reality being self-aware
like every bit and pixel of reality we can say
that reality is composed of bits and pixels that every
bit and pixel is self-aware whatever that might mean so
that's a that's very core to spiritual Lineman another thing
about spiritual alignment is that it means that life is
totally impersonal there's nothing personal about life which means that
everything that you take personally about your life is an
illusion and an in fact life is completely neutral completely
impersonal even your very body is impersonal even your thoughts
your very thoughts about you are impersonal the other thing
that spiritual I'm it means is that all thoughts and
all beliefs no matter are the whether they're religious spiritual
scientific or everyday beliefs all of them are just stories
they're not reality and they're not truth-telling they're just stories
they're stories about reality but not reality itself and they
don't carry truth about reality even though we believe that
they do another aspect of spiritual I mean that's really
cool is that because the U is an illusion it
doesn't actually exist then mortality becomes irrelevant because you are
not the body now sure the body is going to
decay and die you can't really prevent that at least
at this point our technological advancement we can't prevent that
but the body's not you so when you dis identify
with the body you're not going to really be too
attached to what happens to it in the end another
important facet here of spirit alignment is that there is
no free will and by free will we're not talking
about philosophical concepts of free will we mean very practically
so the control that you believe you have over your
life all the decisions you think you make even the
motions you make with your body and your hands even
the blinking of your eyes and the thinking of your
thoughts and the talking of your mouth all of this
is done without any input from you even though it
feels like there is input from you and that you
have control over these things and that you consciously dictate
and direct this stuff actually that's part of the illusion
as well so when the self and the Hugo the
free will goes also this means that all the fear
all the suffering all the emotional distress that you've had
in your life all the prom you have in your
life all these problems are fake your entire life is
a pathetic excuse basically a pathetic escape from your true
nature from ever discovering true nature because this is how
your psyche is inherently unnecessarily constructed your psyche cannot be
constructed otherwise it has to be constructed this way to
currently sustain the way that you live also this means
that all religions all philosophies all schools of thought whatever
they are whether you think they're scientific and rational or
irrational all of those are just stories they're not true
they're just stories another important facet of spiritual alignment is
that this thing that we're talking about spiritual limit itself
what is it it's an insight that you have it's
an insight into the truth of reality that's what it
is this insight happens in the split second it happens
in a split second when you have it technically it's
not even are you having it because there's no you
to have the insight the insight simply happens it's important
to not mistake this with an emotional state or a
high of some sort so this is not so sort
of drug-induced high nor is it an emotional state that
you pop into and then pop out of it's not
a meditation high or whatever else you might think about
it it's the truth the truth exists always so this
is a permanent permanent state of realization if you can
attain it and the real trick of it all is
that it's actually impossible it's impossible for you you who
you think you are right now it's impossible for you
to understand any of this not really you can get
a taste of it through metaphor I'm giving you kind
of metaphors here but you don't actually understand it because
your psyche to understand it has to break down and
dissolve only when the psyche dissolves and what's left is
the truth itself then you understand it so it's not
really even understanding it's just a being of the truth
itself because when you get rid of your you what
does that leave that only leaves reality raw reality no
more separation no more thoughts no more theories no more
models none of that stuff just raw reality and you
are it you are the raw reality see the true
you we were talking about the false you the true
you is actually very paradoxically is nothing you are nothing
and also simultaneously you are everything nothing and everything and
this is hard to understand and it's impossible to understand
without experiencing it but nevertheless this is what is a
fact everything I'm telling you here is not a theory
it's an observable fact you don't have to have faith
in it you have to believe in it in fact
you can't believe in it you want to believe in
it but that's going to prevent you from seeing it
you have to actually see it for yourself so it's
an observable fact which means it can be discovered through
this empirical investigation that we talked about and another interesting
wrinkle is that all spiritual these word spiritual in course
I don't really like that word but it's all spiritual
stories from the Bible from various religious texts from the
east and the West for mystics all spiritual stories point
to this fact right here except what they do is
they cover it up with a bunch of nonsense bunch
of stories and a bunch of metaphor which makes it
very confusing but what I really try to do here
is I try to lay it out very very starkly
for you because this is what actually helps you to
see it it's a very dry fact about reality there's
no gods unicorns deities heaven and hell reality is exactly
what it appears to be without any additions of you
to it which means that we have to subtract you
from it for you to see it okay now at
this point what I want to do is I want
to pause I want to pause I wanna have you
actually soak in and take in everything I said drink
it all in and notice your emotional reactions right now
as I've been laying all this on you what are
your emotional reactions what's your mind doing it's getting upset
it's getting frustrated getting angry is it getting stubborn it's
getting confused is it getting excited is it having an
aha moment is it getting sad is getting depressed what's
going on in there notice it and notice that it
might be something very subtle and not as obvious as
a major depression or a fit of anger might be
something very subtle like a subtle resistance a subtle not
wanting to listen anymore a subtle shifting away of attention
and focus towards something else in your awareness notice that
just watch that reaction also take in what I'm saying
here take it in the problem is that people hear
this truth this truth is talked about in spiritual books
the problem is that they just gloss over they run
through it they don't actually understand what's being told to
them so I want you to understand it and the
way you know that you understand is that you have
an emotional reaction to it so make sure you have
this emotional reaction I hope you can sense that this
truth is outrageous it's out rate what I told you
is just outrageous because I didn't say figuratively like other
spiritual texts tell you I said it literally and now
you're forced to confront it in other spiritual texts what
you do is you read it and then you all
it's just a story it's just it's just a parable
it's just it's just something from 3,000 years ago when
people are stupid don't confront the truth right now it's
outrageous right outrageous and it is outrageous what I said
is outrageous just notice that notice it just because it's
outrageous doesn't particularly mean that it's false also notice right
now if you have a lot of objections counter-arguments happening
your head notice that that's happening a voice inside your
head is saying stuff about me about these ideas notice
that also notice what is that is that part of
the communication system that we were talking about remember I
said that what if your communication system was flawed was
designed in a particular way that creates blind spots could
it be that this communication system which is functioning right
now on overdrive in your mind that this is it
doing its usual thing creating more blind spots because right
now a blind spot was exposed to you but the
communication system and your psyche doesn't like seeing these things
so this point you might be saying okay Lea this
is very very outrageous let's say give you the benefit
of the doubt for a few seconds how can how
can I be so deceived how come I'm so deceive
then if this is in fact true well what we're
saying here is that this is not the matrix we're
not talking about the matrix some people confuse this and
say leo so are you saying that nothing is true
I'm living in a dream is that what you're saying
no that's not what I'm saying everything is real the
world is real reality is real your hands are real
they're just not your hands it's not your reality and
it's not your life so the only thing that we're
questioning here is the you at the center of it
that's what we're question kind of like 500 years ago
before we understood astronomy people believed that the earth was
the center of the whole universe and we thought that
we were the center at all well we still believe
that we personally are at the center of the universe
right science long ago has found out that the earth
is on center of the universe but we still personally
believe that each one of us is at the center
of the universe this life that we have which turns
out to be an illusion so that's what we're questioning
how can you be so deceived I'll tell you remember
that voice inside your head spinning objections talking to me
right now well the key assumption you make that everybody
makes every human being makes on the whole planet is
that the inner voice that's talking is truthful now consider
what if the inner voice that was talking and labeling
reality what if it wasn't truthful what if it was
just arbitrary it was just saying step and slapping slapping
labels on reality oh well we'll call that thing a
tree we'll call this thing a person we'll call this
thing up a building we'll call that thing a planet
we'll call that thing the Sun random labels just slaps
labels on and also use a random form of logic
to connect all these things together into some sort of
conceptual framework and then it says look we got reality
this is what reality is let's see no that's not
what reality is that's a conceptual very heavy conceptualization of
reality so you've got reality itself then you've got the
voice spinning stories about reality constructing a web of concepts
then this one if concept gets layered on top of
reality this happens so quickly and fluidly outside of your
awareness that then you get this hybrid this augmented reality
and then we look at and say oh this is
reality no that's not reality reality is this thing that
it was before you spun all this nonsense about all
these stories these stories that are spun their stories that
are spun from our intuition from our naivete from science
from religion from philosophy from every corner of life stories
are being spun all the time you might wonder but
Leo aren't certain stories more true than other stories well
what's telling you that your stories are true see to
believe that your stories are true you have to tell
yourself my stories are true and then lie to yourself
about it that you tell yourself that so what a
true story is isn't actually a true story a true
what you call a true story is actually a story
that has another story behind it that tells it that
it's true and sometimes we take this to two very
crazy degrees so you might have layer and layer and
layer and layer a dozen layers deep of story telling
you that this story is true story backing up story
backing up story backing up story if you dig all
the way down the chain and you get to the
very bottom of it what you discover is that there's
no truth there at all what you are creating in
your mind is you're creating self-fulfilling prophecies or basically a
better way to put it more more technical term would
be up your question begging all the time you're creating
vicious circles vicious logical circles inside your mind but then
you cleverly hide this under the rug and then you
probably or stories as though they're true so this is
what you're doing now if what you can do if
you can manage to do this as part of the
Imperial investigation is you strip away you take reality that
you've hybridized augmented you strip away all the thoughts stripping
all the way keep stripping away keep stripping away keep
stripping away until there's just nothing left just the raw
reality then you get to the truth and if you
do that then you discover that there's no you at
the center of it pretty cool that's pretty cool that's
the fundamental explanation of how this stuff works what I
want to do is I want to get you another
taste of what a spiritual enlightenment experience can can feel
like just an analogy of it I think that this
this is going to work pretty well so another optical
illusion is coming up here you're gonna do the same
thing as last time you're going to pause the video
when the optical lusion comes up and you're going to
look at it and what I want you to do
is you're going to see a three-dimensional cube represented and
this cube can be looked at and seen from two
different perspectives the first time you look at it you
can see it from one perspective automatically and then if
you keep looking at it you might stare at it
for 30 seconds maybe a couple of minutes if it
takes you that long good just look at it and
then you'll see what's going to happen is it's going
to flip try to see it as you look at
the cube try to see from the opposite perspective and
what you'll see is that it'll flip in a second
it'll flip and then you'll see it from the other
orientation so this will be a cool phenomenon you've probably
seen this before it's called the Necker cube but indulge
me here and take a look at it again go
what's interesting about that example which is what I really
love about it is that it shows you that the
facts of the matter in that picture they stay the
same nothing changes but what changes you is your shift
in perspective right and that turns out to be a
pretty significant difference so the picture didn't move at all
but in your mind the picture moved and that makes
all the difference in the world you might wonder well
Leo if what you're talking about is that the body
is still here in the world is pretty much exactly
as as I see it he says that there's no
me is that then just like a semantic argument or
are we just splitting hairs here and quibbling about words
and actually no we're not quibbling about words not at
all because based on this one falsehood in your in
your consciousness in your awareness this creates a lot of
your suffering and trauma in life in fact all of
your suffering and all of your trauma which I'm gonna
get to in a minute is created by this so
this makes a very important practical difference in your life
it makes all the difference in the world but just
like in this cube example you notice that it's subtle
right it's not like we're saying that everything is going
to change we're just saying that your perspective on things
is going to change in fact I want to twist
your mind a little bit more what I want you
to do I want you to skip back rewind to
the cube again and I want you to look at
the cube again and I want you to notice this
time I want you to notice that in fact we
were talking about cubes but if you look at the
picture there's actually no cube represented in the picture at
all can you remember that you remember what the picture
actually was you can't remember go back and look what
it was it was just a couple of circles with
some stuff carved out of them you were seeing the
cube as a wireframe negative that your mind was projecting
onto the image because your mind is is really good
at you know filling in blanks and stuff like that
but if you look at that picture very strictly very
dryly very objectively you'll notice that there's no cube at
all represented in that picture it's a projection of your
mind so I hope then you get a taste in
a sense from this example that you're you yourself the
ego your name say your name right now nod your
head right now who's not gonna nod your head right
now who's not in your head no one's nodding your
head the head is nodding itself but it sure feels
like someone's nodding your head doesn't it yeah it does
in the same sense that the cube really feels like
it's there when in fact it's not and if you
live your whole life believing the cube is real when
in fact it's not real and then you base your
entire set of actions and your entire decisions through life
based on the fact that the cube is real in
fact it's not you can imagine that that might create
some problems right might create some problems for you at
this point you might be wondering leo it's sounding a
little plausible kind of crazy but okay you know let's
say I buy into it for a little bit but
I just can't understand how comes society isn't buzzing about
this if this truth is so outrageous and revolutionary how
come more people aren't talking about it so let's address
this question because it's important because otherwise you're not even
going to trust me here - that this that this
is worth pursuing for you as a investigation so why
isn't Society buzzing about this well first of all most
people don't know second of all society is rampant with
groupthink and conditioning and cultures and all sorts of you
know delusions of the masses so we know that for
a fact just based on other theories and studies of
social dynamics so groupthink is very rampant in society third
is that you understand that your society we call society
this great thing called society is actually a playground of
distractions for your psyche do you understand this what society
actually is what it's designed for you're saying that in
the entire society inside our social system just like your
psyche is designed so that the psyche is distracted from
looking at what the psyche is not seeing understand that
this is not obvious but when you start to to
see the true this we started to do the investigation
you start to see like oh my god all of
society without even knowing not know this isn't done in
this little evil in the various way without even knowing
it because people are unconscious they behaved on conscious ways
and they suck you into it to everything buying houses
and going partying and having drugs and drinks and in
the political system and the educational system and the the
corporate system all of this religions religions brings us to
the fourth point why is society not buzzing about this
well actually society is buzzing about this it's just that
a the people who are buzzing about it who actually
know nobody listens to them because they sound crazy like
I am right now or religions religions were originally supposed
to be communicating this truth religions are ubiquitous around the
world the problems that religions distort this truth so much
because they don't recognize that the truth is impossible to
communicate and yet they try to communicate it anyways and
over time over thousands of years the distortion just becomes
enormous so enormous that it loses all touch with reality
so in a sense you could say the society is
buzzing around it that's why people are religious but they're
just extremely confused about it this truth is very difficult
to communicate it needs this point needs to be appreciated
see it's hard to understand that there can be a
truth that can't be communicated it doesn't seem like that
could be possible but actually it's very easy for this
to be possible because communication is part of your language
system part of your thinking system part of your psyche
communication is part of the psyche understand this and it
assumes that the stories that are told are true the
stories in your mind sure we allow for lying and
deception but we never even never even occurs to us
to question the assumption wait a minute all the communication
that's happening in the world that's ever happened all the
thinking that's been done could these have just been empty
shells just stories and labels that were completely arbitrary could
that possibly be true we never think about that we
never seriously consider that also you got to ask yourself
you know some people might say at this point well
Leo where's the proof I need proof of this you're
making a really bold claim outrageous claims so we need
some scientific proof people get hung up on this they
can use science as a ego defense I have a
video about that how not to use science as an
ego defense where I talk about this at length but
you also have to ask yourself what proof exactly are
you looking for what kind of proof are you expecting
because some people expect like what like a study you
expect a study to prove this to you that you
don't exist you expect a scientific consensus what exactly do
you expect expect like a microscope picture because you got
an agenda we're talking about something internal you understand science
science is proper domain is external science doesn't really deal
with internal subjective matters or what you call subjective matters
right sighs concerned about looking for molecules and calculating distances
and and calculating quantities and this kind of stuff which
is not what we're talking about here we're talking about
here a certain perspective that you have on life so
even if their words were scientific proof you'd have to
wonder what kind of proof would it be because this
is a very different animal that we're talking about and
in fact science right now you know there's a lot
of research being done on neuroscience and on the brain
we don't really understand the brain very well at all
we're pretty much in the dark ages as far as
that goes we just don't have the tools and technology
to understand the brain brains very complex and science has
theories about consciousness and reality but one of the currently
open questions in all of science that we haven't really
even scratched for the last 3,000 years ever since it
was discussed back in the Greek in Roman days is
how does matter what science calls matter and energy how
does that connect and relate to to consciousness because I'll
only think that matter and energy exists but then we
also tell ourselves that while consciousness consciousness is the most
real thing we know we know there's consciousness we know
there's colors we can't deny that colors exist but then
on the other hand what our colors are colors matter
or are they something else in philosophy of mind actually
colors and sensations are called qualia this is the qualitative
aspect of reality which science really doesn't do a good
job of explaining the only proof you can get for
this is by doing the empirical investigation yourself because you're
investigating yourself right no scientist can go inside mine and
investigate you for you only you can do that so
the looking for external proof is not going to help
you here another difficult part of this communication is that
literally you cannot understand what I'm telling you why can't
you understand it because there's a you that believes it's
there if you understood it that you would still be
there which would be the thing we're trying to get
rid of so for you to understand it the only
way this can happen if the you dies if it
gets its dissolved if we get rid of it this
is why this this is called ego death in certain
spiritual circles they call enlightenment ego death because your ego
ISA die and one thing I see people mistaking and
getting wrong about ego death is that they assume that
the ego is like some aspect of them so it's
like there's me and there's an ego like the arrogant
side of me and so yeah let me kill off
the arrogant side of me and then all be left
you know the wholesome me will be left no we're
not saying that there's a wholesome you and then some
sort of nefarious ego who are saying is that all
of it is one thing the ego refers to everything
so your sense of you right so remember I'm pointing
my finger at you right now nod your head that's
you that's the you it doesn't have to be something
arrogant or nefarious the other thing is that this this
idea to understand it requires deep deep deep self honesty
why because the self is inherently dishonest the way that
self perpetuates itself is through lying or just unconscious behaviors
lack of awareness what is required to do this of
your investigation is simply to raise your awareness higher and
higher and higher until you see that the self doesn't
exist anywhere but this requires self honesty because you tell
yourself firstly that you're already conscious you're already fully conscious
that's what you believe you believe that you're real you
believe in your beliefs you believe in so many things
about life that you're not ready to go in there
and question them very objectively and honestly you just give
lip service to self honesty you don't actually practice self
on in your life so that's why it's very difficult
it's also very difficult to communicate this because you don't
like it this is not a pleasant truth when I
go around people keep talking talking about this to other
people I don't really talk about it other people but
if I chose to what happens what he think happens
first of all this is difficult communication is very nuanced
communication so most people don't even listen to you the
next thing is that that if they hear it and
they actually register it then they get upset they get
angry they get depressed and they blame you for it
or they can they get confused or whatever and so
their ego defense just kind of keeps them away from
this truth entirely and so they basically spend their entire
lives not looking at this truth not even knowing it's
there and everyone does this everyone in society does this
all your friends your family your professors your business partners
your wife your husband everybody this is not a pleasant
truth so you gotta also appreciate and this will make
sense to you if you if you study how society
works you understand that the stuff that spreads through society
is the stuff that people like right the stuff that's
Pleasant that's why society is all built upon the most
low consciousness entertainment and other things that you could possibly
come up with so what's the most popular food the
most low consciousness and unhealthy food the food that tastes
the best but it's the most unhealthy right McDonald's what's
the most popular movies and videogames also the most lowbrow
low consciousness movies and video games that you could possibly
construct so they appeal to everybody and they're satisfying and
they have no intellectual value really because you have if
you use your brain and if that's a struggle most
people they want to use your brain they just want
to unplug what about music same for music what about
politics politics is that way too who are the political
leaders that win in the most elections the ones that
are the most lowbrow dumbed down black and white candidates
the ones that are the least qualified to run the
country what about governments governments work this way to find
any system in in society that's widespread like this religions
same thing right it's all about making something as low
conscious as possible that's that's what makes it spread through
society so if some if there's a truth that people
really really hate it's not going to spread very well
and the last difficult part of this communication is that
to really do this empirical investigation to understand this communication
fully you need to spend and I'm not exaggerating at
least a thousand hours doing this investigation yourself so I'm
talking about hard work hard emotionally distressing work that takes
a thousand hours to do if you really want understand
what I'm saying here you think this video is long
this video is not long a thousand hours and that's
at least a thousand hours that's in the best of
circumstances that's if you cut out all the religious dogma
all the spiritual nonsense and you go straight to the
to the core then you just sit down and just
drill down and do the Imperial investigation day after day
after day a thousand hours at best many people not
in your entire lifetime more realistically ten thousand hours versus
a thousand hours so now try to understand this there's
a truth that needs to be communicated that nobody likes
requires incredible self honesty threatens the [ __ ] out
of your your current life and worldview literally cannot be
communicated and it takes a thousand to ten thousand hours
of sitting down doing hard work to understand it who's
going to know this truth about ten thousand people in
the whole world that's about it you have to appreciate
this you have to appreciate this why do you have
to appreciate this because right now your mind is coming
up with excuses for why not to listen to me
at this point why you're saying Leo this is very
heavy you're talking heavy stuff some of the stuff sounds
really dark depressing nihilistic where you going with this I
mean all I want is I want a good life
why would I undertake this journey a thousand out ten
thousand you want me to invest that much time studying
this stuff you crazy actually there's some awesome rewards which
we haven't talked about yet the rewards of doing this
work so why would you want to do this work
it's difficult work is long work so there needs to
be a a worthwhile reward for this and here they
are I want to enumerate some of them number one
is that you get access to the truth the truth
with a capital T if you value truth which you
should this is one of the highest values for human
being is to value truth then this should deeply interest
you if you're a scientific person if you're a philosophical
person or even a religious person that's been looking for
the truth for your whole life and you think you've
found it or maybe what you found you're not satisfied
with well this is the ultimate truth what we're saying
here is the ultimate truth now if you're scientifically minded
this sounds ludicrous to you if you study philosophy like
I have for six years this is a ludicrous notion
but actually this is one of the rewards truth ultimate
truth with a capital T how I'll talk about that
in other videos the other reward you get is lasting
happiness and peace of mind true happiness true happiness what
you have now is not true happiness you're living in
a living hell with this truth you can actually have
true peace of mind regardless of circumstance this is a
very cool thing because you've been living your life from
the moment you were born up to today and you've
been looking and chasing for happiness and you keep telling
yourself if you watch enough of my videos or you
do enough of personal development work you'll find happiness well
I hate to break it to you but you never
will you never will and you can already sense it
because you've been trying your whole life and it hasn't
been working has it don't lie it hasn't been working
no matter how many houses you get or girlfriends you
get or marriages you get you're not going to be
truly happy why it's not possible because the U is
an illusion the solution needs to be perpetuated by constant
motion constant motion creates suffering so if you want to
fix this happiness thing and you want to be peaceful
and if you want to be peaceful independent of what's
happening in life no matter if you're rich or you're
poor or you've got a girlfriend or you don't or
you're married or you're not or your kids are doing
good in school or they're not or you're healthy or
you're sick if you want to be happy no matter
what you need to be spiritually aligned it sounds too
good to be true but again this is one of
the awesome rewards of doing this work the other cool
thing you get is you get an instant elimination of
self-image problems all your self-image problems don't discount how powerful
this is your entire life in my life I don't
know about you but for me it's very vivid my
entire life is a drama of self-image problems what do
I mean by that Carey what people think about me
people-pleasing worrying how I look learning about your hair worrying
about this worrying about that worrying in relationships worrying if
someone's going to abandon you or love you and all
this all this stuff all this is self-image problems so
that can all be eliminated in one swoop because when
you get rid of the self there's no more self-image
problems it doesn't make sense the other thing you get
with enlightenment is you get emotional mastery emotional mastery is
a theme of actualize that our own thoughts we're trying
to develop here but it's not possible to actually develop
true emotional mastery through traditional self-help techniques why because there's
actually no you at the center of it controlling emotions
or thoughts so your delusion is try to control your
thoughts and emotions which is not possible so how do
you get emotional mastery you get emotional mastery by discovering
that there's no me at all in the first place
when there's no you you know what that does that
makes you calm and peaceful why does it make you
calm peaceful because there's no longer any control and now
you realize it you finally realize there's no control right
now you're struggling for control that doesn't exist and so
because of this counter intuitively what happens that you develop
emotional mastery because there's no longer any emotions of frustration
of trying to seize control when you let go that
whole game you've got your emotional mastery but it doesn't
happen all in the line that you were expecting huh
another thing that will happen is that you can eliminate
all your suffering in life why is this the case
well because right now you think your suffering is created
by things outside of you actually your suffering is all
internally created completely 100% internally created this is hard to
believe because you're so enmeshed with yourself but when the
self is gone that becomes true you can get rid
of emptiness feelings of uncertainty feelings of depression loneliness anger
jealousy purposelessness lack of motivation whatever emotional suffering you experience
in life you can get rid of that the other
cool reward is that you actually get to understand you
get a true understanding of what religions actually are very
few people understand what religion actually is and what it
talks about which is God the word God I'm putting
that in quotes it's a very misunderstood word very misused
word you can get a true understanding of that in
a way that you can't get whether you're scientifically minded
and you do a lot of anthropology or you do
social science or whatever kind of signs you do to
understand religions well that's not getting a real understanding of
religions nor is being religious getting you a real understanding
of religion so both of these camps to understand religion
or God at all you're very confused about it but
if you attain spiritual I'm you can understand it really
easy it's a no brainer the other cool reward that
you get is no more fear of death the more
fear of death this is why the the Easterner is
talking about immortality I don't know how to immortality the
body certainly going to die it depends on what you
mean by immortality but the the fear of death will
will not be an issue anymore why is it not
an issue because like we said if there's no self
there's no one to protect anymore there's no one that's
going to die anymore the body is gonna die but
you're not going to identify with your body or your
thoughts anymore so it really becomes irrelevant so those are
some of the rewards pretty cool rewards huh I don't
know about you but these rewards make the process of
spending a thousand hours doing this hard emotional work worth
it for me even the first reward just knowing the
truth alone is worth it for me just knowing the
truth alone is worth it even if it wasn't good
for my life see the problem is it that you
look at this and you say well even if it's
truly a let's say even if everything you're saying is
true which is probably not but let's say it's true
just for sake of argument why the hell would I
want to know it it seems like my lives can
become miserable see you're so concerned about you you're so
concerned about you feeling good right what is that that's
the ego that's the ego and also what you fail
to understand in your closed mindedness is that actually the
greatest pleasure in life lies on the other end of
enlightenment because once you get rid of yourself there's no
more worry no more frustration no more stupid rat race
no more chasing your tail all the time you literally
get these rewards now these rewards sound pretty are out
there they seem a little too good to be true
but make no mistake about it you're going to you're
going to kill yourself understand this you're gonna kill yourself
getting these rewards literally you're going to kill yourself to
get these rewards how many people going to kill themselves
an infinitesimally small number I'm talking to you right now
you're not going to do it so don't worry you're
not going to get these rewards you're too afraid to
do it so if you're extremely committed one out of
a million of you who watch this video if I
get lucky enough and in my entire life to have
a million people watch this video maybe one of you
will get this and one of you got these rewards
the rest of you will never get them not only
will you not get them through spiritual enlightenment but if
you don't get them through spiritual enlightenment that means you
will never get them through any other means that you
might imagine you get them through so if you want
any of this stuff this is the only way to
do it so this point you may be wondering all
right leo so then what's the point of this video
you said that the stuff you're talking about here is
just a store and you spend a thousand hours what
do you want me to do the point of this
video is to share this truth with you in a
very stark way so that it disturbs you so that
it's on your radar screen in life because you've been
running around life chasing your tail this whole time and
it's not been on your radar screen many of you
have already heard this truth in various disguises in spiritual
literature that you've read and your religions even with science
we know whatever but you haven't actually pursued it in
the way you have to you need to make a
commitment to do a very very serious self-honest investigation empirical
investigation without any nonsense and beliefs into the reality of
who you are so the purpose of this video is
to introduce you to this now I want you to
stop and consider everything after this video is over very
very seriously don't let your mind just jump onto the
next thing don't distract yourself the biggest way that people
don't achieve spiritual alignments that they simply distract themselves with
other stuff and they forget about it very conveniently so
you're going to stop and consider very carefully you're going
to also take a look at your emotional reactions the
emotional reaction that you have whether you become depressed sad
angry offended at by what I'm saying if you become
critical of what I'm saying if you leave a nasty
comment or you have an inclination to or whatever or
you have some objections and you want to dispute this
and you have some brilliant arguments for how to argue
with me there's no arguments here all of that those
are emotional reactions that you have to be conscious of
and all of those equal the proof that you've been
looking for so the proof that you want right now
which you're not getting for me because I'm you're saying
that I'm being evasive or whatever that proof is in
your emotional reactions you have to start seeing at how
your ego is deceiving you your ego your psyche that's
what we're talking about here right so just be very
very mindful of that I'm going to be very much
less you're leaving comments down below I'm gonna be very
mindful at pointing out to you at how you're reacting
emotionally there's three dangers with this video as I'm wrapping
up here one is that you reject it you reject
it out of hand because you say this is a
cockamamie idea is silly of sound rageous there's no way
it can be true and so you just reject it
out of hand let me remind you especially for those
scientifically minded people out there who want proof that when
a scientist does research when a proper scientist does proper
science what he does he has a hypothesis he holds
his hypothesis in his mind he could hold his hypothesis
in mind for 10 years for 20 years for 44
entire lifetime and maybe even not prove it or he
might do that and then at the end he might
disprove it so if you really want to do a
serious investigation you have to actually do proper scientific method
just because you watch this video and you can't with
some some clever little arguments some little ways to critique
what I'm saying does not mean you did any kind
of investigation know what that just means that you've been
clever and you've been tricked by your own cleverness in
refusing to do the actual research you have to do
the reaction research yourself so what I want you to
do with what I'm saying here is just take it
as a tentative hypothesis you don't have to have faith
in it you don't have to believe it in fact
you can't you can't believe it we're not talking about
beliefs here we're talking about an insight you have to
have an actual insight into the truth of the matter
not a belief don't confuse this with other beliefs that
you have this insight we're talking about you've never had
one of these in your entire life it's not a
belief so just watch out and don't reject us out
of hand the other problem that can happen you're the
other danger is that you can believe it if you
believe what I'm telling you and you say to yourself
oh this is just like Buddhism I'm a Buddhist yes
I win I win the I win the religion game
or you're say yourself oh I was spiritual yeah spirit
I have a meditator I win this is right this
is what I believed all along no that's not what
we're talking about here no you can't believe this beliefs
count for nothing beliefs are a story they count for
nothing nothing nothing just a story they don't help you
at all if you believed every last word I said
in this video doesn't help you at all doesn't make
you any closer to the truth the only way in
which it might help you is it might um motivate
you inspire you to go out there and do the
work to find it and the last danger is that
you just you listen to this you might think it's
cool you might even say yes I'm on board for
the journey let's let's do this journey tell me how
to do a journey and then you do is a
month later you forget all about it you just forget
all about it because life and distractions come in and
swoop you away Society swoop too away like it does
with everybody else and so you become lost again you
have this brief window of clarity and then you're lost
again so those are the three dangers watch out for
them at this point you might be wondering are Leo
how do I do this work so let's say I'm
on board with you let's say I'm willing to give
you the benefit out I'm willing to hold this attentive
hypothesis I'll do the empirical work I even will lay
down the thousand hours that you want me to lay
down what do I got to do next how does
this work even done that's going to be the topic
of a bunch of fitting new videos on every shooting
because it's a process it's a process it'll cry many
videos for you to understand how to do this work
and it's tricky work full of many traps that you're
going to fall into but fundamentally to give you an
idea what we're going to do if you're on board
with this is we're going to rip the [ __
] out of your ego we're going to rip the
[ __ ] out of your ego I'm going to
destroy all your beliefs all your most cherished beliefs all
those beliefs you love so much about yourself about life
about everybody all those beliefs are going to destroy we're
gonna destroy all that and at the very end when
you can't take it anymore when we twist your arm
so bad that you're screaming and aching and your ego
can't take it anymore what's going to happen is finally
your ego is going to surrender you were going to
surrender and it's going to dissolve and you're going to
see the truth that is going to require some real
work but you know what I'm excited by this I
don't about you but I love this stuff I love
urban the [ __ ] out of my ego I
love it it's great is it's kind of a bittersweet
thing like sometimes I don't like it you know I
experienced all these emotional reactions but fundamentally I want it
because I want to know the truth to me it's
worth it just to know the truth of the things
and right now I'm I spent about a year and
a half on this journey studying and doing a lot
of a lot of this work I fall into a
lot of traps already myself I'm not spiritually enlightened yet
but I can feel myself getting pretty close so as
I'm working really actively right now on my own in
alignment I want to help show you some of you
know pitfalls that I've experienced um of the stuff that
I learned over last year and a half so I
think that there's um a lot of really practical things
that I can show you techniques that you can use
to do this very simple techniques that you can use
to do this that would take you perhaps a lifetime
to find otherwise because there's so much confusion about the
subject so much nonsense out there I want to talk
about this subject in a very no [ __ ]
no-nonsense hard-nosed kind of way so if you really want
