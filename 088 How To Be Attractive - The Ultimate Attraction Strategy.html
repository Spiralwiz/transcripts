            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/XlfKNqoL8JY' target='_blank'>How To Be Attractive - The Ultimate Attraction Strategy</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Detachment is key to attractiveness</b>: The central idea of becoming attractive is to be completely detached from needing anyone to fulfill a person in their life. 
</li><li><b>Love is not about completion</b>: The principle of finding someone else to complete you is not what true love or healthy relationships are about. A healthy relationship is one where both parties are confident, independent, and happy by themselves. 
</li><li><b>Needy and desperate behavior repels others</b>: A mindset where one believes they can only be happy with a romantic partner proves unattractive to the other person. Needy and desperate individuals tend to attract similar personalities, leading to co-dependent and dysfunctional relationships. 
</li><li><b>Being needy is inauthentic</b>: Neediness in relationships is seen as being inauthentic to oneself. It reflects a void in the person's ego, which they are trying to fill with another individual. Even if a perfect person fits the void, it won't result in happiness because the root problem is still avoided. 
</li><li><b>Understanding and developing oneself are crucial</b>: One needs to introspect and identify their quirks, limiting beliefs, and deficiencies of their ego. It is important to work on their personal development to be happy alone and not rely on anyone else for fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Authenticity is attractive</b>: Being 100% authentic, confident in oneself, and not clinging to others is found attractive by the opposite sex. This applies to all stages of a relationship, whether single or married.
</li><li><b>Psychological dependence risks relationships</b>: If one is psychologically dependent and attached to their spouse, it could likely lead to the relationship becoming sour. An authentic relationship cannot exist where one individual needs something from the other.
</li><li><b>Realizing self-sufficiency</b>: It's crucial to understand that there's nothing someone else can offer emotionally that one can't provide for themselves. This realization stems from meditation and enlightenment work on oneself.
</li><li><b>Psychological Dependency</b>: Leo emphasizes that psychological dependencies on other people, such as family, spouses, and bosses, hinder authentic self-expression and therefore attraction. This authenticity and independence are what make individuals attractive.
</li><li><b>Authentic Attraction</b>: Being genuinely happy with oneself, not needing anything to complete one's life, and being willing to part ways with others if things don't work out, cultivates authentic attraction. The norm for relationships  both parties seeking something from each other  stifles authenticity and breeds fear, leading to dysfunctional relationships. 
</li><li><b>Self-improvement</b>: Leo stresses that truly attractive individuals are those who have a comprehensive understanding of themselves  their needs, desires, and insecurities. To address these issues, it is important to introspect and improve oneself continuously. 
</li><li><b>Create a Fulfilling Life</b>: Leo advises viewers to work on creating a fulfilling life independently, with satisfying career, valuable friendships, enjoyable hobbies, a steady financial situation, and good health. Being self-sufficient and content with one's own life attracts others and leads to genuinely satisfying relationships. 
</li><li><b>Physical Health and Hygiene</b>: Maintaining good physical health and proper hygiene is essential not only for self-happiness but also for attractiveness. By creating a fulfilled and well-maintained life independently, one becomes genuinely attractive to others.
</li><li><b>Rejecting Gimmicks</b>: Leo closes by warning against making use of gimmicks to attract others. Instead, he advises viewers to address their deeper issues, focusing on personal happiness and eliminating their dependencies on others. Genuine attractiveness comes from being content and independent, rather than relying on other people for happiness.
