hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about the three levels
of personal development work and I'm going to show you
what your evolution will look like through the self-actualization path
personal development work is not all the same there's a
spectrum and I like to think of it as having
three main levels and each of these levels you can
spend years in until you move up into the next
one and then the next one and it's very helpful
for you no matter what stage you're at to realize
that there are these levels and that personal development teachings
or insights or wisdom or techniques are geared towards different
people at different levels of this journey that's very important
to understand because otherwise you're going to get confused because
sometimes what happens is that advice or a technique that's
intended for one stage of the journey is different or
even contradictory to a piece of advice or technique for
a lower stage of the journey right and with actualised
org now I'm moving into more advanced and advanced material
so I don't want you to get lost and confused
by that if you're still at the lower stages so
it's very important that you start to kind of classify
the material listening to whether it's for me or somebody
else doesn't matter along this kind of basic model that
I'm going to give you so here's the model it's
very simple I basically say that you've got newbies that's
the first level then you've got intermediate and then you've
got advanced right these are arbitrary I just made these
up but I think that this model is helpful what
I want to do is I want to tell you
what it looks like to do personal development at the
newbie stages and then at the most advanced stages and
then you'll be able to figure out what the intermediate
is because the intermediate is basically a mix between the
newbie and the advanced is somewhere in the middle this
is very very eye-opening it can be very very important
because what I'm seeing more and more of as I
release advanced material is that people who are following me
who are still on the newbie stage they can't grasp
it and in fact it makes them confused it can
make them angry it can make it seem like I'm
contradicting myself or like I'm I'm saying different things at
different times so we're going to clear this up so
let's talk about the newbie what are the characteristics of
the newbie on this path well it looks something like
this and this is a generalization but it looks something
like this basically the nude and then the newbie is
coming from a deep deficiency in his life he has
holes in himself that need to be filled whether with
relationships with money with business with a fitness with his
mood like he's depressed or something like that right so
this is where the newbie is coming from and he
really needs results from this work so he's in it
for the results he really just wants to feel better
because he's probably feeling pretty bad with his life he's
dissatisfied he might be suicidal at times he might be
depressed he might be very anxious or fearful about some
situation in his life and by the way when I
say he of course I also mean she I just
say he because still easier for me to keep in
my mind when I said he and when says she
so don't think that I'm leaving the ladies out of
this the newbie likes to blame his environment for whatever
is not right in his life so the reason that
he's depressed is because of his environment something external to
himself or the reason he's anxious is something external to
himself and the reason he has money problems is again
the environment and so because the newbie thinks that the
solutions are out in the environment that's what he's looking
for is he's looking for techniques and methods that will
give him an external solution to these things so it's
like if he feels that he's not good-looking enough he
will look for an external solution to that so it's
likely oh how can I make myself better looking what
can I do can I get like better clothes better
haircut some plastic surgery can I like use some Creemore
we know what are the what are the methods for
that he's not really interested in considering an internal solution
to this problem that's just one example you can apply
this tamati to relationships and everything else if there's a
relationship problem clearly as external maybe I need a new
girlfriend or I need a new husband and if there's
a problem with the kids clearly external problems right so
it's like the kids are not doing well enough in
school or the kids are misbehaving in some way external
problem how do we create an external solution well maybe
I can like set some some new rules for them
maybe I can ground them maybe I can take away
the keys to their car or something like that also
the newbie is negatively motivated the newbie is not in
this work for the extraordinary feelings he could have from
growing himself and from things like expanding his consciousness in
his awareness or from finding his life purpose and contributing
back to society in some way the newbies not interested
in these things because the newbie is coming from a
place of pain and he's just interested in removing the
pain he's not interested in high performance he's just interested
in kind of getting to baseline just to kind of
be average in life the newbie is also not interested
in changing his beliefs or his sense of self or
identity the newbie wants a solution that avoids changing his
beliefs at all or his identity he wants to maintain
those so really he's not looking for inner change or
inner growth at all he's just looking for things or
solutions in the outer world he's not interested in examine
being and perhaps tinkering with his beliefs about how happiness
works or how business works or how relationships work or
how depression works or how emotions work or what the
self is or what reality is these things are of
no interest to the newbie he just wants a solution
to fix his problem in fact the idea that he
would examine and he rode his sense of self this
is uh this is everything the newbie is against the
reason he's in personal development in the first place is
to build up his sense of self that's the point
in his mind the newbie is also very characteristically not
interested in truth he can't even comprehend why somebody would
be interested in truth for truth sake the newbie is
not interested in what reality is or how reality works
the newbies just interested in getting his result and if
he is interested in truth it's only to the extent
that it serves his sense of self and identity it's
like yeah I want the truth leo but really I
only want it when it confirms my existing ideas about
truth because I already know I already know what the
truth is there's no need to explore it and to
investigate it and to question it because I already know
the newbie also characteristically takes his mind way too seriously
he actually thinks that his thoughts matter that his thoughts
somehow correspond to truth because he has not made the
critical distinction yet between thoughts and awareness he's identified with
thoughts so fully that they are his reality and it
never occurs to him that I'm not just saying that
some of his thoughts are wrong I'm saying that everyone's
thoughts the entire structure of mind could be irrelevant on
this journey and that it could be a huge obstacle
see the newbie is not aware of the difference between
awareness and thoughts the newbie is also lost in theory
and so anytime that I present some kind of piece
of wisdom or advice or some insight especially if it's
a deep advanced insight then he just takes it on
as an idea he conceptualizes it and he doesn't understand
that he's conceptualizing it and he has no alternative to
that he doesn't actually ground the things that are set
to him in his direct experience so there's not a
distinction in the newbies mind between theory and direct experience
this is very very important you have to understand other
things that I teach you especially the most advanced things
that they are all grounded in direct experience I don't
just sit around and think up cool things to come
up here and tell you I do do that but
I also ground these things in direct experience and when
I do research I'm always doing research as to who
is grounding their ideas into direct experience these insights the
most advanced insights they're all coming from direct experience and
if you want to understand them it's not enough just
to understand them you have to also experience it and
some of these advanced things they take a lot of
inner work to experience and until you've done that inner
work and actually have the experience then you can't really
claim that you understand it you're kidding yourself a newbie
doesn't quite understand this a newbie also resists taking action
for the new be listening to self-help advice is great
especially when it's in video form or in audio form
you can just sit back and listen to hours and
hours and hours of it and it really feels like
oh I'm learning cool stuff and it's kind of interesting
and you know I'm agreeing with this thing there I'm
disagreeing with that thing there I'm building up my model
of the world is getting all all nice and rigid
in there I feel like I understand everything now but
of course that's an excuse from not taking action the
actual idea of the newbie taking a piece of wisdom
that's shared with him and then going out the next
day or even the same day and starting to take
action on it lots and lots of action hours of
action hundreds of hours of action thousands of hours of
action this idea scares him he doesn't want to contemplate
it when he thinks about it his body Quivers with
fear on the inside and that's a big problem because
if you're listening to advanced advice and you're not taking
action on it it will actually [ __ ] your
growth because now you're going to have a preview of
some advanced stuff that human beings have discovered but you
haven't discovered and so you're going to feel very very
frustrated because what you know is not going to match
up to what's real for you and yet you don't
want to take the action to make the alignment happen
because you've got all sorts of blocks and inner resistance
and of course rather than dealing with the blocks and
the inner resistance which takes action instead what you do
is you just cover up that problem with more information
nation and more advice watch more videos watch listen to
more audios read more books and that's a great way
to escape from this problem taking action but at some
point you're going to realize that this isn't working you
have to mobilize yourself one day you have to say
wait a minute I've got too much information I got
to start taking action and that you know that first
mobilization effort that you make is going to be very
very emotionally challenging for you so you're going to try
to put that off or as long as you can
you might put it off for six months twelve months
couple of years before it gets too painful to put
it off any longer the newbie is also unaware of
some very critical concepts in human psychology one of which
is the ego the newbie doesn't really understand what the
ego is why it's important and just how deceptive it
is and how much suffering it creates in his life
in fact when the newbie thinks about the ego the
newbie has a totally misconceived notion of the ego and
usually what it is it's like oh the ego is
like some bad part of me something like that not
realizing that the me calling the ego the bad part
is itself the ego so the ego starts to splinter
off in various ways without taking full a kind of
awareness of itself the newbie is also not aware of
closed mindedness the trap of closed mindedness and just how
close-minded he is and how serious of an impediment this
is to his growth when I talk about radical open
mindedness the newbie thinks like oh yeah okay I kind
of get it but it's like yeah Leo move on
let's move on there's no need to talk about radical
open - that's not very significant that's not an important
idea let's move on to the practical stuff so the
newbie hasn't realized yet just how much open-mindedness is necessary
to be able to even entertain gained the most advanced
pieces of wisdom even to entertain it I'm not even
talking about to actually embody it successfully the newbie is
also not aware of what I call the social distortion
that he's under so the newbie might hear an advanced
piece of knowledge or advice and then what he's going
to do is he's going to compare it to his
environment so he's going to look at his friends his
family his teachers his school environment his professors his coworkers
um he's going to look at what he's seen on
TV and in the tabloids and magazines and what he
knows about politics he's going to compare this piece of
wisdom with all of that which is a totally different
level and then he's going to discount this advanced piece
of wisdom because he gonna say Ollie oh that's not
realistic because look at reality my reality says that that's
not possible that can't possibly work because look at all
these people they're not living that way and the key
assumption and mistake that the newbie makes is to think
that actually society represents a healthy form of psychology as
though the average human being is you know the exemplar
of self-actualization which is not the case at all and
even things that you were taught in history class in
science class about human beings and how humanity has evolved
this idea that at one point Humanity was in the
dark ages and then we evolved out of that with
the Renaissance and then there was the European enlightenment and
now we moved into the 21st century now in the
21st century well science has pretty much mastered the universe
religion has been conquered and basically we've got a good
education system that teaches pretty much what's true and what's
right and it's like we're in the golden ages of
humanity this whole narrative the newbie doesn't recognize yet that
actually right now we are in the deep dark ages
humanity is in the dark as far as awareness and
self-development goes the deep deep deep dark ages so you
cannot look around your environment and use that as a
reference point because you're going to be totally off the
mark if what you care about is reaching your highest
potential as a human being which is what I care
about and which is what we're talking about here what
self-actualization the newbie is also not aware of what spirituality
is the newbie falls to two traps with spirituality one
is that he completely dismisses it because he's a scientific
rational atheist and spirituality is kind of fluffy nonsense so
he falls into that trap or he falls into the
opposite trap where he says Oh spirituality Yama I'm a
super spiritual person ah you know I do all these
spiritual things I love spirituality and it's kind of like
this this fake phony spirituality without doing the actual work
of spirituality the newbie doesn't understand yet what true spiritual
work is and how radically opposite it is of his
ideas about it the newbies not also interested in spiritual
group the newbie tells himself that Leo I'm a very
practical person all that spiritual stuff you know some people
are into it I'm not into it I just want
like to improve my life in very practical ways in
secular ways and that's fun I got no problem with
you doing that that's great do that but maybe there's
also a little bit more for you to discover the
newbie is also characteristically impatient he's very eager to take
any shortcut he can get so if the newbie here
is about a psychedelic he can take a psychedelic and
have an enlightenment experience and he says well Leo why
should I do all the enlightenment work you talked about
why should I meditate why should I do all this
hard work when I can just go take a psychedelic
and all the sudden I'm enlightened now I'll just take
psychedelics and there it is all done look how quick
it is uh but the newbie does understand that that
doesn't get him real enlightenment and that's just one example
the newbie will take shortcuts anywhere he'll take shortcuts with
relationships with business with health with fitness with curing his
depression or anything else right so rather than working on
his depression the newbie if he goes to the doctor
and hears about a new pill that supposedly helps people
with depression he's going to say screw all this stuff
Leo says let me go take that pill much easier
also what I've noticed about newbies is they want things
cheap or even free so the newbie is not willing
to really invest in knowledge or self-development the newbies not
interested in buying books or paying for a course or
taking a seminar that might cost a thousand dollars the
newbies not interested in this the newbie wants the cheapest
he can find the freest he can find and there's
no recognition of the value of this wisdom the newbie
for the newbie the idea that someone could invest thousands
of dollars to learn one piece of valuable wisdom to
the newbie that's that's totally out of his frame of
mind and the newbie also takes this wisdom for granted
when it is presented to him for free totally takes
it for granted doesn't recognize the transformative power that it
can have in his life because it's just treated like
a like a little idea it's just an idea to
him the newbie also has overly narrow focus so the
newbie comes into this and it's like well Leo you
know all I want to do is I just want
to bang girls I want to bang a bunch of
girls and I want to like run a killer business
that's what I'm in this for that would be a
guy or if you're a girl and you come into
this you'd be like all I want is like I
just want to have a nice family nice family nice
relationships that's what I'm in this for or you come
into this I Cleo all I care about is like
curing my insomnia and my depression and that's way too
narrow of a focus for personal development work you need
to really broaden that broaden it out because there's so
many things you're going to miss and you're not even
going to be effective in that narrow focus of yours
because you're going to miss a lot of really important
things you're going to dismiss things like philosophy and psychology
and and metaphysics and all these other things that are
going to help you in that quest to achieve those
specific things you want right but you need to broaden
it you need to look at the historical perspective you
need to be interested in history and in science and
all these other things but the newbie doesn't care about
these things in fact he sees them as a distraction
so when I start talking about these things the newbies
like olio this is just like you're off topic now
you're just rambling you're just ramble you're not helping me
build my business you're not helping me bang a bunch
of girls you're not helping me build my my dream
family because the newbie is not forward-looking he's not seeing
how all these little pieces will interconnect and build a
snowball effect in the end a newbie also complains about
abstraction so when I present an advanced piece of wisdom
that advanced piece of wisdom will probably seem abstract and
not practical because the newbie doesn't know how to chunk
down from the abstract to the concrete he doesn't know
how to take an advanced piece of abstract wisdom and
then come up with action steps that he can actually
go and take in his real life to embody this
abstract piece of wisdom so he will write a comment
saying this is all philosophy the newbie also thinks that
he knows what reality is what truth is what God
is and what the self is these things for a
newbie are never called into question the newbie knows these
things already perfectly because after all we're living in the
21st century and science is pretty much demonstrated everything there
is to know so we can just look at science
and everything we were taught in school and in college
and that's basically what there is we got it all
figured out so the newbie is not interested in actually
investigating these things from ground zero with an open mind
the newbie also loves to dispute and to argue so
that when I present an idea all the sudden the
newbies inner skeptic comes out but this is not true
proper skepticism in the way that skepticism was done in
ancient Greece this is the neurotic defensive skeptic this is
the skeptic that is just interested in being a good
lawyer where you just kind of like lawyer your way
out of any situation and you're just looking for loopholes
in what the person is saying and basically you're being
very literal list and all you're listening to is you're
listening to the words that are coming out of my
mouth and you're not actually listening to the meaning behind
it and the action steps that are necessary to ground
that meaning indirect experience and then how you can go
out and connect all that for yourself so that you
can demonstrate at first hand for yourself see the newbies
on interested in that the newbie is interested in just
being ideological because for the newbie it's very convenient to
sit back and just do armchair philosophy and be the
armchair skeptic and just look at things that are presented
to him and say ah well that's not going to
work and you know I read something there about this
that's that's contradicting what you say and you're contradicting yourself
here and you know what about what that person says
that contradicts what you say Who am I to believe
what if you're wrong leo all this kind of stuff
so this is what I call acting ideological it's a
desire to defend your beliefs more than it is a
desire to go out there and embody the things you're
being told and actually transform your life which is what
self-development is about it's not about beliefs it's about transforming
your life the newbie also is very demanding as far
as scientific proof goes so the newbie loves to say
well leo if what you're saying is true then provide
the scientific proof I want studies and I want evidence
and all this stuff back it up cite your sources
otherwise how do we know you're not just making this
stuff up well again it's because the newbie is not
looking to prove this stuff in his own life by
transforming himself he's just looking to validate ideas in his
mind that's what he's really interested in the newbie also
tends to have black-and-white thinking which means that when I
present some advanced concept the newbie will look at that
and he will take it and make a straw man
out of it and totally exaggerated it into ridiculousness and
then he will think that's what Leo said there's not
much nuance in the newbies mind about taking some advanced
idea like an idea like detachment or an idea like
enlightenment or an idea like you know happiness when I
present ideas like this the newbie mind isn't really interested
in probing and studying this this this issue and seeing
what it really is because it's a complex deep issue
it just takes the things I say and just kind
of runs away with it the newbie mind is also
easily offended the newbie mind also tends to make the
teaching about the teacher so if you're listening to some
advanced teaching whether it's for me or anybody else doesn't
matter who it is notice this in yourself when you
make it about me see nothing I really teaches about
me but a lot of people make it about me
it's like Leo where your source is Leo you're being
arrogant Leo you're being egotistical you know this doesn't contradict
sense with something you said there it's contradictory and you
know Leo what about you if you say you you
know I should be unconditionally happy what about you leo
show me your life and unless your life is perfect
and eventually happy then I'm not going to do what
you say this is a classical defense that the newbie
makes is projecting his own insecurities and and issues on
the teacher because that means the newbie doesn't have to
go inside and actually to do the hard inner emotional
work because any advanced person development teaching will force you
inside the depths of your mind to examine and look
at things that you really don't want to examine and
you really don't want to look at and so of
course rather than doing that the easiest thing to do
is criticism the things I talk about I'm not the
master of many of these things I don't need to
be though you know all I need to do is
make sure that I'm working towards it myself which I
am I work on it every single day in my
life on these things and my intention is to embody
and to move closer and closer to mastery on all
these issues that I talk about um and hopefully you're
doing the same thing and also sometimes I see newbies
have a hard time understanding how it is I know
that they are newbies and they get kind of offended
by this when I call them newbies or what I
call them ignorant because the problem here is that you
don't know what you don't know right so the newbie
things like well leo how can you know me you
don't know me leo so how can you say these
things about me but see just the way that you
frame your questions by the questions you ask any questions
you ask and the emotions behind them even the words
that you use even the amount of times that you
say I or me uh someone who's further along the
path than you can clearly see your level of awareness
how high or how low it is right it's extremely
obvious once you moved through some of these levels and
you're getting more towards the advanced level but if you're
a newbie you don't know any of this so to
you it seems like people are just like pretending like
they know you or something like that in fact the
person doesn't know you but the person knows the level
that you're at right and he knows that you can't
really escape the level that you're at the level kind
of defines you and since he's already been through the
level he knows the traps of that level he knows
them intimately so he can point them out to you
but of course is a newbie you don't like that
being pointed out to you so what you're going to
do is you're going to project back onto the teacher
and the last characteristic of the newbies that he falls
into this trap of simplicity as I call it now
this is a very deep idea let me explain it
this is this is really cool the trap of simplicity
so see when I say that there's like a newbie
stage in your media stage and advanced stage right a
newbie here is this and things like oh yeah there
is an advanced stage I will give you that I'll
acknowledge that there probably is one but my ideas about
it are that um it's very complex stuff to the
newbie the levels are marked by degrees of complexity so
you think that the most advanced stuff is the most
complex stuff it's like calculus you know calculus is hard
to do it's very advanced you got to sit down
and kind of go in there is highly technical in
all this and some advanced ideas are like that but
a lot of the deepest most advanced wisdom is extremely
simple it's so simple in fact that your mind will
tend to overlook it and to dismiss it and to
not take action on it which is one of the
biggest mistakes of the newbie banks right he underestimates this
and he thinks that when I present some advanced truth
it's likely oh this is not advanced it sounds so
simple it sounds stupid it sounds like childish it's childish
the ice cream truck is back again I had it
in my last episode and here it is again can
hear ice cream truck alright so so yeah that's kind
of the trap of simplicity because to the mind you
know the the easiest way for the mind to trick
itself is to is simply to hear something and then
just to say oh yeah I already know that I
already got that figured out yeah let's move on let's
move on to the real stuff that's what tends to
happen so in practice the newbie is incapable of grasping
the deepest wisdom that is available society in general is
at a stage in its evolution that it is incapable
of grasping or handling the deepest wisdom that the wisest
human beings have discovered we're not at that stage yet
which is why I said we're in the dark ages
and what's even worse is that society doesn't understand this
and the newbie doesn't understand it the newbie doesn't know
that he's incapable of grasping the deepest truth and this
is not merely a matter of willpower so if you're
at the newbie stage I'm not just saying you can
will your way into understanding the deepest truths the fact
is that you can't the only thing you can do
is you can grow yourself you can take the action
steps that I proposed to you throughout my content you
can do that you can do the deep inner work
to move yourself up into the intermediate stage and then
into the advanced stage and then as your awareness grows
you'll be able to tolerate and utilize the deepest truths
of mankind but right now you may be at a
stage in your life where you can't do that the
newbie hasn't experienced yet the shock of how little he
knows the newbie thinks he knows a lot and the
newbie thinks that as he moves up these levels he's
just going to know more and more and more and
more and just going to be a gradual series of
you know more and more stuff being added to his
mind the newbie doesn't realize yet that a lot of
the work to get to the advanced stages is subtractive
it's removing stuff from your mind which is a lot
more difficult than adding stuff to your mind and one
day will have to come the shock of just how
little you know just how much you thought you knew
isn't true that can be shocking that can be emotionally
horrifying to some people and it really progressed progress up
to the most advanced and deepest levels a lot of
people advanced from newbie to intermediate but they don't make
the leap from intermediate to advanced because they can't handle
the switch that has to happen when you move from
intermediate to advanced it's no longer accumulation it's no longer
more success and more of the same it's often going
backwards in the opposite direction and that feels very confusing
and scary and so you don't touch it with a
ten-foot pole so what characterizes advanced work let's talk about
that firstly it's radical open mindedness open mind is so
radical that I can present you with ideas like there
is no such thing as time there is no such
thing as space maybe the universe doesn't exist maybe you
don't exist maybe history isn't what you think it is
human history okay um a lot of things like that
which the normal mind can't seriously comprehend or if it
does comprehend then it comprehends it is source some sort
of a fantasy type of thing like a conspiracy theory
or something like that which is not what I'm talking
about I'm talking about radical open-mindedness but also at the
same time being grounded in reality so you're not just
making [ __ ] up like oh maybe we're all
living in the matrix that's not what I'm saying that
would be another extreme that the newbie goes to so
it's it's really radical up in - or the idea
where I mean the point where you can take an
idea and entertain it honestly without criticism and harsh judgment
of it you can actually work on the idea in
your life you can take action on it to see
whether it has merit or not even if the idea
sounds crazy or ridiculous to you or impossible can you
do that an advanced student can also an advanced student
rejects all social norms so the things that society tells
him to do what his friends are doing you know
the idea that he has to get married or he
has to get a job or he has to live
a certain way you just reject all that stuff another
characteristic of advanced work of these me a student is
he does a lot of practice and implementation practice practice
practice he really implements the theory he takes massive action
and that action is not primarily aimed outwards but inwards
so it's massive action meditating contemplating doing shadow work introspecting
doing self inquiry you know like digging digging digging deep
inside and that's basically thousands of hours of sitting alone
by yourself on your couch something like that it's just
like you and all your inner demons and you're facing
your inner demons the newbie almost never does that which
is why he doesn't really get good growth an advanced
student also accepts that every problem is created by them
there's no shirking responsibility and pointing fingers and looking for
problems out there the problems are all inside me and
as an advanced student I'm always looking for the for
the triggers inside me creating every single problem I have
in my life for the main student there's also a
focus on truth versus goals so I'm not in to
this work for achieving goals like getting more money or
getting a great relationships the the advanced student is in
it for truth really he's after reality like he wants
to know what reality is for real through direct experience
not through hearsay not through ideas not through beliefs not
through ideologies but through direct experience he wants to embody
it he wants to embody what is true for its
own sake not as some little trick to achieve his
little petty goal of having more sex or having a
better marriage or something like that advanced students also focus
on awareness so primarily their work goes into increasing their
awareness because they recognize that thoughts and the mind is
not going to get them the really deep growth that
they want and if after that's holding them back so
also the advanced student rejects the mind there's a rejection
of mind it's like the stuff that the mind comes
up with he just throws it away it's like it's
not important it's not important let me just focus on
awareness it's not important what my mind is coming up
with because I've been living with the mind the whole
lot my whole life and mostly is God means a
lot of trouble what I need to do now as
an advanced student is to let go of the mind
and that's a tricky thing to do also in my
book at least I think the advance student needs to
have at least a couple of years of meditation under
his belt because if you don't have a couple of
years of meditation or self inquiry under your belt you
really have no experience no direct experience with advanced work
and I'm not saying that meditation is the only form
of advanced work there's lots of different forms of advanced
work and I'll share those with you in the future
as I've already done in the past but I find
that after about two years of daily daily meditation practice
you finally start to have some insights and epiphanies about
the power of awareness versus the mind or thoughts and
at that point you finally open yourself up you have
enough direct experience that now finally you can start to
take seriously some of the advanced things that are being
taught to you and since most people do not have
two years of daily meditation under their belt um some
of the things I share with you simply fall on
deaf ears again it's not a matter of willpower it's
a matter of real inner development also advanced work involves
self inquiry and questioning of the ego that's that's really
the core the core of advanced work if you want
to know like Leo what the hell is this advanced
work you're making it sound very mysterious no it's not
mysterious at all you're basically just questioning who you are
what you are and why you're motivated to do the
things you do why you create every single emotion that
you have believe it or not you do create every
emotion you have and why do you create them including
every single negative emotion you have why do you feel
the need to create them questioning that looking really deeply
into it also the advanced student rejects success and the
need to meet his needs he's not in this for
success anymore he's seen that success is hollow he recognized
he's had the Epiphany that success will never get him
to where he wants to be in life now that
doesn't mean he stopped going to work and then he
has now become a monk it doesn't mean that he
still pursues relative degrees of success but he no longer
subscribes to the newbie ideal that success is like the
end-all be-all and if I just get the success I
want then I can just retire on some tropical island
in the Bahamas and life will be peachy he's seen
through that illusion for real and he no longer really
takes the meeting of his needs to seriously maybe he
doesn't have the ideal relationship he wants maybe he's single
right now let's say but he really wants a girlfriend
but uh it's not the most burning thing on his
mind there's bigger fish to fry or maybe he's not
earning as much money as he wants yeah okay he
could go pursue more money but again he sees that
that's not really get him gonna get him where he
wants to be there's bigger fish to fry which does
not mean he doesn't pursue money at some point and
it doesn't mean he never gets a girlfriend it's just
that his priorities are different also the advanced student has
made this a lifelong commitment personal development has become a
lifelong commitment it's done now for its own sake he
wants to grow he's actually interested in transforming himself he
doesn't want surface-level solutions and as a consequence of this
he becomes quite patient with the process his expectations come
into line they become more realistic he's not after an
immediate result he's looking far down the road five ten
years down the road what all this work will produce
for him and he's excited about that also the advance
student makes serious study of personal development material not just
personal development area l-- not just psychology not just the
techniques that will help him with specific problems in his
life but a broader study he studies philosophy he studies
uh history you know he studies religion he studies spirituality
he studies science he studies logic he studies epistemology like
these kind of fields that normally a newbie would never
want to touch because they would seem too irrelevant but
to the advanced student all of that just enriches his
model of reality and all of that gives him inspiration
and gives some valuable wisdom and insights for how to
guide his life to where he wants to go an
advanced student is able to cope with simplicity problem he's
able to take very simple advice and really work hard
to implement that and to chunk it down he has
the ability to chunk down simple and abstract ideas and
actually create an action plan that he can then follow
for months and for years to embody that simplicity in
abstractness in himself the advanced student is aware that the
deepest work is the most emotionally challenging work and so
he's bitten the bullet of putting in the emotional labor
and he no longer runs away from it and in
fact when he has the most emotionally challenging days um
he's excited about that even though he's suffering through it
he's still kind of in the back of his mind
also excited by the fact that you know all this
emotional pain is experiencing is actually purifying him and moving
him exactly in the right direction that's a sign of
progress whereas to a newbie this emotional pain it's a
sign of his failure in his mind he thinks failing
a newbie thinks that when he's sitting there and meditating
and his mind is going nuts into crazy monkey mind
mode he thinks he's failing whereas the advanced student says
oh my god this is this is this is the
best opportunity for growth that I've had all month the
advanced student is really open to questioning his web of
beliefs and not just on the periphery but at the
very very core he is willing to question his beliefs
about reality life death humanity morality politics science religion spirituality
the self all this stuff is open to questioning and
in fact there's a sort of excitement about changing your
web of beliefs because the the advanced student already recognizes
that his web of beliefs is is holding him back
so much whereas the newbie doesn't recognize that yet to
the newbie his what beliefs is something that he needs
to protect and defend and lastly I would say that
the advanced student is ok with confusion and paradox when
the newbie hears something confusing or paradoxical or contradictory he
uses that as an excuse to reject it and certainly
will never take action on it he uses it to
psych himself out when the advanced student hears something confusing
or paradoxical actually what he does is he sits with
the confusion he sits with the paradox he's able to
hold it and not let it get to him and
in fact he finds a sort of like twisted pleasure
in the paradoxes of personal development these things are actually
quite delicious they're intellectually delicious if you have developed a
certain taste for them but that's an acquired taste that
you only develop when you pass through the intermediate stages
so uh that's about it those are the two characters
ages I have for you the newbie and the advanced
student now you know what they are now of course
the reality is that you know you are probably somewhere
in the middle probably somewhere intermediate or closer to the
newbie stage very very few people get up to advanced
and that's fine there's no problem with being a newbie
I'm not saying being a newbie is bad or it's
awful or that I'm condemning you for it I just
want to kind of make you aware of where you're
at and also to make you aware of where you're
going and what that's going to look like so that
you can kind of just kind of orient yourself and
have the right expectations and also maybe recognize some of
the traps that you're falling into as a newbie so
let me give you some advice specifically for newbies it's
okay to be a newbie if you're a newbie focus
on satisfying your deepest needs first that's probably what you
want to do so when I shoot a video that
tells you to detach from everything and you know go
live in the woods and focus on enlightenment that's probably
not going to jive with you not that you couldn't
do that but that you're probably not mature enough to
handle that so for you pursue some success get some
basic success in your life if you've never had success
in your life if you're a guy who's never had
sex and you're like 30 years old then you probably
want to go fix that problem rather than go living
in the woods and you know if you're a woman
who's just been getting into abusive relationship after abusive relationship
for years well you probably want to work on that
so that you can have at least one nice relationship
before you start considering my advanced ideas about enlightenment and
stuff right so yeah go create some tangible success for
yourself that's fine try to burn through some of the
needs you have if you have these deep needs you
have elite need for love and need for approval I
need to look good I need to be sexy I
need to have lots of friends you know or I
need to have lots of money burn through that if
you can just do it in a way where you
don't carried away with it and you don't get lost
and come on back once you've done fulfilling those a
bit also focus on installing habits a newbie cannot practice
some of the advanced stuff that I say because he
hasn't put into place the right habits very basic stuff
a meditation habit and exercise habit a cleaning a clean
eating habit a study habit a self inquiry habit you
know a meditator talked about meditation like a contemplation habit
a visualization habit and affirmation have you know just like
very basic things that I talked about put those into
place cut out some of the distractions and addictions in
your life like TV and social media and internet and
porn and some of this other stuff videogames so you
just you have some room to implement the more advanced
things you'll hear also be careful with advanced topics I'll
try to point out to you in the future when
I do an advanced topic that it's an advanced topic
and what that should tell you in your mind is
oh this is an advanced topic maybe this isn't something
I need to focus on implementing right now I could
listen to it and maybe all learn a few things
I'll get a preview of where I'm headed and that's
great that preview is important but let me focus on
just you know building my business or fixing my relationship
or curing my depression something a little bit more basic
like that and then I'll come back to this and
if you want skip the advanced videos altogether also be
much more open-minded especially when you're listening to advanced topics
recognize that if you're at the lower stages and you're
listening to some advanced stuff it might sound crazy to
you it might sound ridiculous to you don't be so
fast to jump to conclusions to criticize to label to
judge just recognize that your mind is doing those these
things right and there's a reason it's doing these things
also realize that this is a very deep path personal
development is a super deep path it's really a path
that takes from birth to death this is life right
here this is we're talking about how to become fully
human you see there are people alive who have spent
40 60 80 years of their life doing this I'm
not kidding in extremely hardcore ways I don't mean one
hour a day I mean like 12 hours a day
there are people like that right and it's these people
who come up with the deepest wisdom so if you
want to comprehend that deepest wisdom well don't expect to
be able to do that just as a newbie and
get excited about the advanced work the reason I like
to talk about advanced work in the midst of also
talking about newbie work is because what I find is
that really you need both why is that because as
a newbie if all you're working towards is fixing newbie
problems that's not very inspiring it's the advanced stuff that
should inspire you so I talked about advanced stuff like
enlightenment and other ideas like this because hopefully it gives
you like some real hope to work towards so that
if you're depressed right now not only are you going
to cure your depression but you're going to move to
something very very positive after that it's not very inspired
to just fix your depression and then you're just like
normal that's not very inspiring also because just because you're
doing advanced work don't think that there's not some newbie
areas in your life where you will need newbie advice
on right so I know people who are [ __
] enlightened they're enlightened but they don't know jack-shit about
business so for them they just need newbie advice about
business even though they're enlightened and you know the same
thing to go with relationships you could be enlightened and
not know anything about relationships so you're going to need
some advice about relationships or how to have sex or
you know how to go lift weight at the gym
so in practice you know it's helpful to have all
sorts of level of advice and I don't want to
just limit my advice to the most esoteric you know
mystical advice that you can get I love that stuff
and I'll be talking more about that stuff in the
future but I like regular advice too and in fact
I like the juxtaposition of both you know I like
to screw with your mind I like to release a
video about enlightenment and then the very next week I'll
release a video about how to have amazing sex or
something like that I love that because I know that
people watching the Enlightenment video will think to themselves oh
my god Leo you talked about enlightenment that was amazing
and now you're talking about sex sex is so stupid
like why are you contradicting yourself ah but see that's
not actually an advanced mindset the advanced mindset recognized that
there's no problem and to feel contradiction between talking about
enlightenment and then talking about sex there's nothing wrong with
pursuing enlightenment and also learning how to have great sex
so when I release videos like that in that kind
of order it's actually to kind of [ __ ]
with your mind and to break your expectations because a
lot of people when they talk hear me talk about
enlightenment then all the sudden they think okay so if
it means I'm pursuing enlightenment that means no more school
no more work no more business no more money no
more food no more sex none of that and no
not at all I never said that yes be detached
from all those things but being detached does not mean
that you don't partake in them not only do not
partake in them but it doesn't mean you don't master
them go master sex become a [ __ ] sex
God no problem with that as long as you're not
using that as an excuse from realizing your true nature
and mastering all the or demons that you have see
the problems usually with sex is that you get lost
in sex and then you never address your inner demons
or you get lost in a marriage and you never
address your inner demons and that's why your sex goes
bad eventually and your marriage goes bad eventually and your
business goes bad eventually so the addressing of the inner
demons is important and in fact what it does is
it frees you up to then live whatever kind of
life you want and I don't you know I'm not
even though I do talk about sometimes living in a
box as a as a hypothetical I'm not suggesting you
live your life in a cave or in a box
go out there and enjoy what life has to offer
just do it in a very conscious way do it
in a way where you can really enjoy it rather
than the way that most people do it which is
that they have amazing things around them and yet they
still can't enjoy them because they haven't mastered their mind
so yeah get excited about advance work in fact my
uh my newest material I'm gonna be talking about is
going to be some very advanced stuff you know in
a few years the [ __ ] I'm gonna be
talking about is going to seem preposterous and ridiculous to
you unless you actually grow with me are you noticing
that I'm growing my advice is changing every week I'm
growing stuff I've talked about a year ago is no
longer relevant to me or I've outgrown that stuff or
there's new insights about it right and that will continue
to happen because this is a very long and very
deep path so um take action do the homework that
you're supposed to be doing here if you do the
homework and you take action then when I talk about
the advance stuff you can actually comprehend it and it
will give you incredible value and incredible joy rather than
the way it is currently for some people where it's
like I talked about advance stuff and it only pisses
them off and it it makes them question their life
and question me and question everything and throw it all
away and go back to their miserable existence that's not
what I want I want you to grow with me
on this path I want you to be inspired by
the possibility that exists for transforming yourself as a human
being and what you can grow into so one of
the things that I'm doing with actualize that org is
not only just showing you techniques but I'm showing you
what's possible by doing it myself so the things I
talk about I actually do and I expect you to
do them too otherwise you will not understand them and
man the deepest wisdom is so incredibly joyous and in
just amazing to understand to grasp the deepest wisdom that's
possible for a human being that's that's such a remarkable
experience that um that's what this whole thing is about
that's what I want you to get to to grow
to that I don't want you to miss out on
