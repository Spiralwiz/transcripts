hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about how to understand responsibility
versus blame one of the most important principles of personal
development is this idea that you have to take 100%
responsibility for your life now I've talked about this principle
in other videos I have a really popular video a
very powerful video called how to stop being a victim
which talks a lot about this I also have a
video about how to master and control your emotions which
talks about this and I have other videos that briefly
touch on this but when I see sometimes in the
comments section is that people get confused about what this
really means what does it really mean to take 100%
responsibility for your life and doesn't this then mean that
I'm to blame for all the stuff that's going wrong
in my life that's the common objection that I hear
to this and this is such a critical topic that
I wanted to shoot a video just to clarify this
because if you're confused about what responsibility means and if
you don't actually take 100 cent responsibility for your life
then it's going to be very difficult for you to
make any kind of progress in your personal development you're
basically going to become stuck permanently you're going to become
a victim and you're going to stay a victim and
this is how people kill their personal development forever for
some people they cannot progress at all anymore because they
have just entrenched themselves in victim thinking so this is
a very important thing for you to get over if
you're suffering from this so let's talk about it when
I say that you should take one hopes that responsibility
for your life I mean a very radical thing here
I mean that you take full complete 100% responsibility for
everything that happens in your life I mean the obvious
stuff and the not so obvious stuff I mean the
stuff even that you are not necessarily causing that you're
still responsible for it and this is where people have
a problem so let me clarify what I mean here
because as soon as I say this what comes to
mind is this kind of objection but Leo what about
rape and theft and murder and I've got this toxic
relationship I've got this wife what about her am I
responsible for that or I've got this abusive husband am
I responsible for him too or I was born with
certain deficiencies maybe I was born disabled handicapped maybe I
was born in a bad country stuff like this and
people say how can you say that I'm responsible for
that you're saying that I'm to blame for getting raped
or I'm to blame for someone stealing something from me
or I'm to blame for getting abused in this relationship
this is what comes up the first really critical thing
to get across here is to make a distinction responsibility
doesn't mean that you're at fault or that you're to
blame for this situation so for example we take a
rape and we say that the person who got raped
even though she didn't want it and even though she
didn't cause it let's let's assume that she didn't cause
it in this situation that she is still responsible for
it so what could that possibly mean I'm gonna give
you my definition of what a hundred set responsibility means
here in a second but it's not about internalizing blame
the first thing you got to realize that as you
grow yourself is that this whole notion of blame and
fault that this is just a completely pointless activity there's
never any need to blame or to fault people for
stuff people or things or situations there's no need for
it really that is a lower consciousness behavior that your
ego creates and your ego creates it because it makes
you feel better what's happening here is you're creating a
distinction between good and evil it's a false distinction it's
not a real distinction is a distinction created in your
mind and this is done because it allows you to
say that well I'm the righteous one and that person
over there or that thing over here is the evil
one so it creates this separation it creates a stronger
sense of you a stronger sense of ego this is
why it's done and when you're not conscious of this
that's why it happens because this is a very low
consciousness activity as you develop yourself more as you become
more conscious as you do meditation work as you grow
yourself in other areas of your life as you understand
victim mentality then what tends to happen is that you
stop assigning blame to to anything at all because it's
a totally pointless activity and more importantly you just see
through it use that you see through the Sham of
it it really is a sham it's like a con
that you're playing on yourself when you do this good
and evil dichotomy so what then does that really mean
well first thing don't internalize the blame when I say
that you're responsible for the rape or you're responsible for
this bad thing that happened to you that doesn't mean
that now you need to go and guilt yourself make
yourself feel bad about it that's not what we're saying
what we're saying simply is what I'm going to get
to here in a second and I'm holding it off
because I want to contrast it with another definition that
I see some Eastern philosophers or mystics making for example
osho has this definition of responsibility because in the East
they're pretty big on this because this notion is kind
of central to enlightenment work central to the annotation work
so like one of the things he'll say is that
responsibility to him means response - ability it's your ability
to respond to the situation in the moment so for
example he would say that you're responsible for the rape
in the sense that now right now right this second
even though the rate let's say was five years ago
right this second you have a choice as to how
you respond to what happened five years ago some people
will choose to and moan and complain about it other
people they can take that exact same experience and transform
it in their minds into something resourceful and so they
can have a resourceful response to an otherwise evil thing
so that's responsibility and that is an important component but
I think that it's a bit of a play on
words and that's not what most of us mean when
we say responsibility so this leads me to my four-part
definition of responsibility what it really means to take a
hundred percent responsibility in your life so for me number
one it means that you first of all you recognize
that you caused a lot more of your life than
you're willing to admit you're the cause of a lot
more things than you think you are you're responsible in
this sense for a lot more things than you are
willing to admit so what would this mean well let's
say someone says Leo I'm living in a really terrible
country I don't have the opportunities that people have in
the first world country how can I start a business
how can I be successful how can I self actualize
in this third world country that I'm living in that
infrastructure that economy had a huge disadvantage and you're saying
that I'm responsible for this well look the fact is
that yes perhaps you were born in that country and
you're there now but you got to understand that you're
responsible and you're the cause of the fact that you're
staying in that country that's happening on a daily basis
you're deciding to stay in that country because you could
also decide to lead that country now you might say
well Leo I can't leave the country I don't have
the right permits or the right visas or whatever well
maybe you can't leave that country to go to the
US or maybe you can't leave that country to go
to the country of your choice but you can certainly
leave that country that's just a physical reality it's a
physical fact about yourself and your existence what country you
live in you can physically leave it no one is
really stopping you now there might be certain disadvantages maybe
there are very severe disadvantages maybe there'll be some repercussions
so punishments whatever but usually you can still need that
country if only for a week if only for a
month but technically speaking you could leave that country for
the rest of your life you want it to so
I'm not saying that there's a right or wrong here
I'm just saying that that's possible and that when you
say that well I'm not the cause of this well
actually you are the cause of it see you're not
admitting the subtle things that you're the cause of or
maybe let's say there's a woman and she comes to
me and says leo I miss really abusive relationship my
husband that I'm married to he disrespects me he physically
abuses me he is verbally abusive to me and he's
not treating me the way that I want to be
treated the way I deserve to be treated so clearly
he's doing the wrong thing here right he's the wrong
one because I mean it's not right to be physically
abusing women that's not right Society says that's wrong the
law says that's wrong and how am I responsible for
that I mean I'm like a model wife I try
to be sweet I try to be nice I do
everything I can I try to work out my problems
with him we went the therapy and nothing seems to
be helping and I'm doing everything I can in this
relationship so how can you say that I am responsible
for this well again you're not acknowledging all the little
causes that you actually are responsible for the fact is
that you can leave him right now you can just
get in your car and drive away and never see
that person again in your life that's an option for
you now whether that's a good option or not well
maybe it's not maybe you have to weigh the consequences
of what that what that choice will do to your
life but that is an option also you have to
look at the causes that led you into this relationship
how did you get into this relationship in the first
place wasn't that caused by you wasn't this entire relationship
cause and co-created by you didn't you initially go on
the date didn't you agree go on the date with
this person the first time you met him didn't you
agree to have sex with this person the first time
you had sex didn't you agree to move in together
before you got married didn't you agree to keep living
together even though you guys were having arguments and you
knew what he was kind of like after you were
living with him didn't you agree to get married to
him didn't you go through the whole engagement phase where
you could have backed out of the marriage didn't you
then finally on your wedding day say your vows and
put the wedding ring on and then after that didn't
you still keep the marriage going even though you can
get a divorce and you're telling me you're not responsible
for any of that then now is just this dysfunctional
relationship just somehow just fell in your lap it just
magically fell in your lap no that's nonsense and that's
exactly why this victim mentality is so dangerous and that's
what exactly why when you don't take a hundred set
responsibility you leave a lot of causes kind of under
the rug and what this does is it literally cages
you and you feel very constricted to confine and right
now there's literally probably over a million women in the
United States alone who can hear this thing that I'm
saying this story that I'm saying and say yes that's
me that's exactly me I've been trapped I've been trapped
for months for years I don't know what to do
and I don't know how to get out I don't
know how to break free and that's because they didn't
take responsibility now again notice this is very different than
pointing my finger at you and saying you're bad you
did something wrong here I'm not interested in whether you
did something wrong or not I'm not interested in whether
your husband is an evil or a good person it
doesn't really concern me and nor should it concern you
it doesn't matter that's an ego game it's a very
shallow low consciousness ego game which distorts and it really
diverts your attention from the thing that needs to be
fixed as long as you're playing that game nothing gets
done when you stop playing that game then you could
be very hard-nosed kind of rational about the whole thing
and you can say you know what yeah maybe I
mean some mistakes maybe some of the stuff I did
wasn't even my fault maybe this person tricked me into
getting married maybe I didn't really know what he was
like maybe I was just naive or maybe I knew
and I still went in and I made these mistakes
whatever it was it doesn't really matter but the fact
is that there was a string of my behaviors actions
and thoughts which created this situation the solution the situation
I'm in right now was created by me in fact
if I really think about it every situation in my
life that I'm in is always created by me even
though there are causes that are out of my control
just the very fact that I'm right here right now
standing here listening to this I'm co-creating this moment because
you can choose to close your eyes close your ears
walk out of the room turn your head or whatever
if you're choosing to be here you're choosing to listen
to me right now that's you actively creating your life
you have to see this you have to really see
this very important idea so the first point about responsibility
is just that you have to acknowledge all the little
causes not just the most immediate causes but all the
little causes the whole chain of causes say life is
a chain of causes from where you are now we
can track back all the causes to when you were
born and to a million years before that there's a
whole chain a convoluted complex chain of stuff happened now
not all that stuff is in your control but that
doesn't matter you're still responsible for it the next point
taking a hundred cent responsibility for me means you commit
to never blaming anyone or anything else for the stuff
that's happening in your life this is like a contract
a covenant a commitment that you make with yourself and
you make this commitment simply because you're tired of being
a victim and you never want to be a victim
again in your life and this is the solution the
solution to it is to make this commitment you could
say you know what no Leo I would rather go
and cast blame on people I would rather say those
people are evil and I'd rather say that I'm good
and those those things over they are good I'd rather
do that and continue living my miserable existence and getting
the bad results that I've been getting and I don't
want to take I don't want to make this commitment
I want to take responsibility or you can say you
know what I don't want that like why what that's
that's a stupid way to live it's really a stupid
way to live it makes no sense if I look
deep enough I can see there's just an ego game
this whole blame game nothing needs to be blamed I
don't need to get angry at anyone all I need
to do is I need to need to focus on
the right actions that I need to be taking every
single moment of my life and I'll trust that that
will fix all these problems that I have and while
there's no guarantees that it will fix those problems it's
a pretty good chance there's a pretty good chance that
you can fix a lot of your problems there so
you know it's you got a you got to cut
out this stuff where you're saying yeah if only that
one person was cut out of my life then everything
would be fine if only he did something different just
a little bit different everything would be perfect if only
she behaved in a different way if only I had
a little better education when I was growing up if
only I grew up in a better country if only
my health was a little bit better if only I
looked a little bit prettier a little more handsome if
only I was a little more muscular all right this
kind of stuff what you're doing there is you're blaming
you're blaming circumstances and people for the place that you're
at now you're not taking responsibility for all the chain
of causes that led you up to here and you're
also not taking responsibility for all the actions you could
do from this point forward to change all that because
a lot of these things can be changed now don't
get me wrong this video it's not a black-and-white video
this video is a very gray video so I'm not
saying that you can change everything about your life that's
not the case at all there's plenty of stuff you
can't change and so you might say well let's say
as an example we take some disabled kid who who
doesn't have the use of his legs from birth and
you might say well leo how's that how's that kid
responsible for that how is he going to change that
should he go now work his whole life to get
motion of his legs back when doctors tell him no
you know that's a very extreme case and in that
situation maybe you can't change it maybe he can't change
it maybe he can work his whole life and he
can't change it okay that could be the case the
first thing you gotta recognize is that that's not usually
a good representative example of how you play the victim
in situations in your life where you do play the
victim usually it's in areas where you actually do have
control more control than you think because you've ignored all
these hidden causes that you don't take responsibility for and
all and usually there's many different ways to fix your
situation but it's just that you haven't thought of them
yet you haven't reached researched them yet or you don't
want to take those actions and even with this kid
he should still take responsibility for the fact that he's
in a wheelchair he should still take responsibility first of
all because maybe there is a solution that he's currently
overlooking maybe he can get the use of his legs
back through some sort of chain of of causes but
also I'm getting to some other points here which are
which are going to answer that that objection so this
brings me to point number three which is that you
always have at least some control at least some no
matter what situation in life you find yourself in even
the most dire situation you always have at least some
control and the reason that this is true is that
at the very minimum you have control of how you
respond to the situation so you might say well Leo
what if someone kidnaps me ties me up let's just
come over the most extreme example someone kidnaps me ties
me up and locks me in solitary confinement handcuffs me
and there I am no water no food and I'm
sitting there I'm about to die in a couple of
days they lock me up I can't see anything it's
a pitch-black room so in that situation is there still
at least some control and you know granted you're very
limited in that situation but there's still control first of
all you still got a little motion even if you're
handcuffed you still got a little motion you can still
move your eyes you can still probably move your head
they're still stuck you can move so just even physically
their stuff you can do but more importantly there's your
mind and the way that you're reacting and thinking about
the situation and there you have almost unlimited control no
one can ever force you to believe or to think
something that you don't want to believe or think it's
actually interesting because actually it happens when you're unconscious if
you're sitting there watching TV or if you're growing up
you're getting indoctrinated by median society not and your parents
and all this stuff actually that is what's happening by
default but if you take conscious control of your mind
then you can decide what you want to think about
where you want to focus your attention how you want
to interpret the external circumstances which are happening around you
this is very critical people who are just starting personal
development don't realize how critical this one point is this
point about being able to control your interpretations of reality
this is huge this is everything because even though you
might say well leo you know rather than controlling interpretations
of reality why don't I just change reality into the
way that I want isn't that better like go give
me some real physical stuff I want a nice car
I want money I want a great relationship those things
I can bank on now you're talking about this silly
airy-fairy controlling your emotions controlling your thoughts like why is
this important interpretations okay maybe I can change an interpretation
but is that really meaningful it's not going to change
reality but what happens in fact is that it does
severely affect your reality it affects how you behave it
affects how you interact with the people it affects your
motivation levels it affects what you do in your life
it affects what you create what you build how you
react a situation affects your mood and your emotions and
how you feel affects your happiness level it affects all
your emotions sadness anger fear depression misery suffering loneliness all
these emotions are created through your interpretations of reality these
are not created by physical reality itself so this is
very powerful and I have a video how to control
your emotions which talks more about how these interpretations work
so I won't go to all that depth but you
have to acknowledge how powerful this thing is and finally
this brings me to point number four about what I
mean want to say take hundreds of responsibility it means
that you acknowledge that your response in the present moment
right now is the thing that matters the most see
people really get hung up on the stuff that happened
to them in the past they'll say below I was
born in a bad country but Leo my parents didn't
have money our family was poor I had some some
bad disease or some bad condition I had bad schooling
or I had this horrible relationship that I was in
and that because of this now I'm limited somehow when
you're saying all that what you're doing is you're creating
a very convenient story which relieves you of responsibility in
the present moment this is what Osho was talking about
responsibility your ability to respond right now and to now
take action or to think new thoughts or to have
a new interpretation so for example let's take that rape
example you know people will say to me well rape
how can how can you say that that the victim
needs to take responsibility for the rape that's a that's
an offensive and horrible thing to say but look it
actually is the case if you believe that you have
to account for this following scenario that one person can
get raped and then five years later that person is
still very bitter about it very angry has difficulty getting
into intimate relation chips because she's afraid and she's nervous
and she has resentment and all this illness baggage from
the past that's scenario a then scenario B you've got
the pretty much exact same person but this person and
this person went through the exact same rape experience but
this person five years from now is living it up
in a great family as a healthy relationship is doing
great financially and in other areas is emotionally healthy and
fit in in great and happy not miserable at all
and yet one person and this purple experienced the exact
same traumatic event now this this person be she has
interpreted this traumatic event in an empowering way yes it
was a bad event yes she would never want to
happen to her again yes the person who was the
perpetrator the rapist in this case should be locked up
or put in jail or you know deserve whatever punishment
he deserves under under law but right now in the
present moment she can choose how she wants to respond
and she recognizes that if I hold on to this
this incident and I keep being bitter and resentful about
it then what I'm doing is that I'm choosing a
very unrest or response in the present moment to something
that doesn't even exist anymore the rape doesn't exist anymore
it's in the past the past doesn't exist but the
present you can decide what you're doing and a lot
of people what they'll do is they'll sabotage their present
ability to decide and to act because they do all
so much on the past that they create this self-fulfilling
prophecy effect where you're so focused on the past that
it literally perpetuates into the future and this largely accounts
for the difference between these two people here that we
talked about so it's your ability to respond right now
that's the most critical thing no matter how bad your
past was and you can see examples of this you
can see celebrities and successful people who have had really
bad initial experiences in life but then went on to
succeed and the only reason that that happened was because
they actually interpreted situations in an empowering way they actually
drew strength from this and believe it or not it's
possible to draw strength from rape it's not the case
that it always makes you weaker in fact there are
women out there who have become stronger by it now
that doesn't mean that they would ever want to subject
themselves again to the same situation but I'm sure you've
had experiences in your own life which were very difficult
very trying very traumatic that you wouldn't want to happen
you again but that have made you stronger they've made
your character stronger they've toughened you up and so that's
the key there is that when you take responsibility for
the now then you're always ensuring that you're able to
pick the most resourceful response and therefore create the best
possible life that you can create this doesn't mean that
you can create any kind of life you want there
are limits there are hard limits but you can create
something much more powerful than you probably presently believe if
you really take a hundred percent responsibility for your life
so that's my suggestion to you I think you can
see all the detail in this definition there's really a
lot to be said here it's nuanced right this is
a nuanced definition we're talking about shades of grey not
black and white I think that there's this interesting kind
of paradox in personal development which is that on the
one hand simultaneously you both are the entire cause of
your entire life and you are not the cause of
it at all you both are and you're not if
right now you're very comfortable playing the victim then what
you need to do is you need to swing your
pendulum to the opposite side you need to say I
take full responsibility 100% for everything that's going to be
how you progress then actually was going to happen after
that after you do that and you move from victim
to creator in your life after a short while you're
going to get comfortable enough and you're going to say
wait a minute there's some deeper stuff here and you're
going to go research personal element even deeper maybe you
start tation if you start looking to enlightenment and what
you'll discover there is that actually you don't have as
much control as you thought and it's going to be
interesting it's going to with your mind because your ego
it likes to assume control for stuff and so at
first you're going to feel like well I've taken all
this control from my life I don't to give it
up but then actually what's going to happen you're going
to swing your pendulum backwards going to give more of
it up but you're not going to be the victim
anymore you're going to be moving actually from victim to
creator to this very advanced age called acceptance total acceptance
of legality the way it exactly is without needing to
judge it or blame it but if you're a victim
that's a far distance away so don't worry about that
right now the most productive mindset for you right now
is to assume that I caused everything literally everything the
fact that I choose to be here right now I
chose to be living in this country I chose to
be living in this state this city this house that
I'm in right now the work that I'm going to
the relationship that I'm in the family that I have
the amount of money my bank account how I look
how much hair I have how much fat I have
on me how good my teeth look all that stuff
responsible for everything I'm responsible for all of it that's
very powerful if you have the courage to accept that
you're going to feel a new sense of strength because
actually when you take responsibility for stuff this is good
this is a good thing now people sometimes say well
but I don't you know that's not my fault it's
not my fault this relationship this this family on I
man this dysfunctional family or the bad job I have
my boss that's not my fault but look it's actually
good first of all forget the fault thing that's blaming
right we already talked about blaming instead of fault or
to this or saying responsibility it is your responsibility but
this is a great thing even when something is your
fault it's still a great thing because this means that
you have the control to cheat you have a power
to change it it's not when things are your fault
you need to get yourself up in your mindsets to
the point where you're very comfortable admitting this stuff is
your fault even if it's not your fault you know
if something is not your fault instead of bickering about
and saying no no that's not my fault that's technically
not my fault what you should say is you know
what oh well I'll take responsibility for it anyways so
what even if it's not my fault I'll just assume
it's my fault that's a really healthy mindset to take
why because actually for me like I like that stuff
right I like things to be my fault because that
means that I can change it I can grow myself
over that problem if something is not my fault at
all if it's totally outside of me that's actually the
scarier thing that's scarier because then you have no control
at all but if I'm co-creating my toxic relationship and
if I'm co-creating the bad relationship I have with my
boss and if I'm responsible for the the low amount
of money my bank account and if I'm responsible for
my crooked teeth or the amount of fat I have
on my gut those are all great things yes it's
a little painful to admit at first but once you
admit it it's great because you got the sense of
relief that's like okay well then I can change it
I can I can do some stuff to actually remedy
those situations so that's where the power lies right as
soon as you project your courage as soon as you
embody your courage you make it real and you accept
this stuff then so many possibilities open for you it's
amazing taking hundred-percent responsibility this principle I think that if
you honestly really look at it then you have to
say that it's probably not totally true it's not totally
true that you literally create every single situation every single
moment in your life but I think that this is
a very healthy attitude to take at least for now
if you're at the point in your life where you're
stuck and you're not getting the results you want later
you can distance yourself from that once you outgrow it
but right now you haven't even touched it yet you
need to touch this principle first you need to swim
around inside and see how it affects the way you
live your life for me that's been very powerful at
this stage in my life now I'm actually doing some
work with meditation and enlightenment where I'm kind of letting
go of control and letting go of responsibility that's actually
a very difficult thing to do when you do it
consciously and properly when you do it unconsciously then you're
just being a victim so at this point I'm not
really suffering from any victim mindsets I was a lot
in the past I fixed a lot of those so
I'm kind of evolving but I definitely got a lot
of value out of this principle of taking harm percent
responsibility and I'm still reaping the benefits of that and
there's still areas in my life where I could be
playing a victim and I'll fix those areas by applying
this for this principle harp set responsibility because you know
what it really does for me it allows me to
see all those little hidden causes that I could change
it also allows me to create a empowering resourceful interpretation
so if I want to get better at dating and
I think that it's not my fault that I'm not
good at dating well I'll accept responsibility I'll say it
is my fault and then I'll take the burden on
myself to learn how to get better at dating and
I've done that and it's worked really well for me
and the same thing with my nutrition my fitness and
my weight level I'll take full responsibility for that even
for things that potentially are out of my control so
maybe my genetics I can't literally change my genetics maybe
it's true that I have a gene that actually predisposes
me to be more obese but you know what I'm
going to take responsibility even for that because I don't
want to miss any little chance that I have to
control this situation and when I do that I get
amazing results and I have and I'll do the same
thing with my career I'll do the same thing with
my boss I'll do the same thing with my lack
of energy in the morning when i waking up I'll
do the same thing with my bank account I'll do
the same thing with my friendships I'll do the same
thing with my hobbies and I'll do the same thing
with why's that work in the videos that I shoot
right take extra responsibilities extra extra that's what she need
to do for example I was shooting videos for a
while when I first started and I was one of
the things I was kind of annoyed by is that
YouTube has this compression algorithm so when you put a
video into YouTube it tends to kind of compress it
down and reduce the quality of that video and disappointed
me at first when I started because I'm like well
I want my videos to be as sharp as possible
but then I took responsibility for that and said you
know what now I'm going to take full responsibility like
it's my job to make my videos as sharp as
possible regardless of any compression algorithms that YouTube has I'm
going to take full responsibility and then over over the
months what I did is I started making them sharper
and sharper and sharper because I actually discovered hidden causes
of the lack of sharpness of my videos which weren't
YouTube related but see I wouldn't have seen those if
I said well it's all YouTube's fault you know them
and them did their damn algorithm and my videos would
have stayed fuzzy but I said no let me take
full responsibility and then I found a bunch of hidden
causes I upgraded my camera bought a much nicer camera
ultimately because the clarity of the videos were very important
to me so it's just like stuff like that I
want you to become more mindful of that in your
own life finding examples where you do that yourself the
reason that I like to take more responsibility than necessary
because I think that the greater danger is not that
you take too much responsibility for stuff that is not
in your control that's not really dangerous nothing happens there
the only the only thing that will happen there is
that you'll experience some emotional discomfort right you'll experience emotional
discomfort because you have to go outside yourself you have
to kind of shake free of your ego for a
little bit and take responsibility for something that potentially might
not be your fault but that's good that's healthy that's
actually good for you so nothing bad comes about but
when you understand you don't take enough responsibility well that
really creates a big problem that mean that means you're
stuck forever so if I have to choose between risking
uh not losing anything at all and getting stuck in
my life forever what do you think I'm going to
lean towards it's like it's not even it's just a
no-brainer there's no even question about which one you should
lean towards I'm gonna always swing my pendulum towards this
side of taking too much responsibility it's not a problem
if I swing it this way and I take too
little responsibility I'm stuck I never want to be stuck
never want to be stuck so I'll always swing it
this way that's the gist of it I recommend you
watch my other video about victim thinking I recommend you
watch my video about how to control and master your
emotions they will dovetail nicely with this one alright I'm
