[Music] in this episode we're gonna be talking about spiral
dynamics areas of application and you'll have to excuse me
because I still have a cold that's why I sound
kind of stuffy my nose is clogged up and I
might need to blow my nose here and there as
I'm talking so but anyways let's get right into the
topic so at this point if you've watched my mini
series my multi-part series on spiral dynamics you should have
a very good understanding of the theory of spiral dynamics
and that should help to explain a lot of stuff
to you about your own life and about society but
even though you understand that you still probably don't appreciate
the full extent of the applicability of this model and
how you can use it to solve many practical real
world problems so I want to devote an entire episode
to helping you to see the potential of this model
and just how useful it is and in how many
different areas you can apply it both in your personal
life but also if you plan to go out into
the world and have an impact on the world which
hopefully you want to have a positive impact on the
world whether you're pursuing your life purpose or you're starting
a business or you're running for some government position or
you're trying to change some social system whether in your
university or in your organization or doing some sort of
charity work all of this stuff would benefit enormous Lea
from you understanding Sproul dynamics and from all the people
in your organization understanding spiral dynamics remember fundamentally what is
spiral dynamics about it's explaining human beings values and motives
that's extremely powerful think about that what you're being given
here is a scientific model that allows you to very
accurately predict why human beings both individually and collectively behave
the way they behave and what they're gonna do next
think about how powerful that is think about what you
can use that to do how you can use that
to transform the world for the better think about how
you can use that to do your art to do
your business to improve your studies if you're a scientists
or your nikodem occur you're a researcher to be able
to know how these weird irrational complicated human beings you
know were were chaotic creatures and usually when we think
of human beings we don't think of like having clear-cut
explanations for how human beings behave and yes smile and
AMEX gives us something like that that's enormous ly powerful
especially when dealing with social issues so let's now get
into all the examples of the areas of application so
firstly education this is a huge area of application for
Spile dynamics and I put it as the first on
my list because in some sense it's perhaps the most
important it's one of those high leverage points that we
have in society if we transform our education system and
if we get our education system right both at the
elementary school level the high school level and the university
level if we if we get that right that will
allow us to transform all the other problems we have
in the world because fundamentally all of our other problems
stem from a lack of proper education but of course
if you understand Sproul dynamics you know that education is
not just one monolithic thing every stage of the spiral
every color has its own ideas and opinions and dogmas
about what it feels is the best form of Education
what education should look like so if you ask a
stage blue person what should education look like to them
it looks like religious indoctrination schools the kind of stuff
that you see in the Middle East where you send
your kid there and what they do is they they
beat him with a stick and make him memorize the
Quran every day for the next five years until he
memorizes the whole Quran right that's their form of Education
there that's a very hardcore deep blue staged approach to
education and I mean we have a lot of religious
education schools in America as well so we're not immune
to that not at all I mean Christians and evangelicals
want basically that same kind of theocratic form of Education
here in the US that stage blue then their stage
orange education which is also a lot of what modern
education is in America for example stage orange being very
kind of success oriented and this is the kind of
education where maybe you go to a trade school and
they teach you some sort of specific trade skills and
basically they train you so that you become good at
business they train you so you become good at a
particular career maybe you become a lawyer a doctor an
accountant a computer programmer some sort of physicist scientist whatever
right it's just this sort of like straightforward rationalist form
of Education and most people think that that you know
that's like the pinnacle of Education is stage Orange Education
but actually this is a very very limited form of
Education which gets you chasing materialism because basically stage orange
is a materialistic paradigm so it gets you chasing materialism
chasing money chasing business chasing success but in the end
this is all Hollow and it leads to many of
the other social problems that we have environmental problems and
so forth because our education of stage Orange Education doesn't
teach you about environmental factors doesn't teach you about systems
thinking doesn't teach you about higher spiritual pursuits doesn't teach
you how to meditate doesn't teach you about shamanism doesn't
teach you about self-actualization all these topics that actually I
thought of talks about why wasn't it taught to you
in your school because most people went to a stage
Orange school which doesn't recognize these things doesn't recognize the
value of spirituality because it confuses spirituality with stage blue
dogma or theocracy which of course you need to be
at a higher stage of development in order to see
the difference between those two during the Bush administration we
passed legislation in the u.s. called No Child Left Behind
and this was a tragic legislation because what it did
is it basically made most federal schools subject to very
strict standards of like classroom testing and so there's a
lot of standardized testing kids these days are put through
a ton of testing I remember when I finished high
school in 2003 already we had way too many standardized
tests but No Child Left Behind kicked in after that
I can only imagine how terrible it is now mostly
what our education system is now it's sort of like
a factory farming approach to educating our children the classroom
sizes are very large we're taught the exact same curriculum
to all the children there's no there's no customization given
to different types of students there's no recognition for example
that certain students need one from education while there's other
students need another form of Education right certain students are
more kinesthetic other students are more philosophical and abstract other
students are more artistic and creative and artsy craftsy other
students are more into like literature others are more into
mathematics and computer programming and you have to you have
to cake take into account for example that human beings
have different brain types which means that we're going to
resonate with different kinds of subject matters and right now
our education system doesn't take any of this into account
it's just a very cookie cutter system and it is
all about like passing achievement scores so it's like can
you read can you do math at a certain level
it's like it's it's very very rudimentary and mostly we're
training kids how to pass tests how to get good
at answering multiple choices and guess the right answers rather
than actually educating them for like deep understanding of what
reality is and what life is and how life works
and that's exactly what you would expect with the very
mechanical sort of materialistic approach of stage orange but this
is this is problematic because later in life what this
leads to is this leads to a very materialistic form
of living where the student can't really be connected to
life can't really be passionate about things because they weren't
taught how to be passionate they weren't taught how to
find their life purpose they weren't taught the importance of
life purpose they weren't taught the importance of meditation they
weren't taught the importance of holistic health because stage orange
doesn't understand these things yet so then you get to
stay at Green Education which was one step better and
and here they might start teaching you a little bit
more about health a little bit more about sex and
love and relationships and a little bit more about the
environment and a little bit more about ecology and the
sorts of stuff and this is mostly what a lot
of universities teach these days and even so there's still
a big backlash right now happening from various folks against
stage green universities because they want them to be more
stage Orange rather than green and this is the whole
Jordan Peterson stick that he's all about is he thinks
the universities are too green which of course is the
opposite of the problem yes universities are green but the
solution is not to drag them back down to orange
and blue but to evolve them up to yellow so
what would a stage yellow approach to education look like
it would acknowledge for the first time that different students
in different parts of the world and in different parts
of the country are all at their own levels of
the spiral so maybe for example what happened is you
enter a university and they would give you a test
but this wouldn't be a test for you to to
do some multiple-choice you know passing some sort of government
standards this would be a test to determine where you
are at the spiral and then whether you're blue or
orange or green or yellow or whatever and then they
would recommend a curriculum that's gonna be right for you
let's say you're at stage blue if you're at stage
blue and you enter University then you go into the
stage blue program the stage blue program is not just
gonna feed you stage blue propaganda the stage blue program
is gonna be designed in such a way that it
evolves you up to orange and then from orange to
green and above if you're a student who enters at
stage orange there's gonna be a separate track for you
which helps to evolve you into stage green and if
you're a student who enters at green there's gonna be
a separate track for you that involves you to yellow
so this would be a Tier two approach to education
this would be an understanding of the entire spiral seeing
that education needs to be different for every stage of
the spiral different ideas need to be taught different techniques
need to be used and if you're designing education from
a stage or a yellow perspective and you're designing it
such that you're helping everybody evolve up the spiral at
their own pace you see part of the problem with
stage green education is that they try to push stage
green on everybody below them and that tends to not
work and actually creates that sort of jordan peterson ego
backlash reaction which is what you're seeing when stage blue
and orange encounter stage green they tend to not want
to evolve up to green that's because green isn't properly
explaining the situation to them it's not properly designed yet
Sejal a stage yellow could be much better at doing
that also if we're talking about education all over the
world it's very important that when we're talking about underdeveloped
countries like in the Middle East in Africa in South
America and other places that you you need to take
into account their level of the spiral and a lot
of those countries they're people are at stage purple or
red or blue like very very low on the spiral
and so we need to tailor the education programs to
work for those stages of the spiral a common mistake
is that educators from the US who are mostly a
stage green will try to go to Africa and take
teach stage green ideas to maybe some kids kids in
rural Africa who aren't like stage purple and it just
it's a complete disconnect it's not gonna work you can
also think about if you're a teacher within education if
you're a professor or a high school teacher or even
an elementary school teacher you can think about how you
might expose your students to spiral dynamics that would be
a stage yellow approach you can also think about how
to make yourself a better teacher by learning smile dynamics
and also tailoring your own curriculum to different students even
if you don't make them take various kinds of assessments
to officially discover what color of the stage they're at
you can still use Farley names as a model just
to help you get a little sense of like well
that kid is maybe stage blue his parents are very
blue that kids very green that kids very orange and
you're not doing this to judge them or to pigeonhole
them but you're doing this in your own mind to
help you understand what does that student need to evolve
up to the next level and how can I help
him to evolve up the next level so for example
you can do this as an elementary school teacher starting
with first grade you don't even need to tell the
kids that you're teaching about Spile dynamics all of that
can be just happening under the surface you know that
you you're using this model but they won't know but
the way in which you're teaching the way in which
you're communicating to them the way in which you're explaining
something to some kid who doesn't understand is informed by
your understanding of Sproul dynamics and of course the same
thing with in university and of course by understanding that
the higher you are up the spiral the better you
will be able to deal with kids and students that
are lower on the Spile than you so right now
if you're a stage green teacher you probably struggle teaching
stage blue students whereas if you rent stage yellow you
evolved yourself up to yellow and you understood the spiral
more then you could deal more effectively with stage blue
students and really any students on the spiral so there's
a lot that can be applied to education and I'm
really just scratching the tip of the iceberg if you're
really serious about transforming our education system if you're serious
about being a great teacher if you're seeing serious about
running a great university SpA dynamics is absolutely essential for
you to understand and if you're a government official who
intends to pass legislation to improve education throughout the country
it's even more important because part of the problem is
that the legislation that's being passed is always being passed
at whatever stage of the spiral the politician is at
and because most of our politicians are stage blue or
orange a little bit of green but not really much
beyond that they tend to pass that kind of legislation
so they tend to look at our education system in
the US for example and tend to come up with
solutions which are not really effective at educating people it's
more about putting them through tests or putting them into
the various religious indoctrination programs or you know stuff like
that without really getting to the heart of what is
necessary to educate people and the only way you're gonna
really understand that is by ascending to stage yellow and
and above for example if you really want to transform
education system and this will happen in the next couple
hundred years is we would start teaching children from first
grade about meditation mindfulness yoga holistic health enlightenment non-duality spirituality
not religion but spirituality and other personal development topics that
I talk about with actualize I don't work basically if
we took the entire actualised or a curriculum and we
started teaching that from first grade all the way through
twelfth grade we de-emphasized subjects like history mathematics and whatever
else they teach these subjects are important we still need
to teach them but they are not nearly as important
for living a good life as the subject that I
just earlier mentioned earlier and so really what we need
to do is we need to radically change our system
such that we're not teaching kids some standardized curriculum of
math English and history which is mostly what the first
12 grades are but we rather teaching them wisdom we're
teaching them how to be good human beings we're teaching
them how to be conscious of their body and their
mind we're teaching them how to understand ideology epistemology metaphysics
he's very fun too mental topics so that when a
student graduates tell 10th grade he has fully mastered everything
that I talk about with actualized org all of the
topics that are necessary for finding your life purpose for
living a passionate life for dealing with emotional issues like
depression or suicidal thoughts or ego backlashes or fear and
anger and anxiety and addiction like students will know how
to solve all those problems on their own by the
time they graduate 12th grade and then if they need
mathematics and history and and sciences this kind of stuff
they can get that in higher education if they really
you know if they really want to become scientists and
mathematicians professionally speaking but most people are not going to
be professional mathematicians or scientists so they don't need that
much technical training you don't need 12 years of mathematics
for the average person it's complete waste it's overkill what
the average person needs is an understanding of practical psychology
they need an understanding of how to manage their relationships
consciously they need an understanding of what happiness is and
what are the proper ways of pursuing happiness and what
are the improper ways of pursuing happiness they need some
spiritual techniques some very practical techniques like various kinds of
meditation or self inquiry or yoga that they can just
like do for the rest of their life that they
were taught when they were young so that they can
rely on those techniques to further build their level of
consciousness so just imagine what a world would look like
if we had that kind of education system in place
right now that would be a very different world that
would change everything that would trickle down into all the
other areas in society that we have problems in this
would eliminate the drug problem eliminate the opioid problem eliminate
the gun problem eliminate political corruption problems eliminate economic problems
eliminate people who hate their careers because they weren't find
a good career eliminate poverty issues eliminate business corruption issues
reduce stress on the on the prison system and the
legal justice system right because all of these other problems
basically stem from a lack of proper training in education
but it'll take us hundreds of years to evolve up
to that kind of level of education there's enormous resistance
and inertia within the education system because the ego knows
that if the education system was properly reformed then all
of the egos games would be up see so of
course stage blue and stage orange and sage green are
gonna fight like hell to make sure that stage yellow
education system has never put in place because that's what
every stage in Tier one basically does it thinks it's
the best it thinks it knows best and it wants
to teach everybody its own stage and it wants to
demonize all the other stages it's only a stage yellow
that you transcend that so that was just education what
about healthcare and medicine right now in the United States
we have a terrible stage Orange health care and medicine
system where health care and medicine is done mostly for
profit the way health care and medicine is taught in
universities is also in a very mechanical materialistic fashion such
that a lot of holistic healing modalities are ignored the
spiritual and psychological aspects of health are completely ignored your
insurance company for example won't even pay for life coaching
or for certain kinds of therapies for psychotherapy for other
kinds of when we might call New Age healing modalities
which are very very effective like perhaps like acupuncture chiropractor
services or even more weird services like various kinds of
psychic healings that you can get and stuff like that
like none of that covered by the mainstream healthcare and
medicine system because it's not recognized as being legitimate or
valid because stage Orange is very materialistic and so our
healthcare system is just like our education system where it's
basically like factory farming where you just kind of put
a sick human being through the system you set him
to a doctor the doctor goes through the checklist of
you know what he was taught to go through and
then he prescribes pills and medications because that's all he's
been told to prescribe that's what he's been indoctrinated with
in his medical training is that hey if a person
has this problem then you just prescribe this pill and
of course the pharmaceutical industry is is making sure that
death system stays that way because they they bribed the
education system and they bribe all the doctors with good
paychecks and good bonuses and incentives just to keep prescribing
the medication and then of course what kind of medicine
and health care is advertised all over the TV it's
materialistic medicine which doesn't address any of the root issues
it just is like a band-aid on a wound so
very few health care professionals in the US whether they're
surgeons doctors people who are trying to help you to
lose weight or even mental health care professionals like psychotherapists
almost none of them have a deep understanding of what
human illness stems from from the incorrect psychology none of
them have a spiritual dimension to health care into medicine
which is one of the most important dimensions they just
try to quickly treat a surface symptom rather than helping
you to address the root cause and oftentimes this only
makes the problem worse not better so what - stage
green or stage yellow health care system look like very
different first of all it wouldn't be done so much
for profit there would be a lot better ethics in
the health care and medicine system also it would open
itself up to new modalities the new age modalities modalities
that are not as hard-nosed scientific as we insist on
right now it would open up to modalities from shamanism
and from other parts of the world we would look
for example at how to how do they do health
care in Japan how do they do health care in
South America how did the shamans do health care in
little tribal villages how do they how do they stay
thin in tribal cultures they don't have an obesity problem
in many cases how do they do that yeah so
we would look at all this stuff how do we
use herbs and other kind of natural supplements not just
pills but you know a lot of supplements are more
effective than pills but of course this is not recognized
by many doctors and by the big pharma industry we
might also start to think very differently about psychedelics how
can we use psychedelics as medicine and right now there's
some really good research that's happening in the last 10
years where they will probably soon be legalizing things like
mushrooms and MDMA and LSD for for clinical therapeutic uses
because they're so effective at treating depression they're effective at
treating PTSD they're effective at helping people cope with with
end-of-life problems and so many other things you know so
this is this is all starting to it's it's it's
starting to come on board but it's still we're like
really in the early phases and so if you're a
doctor and your passion about healing people and hell you
know if you have been passionate about being a doctor
that's why ultimately you didn't become a doctor to enter
some kind of bureaucratic hospital system or the health insurance
industry you became a doctor because you wanted to heal
people so that's what you got to focus on as
a doctor and then your your question should be well
if I want to heal people what are all the
the most effective ways at healing people let me go
and explore and research all the different modalities that are
available all around the world throughout all of human history
find the best ones experiment within myself and really be
able to help heal people not just heal them physically
but also help peel them psychologically help heal them spiritually
recognizing that there's a deep connection between our physical ailments
our psychological illnesses and our spiritual disconnection from the truth
and so by taking this more holistic approach incorporating all
of these elements together that's how you can really become
an amazing healer but then of course you got to
ask yourself but there's this giant bureaucracy of the insurance
industry in the hospital system and all of this the
education system for medicine how do we transform those systems
such that they acknowledge all of these multiple dimensions of
Health that's gonna take a lot of work you know
if you're serious about being a good healer then that's
your job is to figure out solutions to those problems
and to help to reform these systems and to advance
us to the next stage of healthcare and medicine from
orange to green and then from green to yellow and
beyond and you see that means going way beyond your
traditional training so if you did eight years of medical
school or ten years or whatever it is that's just
really the beginning now you need to do another ten
years into holistic health and then you also gotta experiment
with yourself and see how this stuff works on you
so it's not just about running clinical studies on rats
and monkeys in in a cage you got to also
understand that for you as a healthcare provider to be
a good healer you need to yourself go on a
spiritual journey to heal yourself mentally physically psychologically spiritually and
only then will you able to really be will you
really be able to help others so so you can
see just by understanding spiral dynamics you start to see
that someone who wants to be a healer or a
doctor who understands for all dynamics it's gonna be a
totally different healer or doctor than someone who doesn't who
just goes through the motions of going through the standard
bureaucratic system you see there's gonna be two very different
doctors and this one is going to be 10 times
more effective at healing people than this one is the
next area of application is helping underdeveloped countries like the
Middle East and Africa there are a lot of countries
in the world which have all sorts of problems problems
with infrastructure problems with disease problems with poverty problems with
AIDS problems with their political systems problems with genocide and
ethnic cleansing and warfare problems with just not enough clean
water you know and there are a lot of nonprofit
and charity organizations organizations in the US and in developed
countries that are trying to help raise the Middle East
and helped to raise Africa for example of the Bill
Gates Foundation is helping in Africa with various vaccines and
so forth and there's many of these kinds of foundations
the problem though is that unless they take a spiral
approach to addressing these problems then you can pour billions
and billions and hundreds of billions of dollars into these
countries without getting much return on your investment and especially
when we're talking about dealing with the various political problems
that exist in these societies what we're talking about is
political problems that stem from a low level of development
on the spiral so perhaps the most obvious recent example
of this sort of blunder of not approaching underdeveloped countries
from a smile perspective is what happens in the Middle
East so the United States decides to invade Iraq thinking
that by invading Iraq we're gonna liberate the Iraqi people
from Saddam Hussein is terrible dictator except what's not understood
is that Iraq is at a stage purple stage red
level of spiral development which means that you cannot install
democracy in Iraq just by deposing Saddam Hussein because in
a stage red society was gonna happen is that you
install democracy but the people there are not at a
level of development where they can where they can buy
into democracy see the majority of Iraqis are like a
stage red maybe even lower so what they need is
they need a strong leader and that's what Saddam Hussein
was was he was he violent and bloodthirsty of course
he was that's part of what it takes to be
a successful leader at stage red because he has other
people there who are gonna overpower him if he's not
like that so what a lot of people in the
democratic countries and I easily assume is that hey all
we got to do is we just gotta like depose
the dictators and we just kind of like distribute democracy
and it's all it's all just gonna work out no
it won't because first what you need to do is
you need to raise the level of development and consciousness
of the entire population including all the poor and sick
people all the business people all the religious clerics and
leaders you'd have to transform all of that which is
going to take you hundreds of years of of education
and and work to do that you need to build
up various kinds of social and political infrastructure which don't
exist there for example there is kinds of judicial systems
legal systems you need a constitution you need like all
these things need to be put into place you need
to install secularism first because after stage red comes stage
blue stage blue is theocracy so if you give a
democracy to a stage red slash blue Middle Eastern country
what's gonna happen is they're gonna create a theocracy out
of that and then the religious might majority there who's
gonna be running the theocracy is going to persecute and
ethnically cleanse the religious minorities because stage blue doesn't acknowledge
yet the validity of minority opinions and perspectives that only
comes at stage Orange and above and really a stage
green see so if our you know if our military
leaders and political thinkers understood Spile dynamics they would have
a very different approach to all sorts of geopolitical issues
around the world also of course if they weren't just
coming from a stage orange perspective where they were doing
all of this out of personal greed and personal gain
by benefiting the military-industrial complex and so forth you know
if they themselves were leading from a stage yellow perspective
where they were actually trying to help these countries and
not just to exploit them for oil or to exploit
them for various kinds of military contracts and so forth
that would be a very different way to run the
government and of course the problem is is that the
United States leadership is not at stage yellow yet so
the reason we're up in the Middle East is because
we ourselves are not developed enough yet so the irony
is that even though we as the United States like
to criticize the Middle East for being so underdeveloped we
ourselves are not developed enough yet in order to really
be able to help the Middle East properly and if
you think about problems like the israeli-palestinian conflict everything I've
been saying applies to that problem as well if you
really want to solve that problem what you do is
take a spiral approach and that's actually exactly what dawn
Beck has done Don Beck was one of the developers
of aisle dynamics he actually has spent years in the
Middle East working specifically on applying Spile dynamics to resolve
the israeli-palestinian conflict and it's really illuminating to read about
his work and his efforts in doing that and how
much success he's had in doing that of course not
total success because the problem there is it is very
complicated and part of the problem is that the US
leadership isn't acknowledging spiral dynamics isn't really applying Sproul dynamics
to to the israeli-palestinian conflict because there's a there's various
kinds of self interest and self dealing going on there
they're not really taking an objective approach to the situation
but if you really wanted to take an objective approach
and to resolve that situation then you would study Sproul
dynamics and you would follow the work of Don Beck
and kind of take what he's been doing and just
amplify that up the problem is that it's difficult for
him to get enough funding in order to really do
his work there and to have a big impact but
I'll actually post a book on my book list in
the future which explains all of the intricacies of how
he was applying Spile dynamics in the Middle East to
help resolve that particular problem and what that ultimately involves
just in a nutshell because it's very complicated but in
a nutshell what it involves is you have to recognize
that in the Middle East with the Palestinians and the
Israelis Israeli society has multiple strata of people at different
development levels so you've got Israelis at blue you've got
Israelis at orange you've got Israelis at Green the Palestinians
are less developed and you've got Palestinians at red you've
got Palestinians even at purple you've got Palestinians at blue
you've got Palestinians at Orange and you've got some Palestinians
at Green and so what needs to happen is you
got a tea Sproul endemics to all these different stages
and help them to understand that that this problem in
in Israel and Palestine it's not just about yes Israel
or no Palestine or vice-versa it's not just a simple
kind of black and white good versus bad who's gonna
win us or them that can't possibly be resolved what
needs to be understood is that society is complex both
of these societies are very complex and that there's different
kinds of sources and motivations and value systems that work
which are making it very difficult to reconcile what's going
on there because what's happened is the lower stages those
segments of society which are at purple or red or
blue what they're doing is they're radicalizing the political discussion
and their radicalizing to higher stages like orange and green
and making everybody kind of ultra nationalistic and fighting only
for their side and unwilling to see that they need
to come together and to understand that there's kind of
a Spile at work and that really there's more common
factors between the Palestinians and Israelis than just their religious
differences or their geopolitical self interests but it's really they're
they're both evolving up the spiral but just at different
rates and in different ways and if they understood that
better than this situation could be resolved but the problem
of course is that for every one person who's trying
to explain the spiral to people and by explaining the
smile that helps to de radicalize people there's a hundred
others who are themselves radicals and ideologues who are trying
to do the exact opposite thing which is they're trying
to radicalize people and polarize them for their side and
so what we need is we need more people teaching
sprawl dynamics in a non-judgmental non condemning sort of way
and that leads to depolarization and ultimately de-escalation because before
you can get political violence first what needs to happen
is you need to ideologically radicalize people and usually the
ones who get ideologically Radl radicalized are the poorest the
ones who are the lowest on the spiral the ones
who have the least to lose because you know if
you're living in the Middle East and you've lost your
family to some drone strike and you don't have any
good job prospects and mmm the economy is doing bad
and then you're listening to your religious cleric who's a
radical who's radicalizing you about you know how evil the
other side is who has caused all these problems for
you scapegoating some other group of people then what are
you gonna do I mean you're gonna just you're gonna
accept that as a dogma as an ideology you're gonna
get radicalized and polarized and then you're gonna go and
you're gonna commit vile also understanding for example that if
we want to solve terrorism in the Middle East that's
not gonna happen through military combat a much better approach
would be through funding education programs funding healthcare genuinely helping
their economy not just trying to leech off their oil
supplies but actually helping their economy get off its feet
or get on its feet rather through these kinds of
efforts by actually improving the quality of their society by
helping to meet their basic needs that's gonna help to
evolve them up the spiral and in this way people
will stop wanting to be terrorists they're only terrorists really
because their societies is such a low level of development
it has nothing to do with Islam per se it
has nothing to do with with religion and that's another
very useful thing that Sproul dynamics will show you if
you really study this model because a lot of people
even in the US there's a lot of intelligent people
here who tend to blame Islam or to blame religion
for the problems that are happening in the Middle East
when really that's not what the issue is the issue
is their level of spiral development when you understand the
spiral and all the stages then you understand that Islam
can exist at stage red which is a very violent
power-hungry version it can exist at stage blue which is
a little bit more peaceful but still very dominant and
theocratic it can exist that stage Orange which will be
very materialistic and business oriented it can exist at stage
green it could even exist at yellow and even at
turquoise but see most people they think of Islam is
just one monolithic thing and then they have an opinion
about it like oh it's bad or oh it's good
without having a more nuanced understanding of like no there's
different levels of Islam certain levels of Islam are very
aggressive and repressive and other levels of Islam can be
very advanced and very beneficial so what the middle-east needs
is not to eradicate Islam in fact if you try
to do that you're actually just gonna provoke an ego
backlash from the Middle East and they're gonna hate you
because you're taking away something that's so so cherished by
them it would be like taking away your business or
taking away your Constitution or taking away your gun rights
right you don't want you don't like that as an
American if we try to do that so that's the
same thing as I can try and take away Islam
from some Middle Eastern person it's gonna backfire on you
instead a much smarter approach would be understand that know
there's there's healthy forms of Islam unless helped to evolve
them and to see the differences between the unhealthy versions
and the healthy versions and then you know once we
get them to that level then they will be ready
to move to more secular worldviews and then beyond that
there will be even higher more spiritual world views but
of course to take that approach we ourselves as Americans
would have to be evolved enough to be able to
understand that there's there's validity within all the different religious
traditions we can't just dismiss them all as childish nonsense
because there is something valuable within these religious traditions and
that's why people cling to them so adamantly because there
is something of value there which means that you can't
just throw them away because you'd be throwing the baby
away with the bathwater and they're not gonna let you
do that see but good luck explaining that to an
atheist because the stage orange atheist won't understand that because
to him his worldview says that all religion is just
childish nonsense and there's no validity to it whatsoever it's
completely unscientific and it's just mythology and just complete superstition
and gibberish so if you take that approach then you're
never gonna really be able to resolve the Middle East
issues you're gonna turn into some sort of Sam Harris
type of person who just points his finger at Middle
Easterners without really contributing to a to kind of like
a broadening of perspective and helping us understand each other
so a lot of these problems that happen around the
world in geopolitical problems are simply due to lack of
understanding each other lack of seeing through other people's eyes
lack of being able to take higher and higher perspectives
and that's all that spiral dynamics is basically about is
about how to take higher and higher perspectives that's what
moves you up the spiral so by being able to
take more perspectives yourself you will be less judgmental and
you will be able to help other people take more
perspectives as well which will help to reduce violence and
misunderstanding and animosity and racism and hatred and genocide and
all that kind of stuff that we don't like but
it starts with you you got to sort that out
first for yourself then you can help others otherwise what
you're gonna do is you're gonna turn into a devil
yourself and you're gonna be polarizing people against other people
which is exactly what someone like Sam Harris or Jordan
Peterson does is watch what and why I'm so critical
of them is because they're contributing to polarization but of
course I also understand that they can't help it it's
just happening out of ignorance the level of development at
they're at they can't do better in the same way
that a terrorist the level of development of terrorists is
at he can't do any better that's how ignorance works
so so on the one hand I can criticize them
but but also on the other hand I understand why
they're at where they're at and why they're having the
ego reaction that they're having see so it's that kind
of understanding that you only get a stage yellow and
above all so another area of application is with economics
economics is a super important field I actually have a
whole book that I'm reading about spiral dynamics and economics
how to take a spiral approach stage yellow approach to
economics right now especially in the US and basically all
around the world our economic system is stage Orange it's
very capitalistic it's all about maximizing profits that's that's mostly
what Wall Street's doing that's what the stock markets are
doing all around the world that's what most corporations are
doing uh-huh they're just spreading themselves like a cancer these
corporations have no ecological awareness they don't recognize workers rights
they don't recognize the importance of unions they don't recognize
hmm the damage that their marketing and advertising has on
the world they're just going purely for maximum profits that's
what big farmers doing that's what Big Oil is doing
that's what the fast-food industry is doing that's what the
entire food industry basically is doing that's what I mean
most businesses a lot of the a lot of the
Silicon Valley tech businesses are also falling into this trap
right now Facebook Apple Google these companies especially Google for
example is a bit more of a stage green company
but still a lot of stage orange is running the
show that's why you see all these legal battles between
these big companies over patents and all sorts of stuff
so we have a very very stage orange economic system
and there's an enormous resistance right now to stage green
economic systems which would look more socialistic which doesn't necessarily
mean socialism I just mean they look more socialistic they
have more socialist elements in them they are more concerned
about equal distribution of of resources more progressive taxation scales
and holding corporations more to account higher wages for employees
more say that employees have in how the organization is
run so that these these organizations and corporations are not
functioning like like dictatorships which a lot of them are
where the boss the top tells all the employees what
to do but it's more of a cooperative corporation where
the employees have more of a stake they have more
of a say there's sort of a representative corporate board
and all of that and the corporation is not just
pursuing maximum but the corporation is conscious about it's an
impact on the economy on the ecology on the environment
on governments like all this sorts of stuff right this
would be a huge step up if we can get
our economic system up from orange to green and that's
sort of the battle that you're seeing right now between
many progressives who want a more socialistic economic system and
then those who are sort of the die-hard capitalists and
libertarians and conservatives who are dead set against that ideologically
and so that's being hashed out right now in our
political system in America very interesting to see how this
works but there's even higher perspectives on economics than just
the green one that I was just explaining there's also
stage yellow for example and what does yellow economics look
like well that's a very technical subject I'm reading a
whole book on that I'll post that book on my
book list when I'm finished reading it so you can
read about that yourself but but just realize that again
most people when they think about economics for example they
have a very static one-stage view of economics they think
of economics is like well capitalism is good socialism is
evil or vice-versa socialism is good capitalism capitalism is evil
without recognizing that know there's there's various stages there's like
stage blue orange green and then above green and that
it's not about just imposing socialism on everybody or imposing
capitalist on everybody it's about finding the nuances in-between and
finding you know what's the right mix of various capitalistic
and socialistic policies and systems and structures such that we
maximize what what are we maximizing well that depends what
stage you're at if you're at stage Orange you're maximizing
money so of course you want capitalism at stage green
you're trying to maximize relationships and fairness and equality so
of course you're going to lean more socialistic and a
stage a stage yellow you're going to be trying to
help everybody move up the spiral so you're going to
take a very nuanced perspective a very kind of systems
thinking perspective about how do we engineer our economic systems
to make sure that we're not just having equality and
we're not just helping to eliminate poverty but we're helping
to evolve everyone up the spiral what kind of eke
an economic system would we need then C so that's
a that's a very fertile ground to mine speaking of
government in politics spotlight Amex is very helpful for evaluating
political candidates who are running for office for evaluating political
parties and for understanding the culture wars almost all political
conflicts especially those we've been seeing in the United States
recently and in Europe are perfectly explained by Sproul dynamics
in the u.s. it's basically staged blue / orange fighting
and staged green / orange and Spile endemics for example
for me has been very helpful in being able to
evaluate political candidates so when I see somebody running for
office I just ask myself well what stage are the
Spile are they at which stage is a spiral are
they trying to enable how ideological and dogmatic are they
about what stage they're at and that helps me to
evaluate how good of a candidate this would be basically
the best candidate is the one who's highest up the
spiral ideally we'd have stage yellow candidates but there's so
few of those to go around these days stage green
is is often the best you can get and even
that most people oppose vie evidently because it's it's too
high above their own current level the way the government
in politics works is that voters generally only vote for
their own stage they're not smart enough to root to
to vote for a stage above the one that they're
at so if you're at stage blue that's who you're
gonna vote for if your stage Orange you think the
perfect political candidate is the most orange guy if you're
a stage green you're gonna want the most green Bernie
Sanders type of candidate that there is so in a
sense you're very unimaginative and you're very very predictable with
your political choices whereas if you're a stage yellow you'll
be a little bit more nuanced but also there probably
won't be very many candidates that you'll like so spiral
dynamics is useful for that it's useful for evaluating political
parties for example if you don't know sprouted hammocks then
you might be tempted to do a false equivalency between
the Republican Party in the US and the Democratic Party
but if you understand spiral dynamics then you understand and
actually the Democratic Party they're not just two sides of
the same coin the Democratic Party is more cognitively and
spiritually evolved than the Republican Party that's just a fact
that you will understand if you understand sprout than damage
now you might not like that fact if you're in
the Republican Party of course you won't and that's precisely
why you won't want to spoil study spiral dynamics in
this case but you know if you're open-minded you really
care about the truth and you care about really understanding
what's going on then you will be able to see
that even though the Democratic Party has many problems it's
certainly not perfect it is certainly superior than the Republican
Party right now now that doesn't mean it's always going
to be this way you know in the next hundred
years that might change political parties are always changing but
but see without sprawl dynamics you might be tempted to
think that like wow but you know Republican or Democrat
they're kind of similar or they're just like two opposite
poles but they're not two opposite poles there's a spiral
and there's the Democrats but then the Democrats can involve
higher up the spiral as well so the Democrats are
not like the endpoint there's hired to go above the
Democrats and the Democrats have a lot of work to
do because they're really not that evolved but the Republicans
are less evolved and that's important to recognize that's important
to know see no one on TV no one who's
doing political analysis will tell you this part of the
reason why is because it's it's it's very controversial you
know good luck getting a CNN anchor like Wolf Blitzer
for example to tell you that that liberals are cognitively
more developed than conservatives and that would be extremely extremely
polarizing and radical position and if he said that he
would be called a liberal but that's not a liberal
position that's something that's coming from a deeper understanding of
spiral dynamics the culture wars if you're trying to understand
what those are about that's all about spiral dynamics stages
fighting against each other and it's very unproductive it's a
huge waste of time the culture wars distract us from
actually doing good government actually improving the systems that are
creating the results for people so by understanding the Spile
you're gonna see that this the culture wars are just
different stages judging each other and the sooner we can
transcend that the quicker we can improve our government and
the better off most of us will be there's all
sorts of other governmental problems that we face like prison
reform environmental problems civil rights issues poverty racism terrorism crime
the drug war immigration issues all of these issues are
made so much clearer if you understand spiral dynamics the
solutions to all of these problems will really only come
at stage green or yellow they will not come at
the current stage that we're at which was mostly blue
and orange approaches to many of these problems for example
when we're talking about the environment the destruction pollution of
the environment and global warming these are very serious concerns
that many people are starting to catch on to now
but still we're struggling as a society we're struggling to
really get leverage and to really start to take action
on these environmental problems why is that well if you're
stood Sproul and AMEX you would understand that's because in
order to care about the environment and to take ecological
issues seriously a person has to be at stage green
or above at stage blue the person is too preoccupied
with their dogmas and their religious traditions to care about
any kind of emerging ecological crises because those weren't present
in their traditions so of course to them it's just
a fantasy and to stay George people they're too preoccupied
with their own self-interested gaining of success pursuing personal achievement
and money and business success that they don't have time
to worry about ecological problems they don't care about looking
at how their strive for achievement and business success is
actually causing massive economic ecological problems they don't care about
that because hey me first I got to take care
of myself first before I worry about the environment before
I worry about the animals before I worry about other
people's kids drinking mmm polluted water or before I worry
about some sort of rising sea levels like to them
that doesn't compute because I stage Orange all I care
about is just advancing me and my family financially so
by understanding this we can go and we can we
can reconfigure our education system such that our education system
helps to move people up to stage green and then
once they're at Green they'll be much more environmentally conscious
and then we can actually start to take action on
the environment see then those stage green people can vote
in stage green politicians who will then also actually care
about the environment because most the politicians we have right
now they're stage orange or below so they don't care
about the environment as long as some corporation pays the
money they'll look the other way but if they were
at stage green they would be too conscious and too
developed to be able to just look the other way
so all these issues drug war immigration the solutions are
really stage Green and stage orange salute stage yellow solutions
and many of the solutions that are being proposed right
now are stage orange solutions which just won't work they're
unsustainable or even worse stage blue solutions which are regressive
and and then there's a lot of bickering back and
forth and you know when you're listening to political commentary
on the news or reading it online somewhere never are
the real solutions discussed to these issues never is the
real solution to racism or poverty or healthcare or terrorism
or crime or the drug war or immigration or the
environment ever discussed what's discussed is just the surface level
cultural war bickering back and forth the judgments that each
side throws at itself now we're at the other side
a stage yellow approach has never taken a stage yellow
approach would focus on the solutions to these problems solutions
that are grounded in in empirical data in facts in
science in various research in actual testing and trial and
error that's what we really need we need to have
more scientific approach to our government rather than sort of
this knee-jerk ideological approach which we've been taking for a
long time in the area of hmm psychotherapy coaching and
consulting spa that Amex can be very effective most coaches
and consultants and psychotherapists don't know skyline Amex so when
they give their advice where they try to guide people
or guide companies to get certain kinds of results how
helpful would it be if you understood where your client
is at like if you're a therapist or a coach
or consultants to understand that okay this CEO who I'm
coaching he's at stage orange and he's stuck at orange
and he's dealing with all the orange limitations and fears
and problems that exist and you as the coach could
be able to to point those out to him and
to to show him why he's resisting moving up to
stage green and help him to make a transition up
into green to see that Green is not as bad
as evil as he's always portrayed in his mind or
that you could see that this client here that you
have is is steep and stage Orange Norah's sorry in
stage green you have a very stage green side setup
a hippy client but you can see as your as
his coach you can see that this client's problem is
that he jumped to stage green way too early and
he didn't master stage orange yet so he has maybe
he's very spiritual and he's into yoga and all the
sorts of stuff but he hasn't really mastered his livelihood
so he has trouble keeping a job and paying the
bills and so you could help to point out to
him that hey yeah you're agreeing and that's great but
you've got more stuff at orange that you haven't fully
integrated let me help you it's a to see those
elements of orange that you've been demonizing and denying help
yourself to integrate those and then we can move you
up even beyond green to yellow or if you've got
a client that's at yellow you could help to share
with him various kinds of maybe spiritual techniques and spiritual
insights and more advanced kind of non dual teachings that
will help him to evolve up to turquoise how helpful
would that be that would completely transform your coaching practice
your therapeutic practice and if you're a therapist who's dealing
with all sorts of very dysfunctional people you might get
a person into your into your office who's like regressed
to stage red you know very very sort of primitive
narcissistic self-centered sorts of motivations and values and you as
the therapist are probably at stage green yourself so if
you're at stage green and you're trying to teach stage
green teachings to a stage red person that's going to
create such a huge disconnect for you that your therapy
will not be effective and in fact you'll burn out
because you'll be wondering why do why do all my
stage green techniques not work on this stage red person
well because they're not there yet and you as the
coach or the therapist could also tailor your communication style
to whatever level your client is at so this does
not mean that you need to give your client a
formal test when you really understand this model you'll be
able to just like look at people talk to them
for five or ten minutes and get a really good
idea of where they're at especially in a therapeutic or
coaching setting where people can be very honest about their
motivations and values you can get a very quick understanding
of what's driving the person and then once you understand
that to help to move them up the spiral you
can now communicate to them in a way that fits
with their value system so for example if I was
coaching a stage orange client who's very business oriented and
I wanted to explain to him the benefits of stage
green I wouldn't be talking to him about how oh
but if you change your business to a more stage
green business then you're gonna help save the polar bears
he doesn't give a about polar bears all right and
I understand that so what I can do is I
can I can dumb down my communication a little bit
I can say look don't build a more green business
for the polar bears build a more green business because
in five years you yourself will evolve to stage green
if right now you're gonna invest all this time and
money building a stage orange business imagine what's gonna happen
once you yourself evolve up to stage green you're gonna
have to abandon your business because all of your managers
and all of your people are gonna be stage orange
and they're all going to be money hungry chasing sex
and fast cars and success and you by that point
will be into psychedelics and spirituality and yoga and all
the sorts of stuff and your business is going to
be much lower it's gonna be dragging you down so
for your own personal development which is what say George
cares about for your own personal development as the CEO
of this orange company start thinking about how to transition
your company already into green so you don't hold yourself
back and also I would challenge you that you can
make more money building a green business than an orange
business and see to a stage orange person now that
resonates because he's still all about money so if you
can convince him or show him an opportunity for how
he could actually be on the cutting edge of his
industry by building a stage green business you could you
could that that's gonna create a bridge from orange into
green see and that's really what understanding sprawl dynamics will
allow you to do is it'll allow you to be
a great bridge builder for example to be able to
show how spirituality is not in conflict with business but
how you can actually build a business that also promotes
spiritual development of yourself and everyone around you so there
you're creating kind of a win-win scenario where as you
know if you take a stage orange person and tell
him something like hey your business is just capitalistic garbage
all you're doing is just exploiting people and you need
to quit your business and just go like go to
meditation retreats and just like smoke pot and do psychedelics
you know that's not gonna work for a stage orange
person they're not ready for that they need to evolve
to that level so to this person you might want
to frame it as look I understand that right now
you're really passionate your business and that's great and you
need to develop your business in order to kind of
you know take care of your finances take care of
your family all these are basic needs you have so
yes put that into place nothing wrong with that it's
not evil it's not bad but also start to look
towards the future because you're a person who's already into
personal development so you know you're not gonna be you're
not gonna be satisfied chasing money all the time you've
what you already got a bunch of money be honest
with yourself did it satisfy you that it make me
happy did you make you happy no so what you
really want is probably more love than money so start
to plan your business in such a way that you're
moving more towards not just earning money but also contributing
love to the world and that will actually make you
more satisfied with the money that you're earning and that
will actually make you more motivated to work harder and
then that actually help you to earn even more money
so it'll be a win-win you could frame it like
that also another area of application is with developing and
managing communities so if you ever want to be a
leader of a community whether it's gonna be an ashram
a religious community a business community a business organization a
non-profit anything like that it would really help you to
understand spiral dynamics because when you're leading people it helps
you to understand what drives and motivates the person that
you are leading or talking to or in a relationship
with or who's your business partner see and that's why
Sarala NamUs can be so valuable for business and for
management is because in business you're always making hiring decisions
firing decisions you're choosing business partners you're choosing which companies
you want to work with which kind of clients you
want to attract and all of that and how useful
would it be to have a clear picture in your
mind of like what stage of the spiral you want
your business partner to be or you want your next
hire to be that can be that can be huge
because in business when you're running a business you want
to be clear at what stage your business is at
what stage your business is targeting like your clients who's
gonna be buying your product or your service is it
going to be stage blue people orange people green people
yellow people turquoise people that makes a big difference because
that informs your entire marketing strategy if you're new to
business you might make the foolish mistake of trying to
market stage green solutions to stage orange people and then
you'll wonder why it didn't work it can be very
useful when you're starting a new business to understand spiral
dynamics to understand what level your business is at what
level you yourself are at what level your employees are
at and what level your customers are at and try
to align all of those together because look if your
customers are aged blue and your business of stage orange
and your stage green then you're gonna have chaos on
your hands it's very important when you're leading an organization
that you have a common set of values and that's
exactly what's about dynamics is about don't make the mistake
of thinking that business only happens at stage Orange business
happens at every level of the spiral their stage red
businesses that's mostly criminal enterprises and mafias and stuff like
that and there's a there's stage turquoise businesses of course
the most common businesses that all of us know our
state orange businesses these were the McDonald's is the Facebook's
is and the the Microsoft's of the world and then
you know you have a few more evolved businesses I
would put Google around stage orange half orange half green
maybe Apple is kind of half out half orange half
green and then there are some smaller businesses who are
solid orange but but you probably haven't heard of them
because they're not advertising themselves all over the place as
much as McDonald's er or Walmart or Facebook is when
you're developing your marketing strategy and you're trying to find
your niche and business it can be really useful to
understand what stage you want to target when looking for
new business opportunities if you're trying to invent a new
product or a new service it can also be extremely
useful to think about it from the perspective of okay
what stage are my at and what stage do I
want my product or service to target and also like
what are the opportunities so right now maybe you get
a sense that okay in your society right now maybe
your society is that stage blue let's say you're in
the Middle East somewhere stage blue Society okay but you
can see that your society is also evolving in that
in the next 10 or 20 years it'll start to
move a little bit more orange so you can already
look ahead and say okay so what are the opportunities
in my society for stage orange products services infrastructure that
I could create and invent and build I could be
a leader I can be at the cutting edge business
is all about being at the cutting edge or if
you're in the United States you know you want to
start to look towards the future what's coming in 10
or 20 years those business opportunities are probably gonna be
the next stage up so right now we're very orange
probably be towards green or towards yellow and you can
look at that from the perspective of like if you're
a software developer you can look at okay what are
the next stage a spinal stage of software development if
you're a filmmaker what's next spinal stages of filmmaking or
if you're a an author or you're an artist or
you're a teacher you know whatever business you're running here's
some examples of business ideas that are connected with spinal
endemics think about creating a stage yellow education platform an
online platform that serves stage yellow that could be a
multi-million dollar business in the future in the next 10
20 years I guarantee you that some smart person is
going to create a stage yellow education platform and make
millions of dollars doing this that could be you that
could be your life purpose right there or how about
creating a stage turquoise community what if you were a
visionary person who wanted to create a stage turquoise community
what would you have to do to be able to
lead such a community what kind of people would you
need to attract to sustain such a community what kind
of infrastructure would need to be developed for this community
what would a sage turquoise community even look like you
could do that you could build that and you could
earn good money doing that that could be your whole
life purpose I guarantee that over the next 20 years
there will be many new stage turquoise communities that are
started and a handful of them will fail because the
people starting them don't have a solid of grass was
feral dynamics how about as an opportunity if you're a
consultant and what you do is you help businesses transition
from stage Orange to stage green and that's like your
niche and that's your life purpose because look we've got
so many stage green stage orange businesses in the United
States for example but they're also starting to hit the
limit of where you can go with stage Orange they're
hitting various kinds of environmental limits are hitting various kinds
of limits with their employees and so forth and it's
actually starting to hurt their bottom line and also the
leaders who are leading these these businesses they want to
go themselves evolve beyond orange into green but they don't
know how to do that what if you were a
business consultant who already went through that process learned everything
there is to know about that all the traps and
pitfalls and problems and you were able to provide specific
solutions and coaching and guidance to other entrepreneurs who are
interested in transitioning their existing orange businesses into green that
could be a very viable and successful market for you
or here's another opportunity how about creating a stage green
marketing company because there's a lot of stage orange marketing
companies out there but you know these people who are
running stage green businesses they stents they tend to start
to not like stage orange marketing anymore they want stage
green marketing which is a more soft more eco-friendly approach
to marketing it's not as cutthroat your marketing higher consciousness
products and services how do you do that there's a
whole set of challenges and problems with developing stage green
marketing and you can create a company that will help
people to do that to figure that out to offer
training or seminars or solutions for that and that can
be a very viable niche you could also earn a
lot of money millions of dollars doing this of course
you would have to train yourself to know what you're
talking about to actually offer legitimate solutions here here's another
opportunity how about you start a stage turquoise University what
would that look like a stage turquoise University it's hard
to even envision that you know because that's so advanced
you have to really jump a few steps to even
get to that but if you're a visionary ambitious person
you can already start to think about this you know
what would a stage turquoise University look like hmm what
would the curriculum be what were the textbooks look like
what kind of teachers would I hire would they be
professors or would they be shamans who would they be
would they be Indian gurus that I that I hire
from India where do I get find these people and
would this be a physical brick-and-mortar university or would it
be a digital online university maybe both or maybe one
or maybe the other you know so you can you
can figure all these things out and then you can
go and actually construct it and through trial and error
actually create it and you can have one of the
first stage turquoise universities then you get a lot of
recognition for that if you make make it successful and
you can earn good money from that and people will
come and visit you from all around the world because
there's not a lot of stage turquoise universities around the
world and think about maybe what kind of careers people
might start after they finish your university what kind of
diplomas would you offer that would be pretty cool think
about how rewarding that would be to because you would
have a university would be which would be like a
visionary University that is a hundred years ahead of its
time which is basically where all the other universities need
to go but you will be one of the first
to actually demonstrate that it works and then once you
do that you can maybe travel around the country or
around the world and write books and talk about and
help those universities who are right now sage green to
evolve more towards turquoise you might talk about what the
challenges are you might help them create a transition plan
change their curriculums change their textbooks change their funding sources
and all this kind of stuff here's another opportunity for
you if you're an artist how about you become a
stage turquoise artist most artists these days or stage orange
artists or maybe stage green but what would a stage
turquoise artist look like of course that means you yourself
would have to evolve up to stage turquoise but then
what kind of art would perpetuate and promote and aggrandize
the values of stage turquoise mmm that's very interesting there's
so many opportunities for artists when it comes to the
intersection of art and spirituality and psychology there's a lot
there because there's a lot of different types of art
we could be talking about painting sculpture filmmaking video game
making music making I mean you name it entirely new
forms of art staged turquoise values probably require a new
medium of art to be invented in order to really
express those values maybe it's not going to be through
video maybe it's not gonna be through paint maybe it's
not going to be through books maybe it's gonna be
through virtual reality or some other new technology and so
you're gonna have to find that intersection point between turquoise
values artistry and so maybe some new technology and how
do you combine all those together to create some cutting-edge
new thing here's an idea for you how about you
become a stage turquoise scientist what would that look like
a stage turquoise scientist that's really interesting if there any
of you who are scientists in the audience I challenge
you to think about that for a week try to
imagine what that might look like how different that would
be from most scientists and universities today and what kind
of breakthroughs you might make maybe you'd be studying the
mind maybe you'd be studying spirituality maybe you would be
combining those things with neuroscience or psychedelics and shamanism and
God knows what else there are so many possibilities but
also don't just limit it to spirituality turquoise is not
just spirituality in itself every field of science can be
turquoise science biology chemistry mathematics well mathematics isn't really a
science but you can think of it that way if
you want um social sciences history I don't have all
the answers here I'm just I'm giving you opportunities I'm
trying to get your mind jogging right I'm trying to
show you that there's so much stuff to mind here
if you're really interested and if you're looking for a
life purpose you're looking for something really valuable to do
that's what's brother dammuz can show you is the next
stage of the cutting edge of what mankind is gonna
be doing in the next hundred or two hundred years
it's this stuff here but it's precisely because it's so
cutting edge and new we don't even know what it
looks like yet perhaps which means that you're gonna have
to build it you have to imagine it go through
a process of trial and error and then invent it
speaking of invention how about you become a stage turquoise
inventor what might that look like or what if you
wanted to start a stage turquoise hospital what might that
look like that would be a very different Hospital than
the stage orange hospitals that we know of today think
about what kind of doctors would work there think about
what the financing and insurance system would be like in
a stage turquoise hospital think about what the funding sources
would be like think about the kind of clients you
would have it would be very different kinds of clients
your whole to healthcare would be very different at that
stage spa at Emma's can also be very useful to
help you evaluate teachers if you're watching material on YouTube
or you're listening to some guru or you're listening to
a professor at your University or you're listening to me
and you're trying to figure out who do I believe
who do I listen to who are the most advanced
teachers and which ones are the less advanced ones which
ideas and ideologies should I be taking seriously and which
ones shouldn't I be well use spiral dynamics to quickly
judge where the teacher is at what level are they
talking from what level values are they trying to promote
and that will allow you to isolate the best of
the best teachers and teachings and to ignore all the
lower ones the ones that are beneath you so to
speak also can help you to evaluate stuff that's way
way way above you that you're not at that you're
not developed to enough yet to to really make use
of so you can kind of put a pin in
that and come back to it ten years later same
thing with evaluating spiritual and religious teachings religion happens at
all stages of the spiral basically so if you really
want to understand religion you need to take a spiral
approach to that if you're evaluating books spinal enamels can
be very helpful there it can also be helpful for
evaluating media entertainment art and analysis so if you're listening
to a talking head on YouTube or on TV or
anywhere else or you're reading it in a journal somewhere
like the Wall Street Journal or New York Times you're
reading an op-ed some analysis about politics about government about
health care about universities about sexuality whatever it is some
analysis always ask yourself what stage is the analysis coming
from that's super useful to know when you're analyzing a
situation if you're in a business meeting and you're doing
analysis on some business marketing problem always ask yourself what
stage of the spiral is this analysis coming from you
can also apply Sproul dynamics within relationships sexuality and dating
for example who are you sleeping with are you sleeping
with the right type of person at your level of
the spiral or is the person that you're falling in
love with an about to marry are they too low
on the spiral for it to work if you're a
stage green woman and you're about to marry a stage
mm blue man is that really gonna be a smart
move are you gonna make that work and not just
romantic relationships think about all your relationships your friendships your
family your work relationships how useful is it to understand
the values and motives that are driving the person that
you're relating with its enormous ly useful you can use
Sproul an Amex to evaluate your friends to understand where
your friends are coming from to understand where your family
is coming from spiraling Amex will oftentimes explain why you
and your family don't get along so well or why
your friends are holding you back or why your spouse
is holding you back and that doesn't mean that you
have to just judge them for being too low too
beneath you you can actually use smilin areas to help
you to resolve the problem first of all you can
discuss and teach Spile dynamics to your friends and family
if they're open enough and patient enough to listen through
it but you could you can help to to expose
them to the spiral then you can you can help
to build bridges you can use a spiral to build
bridges between you and their value system even if their
value system is below yours less developed than yours you
can still build bridges you can still understand where they're
coming from so maybe your parents are very religious and
dogmatic and even though you're not that way you can
still understand it more from the Spile perspective and maybe
you can even learn to communicate with them in a
way where you help to move them up and open
their mind to new perspectives maybe you can frame some
of the more advanced spiritual stuff that you're learning for
me in a way that will make sense within their
traditional Muslim or Hindu or Christian context that they're used
to another way that Spile animus can be applied is
when you're thinking about the kind of environment that you
want to surround yourself with what kind of city do
you live in what kind of country do you live
in what kind of friends and people are around you
what kind of job do you have or all of
these pulling you up or pulling you down on the
spiral and how could you change your environment how could
you move to a city or a country or a
part of the world or into the kind of organization
that will actually pull you up maybe right now you're
at stage green and really what you need to evolve
higher is you need to change your environment and put
yourself in a more yellow environment so how could you
find yellow people maybe that means you have to move
to a different city because in your city there aren't
any yellow people there are no yellow organizations you're come
eunuch Asian skills can be greatly improved by understanding Spile
dynamics if you're a public speaker if like I said
you're a teacher or you're even just trying to teach
people one-on-one something to be able to communicate your ideas
clearly it helps a lot to understand the value system
of the recipient of your communication then you can tailor
your message and your ideas in such a way that
they understand it and it resonates with them and it
can motivate them spar the names can be applied to
raising children what stage of the spiral is your child
at right now and how can you communicate with him
or give him the resources the websites the books the
the videos the courses that the schooling the tutors that
he or she needs in order to evolve to the
next stage so maybe right now your child is at
orange and you want to help them to evolve to
green and then to yellow and beyond and it would
be a mistake just to overwhelm the child with a
bunch of turquoise yellow knowledge where the child isn't at
that level yet historical analysis also benefits from understanding the
spiral enormous Lee if you really want to understand history
go back through all the stuff you learned in school
about history and reevaluate it from the spiral lens look
at every war at every conflict at every political upheaval
throughout all of human history going back to the ancient
Romans and Egyptians all the way through today and just
take a look and try to analyze it from these
different colored stages and you'll be amazed to see that
most of the human conflicts and misunderstandings and disagreements were
simply a a Mis smashing between the different stages was
like a stage blue society comes into contact with stage
purple tribal people in South America and then they wiped
them out something like that or maybe it's like one
stage blue society the Europeans and another stage blue society
the the Arabians you know during the crusades they come
together and they're duking it out to major civilizations duking
it out for supremacy and you could analyze like everything
like that you can even it'll analyze individual historical people
like Abraham Lincoln or George Washington in order Richard Nixon
or Julius Caesar and you can read their biographies and
get a sense for what their value system was and
what their motives were and then match that up with
their spiral level and then see how effective were they
had how did they lead their their troops and their
and their fellow citizens how do they communicate to them
from what from what value system to what value system
and then based on that you'll see whether they were
successful or whether they were failures you can also apply
spiral dynamics to help predict future trends whether in business
or in society what's coming in the next ten twenty
fifty or a hundred years within education within healthcare within
government within politics within science within medicine with in other
countries developing countries what's happening what's happening economically what kind
of political system will we have well with spiral dynamics
you can get a pretty good idea of that you
can also get a good idea of what the obstacles
will be what the resistance will be what the ego
backlash will be if you're trying to lead stage orange
people into a stage green environment then you can already
predict using Sproul dynamics what all of their fears and
worries are going to be and you can address those
preemptively science is another area application for spell dynamics science
isn't just an orange activity science also occurred at blue
science occurred at red and even at purple there's there's
a version of science and there will be verse of
science at green yellow and turquoise and beyond so what
does that look like how do we evolve science right
now science is mired in the stage orange materials in
paradigm very very limiting for scientists if you want to
be a cutting-edge scientist you better start thinking ahead looking
to stage yellow and even turquoise really science will be
utterly transformed if it gets upgraded to stage turquoise but
this is something that one individual can't do this is
a collective effort it's going to require systemic changes in
the way that science is taught understood even what the
word science means culturally that will need to change there's
so much to say about science I'll have episodes in
the future about how science works what science is and
how to advance science into the future I already mentioned
art as an area of application let me just point
out for example like just with one subfield of art
with video games most video games these days are staged
Orange video games but if you want to be a
cutting-edge video game developer you could start thinking about how
to create staged green or yellow video games or even
turquoise and what that might that even look like what
is a stage turquoise video game honestly I don't even
know yet but I know that there's gonna be something
there just like a question mark but you need to
go and you need to explore that and you might
find some very cool stuff there and you might be
one of the first stage turquoise video game developers but
really this applies to any art any medium whether writing
moviemaking music or anything like that if you're teaching spirituality
if you want to be a spiritual teacher it's very
important you understand spiral dynamics because people will come to
you from all levels of the spiral you'll have stage
blue people coming to you for advice and stage orange
ones and green ones and yellow ones and they will
all have their own unique fears and objections and questions
and concerns depending at what stage the spiral they're at
and if you're let's say gonna be at turquoise you're
this advanced spiritual teacher and you got a stage blue
person coming to you you got to know how to
connect with that because that's many stages in between blue
and turquoise that's a big gap that you need to
bridge and if you want to be an effective spiritual
teacher you can't just be spouting the same old non-dual
stuff all the time you got to be like connecting
with with whatever level the person is at and lastly
the area of application is your life purpose if you've
taken my life purpose course and you're trying to figure
out what your life purpose is you can use smile
and AMEX to help you to find a higher life
purpose than you otherwise would I feel like a lot
of people who take life purpose course end up kind
of like setting their sights too low and they end
up having like a stage orange life purpose which is
just basically starting a business of some kind and making
it successful but like I challenge you to actually create
a stage yellow or a turquoise life purpose and just
to even spend time ruminating and imagining what that might
even look like in your particular chosen field so maybe
your life purpose is to be a great teacher or
a great speaker or a great entrepreneur well yeah it's
nice to have a life purpose of becoming a great
entrepreneur but I challenge you to become a turquoise entrepreneur
or a yellow entrepreneur that's so much more interesting than
just becoming a cookie-cutter orange entrepreneur another one of these
Silicon Valley CEO types and you will be so much
more connected with that life purpose than you will with
an orange one so whatever life purpose you have right
now let's say you took my course and you came
out with your life purpose I want you to look
at that evaluate it and ask yourself what set of
values is that life purpose serving on the spiral is
it orange green yellow or turquoise and then wherever you
peg yourself ask yourself okay how could I kick it
up another notch what would that look like what if
I had basically the same life purpose but it was
one level higher so there you go those are some
of the areas of application as you can see there's
a lot here it's exciting stuff really this whole episode
is all about opportunities opportunities for our society our opportunities
for developing countries and around the world opportunities for yourself
and your life purpose in your business so in order
to apply Spile dynamics what you need is three steps
first you must learn it and it'll take you a
good 2030 hours of studying the theory reading the books
listening to my talks about it to learn the theory
number two is that you must stop judging all the
different stages on the spiral don't get lost in the
judging and the pigeonhole pigeonhole of people but rather set
aside your biases be open to the entire spiral be
open to exploring and building bridges across the spiral and
looking at the world from different perspectives and number three
is that you got to develop yourself at least two-stage
yellow because it's only at stage yellow that now you're
at tier two and now you're really we're able to
to move up and down the spiral and see the
world from all these different perspectives and then you can
really start to apply this model to transform your life
and to transform society around you remember that of any
human invention or system you can always ask number one
which stage was it created by and number two which
stage is it enabling and also number three which stage
is it suppressing or demonizing or judging and that's a
very helpful and tool in analyzing various systems and human
creations so finally just remember that spiral dynamics is a
scientific theory it's not just something I pulled out of
my ass spider dynamics is based on real-world research all
around the world not just Western societies but all societies
various cultures across many generations we have been studying and
looking at the psychological development of human value systems and
so just like Newtonian mechanics is a scientific theory which
is effective at helping you to understand how objects move
and helping you to make predictions well likewise you can
use spiral dynamics as a scientific theory to help you
to grow yourself to architect a more functional society to
create amazing innovations to get a glimpse into what the
future is gonna hold and you can also very simply
use it to earn lots of money fame praise and
fulfillment if that's what you're after if your stage Orange
and all you care about is money fame praise and
fulfilment well this probably never is just a tool that
will enable you to do that but of course I
challenge you to use it more responsibly than that I
challenge you if you're creating a business to create a
business that is at least staged green or higher such
that your business is not just fulfilling your own personal
needs and making you rich and successful but is actually
helping to elevate all of mankind helping to raise the
consciousness of mankind in some way so that it's a
win win you're winning but also your environment is winning
as a result of your work and your business in
your life purpose alright sit I'm done here please click
that like button for me and come check out actualize
that'll work that's my website on there you will find
various exclusive resources that will open your mind further so
some of my deepest insights I post on my blog
check that out check out my life purpose course if
you haven't already check out my book list where I
will be posting some additional books on spiral dynamics applications
coming soon and come check out the forum where you
can discuss all this and lastly I'll just say this
imagine what a stage yellow society might look like spend
some time over the next week just letting your mind
wander and kind of a vision into the future what
would a stage yellow society look like and all the
different elements of society we've been talking about from health
care to education to politics to our legal system all
of that what would that look like that's a really
good exercise maybe spend a few hours actually trying to
write it out it should inspire you because what you're
looking at is you're looking at the next 200 years
of human development right there that's where we're headed whether
you like it or not we're headed there you can
help to consciously create that though you can play a
role and what role do you want to play there
are so many different roles to play there's hundreds thousands
of different roles whether you want to be a teacher
or a doctor or a lawyer or a politician or
in the military or whatever you want to do there's
a way you can do that such that you help
to advance society up to this vision of yellow wouldn't
it be cool to align your life with that such
that you're working with the larger forces of evolution because
what society is is society is much larger than you
and me no one individual is creating it no one
individual is in charge of it it really just is
an offshoot of the entire evolutionary process that has been
going on from the very beginning of this planet for
four billion years or however long the very same mechanism
that gave rise to your body and my body is
giving rise to this society that we're in but also
that very forces within you it's inside of you and
it's running your mind and you can you can channel
that force and you can use it consciously to create
for the greater good and you could enjoy that process
and you can derive deep meaning and satisfaction from doing
that rather than just working at McDonald's flipping cheeseburgers for
somebody or being a secretary doing somebody's dirty work or
working in some sort of giant Oil Company you know
making money but at the cost of harming the environment
that's not nearly as fulfilling as what I'm trying to
point you towards here so think about that let your
mind wander a bit dream a bit and then from
that is where you get the motivation and the passion
to then want to go create something amazing before you
can create something amazing you got to be able to
imagine it and it has to be able to inspire
you so whatever that means for you whether it's within
art or within business or within government or within healthcare
it doesn't matter find what that is for you and
turn that into your life purpose you
