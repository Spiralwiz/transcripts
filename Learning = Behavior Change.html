hey leo here for actualised org and in this episode
i want to show you a more effective way to
think about learning [Music] people suck at bridging the gap
between theory and practice they don't know how to take
concepts and then put them into action and that of
course is the most important part for actually getting the
results that you want to see in your life so
what I'm going to share with you today is a
very simple but also somewhat counterintuitive insight which is the
missing link which will take you from theory into application
I want to give a credit to Evan pagan and
why it would small from whom I learned this lesson
at one of their seminars so what is this important
insight well it's this it's very simple but listen close
it's this learning equals behavior change learning equals behavior change
learning equals behavior change that's it it's very simple but
it's also somewhat counterintuitive so we need to go through
this and some depth what this means is that you
haven't learned anything until your behavior has actually changed so
whatever lessons or concepts or beliefs you think you're learning
in school or here with me or after reading a
book this is not really learning it's only learning when
your behavior changes that's when learning has taken place until
then it's just mental masturbation so this is an interesting
perspective on learning what it does is sort of tightens
the reins raises the bar and sets a very strict
notion of what learning is so no longer do we
accept the following things as learning schoolwork reading lectures changing
of your beliefs these do not constitute learning and this
is tricky because you spent 12 or more years of
your schooling career and into university and what do they
teach you they taught you that learning is memorization of
facts and learning theories that's what they taught you except
after all of that how much do you really have
to show for it not much because that form of
learning you could call that learning but it's it's really
too generous of a word right we want to we
want to save this precious word called learning for when
we really make action happen in our life when we
get traction with things otherwise it just becomes intellectualization and
nowhere is this a bigger problem than when you start
to get into the more advanced stages of personal development
work I mean it's all it's a this is a
very important site for newbies but then when you start
to get into consciousness work and maybe towards moving towards
enlightenment that sort of stuff then it becomes even more
important because intellectualizing there becomes very easy and it's more
and more challenging as you get the more advanced stages
because they're more abstract it's more and more challenging to
figure out okay how do I actually start to embody
some of this stuff and not just think about it
so what I'm giving you here is a redefinition of
learning it's a application-centric definition now of course this isn't
the only definition of learning this is a perspective a
lens through which we would look but it happens to
be pretty effective especially when what you care about is
getting some stuff done so let's talk about how to
apply this there's some questions that I want to give
you which are very very effective for applying this principle
because even though it sounds very simple the reason I'm
belaboring this point is because you'll see you're not going
to get it the first time you hear it you're
gonna have to hear it multiple times and you have
to screw up applying it to learn what it really
means to learn so here's a couple of questions grab
a piece paper and write these down these are critical
so the granddaddy question that you want to keep in
the back of your pocket whenever you're in any kind
of learning situation is the following how will this information
change my behavior how will this information change my behavior
so if ever you think you learn something ask yourself
this question and if you're not clear as to how
your behavior will change that means you haven't learned anything
okay but there's also three more minor questions which are
also helpful they're helpful just for for forcing your mind
to articulate the lessons because the mind is a slippery
Beast it loves abstraction zit loves vague generalizations and as
I'll show you what some examples coming up here that's
just not going to cut it when it comes to
getting the results you want your life so the other
questions are what did I learn number one and the
follow-up question is how will my behavior change from number
one what I learned and the third question is what
did I learn about myself what did I learn about
myself and of course when you asked that question what
did I learn about myself it's also not just a
vague thing like oh I learned something about myself no
it's how will my behavior change with respect to what
I learned about myself you see that word learn we're
changing what it means here I hope you're getting the
significance of that it's a little bit weird to just
to think of it that way at first but really
what you're doing is anywhere that you're seeing the word
learn replace the word learn with behavior change got it
okay so let's give you some examples so let's say
that you're an entrepreneur and you're reading a business article
maybe some fortune 500 magazine or some Wall Street Journal
whatever and you know they have all sorts of articles
in there about how to run your business more effectively
maybe here you're reading an article about how to hire
your employees better you read it it's a great this
article is awesome it has some great insights in there
okay but what did you learn if you cannot identify
how your hiring practices will actually change from having read
this article you haven't learned anything no matter how good
you think it was or how cool some of the
concepts and ideas in it work see how about you're
watching the news maybe politics and you're noticing so stuff
in the news there's a lot of violence in the
news a lot of big events happening and maybe you
think there's some lessons to be learned there about personal
development or about humanity as a whole about our country
whatever but did you really learn anything from watching that
thing on the news not unless you have a concrete
way of it changing your behavior see no lesson was
actually learned how about the example of you fighting with
your spouse or a girlfriend boyfriend / boyfriend so in
this case you have a fight like you sometimes do
and then usually guys make up and get back together
and maybe we can save yourself oh yeah I learned
a few lessons from that fight but did you really
learn anything usually people learn some very vague lessons they
don't mean the word learn in the way that we're
talking about it here but here you're going to force
yourself to come up with some concrete ways that your
behavior will change in the future with respect to your
relationship and to your spouse see that's a very different
thing and also it's important to point out here this
other trap that exists when you're going through this process
the other trap is what I call moralization or shooting
so notice that it is not a valid lesson to
say that oh well next time I shouldn't get angry
or next time I should just be nicer or next
time I should just be more peaceful and not get
annoyed by whatever she was doing that sort of thing
see that's not you learning anything that is not behavior
change you shooting on yourself telling you what you should
and shouldn't do in the future that only makes the
problem worse you're not changing anything you're just creating a
bunch of rules in your head for how you should
behave but then of course we all know how you
should behave and how you actually behave our night and
day see so which you need is actually specific action
steps how will your behavior change how about this example
of you working on a project and the project fails
as an Avenue maybe an art project a hobby a
business project well what did you learn from that failure
did you learn anything you only learn something if you
can identify how your behavior will change in the future
with respect to new projects see that's very different than
just sitting back and saying oh well yeah you know
I should have done bad you know if I work
a little harder than uh not know it's like no
what are you actually going to do that's when learning
takes place when you get it you see when you
actually get something when you grok it as they say
something special happens in your mind when you really understand
something at a deep level it's not just an idea
it's not just I should or a little moral that
you have your behavior changes see real wisdom results in
living a certain kind of life like if you know
you really know why you should brush your teeth then
you will brush your teeth but if you're just kind
of forcing yourself and you're telling yourself you should and
you're telling yourself yeah well it would be a good
idea to and yadda yadda yadda and you know in
theory it's nice I know the theory of of why
brushing teeth is important no but you got actually get
it when you really get it then you'll do it
so if there's some area in your life where you
keep doing something but it's not working it seems like
your your wheels are spinning look into a little bit
deeper ask yourself what am I not really learning here
how am I not learning the lesson what you'll find
is that it's not enough just to know it's like
oh yeah I know it's like oh no I know
and like oh I know see when you get to
that really beep all I know that's when your behavior
starts shift but that's a tricky thing about the example
of you seeing an inspiring piece of art maybe in
a museum maybe a magazine maybe on the internet and
maybe you're an artist so you get inspired by that
sort of stuff and maybe somehow relates to your work
and you want to say oh I learned something from
that did you how is your behavior changing how about
when you learn some model like spiral dynamics I talked
about the spiral dynamics model quite a bit I have
some old episodes about that I'm not going to go
into what it is here it's basically just a model
for how human consciousness tends to evolve for individuals and
also for collective societies and organizations it's a very powerful
model and you might learn about that modeling said oh
yeah now I understand I know spiral dynamics wow that
was a great lesson but how did your behavior change
as a result if nothing you're doing in your life
is actually different after having learned spiral dynamics then you
didn't learn anything it's just an idea it's just a
nifty idea and sprout that M is actually a very
practical model you can sit down with that model you
can come up with a lot of concrete havior changes
that might result from that if you really learn Sproul
dynamics at a deep level it's going to change how
you talk how your record of people how you think
it'll change your politics it'll change how you deal with
people in agressive situations it'll change how you deal with
your boss and your co-workers at work and all sorts
of stuff like that how about you learn about epistemology
from one of my videos the pistil knowledge ease the
theory of knowledge maybe you hear me talking about webs
of belief paradigms default positions you hear me talking about
this source of stuff and it's all sounds great it
might sound very interesting in deep and profound and philosophical
maybe you like that kind of stuff but then again
did it actually change your behavior what is it that
you learned about paradigms or webs of belief that actually
has made you behave differently and behaving differently can also
mean thinking differently so it doesn't necessarily have to mean
that you have to go and and do something in
the physical world maybe it changed the way that you
read books or it changed the way that you think
about beliefs and that could be a that can be
an important behavior change maybe before you were kind of
ideological and you were really clinging to your sign beliefs
and paradigms and now you're not so sure about that
and now you're more skeptical and now you're more open-minded
and that's an important behavior change and of course that's
going to have actual consequences in the physical world too
because how you think tends to affect how you interact
with the physical world maybe you've watched some of my
recent episodes about absolute infinity and you learned about that
and you think oh wow I learned about absolute infinity
very cool very profound very mind-blowing stuff except did you
actually learn anything about absolute infinity it seems like it
did because I presented you with a bunch of facts
and interesting quotes and information and some metaphors and now
you think you know something but how has your behavior
changed for example if it's gotten you actually excited to
discover some deeper truths about reality and now because of
that you started a meditation practice which before you didn't
start because you were uninspired too then that's a lesson
you learned but did that actually happen how about when
you have a Smith school experience what did you actually
learn from your mystical experience because mystical experiences they come
they're awesome and then they go and so what what
did you learn how is the mystical experience changed your
behavior you need to be very explicit about that because
the mystical experience when it comes and then it goes
it's not necessarily going to give you a bullet point
list of how your behavior should change sometimes your behavior
naturally changes after a mystical experience but really you need
to apply some consciousness to that process and not just
hope that something happens make it happen or just a
general example for you is if you're learning about personal
development or you're learning about self actualization maybe you're new
to this channel maybe you're new to personal development as
a field and you're kind of excited by all the
possibilities here and you you'll watch some of this content
that's all amazing or you read some books all amazing
but then how has your behavior changed as a result
of that you need to be very clear otherwise you're
just going to be learning stuff and nothing's going to
happen so let me give you also some areas of
application for this technique we already alluded to a lot
of these but let's make them explicit so when you're
reading books that's an awesome place to apply these questions
and this this notion of learning equals behavior change a
lot of times you read books is just all theory
you need to be asking yourself about every insight in
the book how is it going to change my behavior
same thing when you're watching videos or listening to lectures
of any kind if you're in university and you have
a professor that you really love great but then ask
yourself everything he's saying at the end of that lecture
how is that going to change my behavior also very
importantly with workshops retreats and seminars if you're going to
those and I hope that you are whether they're solo
retreats or meditation retreats the pasta consciousness workshops whatever business
seminars relationship seminars throughout that entire seminar if your seminars
multiple days long every single day you should be asking
yourself how is my behavior going to change from what
I learned today another great place to apply this is
after any kind of big success or big failure in
your life some disaster happens or a major victory happens
in your business or in your relationship or in your
family life ask yourself what you really learned also when
you're tripping if you're psycho not and you'd like to
trip and you're using that for personal development then the
the problem with stripping is that it's very easy to
to lose sight of those lessons because when you're in
the trip it sounds it seems very awesome it seems
like you have all these experiences it basically is a
mystical experience you have all these insights but then you
come back down and what have you learned how is
your behavior going to change most people don't take that
extra step and that's why they can trip trip trip
hundreds of signs and not really grow from it you
can also apply this at the end of your day
if you want to have a journal at the end
of day you sit down answer self okay what are
the lessons from today by which of course you mean
how is your behavior can change you can also apply
this at the end of your year do a yearly
review and ask yourself okay what are the biggest lessons
from the last year by which you mean how is
my behavior can change next year same thing with the
end of projects if you're doing some kind of post
mortems post mortems are good but you also need to
make sure that your post mortems include how your behavior
is going to change you individually also if you're working
in a company then your company can apply the same
kind of process how is our behavior going to change
as a company from something that we learned from our
post mortem and of course the end of chapters in
your life you know if you probably notice that your
life has chapters there's like the education chapter you go
to college then you get out of there then maybe
you go to your professional chapter your career that my
last four five years then after that the next chapter
in your career a new chapter opens up by changing
jobs and maybe other chapter opens up when you start
to have kids or family and so forth so on
so there's these different chapters in your life at the
end of each chapter which might last anywhere from three
to ten years it's very good to do this kind
of review and ask yourself what you really learned and
how you'll act differently in the next chapter so learning
I mean using a journal I mean is a is
a very good way to really force your mind to
be concrete and specific and actually work to articulate how
your behavior is going to change the biggest challenge with
doing is in your own mind just asking these questions
of yourself is that you'll notice that your mind is
very slippery and it just it won't it won't articulate
how it'll just come up with big generalizations like oh
yeah you know this year I learned blah blah and
next year I'll just try to be a little bit
better about that you know that's not that's not learning
that's bullshitting yourself is what that is so get a
journal maybe you want to take this on as a
30 day challenge for the next 30 days use a
journal and at the end of every single day write
down all your lessons or if you're watching my content
a lot then have a journal and write down how
your behaviors can change for every single episode that you
watch and so forth alright so that's that's essentially everything
I have to say about this topic except there's one
last very important point which is that we to make
sure you actually learned what learning is and for that
I have a little pop quiz for you alright ready
got B's paper and answer the following question which is
what did you learn from this episode what did you
learn from this episode pause the video right now pause
the recording and answer that make sure you're specific about
what you learned and then come on back and we'll
see if you actually learn anything all right go alright
so I hope you did that now look at your
answer if your answer was Leo I learned that learning
equals behavior change then you failed that is not learning
that is an idea do you see the difference when
you actually that learning is behavior change then you actually
need to change your behavior in order for something to
be learned are you getting that also if your answer
was something along the lines of well Leo in the
future and you have some vague thing about how you
should learn in the future I should probably take notes
about what I'm learning that's what I learned again you
failed you didn't actually learn anything because you fail to
articulate how your behavior will actually change giving us should
is not enough here's what the right answer might have
sounded like the right answer would have been starting tomorrow
my behavior is going to change from this episode in
the following way I am going to keep a journal
of all my lessons from all the episodes that I
watch or from all the books that I read and
I'm going to have this journal I'm going to go
buy it tomorrow I'm going to put it by my
by my desk I'm going to keep it there and
at the end of the day I'm going to do
a five minute review where I sit down and I
evaluate and then I I think about how my behavior
is going to change in the future based on the
stuff that I learned through my reading or through my
schoolwork or whatever something like that would have been the
right answer that means that you actually learned what I
was trying to teach you here today you see it's
tricky it's simple it's very basic stuff but watch how
easily you forget watch what happens over the next week
you'll probably notice that you didn't actually learn this lesson
because what and as you'll watch this you'll agree with
it you'll think it's great it's cool but then a
week goes by and actually nothing has changed your behavior
hasn't changed the way you learn hasn't changed the only
way that this episode has any effect on your life
is actually if the way that you learned has changed
and that's not going to happen just by you believing
some idea or some theory see so that's pretty much
it but let me reiterate one last point which is
that this is just one perspective on learning it's not
an exclusive perspective there are other perspectives about what learning
is that are also important which I want to share
with you in the future in new episodes so it
might sound you're like well leo this this definition of
learning equals behavior change is very strict and it seems
like it excludes a lot of important stuff and maybe
you have some points to make about how theory is
actually important for you just theory and of itself or
maybe you want to talk about consciousness as a as
a mode of learning and there might be some good
points there but like I said those are different perspectives
what I'm getting here is a specific lens use this
lens for a while maybe use it for the next
month and just see how much you can get done
with it this is sort of a pragmatic perspective and
then after you've exhausted this lens and once you've got
that in your repertoire then I'll present some other perspectives
for you and then you can use those other lenses
as well and then you're going to have the full
repertoire and then you're going to be as flexible and
as effective as you can be so that's it I'm
done here please make sure to remember to click that
like button and come try actualize that org I've got
some resources there for you that you can't find anywhere
else come check out the forum come check out my
blog and posting a lot of stuff on my blog
and other stuff that I will be posting in the
future and others that just stick with me I know
that in the past month or two it might seem
like I released a lot of content that was sort
of very very very lofty sort of stuff a metaphysical
type topics like absolute infinity and like that you know
but there's still a lot of pragmatic topics that I
want to cover in the future I am still a
pragmatic guide there's still a lot of foundational stuff just
the stuff that you need to be successful the stuff
that you need to to be able to take the
theory and learn how to apply it in your life
so that personal development is actually working for you and
it's not just a philosophy so more of that is
coming don't worry don't get disheartened by the super abstract
stuff if if you have then over the last couple
months alright stay tuned you
