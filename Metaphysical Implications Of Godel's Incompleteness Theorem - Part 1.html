[Music] you I'm super super excited about this topic this
is one of my favorite topics to think about and
to talk about which is the topic of strange loops
and paradoxes because this gets to the very essence of
what reality is and I love to think about the
paradoxes that result when the mind is trying to think
about reality I've actually been wanting to shoot this episode
for over three years now about girdles and completeness theorem
but it's difficult to organize all this material takes a
lot of work to organize it in a way that's
logical and simple that can be understood by ordinary people
in a non-technical way and so that's what you're gonna
get here today I will explain girl's incompleteness theorem at
a high level without getting you bogged down into the
technicalities and the math and then the logic of it
because it's a pretty technical proof it's dozens of pages
long it's very complicated and there's no need to go
into that because what we care about here is not
the mathematics of the proof which is sound and if
you want you can go watch videos specifically about the
mathematics of the proof or you can go actually read
the proof itself there are many versions of it what
we really care about though is we care about the
metaphysical and epistemic implications of the proof and a lot
of people who are rational and scientifically minded they don't
really comprehend the ramifications and in fact many logicians today
and mathematicians today and scientists today who are working on
the cutting edge you know areas of science and quantum
mechanics and cosmology and all this sort of stuff they
still haven't really grasped the consequences the philosophical consequences of
girdles and completeness theorem because what it's easy to do
is easy to say just oh well this is just
mathematics this is just logic there are no consequences which
applied to broader domains there are no philosophical consequences but
actually there are and so that's what we're gonna focus
on here today I really want to give a call
out to Douglas Hofstadter who is influenced by thinking about
this a lot and I already called him out in
reality too strange loop by which I mean I talked
about his books I talked about the importance of his
work and his concept of the strange loop so I'll
be referring to that concept here quite heavily and I'm
not gonna go into really explaining that concept much because
I already have an episode called realities a strange loop
which explains that in great detail so go check that
out you can consider this as sort of a continuation
of that episode that's like a part two we're gonna
go into a lot more detail that I couldn't go
into there and specifically I want to talk about Douglas
Hofstadter's a brilliant book called girdle Ashur and BA or
GE B for sure this is a book that's really
popular among nerds it's a very technical book but it's
also written in a sort of poetic manner which is
quite fun and interesting it's it's very thick it's over
700 pages long it'll take you a month to go
through it it contains logical proofs and all this sort
of heavy stuff but it also talks about Zen it
talks about a sure the the painter and the the
the draw the drawings and sketches that he did and
the etchings that he did talks about BA and it
draws all these interesting interconnections between what is the mind
what is logic what are these strange loops how does
it all interconnect together so definitely go read that book
if you're really interested in what I'm talking about here
here I'm just gonna give you sort of an overview
of the issues that he taught that he touches upon
we're going to talk about the limitations of rationality and
logic we're going to talk about the profound interconnections between
logic and non duality and we're gonna get a better
understanding of what paradox is and why paradox exists and
why paradox is necessary so let me just refresh your
memory about what a strange loop is a strange loop
is this odd sort of hierarchy that goes around in
a circle such that when you move up the hierarchy
eventually you end up precisely where you began and so
the prototypical example of a strange loop would be the
Penrose triangle which interconnects to itself in the sort of
impossible seeming way and it might seem like such a
thing can only happen as an illusion inside of a
drawing or a video game or something but actually what
you'll see here which I hope to convince you of
is that these strange loops actually are very fundamental to
the very structure of reality itself everything right here that
you're seeing this is a strange loop happening to you
now you might wonder of course Leo why are you
qualified to talk about this topic are you a logician
are you a mathematician where's your PhD are you an
academic are you a professor and if not then what
gives you the right to think that you can understand
the the philosophical consequences of of these proofs well here's
the thing it's very interesting that people who are skeptics
academics and scientists and rationalists that they they love to
criticise religious people when religious people make appeals to Authority
so if you ask a religious person for example well
why do you believe in your religion and in God
and in all this other sort of sort of stuff
the person will say well it's because my Bible says
so and the Bible is the Word of God and
you will say well how do you know it's the
Word of God well because the Bible says it's the
Word of God or because my priest or my religion
tells me and my priest you know he's high up
he's the Pope up you know in the hierarchy and
so he's the authority figure he knows better than I
do and in fact maybe he has a connection to
God so he can interpret the Bible for me and
and speak the truth to me and that's how I
know that it's true that's why I believe it now
of course the rationalist will quite rightly deride the theist
in this case for making this appeal to authority because
logically we know that there's no connection between Authority and
between truth that these two things are completely independent just
because someone has Authority and credentials doesn't mean that they
really understand what they're talking about but what's really ironic
is that the rationalists and the scientists and the atheists
they make this exact same mistake when it comes to
their own positions about science and about mathematics and logic
so see here you're asking for my qualifications in my
PhD and all this in order to listen to what
I have to say but that's the exact same mistake
because what you're assuming there is that if you had
someone up here speaking to you who produced this video
for example or this lecture who had a PhD from
MIT or from Caltech that because of that you would
assume that he understands what reality is and because of
that you would assume that he understands all the philosophical
metaphysical epistemic implications of girdles and completeness theorem and that's
where you would be wrong because there you are also
making appeal to Authority just because someone has a PhD
just because someone want a Nobel Prize or is a
good scientist or a good mathematician does not mean that
they really understand the philosophical implications of a thing you
see because actually to succeed within academia that is that's
a social hierarchy that you're climbing just like a church
and scientifically minded people don't appreciate the significance of this
that you are climbing this hierarchy and to climb this
hierarchy has very little to do with truth to climb
the hierarchy that's how well you play the game that's
also how good of a technical scientist you are how
good do you do lab work how good do you
write your research papers so if you're good at doing
that you'll climb the hierarchy and you'll get to the
top and you'll have authority you'll have a PhD maybe
multiple PhDs you'll have all sorts of accreditation zand and
prizes and medals and and awards and your work will
get published and you will be this big-name celebrity scientist
maybe but does that really mean that you truly understand
the consequences of your work because see there's a big
difference between just doing technical work and having some sort
of narrow technical scientific result that's that's fine that's good
but then do you understand all the ramifications of that
for life at large and for reality as a whole
that's a totally another matter and actually what you'll find
is that the people who are really good technicians a
scientist that actually they're not that good at understanding the
full ramifications of their work because it's precisely by being
technicians and being hyper specialized and hyper focused that they
narrow their focus that they get so good at that
but then they lose sight of the bigger picture you
see so what I'm asking you here is not to
believe me but to just think through these ideas for
yourself that's where the truth comes from it doesn't come
from an authority figure it comes from you sitting down
and thinking through this stuff for yourself and it doesn't
come from believing me and in fact I don't want
you to believe me and if you're skeptical that's good
being skeptical is great I'm the biggest skeptic there ever
is and of course what I do is I apply
to a skepticism first and foremost to my own theories
and to myself and that's something you don't really see
in the videos that's something that happens deep inside of
me that's something you should also be doing deep inside
yourself thinking through all this for yourself and then you
see does it really make sense and if you follow
that sort of methodology then what she'll discover is that
a lot of people whom you might think otherwise are
these authority figures that actually they're full of and they
don't really understand the bigger picture so that's the qualifications
situation now in a sense this episode is going to
mirror the episode about quantum mechanics that I did in
that episode I talked about how there's this sort of
myth of science that goes around and all in our
culture we're how people in mainstream culture think of science
and what science is and how science works is a
very simplified idealized version of how science really works and
that in fact signs much more messy more complicated than
people think well likewise with logic and reason there is
the actual doing of logic and reason the hard-core proofs
the stuff that you can study in graduate school which
is very very different than what most people in mainstream
culture including many atheists and scientific minded people think logic
and reason are because in our mainstream culture we have
this myth of logic and reason as being the pinnacle
of discovering truth it's it's the one true way that
you know that something is true is because it's logical
and it's reasonable and that logic and reason are somehow
the antithesis of faith and belief and then if you
if you have faith or belief in something that means
it's false whereas if you have a logical proof and
you have reasons and you're rational that means that you're
on the side of truth and so what I've discovered
is I've discovered that rationalist materialists atheist skeptics scientists doctors
and professors they fall into this particular trap which is
the dogmas of Reason it turns out that rationality itself
comes with dogmas just like religion and I've identified half
a dozen or so of these dogmas these I call
the core dogmas of rationality number 1 the first Dogma
is that reason is sufficient to understand the world that
is something that rationalist just believe and take on faith
they don't prove to themselves that the whole world is
subject to their reason and that reason will be sufficient
to understand the whole world that's not proved in any
empirical way that's just assumed that's why it's a Dogma
number two it's assumed that contradiction or paradox means that
you've made an error again that's also not something that's
actually proven empirically that's something that's just assumed implicitly and
never really questioned which is why the dogma number three
it's assumed that the laws of nature are reasonable again
you didn't go out and actually investigate every single law
of nature empirically and then concluded yes they're all reasonable
that would actually be a scientific method instead what you
did is you just assume that well all the laws
of nature must be reasonable you just assume that without
actually testing your hypothesis so that's a Dogma because you
know you might go out there you might encounter a
law which turns out to be unreasonable what do you
do then are you going to admit that all the
laws of nature aren't reasonable at that point or are
you gonna stick to your guns and keep insisting that
no everything is reasonable see these things can't be taken
for granted you have to actually test all of your
dogmas all of your assumptions which even rational people forget
to do a fourth Dogma is that logical proof is
the highest standard it's just sort of implicitly assumed by
people that if you really want a lot you know
an airtight argument or you want the truth then there's
going to be a logical proof which proves it to
you and if you have this logical proof then anything
else is below that and that's the enter that we
should aspire to and that if you can't meet that
standard then you really don't have anything solid you're just
speculating you're just doing philosophy or it's just some religious
mumbo-jumbo or it's just some new-age wishful thinking if you
can't logically prove it number five is that logic ality
is equal to deep understanding of a topic dogma number
six is that rationality is self-consistent which of course it
actually turns out not to be which is where girls
incompleteness theorem comes in and we'll get into all those
dirty details in a few minutes dogma number seven if
a thing is irrational then it must be false dogma
number eight is that science and math is rational whereas
religion is irrational and therefore what is true and what
is false this is just assumed it's never tested it's
never put to the test no rational person actually goes
and bothers to study and seriously practice every single religion
in the world to test whether they're actually true no
one does that you see it's very interesting on this
works you prejudge the situation you say oh well they
can't possibly be true because they sound too crazy it's
all stupid nonsense can't possibly be true but that's just
assumed you have to go test your assumptions that's the
essence of science Dogma number nine is that metaphysics is
speculative nonsense and a corollary that document number 10 is
that science and math doesn't need metaphysics you can just
do science and math metaphysics free because metaphysics takes us
into the field of philosophy and you know philosophy we
know how philosophy works you can just sit around on
your armchair and do philosophy all day long but how
do you really know if philosophy is true and we
know that people throughout history have had all sorts of
crazy philosophies but none of that stuff really affects science
and math math and science are hard-nosed activities whereas metaphysics
and philosophy well that's that's very speculative and it's psychological
and it's prone to errors and you know you can't
really make a logical proof for some metaphysical idea whereas
in math and science you can you can prove things
definitively so that also turns out to actually be a
dogma because actually you cannot do science or math without
metaphysics and you can discover that if you just question
your assumptions the problem with all these assumptions is that
they're made unconsciously you make them but you don't know
that you've made them and it actually takes a lot
of work and thinking and contemplating and experiencing the world
from different perspectives to start to see and suss out
your assumptions and of course if you're part of a
university or academic setting if you're like doing a graduate
program or even your undergrad whatever you know your professors
they don't haul out these assumptions because these assumptions constitute
the paradigm or the culture that you're working in this
is all just part of the package when you go
and you sign up for university they don't question this
stuff even though you would think that as a university
you know what should be the highest ideal and aspiration
of a university it should be open-minded free thought and
the questioning of everything well it turns out that actually
there are specific things which the university system doesn't question
which is precisely those assumptions on which the University that
was founded and why doesn't it question these things well
of course precisely because if it did it would undermine
itself it would expose its own internal contradiction and of
course we wouldn't want that would we so we're gonna
dig into this in a lot of detail here but
let's start with some history to really lay the the
the historical backdrop for girdle's incredible discoveries because it's hard
to really appreciate that unless you put it into the
historical context so let's rewind about a hundred years ago
into the era where logical positivism was the the fad
and the rage in all of Western intellectual tradition logical
positivism is this sort of movement that happened within philosophy
within science and within mathematics which was an attempt to
get rid of metaphysics and philosophy from science and for
mathematics so there were key leading figures in this movement
like Carnap slick Neurath vic and stein russell whitehead and
David Hilbert and many many others scientists and philosophers and
and academics signed on board to this logical positivism and
their idea was that we need to make science more
hard-nosed make it really objective make it completely indisputable and
if we do that then we're gonna complete the entire
enterprise of science and of mathematics and of logic we're
gonna formalize everything we're gonna eliminate every single shred of
subjectivity intuition and psychology and philosophy from science and for
math that was their great idea that's what they tried
to do so these guys were serious scientists and philosophers
and some of them were serious logicians and mathematicians and
they worked really hard to to succeed in this logical
positivist agenda so their aim was basically to boil all
of truth down to expressions of language what they believed
was that all genuine knowledge if we ask ourselves what
is knowledge all genuine knowledge is really just about taking
nature and expressing it in a single common language to
all the sciences so that science basically boils down to
statements of fact about the world and that's how most
people think about science if you take a a guy
off the street and ask him what's science he'll say
well it's just just a collection of true statements about
the world you can ask for example is snow white
and the answer is either yes or no snow is
white or no snow is not white is snow black
you would say false and so that would be a
scientific statement and so what the logical positivist wanted to
do is they just want it to boil science down
to this kind of very kind of like simple cut-and-dry
atomic process or you can just boil and reduce everything
down all the complexity down to these little atomic parts
and for them the idea was that all of science
basically it's done with language so everything can be broken
down into little propositions within language and language itself can
be sort of simplified and boiled down from complicated language
and in fact you could take all of natural languages
English and all the statements that we make within English
or any natural language and you can boil that down
you can formalize it down into logical statements so logic
is a sort of language and so you can you
can take some wishy-washy sentence in English and you can
boil it down to a logical statement and so in
theory should be possible to do that with every piece
of knowledge we have until we know exactly what language
is saying and so what they thought is they thought
that a lot of the confusion that happened in philosophy
for the last 2,000 years was was people abusing language
misusing language talking about terms which they didn't clearly define
they didn't really understand what they were talking about and
so people and different philosophers and theorists when they talked
about an atom or or a object or God or
they talked about the self where they talked about mind
or body you know all these concepts they didn't really
know what they were talking about because these are very
kind of fuzzy abstract terms what we got to do
is we got to define our terms very carefully the
way that a logician would and then we can we
can make a real simple sense out of all of
reality and they believed that this was possible to do
with mathematics as well they wanted to boil mathematics down
to logic this particular Enterprise was called logis ism it
was the idea that logic it's that that mathematics itself
wise mathematics true for example how do you know that
one plus one equals two what is the truth of
that relying upon how do you justify mathematics what they
thought is that you can boil it down to logic
mathematical truths are really just logical truths and so they
they went on this on this enterprise to try to
boil mathematical truths down to logic and they basically thought
that all of this can be formalized into a system
of equations and if they succeeded in doing that then
their idea was that well we don't need metaphysics anymore
we don't need philosophy you don't need speculation all of
that is just meaningless fuzzy talk when we've got our
equations our equations explain everything and then math and science
really become the only valid kind of knowledge and everything
else is just fuzzy delusional or some sort of wishful
thinking New Age type of stuff and so the logical
positivists were really adamant about verifiability which means that if
you're gonna make a claim about the world and you
think that it's true that means your claim must be
tested and it must be testable so if you make
a claim about the world which cannot be tested under
any circumstances that means that really you're not making any
legitimate claim about the world at all what you're doing
is you're just engaging in metaphysics and just speculation and
there was a lot of that that happened in philosophy
for for hundreds of years so in a sense you
can you can understand where they were coming from they
were tired they were sick and tired of people making
these sort of arguments like you could say well what
makes the moon orbit around the the earth and people
say well it might be gravity and then some religious
person might say well it's not gravity it's angels there
are invisible angels which help keep the moon in place
but then a scientific person would say well but angels
what is this concept of an angel holding the moon
in place how do we make sense of this can
we test this and of course you try to test
it and you realize well you can't test it and
you can ask the the religious person well can we
see these angels and he'll say no angels are invisible
and then he'll say well can we feel them they
do they register on our instruments and the religious person
will keep saying no no no you can't you can't
measure them at all so to the logical positivists this
started to smell like because now they want to say
well if you can't actually verify a statement about the
world that means you're just speculating you see you're just
playing mind games so they were big on verifiability they
were very big on pragmatism they don't want just speculative
theories and ideas what they want is they want a
pragmatic statement about the world which can be tested and
you can do something with it and all the other
speculation the theory that's not important that doesn't belong within
the domain of science and that really what science is
is science is not metaphysics science doesn't really tell you
what the world is science simply tells you the equations
governing nature and those equations are all that there really
is that's sort of what pragmatism means it's all about
how do we manipulate nature and beyond that there's nothing
more to say they were also into reductionism they believed
that all things can be reduced down to their atomic
fragments so you might ask them what is color what
is consciousness what is love what are emotions what is
an animal and they will say well there are no
such things all of it just boils down to atoms
there's no such thing as a dog it's just atoms
there's no such thing as love and emotions and conscious
they're just atoms and of course logical positivism worked really
well with atheism and materialism so materialism atheism and and
this logical positive all sort of came together and this
sort of created a sort of paradigm in which science
was done back in the early 1900s this really started
to flower in the early 1900s and lasted for about
20 or 30 years in the 1930s or so until
ultimately logical positivism got debunked by by girdle and and
a few other theorists so there was a particular man
who started off this this this enterprise of logis ism
called Gottlob Frege ii he was a brilliant logician and
he devoted his entire life to this enterprise of logis
ism and he worked with set theory and he was
trying to use set theory to basically create a foundation
a logical foundation for all of mathematics he wanted to
find a small handful of axioms which he could use
to create the foundation for all arithmetic so for free
gay he was asking a very basic sort of philosophical
question about math and specifically about arithmetic which is like
the most basic form of math the stuff they teach
you in in first grade he wanted to know and
he wanted to to completely rigorously prove that all arithmetic
'el truths are true and that this should be proven
and not just intuited but rigorously proven and his whole
agenda was to get rid of intuition from within mathematics
he thought that intuition was like a fudge factor within
mathematics which introduced the sort of fuzzy human element into
what should otherwise be a very hard-nosed rigid system it
should be cold and heartless not intuitive so he went
about dedicating his whole life to this process he came
up with all his axioms he did all these proofs
and finally he figured it out how to do this
and he wrote his book and he's just about to
publish the book the book is actually in the printing
presses it's being printed and he thinks he's found the
logical foundation for all arithmetic until his hopes are shattered
by a discovery from a fellow logician Bertrand Russell famous
mathematician logician who discovered and showed to frag a that
there's a paradox at the very heart of his entire
scheme and this was called Russell's paradox and so freddie
was working with set theory and I'm not going to
get into all the weeds there that we can get
into about set theory but set theory is just in
a very simplistic explanation all it is is just you're
you're grouping objects into sets so if you have one
object that's one set you can have two objects that's
the second set and you just have sets and so
basically mathematics boils down to to sort of manipulating these
sets and seeing the interrelationships between all these different sets
but it's not quite so simple because there's something deeply
paradoxical at the very heart of this entire enterprise of
trying to boil down reality to simple equations and that
is Russell's paradox Russell's paradox is stated as such Russell
basically said what if we find a set within set
theory that is the set of all possible sets not
containing itself and what this leads to is this leads
to a sort of strange loop or sort of contradiction
where set theory contradicts itself because if you find the
set of all possible sets that doesn't contain itself on
the one hand it would it would seem like you
could find such a set but if you did then
that set what negate itself and if you couldn't find
a set then that set must exist so it's a
sort of odd paradox that happens where at the same
time it must exist but it can't exist and if
it can't exist then it must exist and this brought
frege's entire program to a halt and he got very
depressed about this for a gated but to his credit
he was honest about he admitted that yes it actually
is not possible to boil down arithmetic to logic and
to these simple set of axioms because of these inherent
contradictions which exist in addition to fray GAE there was
a man by name of David Hilbert who was also
a logician and mathematician who embarked on what's called Hilbert's
program and Hilbert's program was very similar to frege's he
was trying to ground all existing theories into a finite
complete set of axioms and so he was working on
this problem at the same time and Hilbert's program was
derailed by Georg Cantor and Garret Cantor is the guy
who made some groundbreaking discoveries about transfinite numbers he discovered
that there are different orders of infinity within logic and
within mathematics and in fact that there are an infinite
number of sizes of infinity and he also discovered the
absolute infinite set which is sort of like the set
of all possible infinite degrees of infinity that's the absolute
and he called that God he was a religious man
I talked about Georg Cantor in more detail in my
episode absolute infinity part to understanding absolute infinity part two
so I talked about his Baxter it's very fascinating so
if you want to learn more about him go check
that out I won't be covering it any more depth
here now I want to talk now about a Kurt
durdle because Kurt girdle and also a guy by the
name of alfred tarski both of them logicians they made
a couple of critical contributions which completely derailed all of
these efforts at logis ISM and ultimately at logical positivism
and so this is what we are what what is
the heart of this conversation that we're having here so
what is it that girdle and alfred tarski proved they
came up with a couple of theories girdle came up
with two incompleteness theories tarski came up with one undecidability
theorem they're quite technical they're dozens of pages long I'm
not gonna actually go into the full details of that
here but let me give you a high-level explanation of
of girls and completeness theorem so basically what girdle was
able to accomplish is he was able to take a
logical system and he was able to say okay so
here are our axioms in this system in theory we
should be able to take these axioms and we should
be able to to use them to make any kind
of proof of anything that's true within the system of
for example arithmetic so if we try to do that
there's a special case scenario like what Bertrand Russell discovered
is that we can actually use these axioms in a
sort of tricky manner to actually create a statement within
the entire logical scheme which will contradict itself due to
self reference and so what girdle was able to prove
is that if a system is sufficiently complex enough that
it's able to reflect on itself or otherwise speak about
itself for example in the English language the English language
is rich enough of a language that I can speak
about myself using the English language so in a sense
what I'm doing is I'm going meta I'm speaking about
the fact that I'm speaking you see sort of self-consciousness
that's happening here this is otherwise known as self reflection
or as self reference I can speak and reference myself
speaking well if a language like logic or English or
some other system is able to do that speak about
itself what it can do is it can create a
paradox or a contradiction because what I can say is
I can say the following thing and this is ultimately
what girdles and complete center boils down to let's make
an analogy between logic and English so you can do
the same thing in logic that you can do in
English in English what I can do is I can
say the following statement everything I say is a lie
now notice what that means that's a paradox because if
everything I'm saying is a lie that means what I'm
saying that statement everything I say is a lie it's
a lie so if it's a lie that means that
statement is true but everything I say is a lie
that means how can it be true that's a contradiction
on the other hand if I am speaking the truth
all the time everything I say is true then how
can I say the statement everything I say is a
lie that is also a contradiction so it's a contradiction
from both sides it's a contradiction no matter which way
you slice it so what girdle was able to show
is that you can do that within logic itself as
well not just English at least if your logic is
complicated enough that it admits of self reference so what
is self reference mean in logic it doesn't mean that
logic is referencing the self as an ego or as
an eye or as a consciousness no it just means
that logic is able to reference itself so that means
your logical scheme or system has to be able to
speak about its own sentences if the logic can reference
itself as a logic then what girdle approved is that
you can create statements within that logic which are true
but which cannot be proved using that logic and so
in essence what is proved is that truth is larger
than proved ability and this is always true this is
a pretty remarkable result and girdle had to go through
some ingenious mental maneuvers to figure out how to actually
do this with arithmetic so what he was able to
do is he was able to come up with this
idea called girdle numbering where he was able to to
encode self reference with the in arithmetic such that arithmetic
could reference itself and start to speak about itself and
therefore he could show that because arithmetic can speak about
itself that it must ultimately contain more truth in it
then can be boiled down to simple logical axioms and
that was a pretty amazing result which means that you
cannot boil down arithmetic to a simple algorithm that is
something that Frey Gaye and David Hilbert were trying to
do their idea was that arithmetic and all mathematical truths
it should be possible to come up with a certain
algorithm that can just run through every possible possibility and
come up with all the true statements of arithmetic and
if we program a computer for example with this algorithm
the computer can go through and can calculate every single
possible mathematical truth that there exists and therefore we have
solved the problem of mathematics forever and what girdle's proved
is that actually you can't do that mathematics is infinite
beyond the possibility of any algorithm to to figure it
out and that therefore intuition is a necessary component of
all mathematical discovery and in fact what girdle proved is
that mathematics is technically it's called uncomputable which means that
if you had a computer that had infinite resources infinite
processing power and could run for an infinite number of
time for trillions of years it would still never be
able to discover all the truths that are contained within
mathematics think about that that's deep that's deep I'm not
just saying that your ordinary home computer couldn't do this
or some supercomputer I'm saying imagine a computer with infinite
resources and it still could not figure out mathematics that's
how big mathematical truth is you can't capture it with
language you can't encapsulate it in any kind of formal
system with simple axioms and rules so another way to
think about what gertle discovered or proved is that if
the entire domain of truth is a circle like this
then what you can prove is a smaller subset of
that circle and they are never the same you can
never prove all that there is that's true the truth
always exceed exceeds what's provable if self-reference is possible so
another way to say it is that he proved that
if a system is complete it cannot be consistent and
he also proved that the consistency of axioms cannot be
proved inside of the system you always need to have
a meta language to go outside to be able to
reflect upon the system that you're using if you want
to talk about truth and this goes to the very
core of the dogma that many rationalist have which is
they assume that if something is true it must be
provable but that's not the case and in fact what
girdle was able to demonstrate and to prove was that
in any logical system which is capable of self reference
you can create a statement as follows this statement is
unprovable and that will break the entire scheme this is
called the girl statement this is sort of the the
wrench in the works this is also Russell's paradox is
a journal statement so that's sort of like the strict
explanation of what the proof is then there are the
philosophical and a histological and metaphysical consequences of this which
we will talk about but what I want to do
here is I want to read to you a little
bit of from Wikipedia about both the discoveries of girdle
and about David not David Hilbert but um alfred tarski
that really precisely explains what they proved because it can
be a little bit difficult to sort of explain this
in words it's good to have a nice rigorous explanation
of it so we're gonna go to Wikipedia here so
here's what it says girdles and completeness theorems published in
1931 showed that Hilbert's program was unattainable four key areas
of mathematics in his first theorem girdle showed that any
consistent system with a computable set of axioms is capable
of expressing it that is capable of expressing arithmetic can
never be complete it is possible to construct a statement
that can be shown to be true but that cannot
be derived from the formal rules of the system so
what this means is that you cannot have a complete
formalization of of mathematics and really you cannot have a
complete formalization of anything because if we're talking out the
truth the truth is always going to be bigger than
the system of formal rules that you use to to
talk about the truth and then it goes on to
say quote in his second theorem he showed that such
a system could not prove its own consistency so it
certainly cannot be used to prove the consistency of anything
stronger with certainty this refuted Hilbert's assumption that a finite
istic system can be used to prove the consistency of
itself and therefore anything else end quote so it was
assumed that logic can sort of prove itself but then
girdle was actually able to prove using logic that logic
cannot prove itself which if you think about is very
interesting so what girdle was able to do is he
was able to sabotage logic from the inside out and
what's significant about this result to me and I think
to our work here is that it's one thing for
example to criticize logic from the outside from outside the
system for example you might have a very logical person
and then you might have a religious person the religious
person might criticize the logical person oh well you're too
logical you're too stuck in your head why are you
so logical maybe you need to have more faith but
of course the logical person is not gonna buy that
because he's gonna have the position that all faith faith
is just some some nonsense New Age stuff what we
what we need is we need more logic the problem
with the world is that we're not being logical enough
if everybody in the world was just more logical everything
would be beautiful so you're not gonna be able to
convince a logical person who's stuck in his logic that
his logic is limited using appeals to faith or religion
or intuition or other outside stuff but was what girdle
was able to do is he was able to to
to prove to the law to the logical person from
inside of his own system that his own system is
inconsistent that his own logic undermines itself logic taken to
its ultimate conclusion shows its own limits which is a
remarkable result and if you think about it it should
have been obvious to these logicians that this would be
the case because after all if you just think about
very simplistically think about like this if there's a person
who murdered somebody and he's on trial now the fact
that he murdered someone is let's say true he did
in that case but does that mean you can prove
it no there's no reason why you would be able
to prove it he could have murdered somebody and whether
you can prove it or not well that depends maybe
you have some some video footage on some security camera
maybe you have some text messages maybe you have some
audio maybe you have some circumstantial evidence or whatever pointing
like you have some footprints or you have some blood
splats or whatever maybe you've got that but maybe he
committed this murder so perfectly that you can't prove it
does that mean he didn't murder the person no it
just means you can't prove it but he still murdered
him you see so truth is larger than what you
can prove that's sort of a an analogy that we
can make with with a sort of a more human
example to bring this down to earth now this seems
sort of reasonable you would seem like well it would
seem like well of course that that that seems like
common sense yes but logicians didn't get it for a
long time they didn't get it many of them still
don't really get it because they still insist on using
rationality and logic to to figure out reality and what
girdle was showing is the limitations of that now let's
move on to alfred tarski this is also from Wikipedia
and it says alfred tarski zunda findability theorem shattered all
hopes of reducing reducing mathematics to logic informally the theorem
states that arithmetic 'el truth cannot be defined in arithmetic
so you need something beyond arithmetic to define the truths
of arithmetic see the truths of arithmetic are not merely
grounded in the symbols of arithmetic there's sort of a
deeper layer or a metal layer that you need to
appeal to this is my commentary here now so what's
important about tarski is tarski came after girdle he came
out right on the heels of girdle and while girdles
result was more limited to two specific to a specific
logical system tar skis result was more general and it
became more broadly applied to to language and to logic
so that's why tarski is significant although really it was
later shown that girdle also derived the same result that
our ski did but he just didn't publish it as
as early so wikipedia goes on to say the theorem
tarski theorem applies more generally to any sufficiently strong formal
system showing that truth in the standard model of the
system cannot be defined within the system the undefined ability
theorem shows that encoding girdles and coding cannot be done
for semantic concepts such as truth it shows that no
sufficiently rich interpreted language can represent its own semantics a
corollary is that any meta language capable of expressing the
semantics of the language that is talking about the object
language must have expressive power exceeding that of the object
language the meta language includes primitive notions axioms and rules
which are absent from the object language so that there
are theorems provable in the meta language but not provable
in the object language end quote so maybe that confused
you it's a little technical but let me explain what
this means it's quite simple if you have a language
like English I can use that language to talk about
stuff normally how we use languages we use it just
to talk about stuff like people and cars and cats
and dogs and business and and so forth but the
language is also capable of talking about itself and that's
the meta language see we can use English to talk
about English and we can use English to talk about
letters and I can even say that right now I'm
speaking words and the word W I mean the word
the word word starts with a w the word word
has four letters in it see I'm actually now starting
to talk in a self-conscious way about the actual language
and so to do that I need to appeal something
to something deeper higher I need to sort of meta
language to talk about the language and the same thing
with logic if you are using logic to just do
logical deductions that's fine no problem there but if you're
trying to use logic to talk about logic itself or
to talk about the truths that logic is producing you
can't do that at the level of logic what you
need is you need meta logic logic about logic a
meta language and so what tarski demonstrated is that in
order to accomplish what frey gay and and hilbert and
logical positive we're trying to accomplish what they didn't understand
is that they need a meta language to accomplish that
and you might say well okay so Leo so what's
the problem so let's have let's create a meta language
a meta logic which we can use to talk about
logic and so therefore we've we've sort of used logic
to justify and explain logic but you can't do that
either because see the system you're using to talk about
some other system always has a set of primitive notions
axioms and rules and assumptions metaphysical assumptions which must be
made for the system to get up and running in
the first place so you can use a metal language
to talk about the first-order language but you can't use
the meta language to talk about the meta language so
you need a meta meta language to talk about the
truths of the meta language but then how do you
prove the meta meta language you need a meta meta
meta language and so on to infinity you see you
can never escape the need for making ungrounded axioms and
ungrounded assumptions never ever if you're gonna have any kind
of system of explaining the world you're always going to
need primitives primitive things which are just taken on faith
which is why reason itself is in us inextricably connected
to faith reason is not the arch enemy of faith
as is conventionally assumed but rather you need faith in
reason you need faith in your reasonable axioms you need
faith that reason is accurately describing reality if you didn't
have that you wouldn't be able to use your reason
and it's precisely because of that that your reason is
inconsistent because your reason assumes that everything is just reasonable
except of course your very reason is unreasonable if reality
was perfectly reasonable you actually couldn't have reason that's the
paradox if the human mind was just a machine with
no intuitive capacities it could actually not have mathematical insights
that these mathematicians are having so the deep irony here
is that these logicians and mathematicians who are making these
groundbreaking discoveries within logic and mathematics nothing wrong with that
but what they're not understanding is that they're actually using
their intuition they're using and connecting to infinite intelligence to
make their discoveries they're having creative insights it's not a
mechanical process it's deep intelligence and this deep intelligence is
not formal izybelle into a set of algorithms or simple
rules the way that people assumed the way the logical
positivists wanted and the deeper metaphysical and epistemic lesson here
is that you cannot capture reality and encapsulate it into
a formal system because reality is infinite and so it
will always escape any attempt to encapsulate it as it
must because reality is one thing it is the self
the self is capable of self reference and when you're
capable of self reference this necessarily leads to Kipp paradox
into contradiction and this is not a problem this is
not something that we need to be afraid of or
that we need to consider an error or a mistake
no that's correct that's precisely correct because all of your
reasoning is actually grounded upon something that's beyond reason existence
itself is beyond reason because reality and existence itself is
groundless and it is a strange loop because it is
itself reality is itself it is the ultimate chicken-and-egg problem
it is the ultimate self-reference problem you are a self
within reality you are the universe looking at itself thinking
about itself reasoning about itself wondering how did I get
here what am i doing here what is existence well
what is that that's existence asking itself what is existence
and the deep irony is that existence doesn't actually exist
so ironically you're standing here asking what is existence I
am existence asking myself what is existence and is the
same as non-existence and so this is the Ouroboros this
is the snake eating its own tail and what girdle
showed is that logic is a little microcosm of the
larger macrocosm of this Ouroboros logic eats itself by its
own tail just like the snake as it must because
we have absolute infinity which is all of reality as
a whole but then absolute infinity includes all the minor
infinities as Georg Cantor discovered every object including logic because
logic is a part of reality he's also infinite and
mathematics is also infinite and the chair is infinite and
the dog the cat the tree the bird in the
sky it's all infinite all of it is a different
form of infinity and then all of it of course
is contained within absolute infinity which is the whole thing
given all at once but see you cannot cut encapsulate
reality into any formal system because the formal system is
not separate from reality as many scientists and rationalist like
to assume it's a part of it the scientist is
reality science is itself reality so science has to as
its doing science ultimately has to explain itself and for
most of Sciences history science was done simply externally it
was like you were just you were just looking at
the world as though you're not connected to the world
you're disconnected you're kind of standing outside the universe and
you're trying to judge it objectively but then with quantum
mechanics for example and with with these with these theorems
from girdle and from tarski what's what's being realized that
when you go really deeply into your inquiry because science
is an inquiry into the nature of reality when you
go really deeply into that inquiry what you discover is
that wait a minute if I'm inquiring what is the
chair what is a cat what is a tree what
is logic what is science ultimately have to enquire what
am i what am i what is consciousness what is
my self and then when when you inquire deeply into
that you realize that I am the stuff that I
was looking at I am a part of reality I'm
not separate from it and so the subject and object
distinction breaks down it collapses and when that happens then
you become the stuff that you were investigating see you
can't just assume that logic is something separate from you
or that logic is separate from intuition or logic is
separate from emotion not at all all of these things
must be ultimately interconnected into a unity and that's what
non-duality tells us and so really to fully appreciate girdle's
discovery you have to understand non duality because ultimately girdle's
theorems and tarski theorems they were pointing to non duality
again they cannot actually make non duality perfectly clear to
you because for that you actually need to become non
dual you actually need to have an Enlightenment experience but
they were pointing to the fact that there is a
truth which is beyond language beyond logic beyond your mind
so that's the significance now of course they don't teach
you any of this in school when you're taking your
physics classes your math classes your logic classes and even
in university they don't teach you this stuff nobody talks
about this stuff this is our sort of the hidden
stuff the hidden under Melly underbelly the hidden structures of
these scientific and mathematical methods because if you notice when
you were learning mathematics or science or history or whatever
very little attention was actually paid on the process of
science on the process of history on the process of
logic or math you weren't really doing metamathematics you weren't
doing meta logic you weren't doing meta philosophy you weren't
doing meta physics you weren't doing meta history you just
sort of assumed that you could use history you could
use philosophy you could use science or whatever to just
to get your results but the deeper you go and
the more you use those tools eventually have to ask
yourself wait a minute what is this tool that I'm
using where is it coming from how is the tool
connected to myself and to my own being to my
own consciousness and to reality as a whole and when
you do that that's when the self reference problems come
up and academia does a really good job of hiding
all these self reference problems because when you really explore
the self reference problem to its ultimate root you discover
that there is no separate self everything is the self
and you might wonder well what's the problem with that
well the problem with that is that it destroys all
systems it destroys your ability to encapsulate and to capture
reality into a little box which is the whole premise
of science and the whole premise of philosophy and the
whole premise of theory and the whole private premise of
modeling and the whole premise of of language of of
logical understanding the whole premise of that is that you
can capture it into some kind of system but you
can't because the system is smaller than the whole and
the system is a part of the whole and the
map is not the territory and now I want to
read you some excerpts of quotes that I've compiled from
a collection of various authors about girdle and his discoveries
and also tar skis discoveries they do a great job
of eloquently sort of distilling down all the complexity into
into little concise snippets and metaphors and images that that
do a great job of explaining the significance of this
so first we have Douglas Hofstadter and he says quote
the paraphrase of girdle's theorem says that for any record
player there are records which it cannot play because they
will cause it's indirect self-destruction and quote I love that
image that's the perfect metaphor for what we're talking about
here and you can see how now it starts to
connect to non-duality into self-actualization work so what he's talking
about here is a record player so imagine old school
records those sort of photographs which have that needle in
that groove record so now imagine if you could design
a record that you can put on that player such
that when the needle went around the circle's there was
something encoded in the record that would actually cause that
needle to to vibrate and finally the whole thing was
just selfish self implode that would be the equivalent of
what girdle accomplished he found a way to do that
using arithmetic and using logic that's pretty cool and he
was able to prove he wasn't just able to come
in he was able to prove that any system which
is capable of self reference will have this Achilles heel
that will cause its own self destruction because that's what
self reference must do and of course the thing that
he himself never realized and that that even Douglas Hofstadter
really never fully realized even though they understood this stuff
in theory they never actually got to the point where
they realized that actually my own physical existence as a
self and as a mind as a body there is
there exists a record so to speak that can be
played inside my mind which will cause my own death
think about that there is an idea let's say the
the analogy here's a record for record player and idea
for the mind there exists an idea such that if
we feed it into your mind it will destroy you
that's pretty amazing that's pretty amazing you might wonder what
would that idea be well it's not necessarily just as
simple as one specific idea rather the way it really
works in reality is that there can be some level
or some realization that your mind can reach where it
realizes that it itself never really existed and when it
realizes that and it realizes that reality never really existed
and then like it it has a full sort of
overarching meta understanding of itself the entire thing collapses and
is seen to be a house of cards and that's
enlightenment pretty cool but also notice that if such a
thing really were possible then ideas are far more dangerous
than most people assume see most people think that all
ideas ideas are just ideas yeah you could read ideas
in a book you can hear ideas on TV but
it's not like an idea can kill me or can
it could this be why people and minds are so
ideological and they cling to ideas so much have you
noticed this how much Minds cling to ideas you cling
to ideas your your family claims to ideas your friends
cling to ideas that's why you argue with them so
much people on TV politicians and religious people scientific people
logical people they all clink to ideas they all have
pet theories and ideologies why is that could it be
because deep down inside the mind knows that if it
if it's not careful and it explores the wrong ideas
eventually it will run into an idea that will kill
it now there's an idea there's an idea that might
be one of the first ideas in this chain of
ideas that will ultimately lead to your self-destruction to even
be open to the possibility that there might exist an
idea which will lead to your own self-destruction and to
not reject that idea and to take it seriously that
already is a part of this whole self-destructive sort of
ideology see which is precisely why most people would reject
what I'm saying here what I'm saying here is not
commonly accepted it's not talked about in mainstream media it's
not talked about in universities nobody talks about this stuff
and if they do they're very careful to make it
just an idea so that it's just a theory enlightenment
is just a possibility some philosophy or some some hypothetical
thing but it's never actualized because it's dangerous for the
brain it's dangerous for the mind to take these ideas
really seriously that's why when you're sitting and you're doing
self inquiry one of most important things you have to
do is you have to you have to take the
possibility of eradicating yourself very seriously because that's what you're
doing in self inquiry that's what you're trying to do
that's what you're trying to do with meditation that's what
you're trying to do with yoga people sit down they
they're doing this process but they don't really grasp the
significance of what they're doing and of course really you
can't because you can't fathom the significance of it until
after the self destruction has really started to occur Douglas
Hofstadter also says quote prove ability is a weaker notion
than truth and quote so we've talked about that and
my ideas about probability and truth were greatly shaped by
Douglas Hofstadter I really recommend you check out his book
girdle assure and Boff where he goes into a lot
of detail in a very beautiful way at the same
time it's both technical and challenging it's one of the
most challenging books you'll ever read but also it's is
very accessible and it's written in this very playful and
sort of fun and interesting style so if you're nerdy
and you want to go really deep on this topic
then I recommend you check it out one of my
favorite books of all time it's just a delightful to
read it's a total mindfuck especially when you combine it
with the things you have learned if you've been watching
actualised org that takes Earl girdle Escher and Bach and
just takes it to the enth degree cuz Douglas Hofstadter
didn't really realize the significance of what he was writing
about he never did even though he wrote about zen
and he wrote about enlightenment he still didn't really understand
what he was talking about he was still it was
still just a concept it wasn't really actualized so if
you're a fan of gertle Escher and Bach and maybe
that's why you stumble upon this episode my piece of
advice to you is that there's something deeper if you
love gertle Escher and Bach if you love the work
of douglas hofstadter go deeper go deeper that's just the
tip of the iceberg what you're invited to do here
is to actually find that record which will destroy you
as the record player and actually actualize that let's go
on to the next quote by George Gilder he says
quote girdle demonstrated that every logical scheme including mathematics is
dependent upon axioms that it cannot prove and that cannot
be reduced to the scheme itself girdle was reportedly concerned
that he might have inadvertently proved the existence of God
a faux pas in his Viennese and Princeton circle end
quote the Viennese in Princeton circle that they're talking about
in this quote is the logical positivists they were otherwise
known as the vienna circle so why did girdle think
that he proved the existence of God perhaps well because
he saw the the larger consequences here he saw that
reality is such a thing that you can't ever encapsulate
it and what does that mean reality is that means
it's infinity the next code is from Perry Marshall and
he says quote in 1931 this young Austrian mathematician Kurt
girdle published a paper that once and for all proved
that a single theory of everything is actually impossible end
quote people have been trying to come up with theories
of everything for a long time and I'm sure that
there are people sitting in universities all around the world
today working really hard dedicating their entire careers to finding
a theory of everything and they will never succeed because
what they don't understand is is that everything is infinite
what theory are you gonna come up with that's infinite
your theory is never gonna be infinite your theory is
always finite so you're always gonna fail your theory of
everything will actually not be everything your theory of everything
is is an oxymoron it's a contradiction in of itself
a theory is not everything you can't have a theory
of everything you can have a theory which is something
but it's not everything or you can have everything but
you can't have both because everything is not a theory
everything is if everything was a theory that means this
would be a theory right here but it's not this
is not a theory this is what we call reality
the gist between theory and realities precisely that theory is
not all of reality that's why the idea of a
theory is useful because it's more limited than reality because
reality is too much it's too much so we subdivided
into components do you want a theory of everything I
can give it to you right now this is about
as simple as a theory of everything we'll ever get
that's it it's one symbol just draw the infinity symbol
and that's everything that's the closest theory of everything yet
it's still not really everything it's a concept it's just
a theory but you know what come up with a
better theory everything that infinity that's what it is you
don't need complex complex equation mathematics and you don't need
to do anything just infinity that's it but of course
that doesn't satisfy the scientist because the scientist can't build
a career off of off of infinity well he can
but to build a scientific career off of infinity what
you have to do is you have to dedicate your
whole life to subdividing and fragmenting and atomizing infinity forever
and that's what scientists have done see scientists are very
clever people they have invented a career for themselves which
will never ever end scientists will be in business for
a trillion years doing science subdividing infinity into infinite number
of formulas over and over and over again and that's
that's what they're gonna do and their job will never
end and see in a sense to realize that everything
is just infinity well it's too simple it's so simple
you can't really build a career around it you can't
really write a book about it I mean people do
people try people still sell many books that car totally
wrote wrote and sold millions of books based on based
on infinity but uh but you know if you really
want to be truthful about it there's nothing you can
say it's just infinity that's it this next quote is
by John Barrow he says quote as with geometries so
with logics there are an infinite number of consistent schemes
of logical reasoning that can be constructed there is no
such thing as an absolute truth in logic and mathematics
the best one can do is talk about the truth
of statements given a set of rules of reasoning it
is quite possible to have statements that are true in
one logical system but false in another endquote this is
very consequential because that myth of reasoning that we've talked
about in the in the very beginning that mainstream myth
of logic well it assumes that there's only one logic
that there's only one way to reason but actually that's
not true at all if you go to graduate school
in philosophy or within logic or within mathematics you will
quickly discover that there are dozens and hundreds of different
logical systems and that all of these different systems have
their own sets of axioms their own rules and some
of these logics are very counter intuitive and twisted and
not like normal logic and so you might ask well
which logical system is the right one but of course
there isn't one because your logical system is taken on
faith which logic you use which axiom constitutes your logic
every logical system needs to have a set of axioms
well those are arbitrary you just choose them and then
it becomes an empirical question whether your logical system will
correspond to reality or to the physical universe maybe it
will maybe it won't maybe in in quantum mechanics it'll
work but in everyday life it won't work or vice-versa
for example ordinary logic that we traditionally call logic that
we use just around everyday life you know we could
say well I saw an animal on the road and
all and then I can ask you well was it
a cat or was it a dog and you can
say it was both but of course that doesn't work
in everyday logic you can't have a cat and a
dog in one it was either a cat or a
dog or it was neither but it can't be both
if it was just one animal but then see if
we try to take this logic and we start to
apply it for example to quantum mechanics to light we
can ask a light well is light a wave or
is it a particle and you might think if you're
trying to apply ordinary logic of cats and dogs to
light and two particles and waves you might say well
he's either gonna be a particle or a wave can't
be both but the answer turns out that it's both
or maybe that it's neither see but that had to
be empirically tested and many people when they first saw
those experiments they didn't want to believe it took a
lot of work of genius people to really to square
that circle you see so you can't really rely on
rationale in your logic because there's actually an infinite number
of logical systems that you could create so which one
are you going to use how are you going to
determine which logical system is the right one to apply
in which situation are you going to use logic to
determine that no you can't you see because that's just
a recursion of the problem you might say well there's
a meadow logic okay but then there's an infant number
of meta logics which meta logy are gonna use how
are you gonna determine that well by using a meta
meta logic how many meta logics are you gonna have
how many men a meta meta meta logics are you
gonna have where does it end it doesn't end it
can't end because it's infinite even logic itself is infinite
even logic itself can't confine itself to one set of
axioms you see logic itself is very diverse it's so
diverse that you can't even control it it spills out
that's the key feature of realities that always spills out
that's the key feature of infinity it has no end
it has no boundary it just kind of keeps going
and going and going and going here's another quote by
John Barrow I love this one quote if a religion
is defined as a system of ideas that contains unprovable
statements then gertle taught us that mathematics is not only
a religion it is the only religion that can prove
itself to be one and quote I love that that
is the delicious irony the poetic justice if you will
of rational people criticizing religious people for believing in unprovable
things well logic itself is unprovable so who are you
criticizing it's the pot kettle calling the kettle black that
criticism just doesn't work if you are aware of what
your own system is see the only way that a
rationalist can really criticize a religious person is by not
being aware of his own internal self contradictions which is
precisely why rational people like to debate religious people because
when they're debating religious people they can just attack outwardly
but they're not really looking and self reflecting inwardly to
self-reflect you have to just be silent you can't be
in a debate you can't be arguing you can't be
discussing you have to actually be silent and turn inwards
and see your own inherent self contradictions now I want
to talk about more I want to talk more about
girdles a man because he he's a very interesting figure
and the reason I want to do this is important
strategic reason because see rational people here will listen to
what I'm saying and then they will they will come
up with a sneaky little objection they'll say AHA leo
but but girdles ideas you know girdle was just a
logician all he cared about was just formal mathematics it
wasn't philosophical there's nothing philosophical or metaphysical or epistemological or
theological or spiritual or non dual about any of girdles
work you're projecting that on to girdle that's what they'll
tell me and they'll say Oh leo this is just
like with quantum mechanics you know people all sorts of
New Age people love to use quantum mechanics to justify
their religious beliefs and all their spiritual nonsense but all
of that is just it's not really correct and this
is where I need to again I need to use
the evidence against you I need to use girdle against
you in this case because your mind is being tricky
it's being sneaky you're not letting yourself actually experience the
the full ramifications here you're wrong so for this we
go to girdles biographer Hao Wang he was a Chinese
professor who interacted with girdle throughout his life and he
wrote a book sort of by a biography of girdle
and girdles ideas and girls philosophy so I'm gonna quote
to you from this book and here's a couple of
key things that are made very clear in this book
I was quite surprised reading this firstly it's revealed that
girdle was first and foremost a philosopher not a mathematician
not a logician but a philosopher he cared deeply about
metaphysics girdle was not a realist or a materialist he
was a plate inist or an idealist and he was
really resonating with Leibniz his philosophy and with who Cyril
and liveness of course was a famous tidy list and
also he was a of a very adamant believer in
God and his philosophy and his metaphysics and his pista
mala JEE all sort of revolve around God and who
Cyril was sort of the father of phenomenology which is
the study of first-person experiences so what that tells you
is that girdle was resonating with these rather than with
the logical positivists girdle believed in a personal God girdle
in fact invented logical proofs for the existence of God
I'm not saying those proofs are valid but I'm saying
he did attempt it so that just kind of shows
you where he's coming from and the thing that girdle
was most interested in in his life is creating a
complete philosophy of reality he wants to understand what the
whole universe was what is the connection between metaphysics and
epistemology and between logic and mathematics he want to understand
everything he wanted the big picture that was his goal
but he never succeeded in completing his philosophy even though
he had some of these great breakthroughs within within the
field of logic and mathematics so here's some quotes from
from the biography quote when girdle was about four he
was nicknamed mr. Y by family and friends because he
always wanted to get to the bottom of things with
his intensive questioning end quote that kind of reminds me
of myself also quote I single out the quest for
a worldview as girdle's central goal his aim in life
was to make the greatest possible contribution that he could
to the ideal of finding and justifying the correct and
true worldview and quote you see so girdle was not
just a technical mathematical or logical hack he wanted to
understand the full ramifications of of what's going on with
mathematics and with logic also quote girdles interest was less
in physics itself than in his philosophical foundations and significance
and quote and also quote girdle told me that his
general philosophical theory is a life Nietzschean mana dalla G
with the central monad being God although he also stressed
that liveness had not worked out the theory end quote
so if you're not familiar with the philosophy and metaphysics
of live Nets and this idea of monads or mana
dalla G it's a little bit arcane but basically liveness
had this metaphysical idea that reality was not composed of
particles or atoms but these things called monads and this
was perhaps the earliest idea for a holographic universe these
monads were little Holograms so what a monad was was
just a particle but this particle contained inside of it
all the other particles sort of like a reflection of
them and so there were many of these monads but
every monad contained inside of it all the other monads
also sort of a strange loop and that that's ultimately
what God was is that God was this monad sort
of like a singularity so it's a little bit wonky
the details of his of his of his theory were
a little bit wonky I wouldn't go and buy into
all of it but I'm just saying that Leibniz was
onto something there because he intuitively sensed that that there's
something more to the universe than just plain stupid materialism
and so did girdle they just weren't really able to
to fully articulate it because they were still operating on
a level of duality they were trying to understand non
duality using duality and so they never quite succeeded here
are a few quotes from the biography from girdle himself
quote the plate mystic view is the only one tenable
thereby I mean the view that mathematics is describing a
non sensual reality which exists independently both of the axe
and the dispositions of the human mind and is only
perceived and probably perceived very incompletely by the human mind
end quote so when we say Platonism what that means
is Plato's metaphysics and Plato's metaphysics was not material but
more idealistic so what Plato believed is that these sense
perceptions that we see here the objects cars trees dogs
and cats and people that this isn't what's really true
about reality what's true is the ideas the concepts the
forms these abstract entities for example what's more true for
Plato is the idea of a dog in the abstract
rather than a dog in particular now that's a bit
weird and I'm not saying that that's the right way
to look at reality he was still looking at reality
very conceptually and that's a problem and that same problem
basically also then got passed out to girdle which is
why girdle had his problems because he was still not
recognizing the distinction between direct experience and concepts but nevertheless
what girdle was sort of thinking was that reality is
is mathematical that's not correct quite correct but he was
still basically thinking that what's most real about reality is
the higher level sort of like the higher spiritual levels
that the mind can reach only occasionally and only get
little glimpses of not this physical gross reality so he
sort of believed in a subtle reality and he thought
that that's what he was accessing when he was doing
these proofs and that's why you need intuition is to
access that and that's why you can't just use a
mechanical process because the mechanical process at this gross physical
level you need something that actually reaches out into the
subtle spiritual level from which insights come and those insights
are what the mathematicians are using to to really power
their work he also said quote it was the anti
platonic prejudice which prevented people from getting my results this
fact is the clear proof that the prejudice is a
mistake and quote so there he's specifically addressing the question
of why wasn't girls incompleteness theorem discovered earlier and the
reason is is because people assume that everything is just
mechanistic but because girdle didn't assume that reality and math
was mechanistic because he intuited that there was an important
component and role for intuition to play because he was
a plate inist that because that he was able to
derive his results he also said quote you cannot understand
what mathematics is without understanding knowledge in general and you
cannot understand what knowledge is without understanding the world in
general end quote so see here he's he's saying that
you can't just understand all these subjects in isolation you
can't just be a mathematician and think that you're gonna
understand mathematics without understanding knowledge epistemology or metaphysics or the
world see because it's all interconnected you can't assume that
your little field is a separate little bubble that lives
off by itself that assumption doesn't hold he also said
quote when I entered the field of logic it was
50% philosophy and 50% mathematics it is now 99% mathematics
and 1% philosophy even the 1% is bad philosophy I
doubt whether there is really any clear philosophy in the
models of modal logic and quote so here he's criticizing
what's been happening over the last hundred years in academia
academia has become less and less philosophical less concerned about
metaphysics less concerned about epistemology and just more concerned about
getting the right result because science and academia has just
become the quantification of everything if you can quantify something
if you can model it and you can get the
right results and then you could just be very pragmatic
about application of your scientific formulas to make predictions about
the future then that's it you're done that's what modern
science sort of works like it's lost that deep philosophical
connection that it used to have and asked in large
part because the logical positivists even though they were ultimately
debunked and disproven and logical positivism has largely fallen out
of favor people who study this stuff know that logical
positivism is is a load of it's it's completely inconsistent
but nevertheless this has sort of permeated the culture and
has just sort of become part of the scientific and
rationalist paradigm and the materialist paradigm which operates at a
much deeper level than then even most scientists are able
to fathom it's just part of the culture it's way
beyond you you're just programmed with it and now you
know Goerdeler was already seeing that starting to happen in
his time and he didn't like that because he cared
about the philosophy of it he didn't think philosophy was
nonsense she also said quote the answer to the question
what am I would then be that I am something
which is of itself has no properties at all rather
like a clothes hanger on which one may hang any
garment one wishes and quote so see even girdled was
starting to understand the importance of the question what am
i and he was starting to see that really there's
no self inside what I am is nothing but nevertheless
he never became enlightened this was still conceptual for him
and then his biographer goes on to say quote more
than once he had said that the present age was
not a good one for philosophy end quote and also
quote gourdel was in favor of metaphysics as opposed to
positivism and quote by which he means logical positivism and
then girdle himself said quote the discovery of metaphysical truth
will benefit mankind end quote and then his biographer said
quote the superiority of mind is undoubtedly important for his
ontological idealism which sees mind as prior to matter and
quote so ontological idealism is just the the idea that
what's more real is mind over matter matter is something
that happens within mind mind is not something that happens
as a phenomena of matter he also said quote girdle
regarded contemporary science as mistaking the part for the whole
and quote that's exactly right that's exactly what's happening this
is the whole problem of confusing the map for the
territory the map is the is the part the territory
is the whole the part is a part of the
whole but it's not the whole he also said quote
girdle proposed a doctrine according to which time and change
were not objectively real end quote and lastly girl himself
said quote matter will be spiritual eyes when the true
theory of physics is found and quote it's pretty illuminating
huh so I don't want to hear from you rationalist
objecting that girdle was just a mathematician or just a
logician that his results have no metaphysical consequences or epistemic
consequences or philosophical consequences yes they do or at the
very least he certainly believed they did maybe it's use
not seeing the deeper consequences here because you've been so
blindsided to just look inside you're a little technical sub
domain of your field you got to go beyond logic
that's what girls and complete this theorem is telling you
so you might wonder what happened to girdle in the
end he was alive during the heyday of quantum mechanics
and of course he was understanding all the stuff that
was going on in quantum mechanics and that probably helped
them to to make some of his discoveries and and
to see that that reality was was not material but
ultimately what happened to girdle was quite sad at the
end of his life he became mentally unstable in fact
he was so paranoid of being poisoned that he would
only eat food that his wife prepared for him when
his own wife became ill and she was not able
to prepare food for him anymore then he actually starved
to death and he died sixty-five pounds of body weight
that's how much he weighed he died from starvation a
rather sad end to a rather ingenious individual I think
there's a lesson to be drawn even from the way
that his life ended just like with quantum mechanics with
David Bohm I told you about how David Bohm became
depressed even though he was this brilliant physicist who understood
basically non duality he understood in theory but again he
didn't actualize it and that's the same problem I think
that happened with girdle now this is a little bit
of speculation on my part I don't really know why
he became mentally unstable but I can speculate with some
degree of reasonableness and likelihood that what happened with him
is that as he get older and older and he's
hard to face the prospect of death he started to
think about well what is my legacy did I really
accomplish what I wanted to in my life with my
life purpose and his life purpose was to figure out
what the hell is going on why is there reality
what does all of this mean what is what is
the metaphysical truth what is the right philosophy and he
was never able to piece it all together because he
was trying to do it still coming from the conceptual
domain what he didn't fully understand is that you have
to go beyond logic yes but also beyond concepts beyond
ideas beyond mathematics beyond philosophy beyond language beyond symbols beyond
the mind entirely and he was never really able to
do that and I think that that might have driven
him crazy just like with Georg Cantor he sort of
had the same problem as well is that Garret Cantor
understood that his logic and his mathematical proofs were pointing
to this transcendental truth that that he called God and
that girdle called God but he was never actually able
to actualize it and to see it for himself and
he probably wanted to very badly that was his whole
life purpose but he never made it and that's because
ultimately I think he got stuck in reasoning even though
he made these proofs he still got stuck in his
own mind and there's a really great quote that I
think hits at the heart of this problem and it
is this quote a madman is not someone who has
lost his reason but someone who has lost everything but
his reason end quote by GK Chesterton and I think
that's precisely what happened with girdle and many of these
other theorists like Cantor and to a certain extent David
Bohm they were still stuck within reason even though they
went post rational and they knew the limits of reason
but it's not enough to know the limits of reason
you have to transcend reason which is another level altogether
now let's tackle some objections hmm now let's tackle some
objections but Leo girdle's theorem only applies to strict formal
systems and what you're doing is you're bastardizing it and
you're taking it and you're running with it you're being
way too loose and metaphysical well that's precisely why I
wanted to quote to you from his biographer and some
of girdle's quotes from the biography himself so that you
can get an insight into the man himself and how
he thought hopefully those quotes have convinced you that he
wasn't just strictly a logician it's not that I'm being
too loose and metaphysical it's that actually you're being too
rigid and too limited in your scope which you might
think that that's actually a good thing because you're trying
to protect science and to protect knowledge and to protect
your web of belief because you want you want it
to be strict and you want it to be just
hard-nosed but actually in doing that you actually limit your
knowledge you limit your understanding of the bigger picture you
need to allow yourself to start to see the metaphysical
and epistemic consequences of this stuff that's not loosey-goosey that's
that's exactly what's necessary otherwise you fall into the trap
of logical positivism or for example in psychology they had
a similar movement which was coming from the same sort
of intention to make science overly strict which was behaviorism
and that also didn't pan out very well it just
doesn't explain enough reality is more rich and more complicated
and more nuanced and more interesting and more way more
fascinating than just simple reductionism would lead you to believe
so I really encourage you to to think through these
consequences for yourself very deeply and try to see how
your insistence on being rational is actually fragmenting reality and
when you're fragmenting reality you're not seeing the larger whole
and to really understand what reality is as a whole
well by definition you're talking about the whole and not
some little fragmentary part sure yes strictly speaking girdle's theorem
only applies to some strip little formalism within logic but
you know there's more there's more realities not just a
little fragment logic is not some isolated hermetically sealed field
from the rest of reality logic is occurring inside of
your your brain and Union in your mind so that
means it's happening to you as a human being you
can't really separate logic from emotions you can't separate the
left brain from the right brain they actually work together
and actually when you're doing logic and when you're analyzing
and you're reducing reality and you're fragmenting reality into these
conceptual categories that's actually happening thanks to the fact that
you have intuitive capacities and you're actually tapping into unbeknownst
to you infinite intelligence to do that to actually sit
down and make sense of a complicated proof to have
some deep insight within some mathematical theorem that requires infinite
intelligence you have to have an aha moment that comes
from outside of your ego outside of your little selfish
mind outside of rationalism that's where it comes from and
then you use that to actually build up your rational
frameworks start to see that start to self-reflect as you're
doing logic start to notice and observe and be mindful
of yourself doing the logic or doing your reasoning start
to carefully observe the internal processes rather than just using
it externally to solve some sort of problem out in
the world or some problem that your professor gave you
and then ultimately if you start to have mystical experiences
and you start to glimpse absolute infinity for yourself directly
by going beyond your mind it'll all interconnect in a
very beautiful and profound way for you the other objection
here of course is the the perennial one Leo how
is any of this stuff practical what does logic have
to do with my personal life well actually quite a
bit a lot more than you would assume because if
you grew up in Western modern 21st century culture then
you have grown up with this myth of rationalism this
myth that things can be proven to you in some
sort of airtight way and hopefully many of these myths
have been shattered here when you're stuck in rationalism that
is a very practical thing you are stuck and it
does affect your ability to think creatively it affects your
ability to theorize to do proper philosophy to understand science
to be able to open your mind to new ways
of looking at the world and new perspectives this is
extremely important the problem with rationalism is that it it
calcifies your mind it makes your mind rigid and dogmatic
it's the exact same problem that religious people have religious
fundamentalists same exact problem when the mind becomes rigid it's
not able to be truly creative it's not really thinking
for itself it's not opening itself up to infinite intelligence
it's not opening itself to new diverse perspectives you know
here's a very practical thing I can give you a
life changing book about yoga for example and I can
tell you here go take this book go practice it
go read it within a year it will completely transform
your life the quality of your life nothing theoretical about
it all practices exercises go do them and if you're
a rationalist or you're a scientist or you're an academic
or whatever you're not going to be able to get
five pages into this book why not because the paradigm
that this book will be coming from will be so
radically different from your rationalist logical materialistic Western but the
paradigm that it's not gonna it's not gonna compute for
you you're gonna get disgusted you're gonna throw this book
away you can say oh this is just nothing this
is just metaphysics it's just speculation this is just some
New Age stuff look Lea they're talking about chakras and
they're talking about out-of-body experience all this this is all
nonsense we all know that those are just hallucinations in
the brain we all know that consciousness just happens in
the brain that's just nonsense I'm not gonna do these
exercises Leo you want me to waste a year doing
these exercises no way see that's how your mind will
trick you and that's very practical you're limiting yourself you're
really limiting yourself not only are you limiting yourself with
some of these New Age techniques that are real that
can really benefit you which you poopoo but you also
limit yourself as a theorist and as a thinker to
be a genius theorist a genius scientist a genius mathematician
a genius engineer a genius thinker of any kind to
make original genius and valuable contributions to mankind you need
to cultivate a certain kind of intellect not a rationalist
intellect that's not gonna do it that's just gonna make
you a technician and a hack you need to cultivate
a very open minded creative intellect where your mind becomes
playful and you're able to jump between different perspectives and
look at the world this way and then that way
from a new-age perspective from a religious perspective from a
scientific person from illogical all of it you need to
be able to jump around comfortably and not to take
sides and not to get offended and not to get
emotional not to get attached to any of these perspectives
you need to be able to question all your assumptions
because that's the essence of thinking outside the box how
do you think outside the box well first of all
you have recognized that you're always in some kind of
box when you're thinking that helps and then you can
learn tools and methods and you can do various practices
you can do visualization exercises you can do yoga exercising
you do meditation self inquiry phillup philosophical actually you can
contemplate the nature of almost anything and as you do
that and you can also self reflect and you can
observe your own process you can observe how you use
language how you use logic how I use rationality as
you do all this you become more conscious the more
conscious you become the more of a vessel for infinite
creative intelligence you become the more you purify yourself the
more you purify your chakras your creativity will just go
through the roof if you think you're a good scientist
right now or a good mathematician or a good logician
or a good theorist right now man wait till you
spend five or ten years doing these practices and really
self actualizing and opening up your mind in the ways
that I'm talking about your your creativity will go to
levels that are superhuman your problem is gonna be that
you'd have so much creativity you're not gonna have enough
time to actually make all your ideas a reality there's
going to be an overabundance of brilliant ideas an overabundance
of a brilliant business ideas brilliant ways to transform society
to improve the world to help yourself to help your
family it's gonna be too much I have so much
creativity because my mind is so open and I've been
doing these practices my mind is so creative at this
point that it's actually exhausting it's exhausting because I'm pummeled
every week I'm puddled by by so many new ideas
that I could follow up on business ideas and how
I could transform the world how I can earn millions
of dollars it's just it's too much I don't have
enough time to actualize all that I would need ten
lifetimes for it I have to be very selective about
that see so this extremely practical and we're just we're
just getting to the to the tip of the iceberg
of the practicality of it and I haven't even mentioned
your health for example your psychological health or your your
physical health all of that is affected and if you're
a theoretician one of the things you face is you
face the danger of depression of getting stuck and mired
in all your concepts because your understanding so much about
reality but even though you understand all this stuff it's
just turning into the sort of brain fog you're walking
around with all these concepts but your body isn't really
growing along with all the stuff that's in your head
so you're sort of disconnecting yourself from your emotions you're
disconnecting yourself from your physical body you're stressed out you're
not able to relax you're not able to be at
peace your mind is always in a monkey mind mode
you're always thinking in the future always in the past
can't be present see so there are tons and tons
of of practical ramifications here that we haven't even begun
to to elucidate the ball but even though we're wrapping
up part one here there's gonna be a part two
so stay tuned for part two that will be released
soon and in part two there's still more to talk
about I really want to focus on how Western intellectual
tradition actually fears paradox there's a rich tradition in the
West of fearing paradox and actively hiding paradox and I
want to talk about why that's the case why it
happens the deep reasons and I want to show you
examples of how that works and I'm gonna show you
examples of how in science and in math actually Western
rational thinkers have been sweeping these paradoxes under the rug
hiding them from you precisely because they pose some some
threats to the entire establishment of science and rationality and
philosophy so stick around for that that's it for here

philosophical topics that I cover what that will do is
that will then make you sort of fertile soil in
which seeds can be planted which can then be nurtured
and grown i have already shared many practices with you
which you can start to practice to transform your life
in radical ways if if you want something very practical
go to actualize that our own slash start and you
will see a list of practices there and lots of
videos to get you started in this process so there's
a lot of practical stuff there but also i'll be
sharing a lot more practical stuff practical techniques that you
can use in future one of the challenges i have
when one of my sort of missions and visions for
use i want to share techniques with you that are
so radical that you are not going to be able
to do these techniques if you're operating under the materialist
rationalist paradigm so a lot of the time that I
spend shooting these long complex philosophical videos is just to
open your mind up because I know how stuck you
are in your mind we to open your mind up
first then once we've done that then we can start
to introduce techniques to you and then you'll be more
open to those techniques and then as you start to
practice those techniques it's gonna create this sort of positive
feedback loop you see because when you have a rigid
mind with rigid theory that prevents you from actually going
out there and practicing radical techniques that can transform your
mind but when your mind opens that allows you to
now go and explore new techniques so you go explore
those techniques and practices and those in turn reflect back
and change your mind and change your ideology and open
your mind even more so as you practice more of
these new techniques that opens your mind more but as
your mind opens more you open yourself up to even
more powerful and advanced techniques and so it just creates
this positive feedback loop you see so the theory of
the practice of course they all feed into each other
there's no difference between theory and practice that's a duality
that people use to keep themselves stuck and all dualities
of course by this point you should realize our gonna
break down including the one between theory and practice and
as you do more of the practices I really want
you to start doing the practices because if you like
the theory you gotta start doing the practices because if
you're just gonna ignore the practices and just listen to
the theory eventually what's gonna happen is that at some
point you're gonna get disgusted with the theory because it's
gonna start to seem like only all you do is
just talk about theory what's the point well the point
is if you're doing your practices the theory I talked
about will deepen your practices and deepen your insights and
deepen your understanding in ways that are gonna be very
beautiful and very profound and very enriching for your entire
practice so the theory is sort of like a treat
for those people who are doing the practices but then
people who don't do any practices just learn the theory
and then they engage in mental masturbation and they don't
take any action well those people are gonna suffer so
don't be one of those people start doing the practices
now I've already told you what all the practices are
stop asking me what the practices are you know what
the practices are you just don't want to do them
cuz you're lazy I know because I I've been there
I know how that works theory is much easier than
practice because you can just sit back and read books
or just watch videos for hours on hours on end
that's fun and you need a certain amount of that
when you're getting started but then start doing the practices
too you
