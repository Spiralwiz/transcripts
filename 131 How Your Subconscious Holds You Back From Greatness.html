            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/glOobHQndJA' target='_blank'>How Your Subconscious Holds You Back From Greatness</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Subconscious shaping behavior</b>: Leo shares a personal anecdote about dropping a mushroom while cooking and his subconscious desire to not waste it, leading him to question why he had such a strong impulse to reuse the mushroom off the floor. He has made a conscious rule now to throw away any dropped food, which is not motivated by cleanliness, but by the desire to overcome a deeper issue of scarcity.
</li><li><b>Scarcity mindset and childhood influence</b>: Leo links his reaction to the mushroom incident to a greater issue of scarcity, specifically to his upbringing where money was a source of conflict and created a sense of insecurity. Despite being in a financially stable position now, he realizes that he still operates from a mental model of scarcity.
</li><li><b>Working on scarcity mindset</b>: He is actively trying to reprogram his scarcity mindset which hinders him from proper investments in business or life purposes. Leo highlights how this scarcity mindset is not just about money or food, but symbolizes a deeper-rooted issue; it could hinder people from living life purposefully.
</li><li><b>Impact of Scarcity mindset on Life Purpose</b>: Leo shares that his scarcity mindset has held him back from discovering his life purpose. He emphasizes his hang-up about wanting to be assured about the financial aspect before pursuing something he is passionate about and believes in. He acknowledges that these limiting beliefs are rooted in his childhood but continues to actively work on changing them.
</li><li><b>Limiting Beliefs from Childhood</b>: Leo expresses that past experiences and limiting beliefs from his childhood continue to affect him. He acknowledges the need for active participation in overcoming these beliefs, predicting it may take years of focused effort.
</li><li><b>Wealth Psychology</b>: Leo has identified a need to engage with the field of wealth psychology in order to better understand his personal attitudes towards wealth and his related underlying triggers. He plans to read books and engage in exercises designed to address and rectify limiting beliefs about money.
</li><li><b>Importance of Security</b>: According to Leo, feeling secure is vital for venturing out of one's comfort zone. He alludes to studies where children only feel comfortable exploring new environments when their mother's presence provides a sense of security. He connects this concept to adults not taking risks in life because of their lack of security regarding their finances.
</li><li><b>Effect on Other Life Areas</b>: Leo acknowledges that his issues with money have limited him not just in business but also in his overall life purpose. He expects that overcoming these issues will offer a significant boost in life areas.
</li><li><b>Addressing Subconscious Hang-ups</b>: He encourages listeners to address any hang-ups they may have in various aspects of life such as money, relationships, social life, and health. These hang-ups often come from childhood experiences, but Leo asserts that they can be overcome through personal development work. 
</li><li><b>Availability of Resources</b>: There are many resources and tools available to help individuals overcome their hang-ups, regardless of the severity of these issues. He advises his audience to reflect on and identify possible hindrances in their lives. 
</li><li><b>Engagement with Commenters</b>: Leo appreciates feedback from his viewers and encourages them to engage with his content by liking, sharing, and commenting on it.
</li><li><b>Declaration of Free Resources</b>: Gura encourages viewers to visit actualized.org for more free resources and advanced material for personal development.
