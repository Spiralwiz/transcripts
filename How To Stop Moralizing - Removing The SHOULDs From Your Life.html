Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to talk about should statements and how they're
ruining your life, and how you can stop guilt, shame,
bitterness, and blaming. This episode is really a continuation of
last week's episode, which was entitled a rant against morality.
And that episode was pretty foundational. So I recommend that
if you haven't watched it, go watch it first, then
come back here, because what we're gonna talk about today
is we're gonna talk about the practical applications of the
sort of philosophical stuff I talked about morality, last time.
All right, so we're going to build on that, we're
going to show you how to actually now use some
of those concepts to eliminate things like guilt, or bitterness
towards the world or towards other people, or blaming other
people for situations, and all that kind of stuff. Right,
I'm going to give you one really powerful insight here,
it's almost magical, this insight. When you fully realize this
insight, it will radically transform the quality of your day
to day life. That's the power of can have. And
it's very, very simple. And it's actually quite simple to
apply as well. But first, a little bit of the
explanation. So actually, I want to tell a story, which
is my ex girlfriend, I had a girlfriend few years
back. And we saw each other a lot. And the
problem, though, is that it was impossible to maintain a
relationship with this woman. And the reason was, and I
only figured this out, after maybe a year or two
of being with her, I slowly started to piece together
her backstory kind of like, what was what was your
childhood like? And you know, how did she grew up
and what was her family like, and so forth. And
what I was able to kind of piece together and
I'm, I'm kind of speculating, but this is kind of
the best that I was able to figure out is
that her mother was extremely moralistic with her and filled
her mind from the very beginning of her life, with
all sorts of ideas about what should and shouldn't happen
in life, what's right, and what's wrong. And this is
what I call moralism. And so she fed her with
all these shoulds payments. And she continues to feed her
with the should statements for all of her childhood and
into her teenage years, and even now still as an
adult. And so what happened with my girlfriend is that
she had all these very rigid ideas about how life
should be what's right, what's wrong, what she should do
what she shouldn't do. And it was kind of sad,
sad to me, because that's not how I was raised.
I was raised in a sort of very kind of
like, laid back environment. Right? For her, it was like
the opposite. And also, there was like elements of Christianity
in there. So there's religion, you know, thrown into the
mix there. And her mother was a very neurotic person.
So of course, this neurosis that her mother had, was
transferred to her. Because the neurotic, acts neurotically the child
learns neurosis from observing that parents behaviors, and then the
child thinks that that's normal, right? But then what happens
is that the child grows up to become an adult,
and then the adult can't function. Because every step in
life that she tried to take, there were all these
like limitations, and rules and things she couldn't do anything
she had to do and how she had to look
and how she had to be and what her weight
was supposed to be like, and what relationships were supposed
to be like, and what ideas were supposed to be
right. And all that. And that was very unfortunate, because
it made it impossible to be in a relationship with
her. So I'm just saying that is a little backstory
here. But what I really want to talk about is
I want to talk about what I call should statements.
What are should statements, should statements are basically any time
in your life where you or somebody else tells you,
you should do X, or you should do Y or
you should not do z. Now, on the surface, these
statements appear very innocent. And in fact, they appear as
though they're well intentioned. It's like, well, yeah, I mean,
how else can we live a good life, other than
by telling ourselves what we should and shouldn't do? We'll
circle back around to some of these questions, and we'll
address them as we go on here. But let me
give you a list of short statements so that you
understand exactly what I'm talking about. And here I'm going
to focus mostly on the practical secular should statements that
you make in your life. So I'm not talking about
religious stuff. I'm talking about everyday kind of stuff. So
here's some examples. So you get an idea. People should
be nice to me. Children should respect their parents. People
shouldn't steal from me. Politicians shouldn't lie to me. Corporations
shouldn't be so greedy. I shouldn't be so lazy. I
shouldn't watch so much TV. I shouldn't masturbate. My mom
shouldn't be so stubborn. People should be more understanding. People
should be more tolerant. My girlfriend, she should stay in
shape. And she shouldn't be fat. I shouldn't eat donuts,
and I should stay in shape. And I shouldn't be
fat. I should wake up earlier in the day, I
should meditate better, my boss should work harder, and he
should be competent. My business should be more successful, I
should be earning a bigger paycheck. Okay, so that's just
a random assortment of very common every day, ordinary should
statements. Notice that we have some statements that say I
should, or people should. And also, we have some statements
that say I shouldn't, or people shouldn't. So all those
I count as should statements. Now, here's the magical insight
that will radically increase the happiness in your life, if
you can embody it. But I warn you that you're
gonna resist this. And it's gonna seem very counterintuitive to
you. And in fact, it's gonna seem like it's crazy.
It is. Stop making should statements. That's it. That's the
whole insight. So if you want to boil down everything
I say, in this entire episode, it just boils down
to this, stop making should statements in your life. Just
stop it, cut it out. Now, as simple as that
is, there's big problems with this, because like I said,
it seems very counterintuitive. And you don't understand why you
should do this. And there's a lot of room for
misinterpretation of what this really means. And why I'm making
this suggestion. Right. So the first warning I have to
issue to you is that notice that I did not
say you should stop making should statements. I said you
can stop. Do you notice the subtle difference? It's subtle,
but very significant. I'm not saying to you stop making
should statements as though they're wrong and evil, and you
should stop doing it. I didn't say that. What I'm
saying is that if you want to live a better
life, and you want to be happier, consider this option
that you have, which is to realize that your should
statements are limiting you and that you can stop them.
You don't have to if you don't want to don't
do it. If you feel like they're benefiting you keep
them Do you see the difference? I'm giving you an
option. I'm not moralizing to you. I'm not preaching you.
I'm not telling you that you're gonna go to hell.
If you don't listen to me, I'm not telling you
that you're wrong, for not listening to me, I'm just
telling you that your life won't be as nice as
it could be. Now, that's a factual statement. And I
can back that up, and psychology can back us up.
And if you've been following along with me, and you've
been doing this consciousness work that I'll be talking about,
then you can verify all this stuff for yourself. So
you don't have to believe me about any of this.
Now, the question is, why? Why are should statements problematic.
And this brings me to one of the most important
insights that I learned over the last year, which is
that the world is exactly as it should be. That's
a huge insight. It seems simple and obvious. But it's
hugely significant if you really plumb the depths of it,
which I want to help you to do here. And
by the way, I want to give credit to Byron
Katie, who helped me to see the importance and significance
of this insight. And then of course, I also followed
it up with my own work, meditation, work consciousness work
that I do. So it wasn't just like me reading
it in a book. I had to connect the dots
and pray Just didn't implement this in my life to
see that the world is exactly how it should be.
What this means is that the world should not be
any other way than it is. Let me repeat that.
Because this is super counterintuitive. And on first glance, you're
not going to want to believe it or accept it.
But what I'm saying is that the world should not
be any other way than it is. Now, how can
I say such a ridiculously seeming claim? Well, it's just
a matter of reality. And I spent a bit of
time explaining this in the prior episode. So go check
that one out, if you really want to go into
the depths of all the kind of metaphysics of it,
I don't want to get too deep into it here.
But basically, you have to look at reality. And what
reality tells us is that what is is what is
and then it's up to us, whether we accept it
or not. But whether you do accept it, or you
don't accept it, it still remains the same, it remains
as it is, right? Reality simply is exactly what it
is, it's like, it's just that simple. You just have
to care enough about reality, to want to see it
for what it actually is, when you tell yourself, that
reality should be some other way. What that actually is,
is that's an idea in your mind, that's a fantasy.
That's a story you tell yourself, that's a limited expectation
that you set upon reality. Based on your ego, and
the agenda that you have, right, you're living in light
as an organism, you have an agenda, primarily your agenda
is to survive, and to reproduce, that is your agenda.
But this agenda is not just limited to those two
things. These two things are played out in your entire
life, everything you do, from raising your children, to going
to work, to having fun with your friends, to reading
a book, all of these things, you have to recognize
that they're all related to this self agenda of survival
and reproduction. So when I say survival and reproduction, this
is not just a very limited kind of like Darwinian
notion. This is a very broad all encompassing notion, which
basically encompasses your entire existence. It's mostly designed for you
to survive and reproduce. Right? So from that perspective, when
you look upon reality, it looks as though Well, certain
things shouldn't be the way that they are. Why not
because they're not conducive to your particular survival or reproduction
needs. For example, the world should not have violence, according
to you, because violence doesn't serve yourself agenda, se. But
if you zoom out for a second, and you try
to be little bit objective, and you look at the
world, from the world's point of view, rather than your
egoic point of view, then what you realize is that
the world doesn't care about whether you survive or not,
or whether you reproduce or not, the world is running
kind of on its own terms. Right? The world is
not limited to your perspective, or any other person's perspective,
or even the combined perspectives of humanity, the world is
not limited to that either. Right? The world kind of
has a God's eye view perspective, you might say. And
from that perspective, what is is exactly what should be
if this notion is difficult for you to accept, or
to really grasp, is because you have to realize that
from your very childhood, you were told, things that you
should and shouldn't do. So these things were put imprinted
into you, and you've been indoctrinated with them. Right from
childhood, from the very beginning of your life, your parents
were telling you what you should and shouldn't do. And
they were doing it from this kind of, like moralistic
perspective. You know, they told you that children shouldn't do
drugs and children shouldn't have sex. And you know, you
shouldn't eat too much candy and you shouldn't masturbate. You
shouldn't watch television, and you shouldn't pick your nose in
public. And you should wear a safety belt when you're
in the car. And you should respect your parents and
you should be nice to people, and you shouldn't be
angry all the time. And you shouldn't be sad. And
so on and so on. So on, right all these
rules, they filled your life with all these rules, and
you just swallowed them up because well, you had no
choice. And now those rules are running you The problem
though, is that these rules, they're overly simplistic. They're so
overly simplistic that you can't actually use these rules. To
live a high quality life. To live a high quality
life, you have to live it consciously, consciously means you
have to actually assess situations in a nuanced, gray scale
sort of way, not in a black and white way.
It's not always wrong to eat candy. And it's not
always wrong to have sex. And it's not always wrong
to get a divorce. And it's not always wrong to
go partying at night. And it's not always wrong to
do some drugs. You see, the problem is that all
these shoulds and rules, there are way, way, way too
simplified for living real life. Not only that, but these
rules are not grounded in anything. You can try to
ground them in the Bible, or in the 10 commandments
or in God or in some Kantian notion of the
moral imperative. You can grant try to justify these rules.
But the bottom line is, if you look at what
these where these rules come from, you see that they're
arbitrarily created. So this is something you don't believe me
on, you can actually, look, look, where are your rules
coming from? Why are you accepting them? Right? This is
where questioning of dogmas and questioning of beliefs, this concept
that I talked a lot about, in other episodes, this
comes into real importance here. Because you really have to
start to question actually question. Where did this rule come
from? For example, if I have a rule, like my
business should be earning more money? Where did that rule
come from? Where did that expectation come from? Who said
so? Who said my business should be earning more money?
Maybe? Could it possibly be true that my business should
be earning exactly as much money as it currently is?
No more and no less? What about that? Could that
be a possibility? So you have to sit down actually
question this stuff. But um, but the way we're raised,
this is really not open to questioning. And especially, I
want to point out that there are some extremely moralistic
cultures out there. Especially certain Eastern or Asian cultures, because
they come from a tradition of, for example, being heavily
influenced by the philosophy of Confucius, you know, Confucius, Confucian
ism, in, in China and in Asian thinking is a
huge, huge, powerful force, moral force that goes back over
2000 years, to the point where people growing up in
China now don't even know how deep this is rooted
in their, in their culture, unless they study this stuff.
And it's not acknowledged, that's an arbitrary cultural norm that
was set 2000 years ago. That's not acknowledged, when you
study Confucius in China. When you study Confucius in China,
I imagine, it's just taught to you as though it's
the law, as though it's how it's supposed to be.
Likewise, for example, with Islam in the Middle East, and
in the Middle East, you know, that's also a very
highly moralistic culture, where certain values are like, mandated, for
example, the value of family loyalty, and loyalty to your
parents, this is mandated, you would be the devil, you
will be a social outcast. If you challenge this notion,
that parent or that family is of supreme importance, or
that your parents should be respected. Right? These are things
that are just like laid down as law, and it's
never questioned. I mean, you can be in the Middle
East, and you can study where these should originated from.
And you might trace them back down to the Koran
or something. But it's never acknowledged that that was an
arbitrary, an arbitrary cultural norm that was that. Right? It's
grounded in something probably metaphysical or supernatural, right to justify
it. So if you do come from one of these
extremely moralistic cultures Watch out. And I mean, those two
are not the only cultures. There's others and there's plenty
of moralism that goes on in every society, even in
first world societies, and in United States and in Europe.
There's still plenty of this going on. What you need
to do in those cases, you need to read really
questioned the dogmas despite your tendency to not want to
test it and look for yourself. So let me give
you an example here of how we can determine that
what I'm saying is correct. So go ahead right now
and pick a common should statement that you notice yourself
saying to yourself. So, select any one you want, that
is common to you. I'm going to use the example
of something like, I should go to the gym. So
as I'm speaking, I'm gonna be using this example, you
can just substitute my example with your example. Right? So
let's say that the should statement I tell myself is
I should go to the gym. And it's like, you
know, I have to I have to go to the
gym, you know, it's not, it's not okay for me
to be fat, it's not okay for me to be
lazy, it's not okay for me to be overweight, I
have to go, if I don't go Leo, I'm going
to become a lazy slob, I'm going to be fat,
like all those fat people. And I don't want that.
So I have to go to the gym, I should
go to the gym. Okay, now, whatever your statement is.
Notice it. And now what I want you to do
is I want you to actually flip it around. So
turn it into its exact opposite. So if I were
to do that, with this gym example, I would say,
instead of I should go to the gym, I'll say
I shouldn't go to the gym. I shouldn't go to
the gym. And now just leave a little room to
pause and to soak that in. I shouldn't go to
the gym, and just notice what kind of resistance comes
up in you to that statement. There will probably be
some resistance, but also notice. If you're very mindful, you'll
notice that it actually feels truer than your original statement.
So if your example was for example, I should be
respectful of my parents, let's say that you should statement.
Now I'm telling you to flip it around. So now
it's like I shouldn't be respectful to my parents. And
at first glance is like, I shouldn't be respectful to
my parents. Oh, no. That's horribly wrong. But stay with
it. And you'll notice that actually, it feels more true.
Now, what do I mean by this? I don't mean
that you should never now be respectful to your parents.
What we mean here is that not always, should you
be respectful to your parents, not always should I go
to the gym. That's an arbitrary rule that I have
set upon life. And the fact is that life is
more complicated than that. And you know what, sometimes I
shouldn't go to the gym. And sometimes I shouldn't be
respectful to my parents. That's reality, that actually feels fucking
real, rather than the cartoon version of life that you're
living in the moralistic model of the universe is very
overly simplified. What I'm telling you to do is to,
is to let go of that, and start to live
in a sort of gray scale version of the universe,
rather than a black and white one. And to acknowledge
that all of your should statements are actually fantasy. And
in fact, the more you insist that something should be
the case, or something shouldn't be the case, the more
of a fantasy it fucking is, because the only reason
you insist on it so much, is because you're afraid
of what would happen if you let it go. So
fundamentally, you're acting from a place of insecurity, neurosis and
fear, a self actualized person who's secure in himself, and
who's secure in his dealings with the world and his
relationship with the people. He doesn't need strict laws and
rules to do the quote unquote, right things. You see,
he doesn't need to always tell us to tell himself,
I have to go to the gym. He doesn't need
to do that. Only someone who really doesn't want to
go to the gym in secret, has to say to
himself, I should go to the gym and really be
insistent about it. And someone who is respectful of his
parents in a genuine authentic fashion and genuinely desires that
does not need a law or a rule that tells
them you have to be respectful your parents see So,
the basic idea here is that any should statement, you
have just flip it around to its opposite. And notice
that it actually is truer and more real and less
of a cartoon version of reality than what you had
before. And that should sort of nullify, or make this
thing obsolete. Now, it's still, it's still difficult to swallow
some of these bitter pills that I'm feeding you here.
So I want to tackle this right head on, right?
Because to really grasp the significance of this, you're not
going to grasp it unless we give you a lot
of examples. So here's what I want to do, I
want to give you a list of common should statements
that are very common for most people, and which are
going to be very hard for you to accept. They're
polar opposites. Okay. So here we go. He should treat
me better, or she should treat me better. Do you
believe that he should treat me better, like my boyfriend
or my boss should treat me better? So now we
flip it around. And it becomes he or she should
not treat me better. Now, that's reality, the idea that
people should treat you better. That's fantasy. The reality is,
is that sometimes people will not treat you well. That's
the reality. How about the next one, I should be
good. Or I shouldn't be bad. You tell yourself that.
So what's the opposite of that? I shouldn't be good.
And I should be bad. That's a really difficult one
to swallow. But notice that it actually feels more real.
The reality is that you should not be good, and
that you should be bad. Not that you now always
are bad, but that's sometimes you will be bad. And
sometimes you won't be good. And to expect so is
to set yourself up for neurosis. And to insist on
it being so just shows you that you don't have
a natural desire to be good. And that you have
a natural desire to be bad. Right, you're defending something.
Notice that each one of these should statements is a
defense. It's a reluctance. It's a resistance towards something. About
this next one, I shouldn't feel blank. I shouldn't feel
sad. I shouldn't feel angry. I shouldn't feel guilty. I
shouldn't feel afraid. I shouldn't feel whatever. How often you
tell yourself that a lot, probably many times per day.
But the reality is what the reality is that you
should feel angry, you should feel sad, you should feel
guilty, you should feel afraid. Right? The opposite of it
is more true. Sometimes you should feel that way. What
about people should like me? Do you have that expectation
that everyone should like you? What's the reality? The reality
is the exact opposite is that people shouldn't like you.
How about, he shouldn't cheat on me, or she shouldn't
cheat on me. Oh, man, that's a really difficult one
to swallow. But look at this. We flip it around
and turns into, he should cheat on me. She should
cheat on me. And that's the reality. If you're telling
yourself that people shouldn't cheat on you in relationships, you're
kidding yourself. It's a joke. You're denying the fact that
people do cheat. That's the reason you tell yourself so
adamantly, and so self righteously, that he or she shouldn't
cheat. The reason you do it is to resist the
reality that people do cheat. You see this? That's exactly
why it's so bitter to swallow for you. How about
this one people shouldn't break the law. Do you get
self righteous about that when people break the law do
something illegal? Well, what's the reality? The reality is that
people should break the law. Why? Because they do. And
that's something for you to accept. Not to resist. How
about people should be more considerate? You ever say to
Seder is all that guy is such a bastard, he
should have been more considerate of me. Well, the reality
is that he shouldn't have been more considerate of you
He shouldn't have. Why? Because he wasn't? How about my
kids shouldn't do drugs? Well, the reality is that your
kids should do drugs. Why? Because they did them. If
they did drugs, that means they should have done them.
That's the reality, you have to accept that you have
been denied. And the reason that you're so hard on
your kids for doing drugs, is because you don't want
to accept that kids should do drugs. In fact, maybe
you want to look back on your past. And see,
when you were a kid, did you do drugs? Now
it's irrelevant whether you did or didn't? If you did,
I mean, it's blatant hypocrisy. But even if you didn't,
even if you say, Leo, you know, when I was
a student, I went through high school and, and college
and I didn't do a single drug. So that's proof
that kids shouldn't do drugs. No, it's not. That's proof
that you shouldn't do drugs. That's not proof that your
kids shouldn't do drugs. How do we know? Because if
your kids actually did drugs, then that's the proof that
they should have done them. That's reality. The only proof
there is is reality, your fantasies and your ideas and
opinions about what should be is not proof of anything.
You see, I could have a fantasy that I should
be a billionaire living on a tropical island sipping a
pina colada with a with a jet that comes by
and flies me to Europe. And there I have hot
women rubbing me with oil. I could have that fantasy,
but it doesn't mean that that's what's real. And it
doesn't mean that that's what should be. Right? Your Your
situation is no less ridiculous than that. Know that you
think you think that you feel should statements that you
hold are somehow more nuanced, and more practical, and are
more realistic than the example their ludicrous example that I
just gave you, but actually, they're not. They're just as
ludicrous. You've just tricked yourself over the years to believe
them? Because they seem so commonplace, because this is how
society functions. Because this is how your parents function. Because
it's how your whole family function. This is how your
friends function. This is how at school, everything worked at
school this way, it is how stuff works at your
job. So you're like a fish in water? You don't
see the water? How about a should statement like he
shouldn't lie, or she shouldn't lie? Well, the reality is
that he or she should lie, because people lie all
the time. That's the reality. Don't kid yourself about that.
And also notice that you lie all the time, too.
How about a statement like I should be more confident?
Do you have confidence issues? Are you shy? Well, have
you considered that maybe you shouldn't be more confident? And
that you should remain shy? Doesn't that feel more true?
Than the opposite? And the last one, which I really
like is I shouldn't feel frustrated when I meditate. Do
you have a meditation habit? Do you feel frustrated when
you meditate? Do you feel like you're overthinking everything? Like
I should not think so much. I shouldn't overthink, I
should just be calm and peaceful. I shouldn't be frustrated
when I meditate. Well, what's the reality? The reality is
that you should feel frustrated when you meditate. And if
you take on meditation as a lifelong practice, with the
expectation that you should be frustrated, you're gonna have a
lot better time, it'll go a lot easier for you
that if you do that, and you have the expectation
that you should not be frustrated, because you're fighting reality.
In all these situations, the problem is that you're fighting
reality. And the reason that this magical insight that I
gave you, which is just to drop your should statements,
the reason that this has any power whatsoever, is because
it works by helping you to accept what is and
to stop resisting. It's like you've been tensed up and
you've been resisting your whole life. And now I'm giving
you permission to let go. And that's at the same
time very liberating, but also very scary. It's very scary
because now you have all these objections about you will
Lea, what's gonna happen to the world? If if everybody
let's go, you know, what's gonna happen to my life?
What's gonna happen to my kids? You're saying all these
things, you know, but what happens when your kids start
doing drugs? I know you have a lot of these
objections, I'm going to cover them in a minute, right.
But I want to say a few more things about
truth statements here. So what we're having you do is
we're having you acknowledge your humanity and your imperfection. Because
what should that statements do is they put an ideal,
like an ideal picture in your mind of what you
should be like. And it's a picture of perfection. So
you should be perfect, you should be perfect, wait, you
should be perfect financial, you should be have a perfect
career, you should have perfect emotions, you should have a
perfect marriage, you should have perfect kids, you should have
perfect everything. But this is fantasy. This is fantasy. Nothing
will ever be perfect. At least not in your, by
your definition of perfection. We can redefine perfection, with reality.
And we can say what's perfect is what's real. That's
a lot more healthy than the way you're going about
it now redefine perfection as reality. So if it's real,
it's perfect. And there's nothing to resist. If it's real,
there's no need to resist it. If it's real, accept
it. Okay, so turn your resistance in on itself. Here's
the problem with should statements is that they make you
feel obligated to do things. You're not doing things out
of natural desire, but out of obligation. And then that
actually feeds your resistance in life. So if you have
motivation problems, this is why it also puts you out
of integrity with yourself. It makes you feel conflicted, because
you have to deny genuine desires that you have. Sometimes
you might have a desire to eat a doughnut when
you shouldn't. And sometimes you have a might have a
desire to cheat on your girlfriend or boyfriend even though
you shouldn't. Those, we might say those are bad desires,
we shouldn't have such desires. But what's the reality? The
reality is that we have these desires. So what we
need to do is we need to take your picture
of reality and bring it closer to reality, ideally, to
the point where the picture and reality merge, and they're
like this, they're a one, one to one correspondence relationship,
right? But right now, that's not what you've got. Right
now what you've got is you've got this super idealized
cartoon caricature version of heaven of reality, and then you've
got real reality. And then, of course, you've got this
giant gulf between the two. And you wonder why your
life is so frustrating and painful and has all this
suffering. And it Well, it's because you're expecting this, but
you're getting this. See? Also, when you should a lot,
you make yourself angry, you're going to experience a lot
of guilt, you're gonna experience shame, you're going to experience
bitterness towards things in the world, because how could you
not, if you expect reality to be something other than
what is given to you as, of course, you're gonna
feel angry, of course, you're going to feel bitter. Of
course, you're gonna feel guilty when you don't live up
to your own super idealized expectations of what you should
and shouldn't do. To eliminate guilt, simply drop all your
rules about how you should be and accept yourself as
you are. And then no more guilt as possible. Also
recognize that what you resist persists. So anything that you
think you're resisting for some noble purpose, like, let's say
you're resisting sex because of, you don't want to break
up your marriage, and you're resisting food, because you don't
want to be fat. And you're resisting being mean to
people, because you don't want to do something bad. Okay?
That's just going to keep you in resistance for the
rest of your life. That means your problems will never
get solved. They will never be brought out into the
light of consciousness. The problem will remain submerged in your
subconscious and it will keep sticking you in the sciatica
form for the rest of your life. Right. And you're
not going to be able to perfectly hold it back
either. The more you resist the temptation for sex, the
more tempted you will be, and eventually that's going to
lead to a catastrophic situation. That's the reality. If you
don't like it tough, that's the thing that needs to
be fixed, is you not liking it. I'm not saying
you're gonna like what I'm telling you. That's where the
work happens. Again, it's a matter of internal versus external
work. See, most people think that these problems get resolved
on the outside. No, they get resolved on the inside,
by biting the bullet and seeing that the only problem
is the fact that you're resisting what I'm telling you
know, the problem with should statements is they make you
feel trapped. Like I was talking about my ex girlfriend,
you know, she felt very trapped in life. Because when
you have all these rules, telling you what you can
and can't do that, it's like, every one of those
rules is an extra ball and chain that's tied to
you. And not in a good way. Because it limits
your ability to be fully conscious. It's only when you
have full freedom. That then you can apply full consciousness
to make deliberate choices, strategic choices about how you want
your life to go. When you get used to just
following rules blindly, that's when you really get into trouble.
And one of the big problems with that is that
you now have improper motivation in life, you're now negatively
motivated, you're motivated by all the things you shouldn't do.
You're motivated by obligations. And to such a degree, that
when I tell this to people, what I described this
whole, this whole should topic to people. Then they asked
me questions like, well, Leo, if I don't shoot myself
to death, how do I get anything accomplished? How will
I ever be motivated? I'm going to be a lazy
slob. Yeah, because the only source of motivation you've known
for your whole life is this improper neurotic form of
motivation, which is like you kicking yourself in the ass.
That's a highly neurotic form of motivation. You can't really
achieve anything great in life. Through that kind of motivation,
you're guaranteed to stall out. And to sabotage yourself, in
those situations, you need positive motivations that I want you
to start to notice. Throughout your day, as you're going
through your day, I want you to notice that every
time you make a should statement it's leading to suffering
into pain in your life. In some way it is.
Because an artificial limit that you don't really need. And
I want you to notice how bad the habit is.
I want you to notice that you just even when
you want to stop, you still can't stop. You're really
addicted. It's a terrible habit like smoking. Right? You're addicted
to it. But imagine for a second a totally new
paradigm for living life. So let's say that your paradigm
is this moralistic should paradigm. What's the alternative? The alternative
is this. Imagine for a moment that your life contains
no shoulds statements anymore. And try to imagine now how
you would feel in all the following areas of your
life. How would you feel about the gym, about nutrition,
about parenting, about finances and money, about politics, about sex,
about drugs, about relationships, about your work schedule, about your
career or your business? About being a nice person. How
would you feel about religion? What would your attitude be
towards murder, theft, rape, abuse and terrorism? Be careful here
not to bring in your old paradigm and not to
judge this from the old paradigm. It would be a
mistake to say, well, you know, Leo, if I didn't
have any should statements, that means I think terrorism wouldn't
be bad. That means terrorism would be good. That means
I would become a terrorist. No, that's preposterous. That would
not happen. That's fucking stupid. The reality. If you want
to take it to this extreme, you're talking about terrorism.
What would happen if you actually adopted this paradigm that
I'm telling you, and you had no short statements? When
you saw terrorism, what would happen is that you would
still have a negative reaction towards it if you're normal.
person, you have a negative reaction towards violence, because that's
how the human mind is wired. But you shouldn't have
any shoulds about it right. So you wouldn't moralize or
condemn terrorists. You wouldn't call them evil, you wouldn't get
into a fury about it, you wouldn't get angry or
pissed off, you just recognize that that's not the kind
of behavior or the kind of society that you want
to live in. Right? And you would probably be supportive
of efforts to try to stop terrorism, you'd have no
problem with those efforts. You'd want bigger police force, you'd
maybe want a military presence in the area to curtail
terrorism, you'd probably be okay with all that. And, and
that's it. That's it, you would have no, you'd have
no bitterness towards it, you'd have no self righteousness, there
wouldn't be a whole ego complex about how you're better
than the terrorist and how the terrorists are doing these
evil acts. And how dare they, you know, what about
what about Islamic Islam is creating more terrorists in the
United go to this whole fury. There'll be none of
that. There will just be sort of calm, cool, very
kind of like rational, but grounded, common sense approach to
terrorism and so on, with all these other areas in
your life. Right? Not only that, but you would actually
understand, you would say, oh, you know, I can kind
of see the world from the terrorists perspective, I can
kind of understand why they're pissed off, I can kind
of understand why they're doing what they're doing. I don't
agree with it, but I can kind of understand it.
I mean, they are human beings, they do have human
needs, I can see the factors that have led to
that to happen in the world. And I acknowledge it,
I accept it. That's how the world is that's what
reality is. Reality should have terrorism in it because it
does. And if I were to deny that I would
be living in a fantasy of my own arrogant egoic.
Limited. Self agenda. Prospective, see? Okay, so now let's tackle
some objections, common objections to everything I'm saying. So number
one is, Leo. But no, you've gone too far, you've
gone totally too far. Because what you're saying is, you're
saying that there are no wrong, there is no evil.
But really, Leo, there are things that are clearly evil,
like terrorists, and pedophiles and Hitler, and this and this
and that. I don't want to waste too much time
on this. Because I've talked about this in other places.
The reality is very simple, is that what you call
evil is the creation of your mind. Now, the acts
that you attach the label evil to those acts do
exist, but those acts are not evil. You may not
like them, and I may not like them. But what
we like or don't like, doesn't matter to reality. The
reality is that these acts exist. Whether you call them
evil or not, is irrelevant. What you think about them
is irrelevant. They exist. Are these things really wrong? No.
Because for something to be really wrong, there has to
be an ego that says so. Without an ego, without
a mind, there is no right or wrong. Plants and
Animals do not have notions of right and wrong only
humans do. The human ego has created this notion of
right and wrong. Now, I'm not telling you to believe
me, this is a fucking fact. Sit down and actually
examine what you believe is right and what you believe
is wrong. And look at where is it grounded in
and you'll notice that it's grounded in your ego. Okay,
I talked about other places, so I won't cover that
anymore. Here. second objection is but Leo. So then how
do I be good? Sounds like you're opening the doors
for me to be evil here. And the answer is,
you be good by following your desire. And you might
say, well, Leah, but what if my desire leads me
to be evil? Well, then it's going to happen anyways.
You are run by your desires, not by your moralistic
ideals. When are you going to acknowledge that when are
you gonna become mindful that your desires run you completely?
Including your moralistic ideals, you understand that your moralistic ideals
are actually coming from your desires? You cannot avoid this
problem. No matter how much you moralize to yourself, if
you have a desire to kill someone you will and
if you have a desire to rape someone you will
and if you have a desire to become terrorists, you
will anyways So let's stop pretending here that your morals
are actually preventing you from evil. They aren't. They're actually
enabling evil because you're repressing, and what you repress tends
to come out in greater force. So how do you
be good, you'll be good, but becoming accepting of reality,
to the point where you're not angry and bitter at
anyone anymore. And so now you don't need to do
anything bad to people. That's how you be good. Or
just follow your natural desires. For most people, their natural
desires lead them to be good. If anything gets in
your way, it's the moralizing. Also, notice that this idea
of being good, dropped this fucking idea. That's not what
life is about, is being good. This is completely artificial.
This is all part of your old paradigm, drop it.
Another objection people have to what I'm saying here is
they'll say, Well, how, how will I get things done,
Leo? Why don't I just become a lazy slob? And
again, the answer is, follow your desire. You're a lazy
slob now, because you keep telling yourself that you should
and shouldn't do stuff. being lazy is a function of
this shooting paradigm. Once you let go of that, and
you accept everything that is you accept all your natural
desires, you will have tons of valuable high quality, high
consciousness desires that come up within you, these desires will
lead to positive motivation, you will genuinely be passionate about
things and those things. Now you will follow those things.
And now you will have authentic motivation. And now you
will get more done than you could have possibly imagined
in your old paradigm. And it will come effortlessly. You
won't need to work or grind it out. It will
come effortlessly, because you're following your passions. But to follow
your passions, you need to first let go of all
the rules, because the rules tell you oh, well, you
can't be passionate about this. And you shouldn't be passionate
about that. And this desire here is wrong. And of
course, when you grew up your whole life, everybody telling
you all your desires are wrong. You're so disconnected from
your authentic desires. The now it feels like you can't
trust yourself and you can't trust your desires. You might
not even feel like you have desires. You do have
desires. But you're not gonna realize them until you let
go of this shooting paradigm. That's very, very important. It's
very important for you to get this one. The next
objection is Billy Oh, aren't you contradicting yourself? aren't you
telling me now that I should, I should do what
you're saying. And I, you know, I should stop shooting
on myself. And I should stop saying all these things.
And I should stop moralizing? No. Again, to see what
I'm saying from that perspective is coming from the old
paradigm. My point is not to really tell you to
never shoot again. My point is to tell you is
to accept yourself more and to change paradigms. And when
you apply what I'm telling you don't apply it in
a moralistic fashion. So I don't want you to wake
up in the morning and tell yourself Well, today, I
shouldn't make any short statements. That would be to totally
misunderstand what I'm saying. You need to change paradigms to
the point where you wake up in the morning. And
then a thought comes up such as I should have
woken up earlier today. You notice it because you're mindful
and conscious. You notice it and you say ah that's
a short statement. Oh, well. Yeah. What are you going
to do? Sometimes I should sometimes I make a silly
short statement. I know I shouldn't. I kind of know
that. It's hurting me in the long run. But you
know, I can't control myself. Sometimes I'll make a short
statement. Oh, well, On we go with the rest of
the day. It's a sort of laws a fair attitude,
right? You're chilling out rather than becoming neurotic. So I'm
not contradicting myself here. Another common objection is, well, Leo,
what about making reality better? So it sounds like you're
you know, you're saying that we shouldn't make reality better,
we should just accept everything that is so what would
have happened if we accepted slavery, and we accepted the
Nazis and we accept the terrorists and we accepted you
know, religious ideologies and we accepted wrong scientific models. What
if we accepted all this stuff? What would happen I
mean, society would self destruct it would be chaos. Know,
again, that's to miss interpret what I'm saying here. First,
you accept reality. then your desires, whatever those are, you
follow those, and they will naturally lead to change and
to the making of a better reality. You see? So
how do you make reality better? Well, if there's slavery,
you acknowledge that there's slavery, you acknowledge the reality you
don't resist it. And then if you have a natural
desire to end slavery, you follow it authentically. And you're
very effective and you stop slavery. See? How do you
make reality better? If there are Nazis around? Well, you
accept the Nazis. You acknowledge it as a reality. And
then if you deem it necessary to go to war
with them, you go to war with them. But here's
the difference. You don't call them evil? You don't build
a whole worldview where you demonize them. You just acknowledge
that? Hey, you know, I don't like Nazis. I don't
want to live around Nazis. I don't think the world
is a good place with Nazis in it. Not in
any moral sense. But just, you know, it's not a
it's not a pleasant place. When people are getting sent
to gas chambers. That's not the kind of world I
want. So yeah, I think it's worthwhile to maybe go
to war with these people. And to stop them. Okay,
fine. Do it that way. So you can make reality
better. And the same applies to your life, right? So
you might say to like, well, Leo, how do I
lose weight? How do I drop 50 pounds. If I
don't tell myself, I should stop eating donuts. And I
should, should go to the gym. Well, you completely change
paradigms, you let go of those shoulds. And you get
in touch with your authentic desire to be healthy. Rather
than all these obligations, when you get in touch with
your authentic desire to be healthy, you will naturally naturally
effortlessly desire to go to the gym, you will effortlessly
put down the donut, you won't need to fight yourself,
it won't be like, Oh, I have the door in
my hand. And now I have to like hold back,
I have to hold back from putting it in my
mouth. It won't be like that. It will be just
like, oh, donut. That's disgusting. Why would I put that
in my body? That's the mature, healthy, non neurotic version
of health. Right? And you will never by the way,
you will never keep your 50 pounds off. You will
never accomplish that goal through this neurotic should paradigm that
you're using now it's never going to happen. Even if
you lose the 50 pounds, you'll gain them back in
a couple of years, you will because you can't should
on yourself forever, at some point that that system is
inherently out of integrity. It's inherently going to break down
it's only a matter of time. So making reality better
is in abled by dropping your shifts enabled. Another common
question people have is well, okay, Leo. So what about
my kids? Should I stop telling my kids that they
should do stuff and shouldn't do other stuff? Well, first
of all, notice that you're still part of that paradigm
of shooting. So drop that. How do you raise your
kids? Base Basically, first of all, fix the shooting paradigm
and yourself. When you stop shooting yourself? Only then will
you be able to stop it with your kids. Is
it a Good Idea to stop shooting with your kids?
Yeah, it probably is. If you want healthy, emotionally mature
kids. Because if you shoot on them all the time,
then you're going to become neurotic. Now you might say
well, Leo, how do I set boundaries and rules? Notice,
I did not say that you can't set boundaries and
rules. This is a subtle distinction, but it's very important.
Listen to this. So let's say I have kids, I
don't have kids, but if I have kids, I probably
wouldn't want them doing drugs. Okay. So there's two ways
to go about that. One way is I say you
shouldn't do drugs, because drugs are bad. Yada yada, yada,
yada yada. Kids shouldn't do drugs. Never do drugs, don't
touch drugs. They're dangerous and they're bad. I could do
that. Or what I could do is I could say
I don't want you doing drugs. here here's the problems
with drugs. Here's some of the benefits of drugs. Here's
some reasons why drugs are done. If you do drugs
When you're very young, that could screw up your whole
life. Now go do whatever you want to do. That
would be the more mature adult way to raise kids,
right? Notice, notice the honesty here. It's basically just a
fact, matter of honesty. Because if I tell them that
they should never do drugs, I'm basically lying to them.
lying to them, I'm presenting a one sided version of
this option that they have. Right? The fact is that
they could have legitimate reasons for wanting to do drugs,
they could, now you make that decision for them, you're
denying them their their freedom to live consciously, right? When
you give yourself your kids a bunch of rules their
whole life, that means you don't train them to make
decisions, you don't train them to be wise, they just
follow your stupid rules. And then eventually, those rules. Teach
them that the only way to live through life is
by following rules, and that there's no other way. When
in fact, the way you want to live life is
consciously let your kid make important decisions. And be honest
about the fact that if you don't want them doing
drugs, that's, that's your opinion. So I don't want you
doing drugs that's very different from you should not do
drugs, because when you tell them you should not do
drugs, that makes it seem as though it's wrong, as
though it's like breaking God's commandment. When that's not what
it is. The reality is, if you're fucking honest with
yourself, is that you as a parent are paranoid, overly
paranoid about protecting them. And so now, because of that,
you're overreacting, you're being over protective, and you don't want
them ever doing drugs. That's the reality. That's your problem
to deal with, not your kids problem. Okay. So that
addresses the problem of with kids. Now, another objection here.
And this brings forth an important distinction we have to
make this other objection is something like well, Leo, you
know, in your other episodes, you give us various kinds
of advice. And sometimes what you do is you moralize
to us. And you tell us, Oh, you should you
should meditate, and you shouldn't do that thing there. And
you know, you shouldn't judge people and you should, and
you should do this and you should go for enlightenment,
and you shouldn't state you're in your bad relationship. Yes,
sometimes I use the word should. So we have to
make an important distinction. The important distinction is the word
itself is meaningless. It's not important. What's important is the
intent and the belief behind the word. So, you know,
in common language, the word should and shouldn't, is used
automatically, very commonly, you probably say it 100 times a
day. Saying it isn't the problem so much. So if
you just remove the words from your vocabulary, that itself
is not the solution here. The solution is actually to
stop setting the rule, it's the rule behind the word
of the problem. Do you actually believe that you should?
Or shouldn't you actually believe that it's like a moral
imperative? You actually believe that this is a law of
nature, or a love of humanity or something like that?
You? Do you give it that kind of weight or
importance? That's what's important. So yeah, sometimes all contradict myself
in the sense that I'll, I'll tell you in some
episodes future episode, I'll tell you, you shouldn't. I don't
know. You shouldn't judge people. But when I say that,
I'm not really being serious about it. Right? It's like
I'm not putting that kind of weight behind it. I
don't literally mean that. If you judge people, then you're
doing something wrong in some absolute sense. I'm saying you
should stop judging people in the sense that in the
context of self actualization, if you want to self actualize,
which is kind of our, our joint effort here is
what we're all trying to accomplish here. It's kind of
the theme of of this work. So if you want
to self actualize, and you want to be happier, and
you want yada yada yada, then you shouldn't judge. You
see? But hey, if you don't want to self actualize,
don't. Most people don't and that's fine, that's fine. No
one has to self actualize. I'm not forcing you. There's
no moral imperative to you're not going to be a
better person. If you self actualize. You're not going to
be superior. You're not going to be more godly. Nothing
like that. Right it so. So keep that distinction in
mind. It's not the words, it's the it's the kind
of the the seriousness behind the words. Also be careful
about misinterpreting me. So if anything I ever say you
use as an excuse to be a victim, or to
not take action, that means you misinterpreted me. Nothing I
ever say, will enable victim thinking, everything I say, is
the exact opposite of that. So if you ever interpret
it that way, then you're wrong. Okay? Also be careful
to not misinterpret me as saying that there are no
consequences for action. There are grave consequences for action. So
when I say that, for example, you shouldn't cheat on
your spouse. Or I mean, when you say that, and
then I say you should cheat on your spouse because
it happens. And then you use that as, as some,
you know, notion comes to you and such as like,
well, if Leo says I should cheat on my spouse,
then you know what, I'm gonna go cheat on my
spouse, and there's gonna be no consequences. No, that's not
what I'm saying. If you go cheat on your spouse,
then most likely what's gonna happen is the divorce will
happen. And maybe even your spouse will cut your dick
off. Okay, so there are consequences. And you know what,
when your spouse cut your deck off for cheating, that
should happen too. So you have to be very nuanced
here with how you interpret what I say nothing that
I said in this episode, in any way justifies anything
at all. What I'm doing is I'm removing the justification
from all your actions, to the point where you now
act from authentic desire, from authentic motives. It's a form
of being authentic. It doesn't allow you to justify anything.
So if you tell yourself something like, Well, you know,
today, I'm not going to go to work, because Leo
told me that going to work well, I thought I
shouldn't go to you know, I thought I should go
to work. But now Leo told me that I shouldn't
go to work. So I'll just sit at home on
my ass and not go to work and not going
to any consequences. And it's all justified. But what Leo
said, No, that's a gross misunderstanding of what I said.
You have no justification for anything, is what I'm saying.
And there's no destiny. There's no destiny here. So be
careful about that. We don't know what's going to happen
tomorrow. Should you go to work? Or shouldn't you go
to work? Well, we will know when we get there.
So when tomorrow comes, and we come and look at
your house and see if you're in it, when you're
supposed to be at work, and you're in it, or
you're at work, that's when we'll know what should have
happened. We can't know ahead of time, what reality has
up its sleeve, so to speak. Okay, so what I'm
talking about here is not a form of destiny. It's
actually the opposite is the form of total freedom. Follow
your desires, trust your desires and do what you want
to do. And that's the best you can do. You
can't do better than that. If you think you can
supplement that with a layer of rules to keep you
hemmed in from doing all the dangerous evil stuff, that's
not going to be a better paradigm that's going to
be only worse, that's gonna lead to all the problems
that come with that. Also, as a warning. This is
a rather advanced technique. You may not be ready for
this. So right now, if the only thing that's keeping
you from cheating on your spouse, is a rule that
says I shouldn't cheat on my spouse. If that's the
only thing that's keeping you in line, then you know
what? I would say probably hang on to that rule.
Because you're not ready yet. The things I'm talking about
to implement this new paradigm requires growth requires conscious requires
mindfulness, right. It requires a certain trusting of your intuition.
A certain trusting of your desires is the only thing
that's keeping you from going to school and shooting the
place up. Because you're so pissed off at everybody is
over. rule that says that that's morally wrong, then keep
that rule. Because you're in such a weak and fragile
state that you're not ready to move on, right? Do
some more basic kind of therapy work to get over
that. So you don't have these kinds of desires to
fucking murder people and rape people and cheat on people.
These are neurotic desires. So be careful about that take
full responsibility for applying what I'm saying here. Nothing that
I'm saying here should be used to commit atrocities, automate,
even to manipulate people don't use this town to justify
your lying, and your swindling and your cheating and all
the secret stuff that you've been wanting to do your
whole life. Don't use what I'm saying as a justification
for that. Take responsibility for the fact that you had
those desires. And you had them before I even spoke
to you. How do you apply what I said, to
apply what I said, start doing it in baby steps.
I don't recommend that you just completely wipe away every
rule you have in life. That's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying, firstly, just become mindful, become aware of how
many rules you have of these short statements. Then slowly
start questioning the ones that are probably not going to
make or break your life, right. Like for example, you
have a should statements something like I shouldn't eat doughnuts.
Well, that's not going to make or break your life,
you can play around with that one, play around with
it. See, see what happens when you can get rid
of that one. What you might notice is that you
actually take a step backwards, not forwards. When you drop
the rule, I should not eat doughnuts, what might happen
initially for the first month is that actually you eat
a bunch of doughnuts, and you get fat. But your
friggin eyes that this wasn't a failure. This is part
of the growth process, you learn by fucking up. So
be okay with that. That's what it takes to move
up to the next paradigm. Now, you probably of course,
don't want to make major fuck ups in your life.
So if you have a rule in place, such as
like, go cheat on my wife, and you want to
play with that rule. I don't recommend you play with
that rule. Because that's more of a serious rule. And
if you fuck that one up, you're probably going to
do something that you're going to regret. And then you
might come back and blame me for it say, well,
Leo, look, look what you did, you ruined my life.
So start with little things, build your trust with the
little things like I should put the toilet seat down.
Start with that one. That's an innocent one, the stakes
aren't high. And then when you can trust yourself there,
move to the next one to the next one. The
next one is ultimately after years of work, you can
fully embody this, and then you're completely free, completely conscious,
you can completely trust yourself. This process here that I'm
sharing with you is a process of loosening the reins,
because right now what you want is like horse, your
horse with blinders on and you've been needing to be
kicked in the ass your whole life with spurs sharp
razor sharp spurs, were kicking your ass to get you
to move and to go and to obey. And a
whip was used on you. And now what we're doing
is we're taking this horse that was completely taken out
of his natural environment. And now we're slowly removing the
blinders, removing the reins, removing the whips, removing all this
stuff. And we're teaching the horse to function in a
natural setting again, like it would in the wild. And
at first the horse is uncomfortable with that. At first,
the horse isn't very motivated. It might take steps backwards,
it might be lazy. It might stumble, right. But eventually
it'll get back in touch with its natural desire, its
natural motivations, and it will become authentic and it will
become free, fully free. So this is the process of
learning to trust yourself. And the way that you build
trust with yourself is not in one giant leap. But
through baby steps. Start with the foundation of there is
nothing that I should do. There's nothing that I should
do. I'm just going to do the things that feel
authentic and write to me. And I'm going to trust
myself in that and start there and kind of build
up and see where you can apply that in your
life. You'll find many places slowly you'll start to apply
it more and more and more. So I want to
finish up with with The, with an exercise for you.
Okay, I would like you to do is pull out
a pen and paper. And I want you to write
down your top 50 most common should statements could be
should statements or should not statements. So stuff like, I
shouldn't eat donuts and I should put the toilet toilet
seat down and I shouldn't smoke too much pot and
I shouldn't masturbate. I shouldn't cheat, write all those down,
then what I want you to do is to flip
each one of those around. So everything I just said,
flip it all around. So I should eat doughnuts, and
I shouldn't put the toilet seat down. And I should
cheat on my spouse. And I should masturbate and so
forth, right. And just notice that, be conscious of this
as you're doing it. And then throughout your day, tomorrow,
and the next week or the next week, just be
more mindful of all the shoulds you make throughout your
day. Notice how when you create these statements, and you
tell yourself, I should do this, or I shouldn't do
that. Notice how that creates guilt creates resistance, it creates
lack of integrity, it leads to laziness, and all these
other problems. Okay, that's your assignment. This is a long
episode because I cover a lot of stuff. There's a
lot of objections, a lot of complexity to this. It's
a whole paradigm, which is why I've spent so much
time covering all these different angles. It's not easy to
talk about this stuff in this way. We're bringing together
many concepts here from other episodes, we're bringing here to
this mind, open mindedness. You need radical open mindedness to
be able to grasp this new paradigm. We're bringing in
the concept of mindfulness, you need mindfulness to be aware
of when you're making short statements, you also need to
be mindful of how your ego plays into this thing.
We're bringing the concept of the ego, this idea that
you need to surrender that you're gonna watch out for
the ego, and that your ego is distorting your views
of reality and what you think should and shouldn't be
real. Your ego is preventing you from seeing reality as
it really is. We're bringing the concept of acceptance and
self acceptance, accepting yourself and accepting the world. That's an
important concept in the self actualization work, we're bringing this
concept of counter intuitiveness and paradigm shifting. And we're bringing
the concept of truth. This idea that the world should
be as it is, that's ultimately truth. And to really,
really fathom that, you have to be interested in discovering
the truth for yourself not as the belief but actually
digging in introspecting, seeing what's true, that has to be
something you desire, something that you're sort of passionate about,
and willing to commit time and effort towards. And lastly,
I just want to mention, notice the practical power of
enlightenment. I haven't talked about enlightenment much. But if you're
following me, you know, I like to talk about enlightened
sometimes. And sometimes you might wonder, well, enlightenment, it's a
very lofty, you know, faraway notion about the nature of
existence and so forth. What does it have to do
with my day to day life? Well, this whole shift
in paradigm is all founded upon seeing reality accurately, without
distortion of your ego, which is basically enlightenment. This is
an enlightenment truth. This whole idea of stopping shooting, this
is a truth that stems from the deepest possible source.
So one thing that I want you to notice is
that even though enlightenment seems like a very abstract, philosophical
sort of thing, actually, when you start start working towards
it and tapping into it, you will discover wisdom and
insights that are profoundly practical, that will create a trickle
down or ripple effect that can not affect your everyday
life, the way you relate to people the way you
talk to yourself. Your motivation levels, your integrity, things like
guilt and shame and fear and anger, all these things
will be affected by the truth. The truth here is
is your ultimate savior. So, notice that all right, that's
it. I'm done signing off. Go ahead, click the like
