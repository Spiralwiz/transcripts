            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/PpMp0VUKlBU' target='_blank'>Peak Performance - How To Hit and Maintain Consistent Peak Performance In Life</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Compelling vision for peak performance</b>: The most crucial factor for sustainably maintaining peak performance is having a compelling vision. This vision should be incredibly significant to you on an emotional level, not just logical. It's the secret behind the discipline and peak performance found in Olympic athletes, who've been dreaming and visualizing their success for years. 
</li><li><b>Peak performance isn't casual</b>: Achieving peak performance is not a casual endeavor. It requires understanding why you want it and having compelling reasons for commitment. It's about making a compelling, vivid vision and constantly revisiting it to keep it fresh and inspiring. 
</li><li><b>Momentum in peak performance</b>: To reach peak performance, it's essential to understand the concept of momentum, which can be of two types: micro and macro. You can't jump straight from no effort to peak performance; it requires gradual effort, patience, and baby steps. 
</li><li><b>Micro and macro momentum</b>: Micro momentum is built within a day or part of a day, and macro momentum is built over days, weeks, and months. An Olympic athlete's performance takes years of consistent training to build both types of momentum. You can apply this concept to any aspect of life where you seek peak performance, whether at the gym or in your career. 
</li><li><b>Importance of discipline</b>: Discipline is key to maintaining peak performance. Studying personal development, understanding yourself, mastering emotions, and applying self-development principles are all essential. Physical energy is just as important, which means prioritizing nutrition and exercise. Peak performance is deeply rooted in psychology. 
</li><li><b>Avoiding backlash and failure</b>: Attempting to force peak performance can lead to failure and diminish confidence; instead, by challenging yourself gradually and building momentum, you can avoid this backlash. Successful peak performance is an incremental process, not an overnight change.
</li><li><b>Micro and Macro Momentum</b>: Leo introduces two aspects of momentum: Micro and Macro. Macro momentum explains how we gradually build motivation and habits over time, whether it is physical exercise, or working towards a career goal over days, weeks, or months. Micro momentum, he argues, is just as important - and it refers to the smaller steps we take throughout the day to gradually increase our performance. 
</li><li><b>Daily application</b>: An example offered is a workout routine - starting from a simple task like a relaxed treadmill walk, to light stretching, gradually increasing intensity until reaching peak performance with heavier lifts. This concept can be applied to our daily work routine as well - starting from checking emails, reviewing notes, taking breaks, and then slowly increasing the workload until peak performance is achieved. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Discipline</b>: Disciplined effort is vital for maintaining both micro and macro momentum. People fail to achieve their potential when they neglect to enforce discipline upon themselves. It's emphasized that viewers should study and learn how to enhance their self-discipline.
</li><li><b>Student of personal development</b>: It's suggested that one becomes a student of personal development and inner work. Peak performance is deeply rooted in psychology, it's a reflection of what we believe about ourselves and our capabilities. Understanding ourselves better helps in improving performance in all aspects of life. Athletes often study the psychology of peak performance; physical training alone is not enough. 
</li><li><b>Physical energy and Vitality</b>: Good nutrition and exercise are essential elements in achieving peak performance. In any performance, physical or mental, one needs energy and vitality. Therefore, maintaining a healthy body is crucial to obtain high performance.  
</li><li><b>Closing remark</b>: Leo reminds the listener that there's more nuance to peak performance than what has been discussed and recommends continued learning and personal development. They recommend viewers explore more resources on actualized.org for further information about peak performance and subscribe to their newsletter for regular updates.
