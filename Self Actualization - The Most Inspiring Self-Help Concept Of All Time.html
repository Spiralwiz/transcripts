Hey. This is Leo, for actualized.org and in this video,
I am gonna talk about self-actualization. Oh man, I've been
waiting for a long time to do this video because
I love this topic. For me, this is what inspired
me to create my website. That's why I named it
actualized.org Because I think self-actualization is a super important and
inspiring topic. So, we're gonna talk about all the nuances
here, and there's a lot. there's a lot more than
you read about in the textbooks and the little glosses
that you get here and there on Wikipedia or elsewhere.
So, self-actualization. What is it and what does it really
mean and why is it important, why should we care
about it? So, bottom line, and this is kind of
where it all starts. Is; I'm gonna give you a
little bit of history of it. Self-actualization is really a
term coined and promoted by positive psychology; Kind of the
grandfather of positive psychology, which is Abraham Maslow. and Maslow,
you might know from introductory psychology classes, is the guy
who created that hierarchy of needs. That pyramid, right? That
pyramid of human psychological needs. And there he talks about
the different needs that we have. At the bottom level,
we have, just the very physical base needs of oxygen
and water and food, right? That's the most essential thing
that we need to survive. Then, the next level up
from that, is; We have safety needs. Obviously we want
some shelter, We want to be safe from the cold
and heat, We also want to be protected from-- from
being stabbed in the back or being assaulted or injured
physically in some way. So we've got that. Then the
next level up from that, you'll be starting to want
to get a sense of community, a sense of belonging.
So, being part of a tribe, being part of an
organization being part of something important. Then, next level up
from that might be something like friendship and love, intimate
relationships. and then, building up on top of that, is;
You have Self-esteem, the needs for self-esteem, needs for recognition,
needs for significance within your life. And then, at the
very, very top. That top triangle is what you call
self-actualization. And that is, really, the need for growth The
need to realize your full potential. And so, that's what
self-actualization is. But, that is a very simplistic surface definition
of it. I wanna go in depth and tell you
exactly what it means to be self-actualized. Because I find
people throwing around this term, self-actualization. It tends to be
abstract and even though I understand what it means, most
people, when they use it, they're not very specific, because
they've never gotten the full, rich definition that Maslow gives.
And Maslow gives a brilliant definition of this. And you
can read this. If you're really interested, I really encourage
you to read his book called Toward A Psychology of
Being where he gives a lengthy, deep discussion of self-actualization,
which is so inspiring, that when I read it, I
started my website. It's just amazing. You have to go
and read this. So, one of the keypoints that he
makes there is; He says that, we've got these needs.
And everyone agrees that, you know, we need food, or
we're gonna die. And we need social interactions. We possibly
need intimate relationships, we need to be part of a
community, we need to; We need to have some sort
of sense of significance to feel good about ourselves. These
are needs. But what most people don't recognize is that
there's also this need, to live to your full potential.
And this is not a luxury. This is not something
that would be nice to have. This is a need.
Maslow says that this is something, that if you do
not honor, and that you do not live up to
your full potential, when you know what you're capable of,
that; What it's gonna do - It's gonna rot you
from the inside. And actually what it's gonna lead to
is psychological dysfunction. It's gonna lead to neurosis. So, ignore
this at your own peril. And really, what he compares
it to; He makes this analogy that, just like there
are vitamin needs, that the human body has, in order
to function optimally and to not have some sort of
diseases or deficiencies The same thing with the human psyche
is that; We have these very subtle needs. Just like
a vitamin. A vitamin is this small little thing, that,
normally we don't consider that we have a deficiency in.
But if you are deficient in it, all of a
sudden it creates a huge problem. And so, the same
thing here, is that, normally, if you're setting goals for
yourself, and you're going and you're pushing yourself, and you're
achieving stuff in your life, then you don't have a
problem with this need of self-actualization. But if what you're
doing is; For example you're settling for less than your
best, Then that problem starts to rot you from the
inside out and that becomes a big problem. And a
lot of people out there, I see ignoring this need
for self-actualization. And what they're basically doing, is, they're just
handling their lower level needs. And that higher level need,
they're ignoring, and they don't know why they're not satisfied
with life, They don't know why they're unfulfilled. They don't
why they just feel this general malaise about life and
they don't want to do anything, they're not motivated. Well,
that is why. Because this is a need. It's not
just a luxury. The other nice thing about self-actualization, and
this is what's really inspiring when you read Maslow, is
that, it's really what it means to be human. Is;
To pursue self-actualization. 'Cause that other stuff, that's nice, But
the joys that you get from that, are not giving
you that same level of clean high that you get,
when you're going after, and living on your edge, and
pursuing your full putential. When you're actually going after that
self-actualization. 'Cause there is quite a distinct boundary between the
two types of needs. The lower level needs are like
base needs. And they're nice to have. They make you
feel safe and comfortable and secure. But, it's pursuing those
higher level needs, those ideals, that really gets you charged
up and pumped up and gets you super excited. and
gets you really passionate about your life. Right? You can
be comfortable living according to your base needs, But you
get a charged life by living according to your ideals.
That's what is really inspiring there. So what I want
to do next, is; I want to cover and go
down this list that Maslow has in his book, where
he talks about what it really means to be a
self-actualized person. And when I read this list, It literally
put tears in my eyes, it inspires me. Because this
is what I imagine my best self as being and
this is who I wanna be. And this is really
what actualized.org is about Is; Helping you become this. So,
this is kind of the full-on, rich definition of what
it means to be self-actualized. So here is what a
self-actualized person is. Here are the qualities that he has.
So, a self-actualized person has a superior perception of reality.
He sees reality more objectively than other people. He has
an increased acceptance of himself, others, and nature. He has
increased spontenade in his behavior. He is not so rule-bound,
He is able to be outrageous and spontaneous. Self-actualized people
are more focused on the problems, the challenges in life,
than they are on themselves. They're not so much worried
about their own feelings. Which makes them, counterintuively, feel better,
because they're not so focused on themselves. They have an
increased detachment from things. That means they don't cling to
things as much. And they have a deeper desire for
privacy. They value solitude 'cause they value time to contemplate
and to think. Self-actualized people have an increased sense of
autonomy and individuality. That means, they feel like they're agents.
They don't feel like they're victims in life. They take
full responsibility for how their life unfolds. Self-actualized people are
resistent, or at least more resistent, to social conditioning than
other people. They are world citizens not beholden to culture.
That means they are not a slave to their culture.
They pick and choose from culture. The things, that work
for them in their life. And the things that empower
them. and leave the rest on the table. Self-actualized people
are comfortable being themselves, even when it means being unpopular.
They don't need approval from others. They're self-reliant. Self-actualized people
have a good sense of what is real and unreal.
And they value the truth and facts over mere beliefs
or superstitions or dogma. They have a more scientific type
of thinking. Self-actualized people have great freshness of apprectiation and
richness of emotional reaction. That means they are not always
logical and locked in their heads, On the contrary, They're
open to experience. They're open to emotions. They experience emotions
fully and richly. Self-actualized people have a higher frequency of
peak-experiences. So that means they're in that flow state more
often and they get those really thrilling, exciting, passionate experiences
in life more often and more consistently. Self-actualized people have
an increased identification with the human species. They feel like
they're part of the species. That the species is doing
something good. Self-actualized people have improved interpersonal relationships. They're better
able to deal with relationships and to manage relationships And
their relationships are not up and down rollercoaster rides. Self-actualized
people have a more democratic character structure. They don't feel
like they need to be dictating to people. They don't
feel like they need to be controlling or manipulating people.
Self-actualized people have greater, increased creativity. So they're more creative.
They want to out there and create something. They want
to be original. They are always thinking about that. Self-actualized
people have a deep knowledge and understanding of who they
are. They know themselves. Which, I find, many other people
do not. Self-actualized people are constantly moving towards unity and
integration in their personality and world view. They're always synthethi--
They're taking in information, they're analyzing it, they're synthethizing it
together, into some sort of deeper understanding. Self-actualized people are
actively nurturing of their talents. So that means, they recognize
what their talents are, And then they build them up.
They train. They build up skills. Self-actualized people place great
value on the ideal values. And Maslow goes into this
at length. He talks about what the values are of
a self-actualized person and here is a partial list. Truth,
beauty, goodness, uniqueness, wholeness, justice, simplicity, richness, Effortlessness and playfulness.
So these are kind of the, like, the ethereal top
level platonic values of humanity. As opposed to some of
the base values, like, the need for security, or the
need for comfort, or the need for approval, or the
need for money, right? Which generates greed. All of these,
kind of, more pety needs. So, a self-actualized person is
chasing and pursuing these higher needs. Stuff like truth and
beauty. Which, to me, is just amazing. I love that.
It sends chills down my spine, when I hear that.
Next is; Self-actualized people are driven by positive and intrinsic
motivation. They're not really driven by lack. A self-actualized person
is not so much doing things in their life because
they need to. They're doing them because they want to.
They love to. So they're not going to their work
because they have to go. They're not in a relationship
because they have to be. They're doing these things because
they love it. They enjoy it. This is something that
they're driven from the inside. They're not so much driven
from the outside. Self-actualized people are generally more able to
enjoy more aspects of life. They don't just enjoy achievement,
thrive and peak experiences, they also enjoy those quiet moments.
So they're able to be happy. Even when they're not
stimulated from the outside. Self-actualized people take pleasure in functioning
at their prime. So they love to pursue peak performance.
And they love to be excellent at whatever it is
that they're doing. Self-actualized people take a non-valuing, non-judging, non-interfering,
non-condemning attitude towards other people. Which basically means that they
take other people just as part of the world. And
just as beings, rather than, some sort of objects or
pawns that are there for their approval or their satisfaction,
their stimulation, and their enjoyment. Right? So, it's not judging
other people. It's just being comfortable with who people are.
Even when they're different than you. Self-actualized people are more
loving. They need less love, but are able to give
more love. Self-actualized people embrace conceptual dichotomies and polarities and
conflicts, by fusing, transcending or resolving them. They're comfortable with
paradoxes, contradictions and not knowing. Have you ever known someone,
who always needs to be right? Who were so firm
in their beliefs that they can't be around other people?
Well, a self-actualized person is comfortable, they're open-minded, they're able
to tolerate the unknown. Self-actualized people have desires and impulses
that correlate with what's actually good for them. So, they're
not reaching for that donut when they know it's bad.
They're able to resist it. And they're able to resist
it in an easy sort of way without a lot
of harsh discipline. Right? What they want aligns with what's
actually good and healthy for them. Self-actualized people have a
solid psychological health. Self-actualized people live on purpose in their
life. With a sense of mission. And they view their
work as a precious cause. Their work is personal to
them. It's important to them. They take great pride in
their work. They want to do it excellently. Self-actualized people
are generally involved with improving the world. They don't just
care about themselves. They want to make a contribution that
improves the world in a positive way. Self-actualized people are
willing to admit and correct mistakes. So, they're not perfect.
But they are willing to admit when they are not
perfect. And they're wiling to work on themselves. And self-actualized
people have an easy discipline about them. Easy self-discipline, Which
comes hard to the average person. And for them, their
duty is the same as their pleasure. Self-actualized people gratify
themselves as moderately, rather than obstaining through hard discipline. So,
instead of saying no to that donut, Maybe they'll take
one bite of it. But they'll stop there. They won't
go overboard. They can find that balance that other people
find difficult to find. Self-actualized people express their impulses, yet
they use less control to do it. Their controls are
not ridgid. And they're not so anxiety-driven as it is
for other people. Self-actualized people are able to express their
aggression in a healthier way. And they express it in
a sort of righteous indignation, rather than a physical lashing
out. Self-actualized people have a different, new set of concerns,
that ordinary people have. They have what Maslow calls Being-challenges
versus needs-challenges and that's too deep of a concept to
go into here, but it's actually super powerful and a
fascinating concept. Self-actualized people live to experience joy rather than
to experience pain. So they're moving towards things rather than
moving away from things. They're positively motivated. And self-actualized people
live in the present moment. They're not focused on the
past. They're not focused too much on the future. And
then, lastly, Self-actualized people make more conscious decisions. They're generally
at a higher level of consciousness, which allows them to
really tab into this whole list of things that I
just raddled off here. So, that is it. I'm a
little bit over time. But, I hope you get a
deeper, richer understanding of what self-actualization is. I hope this
inspires you to be a self-actualized person I don't know
how you can listen to this list, and not want
to be that. For me, this is it. This is
what being human is all about. This is the peak
of being a human being. Is; Getting yourself into all
these characteristics and living them and embodying them. And that's
why I started actualized.org Is; To help you understand how
