            <ul>
    <li><b>Concept of Preah and Shreya</b>: Leo Gura begins the section by introducing two Sanskrit terms: Preah and Shreya. Preah signifies immediate gratification and short-term pleasures like junk food, recreational drugs, or entertainment. Shreya, on the other hand, represents long-term benefits and ethical values such as hard work, honesty, discipline, loyalty, love, excellence, generosity, and compassion.
</li><li><b>Importance of Choosing Shreya over Preah</b>: Gura argues that true happiness doesn't come from pursuing preah but from Shreya. Consumer society often encourages the pursuit of preah, but this often leads to short-term pleasure rather than solid, consistent happiness. Gura emphasizes the principle of right action or doing what is morally right regardless of one's feelings, like going to the gym, an activity that may seem initially unpleasant but leads to long-term fulfillment and happiness.
</li><li><b>Building Good Habits for Shreya</b>: Gura suggests building good habits like practicing meditation, taking time for solitude, journaling, reading, studying for personal development, and engaging in hard work towards something meaningful. This also involves eating right, eliminating addictions, and shifting from negative to positive thinking.
</li><li><b>Personal growth and Contribution for Solid Happiness</b>: Gura talks about the importance of personal growth and contribution to the world as the way to achieve advanced happiness. This involves aligning one's business, career, and personal growth with contribution to humanity and finding satisfaction in helping others. He argues that working towards benefiting humanity leads to rock-solid, consistent happiness as opposed to fleeting, inconsistent pleasure from preah.
</li><li><b>Immediate gratification vs Long-term benefits</b>: Leo Gura suggests that the low level of happiness people seek from immediate gratification can't compare to the happiness that originates from working on something meaningful that helps others, such as creating a business that contributes to people's lives or a career where you share your expertise and talents. 
</li><li><b>Principle of Right Action</b>: According to Leo, the principle of right action implies doing what's right regardless of temporary feelings. If individuals feel unhappy, they are likely avoiding things they know are good for them (Shreya) because immediate gratification (Preah) seems more appealing. Exercising is used as an example of an activity that may seem unattractive but results in long-lasting happiness.
</li><li><b>Developing Good Habits</b>: To feel good, Leo advises building good habits in place of bad ones that make individuals feel miserable. These good habits may include meditating, spending time alone in introspection, journaling, reading, studying personal interests, working diligently on meaningful tasks, maintaining physical fitness, eating healthily, eliminating addictions, and changing negative thinking into a positive mindset.
</li><li><b>Personal Growth and Positivity</b>: Leo emphasizes that personal growth begins when good habits are established and become habitual. These habits replace negative ones and lead individuals towards consistent happiness, although the process may be initially uncomfortable. He links this progression to ancient wisdom with a contemporary perspective about personal development.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's teachings</b>: Leo's teachings aim to show individuals how to live a fulfilling life in an exciting, youthful, and practical way, rather than sermonizing or lecturing. He encourages viewers to sign up for his newsletter for more personal development content and the opportunity to participate in free coaching sessions and overcome limiting beliefs.
