hey this is Leo for actual eyes done already and
in this quick self-help segment I'm going to talk about
peak performance what does peak performance and how do you
achieve it well for me I love peak performance this
is like the greatest feeling ever when you're out there
and you're just excelling you're just killing it whether you're
running a marathon and you're killing it there or you're
at the gym and you're killing it there or at
your work you're giving an awesome presentation or you're writing
a novel and you're just having an awesome day and
you write an awesome chapter or whatever else it is
for you just being at the peak of your potential
and actually being on that zone where you know that
you have so much potential but then you also know
that you're stepping up to it and you're actually realizing
it and that feeling of realizing your potential to me
that's one of the greatest feelings in the world and
one of the reasons that I found in Naturalizer org
is because I want to figure out what is the
psychology behind getting that more consistently because I find the
biggest challenge with performance is that it's hard to stay
at a peak performance all the time right that's in
fact why they call it peak performance it's like your
performance is is down here and then it Peaks and
then it drops back down it kind of spikes creates
a spike and then it's back down to this to
this low baseline well the question that I have and
the question that you should have is how do we
get that peak and sustain that peak so it turns
into a plateau so that you're getting high performance consistently
well this is something that I love to study and
I think there's a lot of different angles and a
lot of different facets to this problem so I'm just
gonna scratch the surface of it in this video and
I've got a lot more ideas about this on actualised
org but I would say that the biggest most number
one reason factor I should say rather to your performance
and to being on that edge is to have a
compelling vision you have to have something that you're fighting
for you have to have something that's a cause of
yours something that's important enough to you something that's significant
enough to you you have to be totally bought into
it it has to be compelling that's why having a
very big lofty goal or a dream or a vision
is it's just critical it's critical you're not gonna have
that kind of peak performance unless you see that you
see that potentially you see something great out there for
you that excites you on an emotional level not just
a logical level this is why for example you could
have an Olympic athlete who's out there and training for
literally five six eight hours a day for years they're
doing this why would they do that they're killing themselves
it's like their body is is is putting putting put
on so much strain and so much pressure there's pain
but they're going through all that and they're performing at
their peak and then they get to the Olympics let's
say and they're going there and they're going through all
the different qualifying matches and races and then finally it's
like that last race and that last race that gold
medal race that potential to win bronze silver gold medal
that's what they've been dreaming of since there were small
children that was just drilled into their minds and for
them they've been dreaming about it literally when they slept
they've been dreaming about day dreaming about it when they
eight they've been dreaming about it and thinking about it
and visualizing out while they trained and they've been doing
this for years so for them this is it this
is what they want this is what they've been fighting
for and something within them some sort of value is
being honored by that maybe it's excellence maybe it's that
they want to do it for their country or they
want to do it for the family or they want
to show their friends that anything is possible something noble
like that right that creates the vision which then gives
them energy and the drive and the discipline that they
need to go out there and accomplish something big and
when they are doing that they're performing on their edge
and they're getting peak performance so that's what I want
for you and if you think that only Olympic athletes
can get this then you're dead wrong anyone can get
this it's just a matter of sitting down and doing
some of the inner work that has to happen to
get to that point now don't get me wrong peak
reforms is not something that you get casually peak performance
is something that you have to get and you have
to want it you have to really understand why you
want it have some compelling reasons and what I would
say right now is if you want more performance than
you need a better vision make it more compelling make
it more vivid actually visualize on it come back to
it every day think about a journal about it write
about expand on it make it even grander than it
already is and that's gonna get you juiced up to
go out there and perform all right the next point
and this is really big is this concept that I'm
gonna introduce called momentum and there's two forms of momentum
there's micro momentum and macro moment I'm going to talk
about both of them but if you want to be
at your peak you have to realize that you're gonna
have to build your way up to it you don't
just go and from not going to the gym ever
in your life all the sudden go to the gym
the next day and get peak performance nor do you
all the sudden let's say if you're at work and
you're just kind of humming along at work and then
all of a sudden you want peak performance at your
work you just all the sudden the next day get
peak performance it's not gonna happen that way in fact
if you try to do it that way and you
force it like that then you're gonna get a backlash
and it's gonna backfire on you and actually your performance
will probably diminish or you'll kind of get put back
in your place except now you're gonna feel you're gonna
feel lack of confidence you're gonna feel like a failure
so instead what you do is you baby step your
way up by ever increasing small steps and challenging yourself
more and more and more and more and this means
you have to have a little bit of patience and
allow yourself to build up to it let's talk about
that Olympic athlete example again do that Olympic athlete get
to that performance level all the sudden in one day
no did they do it in a week no did
they do it in a month no did they do
it in a year probably not even in a year
it probably took them many years to get to that
kind of level and when you're seeing them on television
it seems like they're they're just performing on the spot
that that hour of the race that minute of the
race they're performing so well but they've been training up
for they've built up to that level and so they're
in the zone they're in that mindset because they've been
training for it and they've been creating momentum that's what
I want you to do is start to create momentum
whether at the gym or in your career or wherever
you want half peak performance is start ratcheting up for
example at the gym put a little bit extra weight
every time you go put a little bit more weight
on a little bit more weight a little bit more
weight and push yourself a little bit more a little
bit more a little bit more and all the sudden
you'll find that six months from now you're gonna be
totally at a different level of performance than you were
today because you've just been baby stepping it up and
you've been building momentum and what you find is that
as you build momentum it becomes easier to do that
stuff and your motivation can can kind of well up
and well up well up to the point where right
now maybe you're not excited about going to the gym
at all but six months from now you can get
yourself so pumped up about doing a super heavy set
on squats or deadlifts or or whatever exercise you're doing
just because you've kind of you've been building it up
building it up building up and you've been not only
just building your body up and your muscles up and
the habits and your brain but you've also really built
up the motivation for it too so that's really important
that is what I call macro momentum there's also a
micro momentum which is building up on a small scale
throughout your day so macro momentum takes place over the
course of days multiple days weeks and months the micro
momentum takes place within the course of let's say a
day or even within the course of part of the
day so by macro momentum I might mean when you
go to the gym on that one specific day you
can build up micro momentum by first doing a very
easy relaxing treadmill walk right just to get your blood
flowing and your muscles going and then your brain kind
of starts to get engaged to want to do exercise
then you walk let's say for 50 minutes then you
go out there and you do some light stretching then
you do that for 15 minutes then you go and
you do some some kind of moderately heavy lifts then
you do that and then you get and you get
yourself pumped up to do some really heavy lifts at
the end of that session so then what you've done
is you kind of baby step your way through that
one exercise session to something really really powerful a really
powerful peak performance doing a very heavy lift but you
did that by building up you don't just go in
there and all the sudden break out super heavy lift
right off the bat not only can that and that
hurt you physically and can cause all sorts of problems
muscle strain and injuries but it's also just your brain
is not going to be geared for that so you
got to build yourself up and the same can happen
not only at the gym but in your work to
when you're starting your workday let's say you're trying to
write something and you've got a whole day of writing
to do well you don't really want to write at
the beginning of the day but you have to you
want to get to that peak performance I'm writing when
you're totally in the flow and you're like you're killing
it on on the paper right and you're everything's just
coming out so smooth all the words are perfect the
language is everything is just clicking for you but to
get to that point you got to build up to
it you got to realize and that means building micro
momentum throughout the day so that means the first thing
you might do is just maybe you sit down and
you check your email that just kind of gets you
in the work mode next thing you do you check
your email a little bit then maybe you go and
you review your notes and you do that for for
half an hour then you you you reviewed your notes
and now you go and you take a look at
what you've written the previous day and you just kind
of familiarize yourself with that so your mind is in
that frame then maybe you just say okay I'm gonna
write just one or two pages and then I'm gonna
go to lunch so you do that you write just
one or two pages then as you're at lunch you
start thinking about more ideas start stuff starts kind of
bubbling up and percolating and you come back from lunch
and you challenge yourself to write five pages in the
next hour or two and then all the sudden by
the end of the day you see yourself and now
it's like you've got 10 pages and you're just like
a writing machine and everything's going smooth but you couldn't
get to that point of peak performance right at the
beginning of the day when you woke up probably not
realistic to just get there right off the bat unless
you've been building up to it with macro mentum for
a very long time so this is the distinction between
micro and macro momentum I hope you understand this a
little bit better and really you should be using both
of these to get yourself to a level of peak
performance build up throughout your day and then build up
every day throughout the week and a month and the
year to get yourself to this amazing level where people
just look at you and they see you as this
Olympic athlete it's like you're getting this these things done
you're having these amazing lifts at the gym you're able
to produce so much stuff at work and the reason
that you're able to do that is because you have
utilized this ramping up momentum building process that most people
discount and they just try to force it and then
it fails on them so that is a great way
to build up to peak performance the other thing I'm
going to tell you some other little tidbits and secrets
about peak performance is discipline you need discipline of course
to make this process work and that's why most people
are not getting peak performance in their life is because
they take it too casually they're not disciplined about it
they're not able to enforce discipline on themselves so study
how to build discipline within yourself I cover that in
other videos and other topics that's also a deep topic
to cover and very fascinating then I want to encourage
you to be a student be a student of personal
development be a student of inner work of psychology because
performance is deeply rooted in psychology more so than even
the actions that you're taking because the actions are a
reflection of who you are what you believe what you
think about yourself what you think of your capabilities what
kind of goals you're set for yourself what kind of
vision you create what kind of techniques you use like
visualizations and affirmations and also the just the things that
you know the knowledge that you have and the workings
of your psychology so the better you understand yourself the
better you master your emotions and you know all these
principles of self development that I talk about then the
better you're going to be able to see the avenues
of improving performance in any aspect of your life so
to be a peak performance I think you have to
become a student of it and that's what you know
the top athletes do is that they do study this
stuff they study the psychology of peak performance in order
to get peak performance physically it's not just about training
physically it's also about training mentally so there's both those
components and don't discount the mental component and then of
course peak performance if you really want to be performing
at your peak and this is too deep of a
topic to get into here you got to start worrying
about your new tree and your exercise even if we're
talking about performance at work even if we're talking about
performance writing a novel even if we're talking about performance
doing some public speaking or performance in bed whatever your
performance you want you have to have the physical energy
and the vitality to get that and that means you
have to start looking out for your nutrition and your
exercises so that your your body is in good shape
because when your body is in good shape and your
mind is in good shape then you can get good
performance out of this machine that is the human body
so start looking out for that and I've got more
videos on that and that's gonna do it I think
that those are the core principles of peak performance there's
more to it of course more nuances but go ahead
and post your comments down below I want to hear
what you guys think like this please share this and
of course check out actualized org for more advanced personal
developing video just like this on how to achieve peak
performance that's really what I found at the website for
is to help you get all these little little things
in place in your life so that you understand the
psychology behind it all and then you can go out
there and achieve amazing results extraordinary results in wherever part
of your life that you wanted in subscribe to my
