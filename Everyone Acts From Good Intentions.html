[Music] i want to share a simple but powerful principle
with you that will help you to make sense of
all human behavior for the rest of your life the
problem is that this principle is so simple and so
deeply counter-intuitive that you're not going to want to believe
it it'll take you a long time of really contemplating
this and looking for it out in reality to notice
its truth it's gonna seem kind of stupid at first
but anyways i hope your mind is open the principle
is this that every human being acts with good intention
that's it every human being acts with good intention this
includes the most evil quote-unquote evil humans that you think
exist out there and act with bad intentions all of
it is actually action from good intention so this is
a point that so many people misunderstand and especially when
it comes to understanding things that are happening in the
world you you pop open the webpage and look at
the latest news and what do you see on the
news you see a page full of evil it's like
a catalog of all of mankind's evils every single day
that's what the news effectively is and then um you
argue and debate with people ideologically over differences in politics
or worldview or religion or about science or about reality
or about spirituality all of these debates and differences in
in in perspective and uh it becomes very difficult for
the human mind to make sense of these differences in
perspective and rather than taking on the burden and the
responsibility and taking extreme ownership over making sense of these
relativistic differences what the human mind does is instead it
demonizes and it ascribes bad intent to these other actors
when you can't understand somebody's actions and they do something
that goes against your own agenda the naive mind naturally
ascribes to that actor a bad intention in the worst
case scenario you call that person evil or you might
even say he's uh possessed by satan or something like
that or some sort of demonic forces or maybe you'll
call him crazy i want you to resist that temptation
this is a very counter-intuitive move that you make and
it takes a lot of personal responsibility and intellectual integrity
to to make this move even if you're the type
of person that doesn't believe in satan and devils and
demons and dark entities possessing people and so forth reptilians
and whatever else even if you're a secularly minded rational
person you will still ascribe evil intentions and motives to
lots of people and organizations around the world and you
will use this as part of your sense-making paradigm and
it's very counterintuitive even for people like that to let
go of that and to take on more responsibility for
making sense of the situation and to really try to
see the relativistic difference in perspective between different actors and
agents and yourself and the reason this is so difficult
is because we have our own survival agenda that we're
dealing with we have our own biases we have our
own perspective and paradigm that we're locked into and so
part of how the ego works and you should you
should see this and feel this in your own life
if you are practicing introspection see my episode called developing
introspection which tells you how to do that but if
you're practicing that through deep self-reflection introspection what you should
notice but as you're studying the the psychodynamics of your
ego mind what you'll notice is that whenever you're acting
in the world you see yourself as a good actor
always always always you always have good intentions isn't that
funny shouldn't that make you suspicious how is it that
you're such a good person all the time because objectively
if we look at you objectively you're not a good
person you've done all this in your life you're extremely
selfish you're biased you're fearful you get angry you're emotional
you're needy you're attached to all sorts of things you
manipulate you scheme you lie all the time you do
this no matter who you are and yet you're such
a good person according to who according to you ah
it's funny it's a joke it's a cosmic joke what
you're doing you seem so good to yourself even if
you hate yourself you still basically think you have good
intentions well what needs to be seen and recognized is
that everybody is this way there's nothing special about you
that gives you good intentions above everybody else everybody behaves
this way because that's just the dynamic nature of the
ego mind the ego mind distorts reality and consciousness in
such a way as to make itself become the definition
of good the very notion of goodness is relativized and
co-opted by the ego mind after all what does it
mean to say that something is good when you say
it when a person like you says it when an
ego says something is good all that means is that
it's good for that ego that's what the ego means
good is defined relative to your ego and so the
key here is to see the profound relativity behind all
human actions and if you don't do this you will
forever be perplexed and confused and angered and upset and
disturbed by all the ongoings that you see in the
world by various human actors you actually will not be
able to make proper sense of it so what i'm
telling you is that all of the stuff that you
consider evil terrorists rapists political enemies that you have thieves
and criminals and con artists racists and misogynists and homophobes
and transphobes and grifters of various sorts you think these
people are acting with bad intentions they aren't they're all
acting with good intentions elites this is a popular trap
that people are falling into now there's this sort of
uh duality that's being set up now in the media
especially on non-mainstream media about the the populists the ordinary
little people versus the elites and the elites are the
evil ones the corporations are the evil ones they have
bad intentions leo obviously the military industrial complex has bad
intentions obviously the tobacco companies have bad intentions obviously big
pharma has bad intentions obviously the deep state has bad
intentions the cia has bad intentions no all of them
have good intentions just like you they're just selfish just
like you from their point of view their ego mind
has twisted consciousness in such a manner that what they're
doing is justified in their own minds with good intentions
and they see it legitimately as them acting from good
intentions so they have complete plausible deniability for their actions
so when a terrorist chops someone's head off in his
mind that is done with the best of intentions this
is a bit disturbing to accept because of what it
means for you he said here you were navigating through
life believing that you're the good guy believing that your
your tribe and your team and your side and your
political party and your company and your race and your
ethnicity and your country that that you're all the good
guys and then those others over there whether it's the
corporations or the military-industrial complex or the oil companies or
the pharma companies or the elites or the the muslims
or the christians or the jews or the atheists or
whatever that they are the bad guys they're the ones
who have bad intentions they're the grifters they're the con
artists they're the thieves they're the abusers they're the racists
but that is just how your ego mind has twisted
and distorted consciousness to suit yourself to really understand what
i'm talking about here you're gonna have to go watch
my episode called understanding relativity reli relativism which is the
same thing as when i say relativity really i i
wish i retitled that episode it should be called understanding
relativity i didn't title that because i didn't want to
get confused with einstein's relativity so i called it relativism
um to differentiate it a bit but uh so yeah
so that episode you got to watch that and contemplate
that deeply uh and also you need to watch my
episode called self bias that's a foundational episode so when
you understand those two things then you can start to
get a bit of a clue that it could be
the case that literally everybody is acting with good intentions
but you might wonder but leo how could these people
be committing such obvious acts of of evil and inflicting
so much suffering onto others it's so obvious what they're
doing well it's obvious to you from your point of
view it's not obvious to them the challenge here is
that it's really difficult to see outside of one's own
perspective it's one of the most difficult things in the
world so there's sort of a optical illusion of consciousness
that takes place where it's very easy to see the
obvious mistakes of other people in the government and corporations
and elsewhere that are happening in other countries and other
ethnic groups and other tribes other political parties but it's
very difficult to see one's own and the reason it's
so difficult to see one's own obvious mistakes and blunders
and collateral damage that one does is because it doesn't
serve you to see it see that's what selfishness fundamentally
is selfishness means you don't care about the collateral damage
or footprint that your existence has upon others because if
you did care if you cared too much if you
were too empathetic it would be difficult for you to
live it would be difficult for you to eat it
would be difficult for you just to drive down to
the grocery store and buy your groceries because on your
way there at the traffic light you would see a
couple of homeless people and you would so empathize with
their miserable situation how hungry they are how hot they
are out there in the middle of the baking sun
in the in the summer heat how little water they
have how what kind of mental illnesses they have how
much they've been abused as as children all this if
you truly understood their point of view this would move
you so deeply that you would give them all of
your money you wouldn't have any money left to shop
for groceries because you would you would think about it
but you'd say you know what i still have a
pantry full of stuff i could probably use i don't
need the money these people need it way more than
i do i was just driving a grocery store to
buy some ice cream or something you know i don't
really need that ice cream relative to you know how
bad the situation is for these people these people haven't
eaten in a week and here i am driving the
grocery store buying some ice cream you know how uh
first world problems as they say you know how entitled
am i how uh how selfish am i right so
so because of this your mind literally has to block
off empathy it's difficult to function in the world with
too much empathy and yet this empathy is actually pointing
you to the truth the truth is that there's no
reason why you should live a more comfortable life than
anybody else that's the truth i mean who are you
kidding this idea that somehow you're entitled to a better
life you're entitled to more money you're entitled to a
house you're entitled to food to ice cream you're entitled
to sex you're entitled to um to any kind of
freedoms or democracy or anything it's a joke it's pure
selfishness on your part you're not entitled to anything and
coming to grips with this is challenging it's emotionally challenging
it takes maturity it takes intellectual honesty most ego minds
don't have enough intellectual honesty to take this on and
they're going to say well what's in it for me
leo how does this serve me well it doesn't you
selfish it doesn't serve you at all but it is
true when your life is built around just pleasing yourself
the truth doesn't serve you very often and therefore there
becomes a divergence between your life and truth and you
might say well what's the problem well at first it's
not a big problem but over time a divergence grows
the gap grows wider and wider and you start living
in your own isolated bubble your own fantasy your selfish
fantasy and then that fantasy you see it becomes very
fragile and vulnerable to getting bursted from the outside like
a soap bubble and see now every word i'm saying
every phrase i'm saying is like a needle threatening your
little soap bubble and so the more selfish your life
has been the more attached you are to that kind
of lifestyle then the more it's going to hurt the
more my words are going to hurt you and threaten
you and that's why a lot of people will just
turn this off at this point or maybe you're a
bit of a masochist a spiritual masochist and you like
being poked and paraded in which case welcome welcome to
this channel subscribe you'll love it so you see what's
really going on like you have to really care about
the epistemology here right like do you really want to
understand why people act how they act most people don't
give a but if you do then here's the scoop
right every ego is acting from good intentions but its
actions are always limited by its awareness and perception of
reality and the more selfish the ego is the more
distorted and twisted its perception of reality is so a
really selfish ego will believe convince itself that acting very
selfishly is good because it is from its own point
of view and then it will go out and cause
a lot of destruction and suffering to others and even
to itself while all the time convincing itself that it's
doing good and it's being the hero of life to
others from the outside looking in on that we will
see it as evil and bad and monstrous behavior especially
if we're more selfless and we're higher in our consciousness
because the more selfless we we are the more compassion
and empathy we have the more undistorted by ego our
awareness is the easier it is it is for us
to see the selfish actions of others and how they
hurt others and how they're obviously self-biased so this creates
almost a sort of a blind spot within reasonably conscious
people is that conscious people can look at unconscious people
and think that the unconscious people are evil because it's
not clear to you know a conscious person that one
could be so low conscious as some of these low
conscious people so like if you're living in a first
world democracy and you grew up in a suburb in
america somewhere a relatively nice middle-income a middle-class household let's
say you went to good schools you weren't physically abused
by your parents your parents were there for you they
were nice you know they gave you christmas presents and
all this and you had friends you had birthday parties
and things worked pretty well for you and now you
know maybe you're 25 30 40 years old somewhere around
there and see now when you look at let's say
in the middle east some terrorist you know decapitating some
westerner that he's kidnapped you look at that you say
oh my god that's horrible how horrible that person is
evil but what you're not appreciating is you're taking for
granted so much of how easy life has been for
you how privileged you've been to grow up in this
first world democracy where you could just drive down to
the grocery store and get yourself a bucket of ice
cream and eat it and have fun and play video
games and enjoy all the modern comforts whereas that guy
who grew up in afghanistan or wherever that this is
happening um like do you understand how difficult of a
childhood this person had this person's parents were probably killed
or raped or bombed their brother or sister might have
been kidnapped and tortured or bombed um this person as
a kid as a teenager just to survive had to
steal from others otherwise he would have died or gone
hungry or he had to steal just to provide for
his family or for his sister and then he had
to uh he had to join the local militia at
age 12 or 15 because there was no other job
opportunities in that area he couldn't have become a computer
programmer he couldn't go to school there were no schools
his school was bombed he couldn't go work at mcdonald's
there is no mcdonald's he couldn't get a summer job
he didn't have vacations [Music] his parents didn't supply him
with the bank account and a credit card there are
no credit cards so he joined the militia and to
survive in the militia he had to be tough and
he had to learn how to shoot a rifle and
throw grenades and set land mines and so all of
his friends were like him so you grew up with
a group of friends who were like-minded and you adopted
most of their beliefs and ideas uh like a sheep
and he did the same thing there and his friends
had a certain kind of ideology that was necessary for
survival in that brutal environment and so he picked up
that ideology it might have been some fundamentalist uh militant
form of islam or whatever and he picked that up
because he had to to survive and so anyways decades
of that passed and now he's 30 years old and
he's a he's you know he's a toughened uh you
know militia member of of that you know tribe that's
been surviving there for thousands of years they have a
long lineage they've been fighting different uh occupying countries not
just americans they were fighting russians and the british and
the saudis and the whatever iranians you know they've been
fighting there for decades and that's how they survive and
so in that environment cutting off someone's head this is
how they protect their land this is their version of
good this is how they gain back their government this
is how they gain their sovereignty from the oppression from
outside forces that are way beyond their power this aligns
with their version of you know their religious visions and
ideas of reconstituting their religious order that has fallen into
decay and from their point of view all these different
secular governments that are coming in there and meddling with
their affairs these are secular heathen governments that don't believe
in allah or whatever and therefore literally they're committing sin
so cutting off the head of a devil is that
a good thing or a bad thing from your cushy
perspective sitting there eating a bucket of ice cream watching
youtube for you it's a bad thing for them for
that person it's a good thing that's relativity to nutshell
and now what i want you to do is i
want you to open your mind so radically that i
that i want you to be able to see that
this relativistic dynamic is going on literally with every single
human actor on the planet not just individually but also
collectively with every organization every government every nation every tribe
every sports team every uh charity every non-profit every political
party this is going on and the chief delusion that's
also plaguing everybody on the planet is that almost no
none of these actors see this relativity they can't believe
this radical degree of relativity therefore they all end up
demonizing each other so the american thinks that the afghani
is evil the afghani thinks the american is evil the
muslim thinks the jew is evil the jew thinks the
muslims are evil or the palestinians are the evil ones
with bad intentions the little guy thinks the corporations are
are evil the corporations think that the bigger corporations are
evil or that government is evil government thinks that something
else some other government is evil and this is going
on all across every actor and even if you don't
think they're evil you think they have bad intentions well
consider the radical possibility that nobody actually has bad intentions
they have bad intentions from your point of view but
from their own point of view they're doing good they're
doing good according to their level of consciousness their level
of selfishness and what they perceive as good for them
because that is how the ego defines good good for
me it's not an absolute good so what the us
government calls good is good for it for the us
government it might be terrible for the russian government or
for the chinese government what exxon mobil calls good is
good for it it might be terrible for the environment
it might be terrible for you and me as ordinary
people might be terrible for the birds and the bees
and now you look at that you say well leo
but they should know better they should know better exxon
mobil should know better and they should care not just
about exxon mobil but they should also care about the
birds and the bees and the regular people too after
all don't the executives of exxon mobil live on the
same planet we all do so don't they all breathe
in the same fumes and pollution don't they all also
experience the same effects of climate change and so on
that all of us do won't the sea level rise
affect them too well of course it will but it
doesn't affect everybody equally you see if i'm the the
ceo of exxon mobil i don't really care how much
the sea level rises because i'm going to always have
enough money to just build walls or live on mountains
so it doesn't matter to me how much the sea
level rises so i can ignore that now you might
say leo but that's so selfish that's so myopic that's
so sociopathic but look at you look at how you
live your life it's actually no more myopic or sociopathic
than the way you live your life this is what
you don't want to realize you do the same thing
just in different ways structurally exxonmobil and you have the
same same problem which is self-bias you're both self-biased but
just in different ways into different degrees that's all you
say no leo but i'm really different i'm not like
exxon mobil i care about the environment and the birds
and the bees i wouldn't be so selfish yeah maybe
you're a little bit less selfish but fundamentally you're still
a selfish and you're still so self biased and the
way you live your life is so entitled and you
cause so much collateral damage just by the fact that
you breathe air and you eat food you've killed hundreds
and thousands of animals and creatures just by your existing
on this planet by driving your car by flying airplanes
by eating these creatures uh by uh even if you
eat vegetables even if you're a vegan you still you've
caused the suffering of of thousands of animals through farming
methods through the pesticides that are used on your apples
and your lettuce and so forth the chemical runoff um
from this has killed millions of fish and other sorts
of animals and insects like you don't but you don't
care about any of this from your point of view
you're just a good little vegan and you actually believe
that and you actually believe you're superior to others and
that you're actually the good guy and that your intentions
are pure whereas leo the intentions of the elites that
are running exxon mobil their intentions are not pure because
they're after money and money is you know evil in
this sort of no this is just a relativistic difference
of perspective actually the intentions of a ceo running exxon
mobil the the sort of the scary thing to realize
is not that the people running exxon mobil have evil
nefarious intentions but actually that they have good intentions they
actually have convinced themselves that they're doing good for the
world because hey you know they're doing the necessary um
work of exploring and mining out the natural gas and
and oil around the world and selling it to people
so that you can pump your you know some mother
can pump her uh her car full of gas and
drive her little sick child to the doctor and save
his life when he has an asthma attack and if
he didn't have the gas and if she didn't have
the gas in the gas tank that morning to drive
her son to the hospital he would have died and
so from the point of view of the exxon mobil
ceo the way he thinks about it might be something
like you know how many children did i save today
by pumping out all of that crude oil from the
middle east or wherever from the arctic how many children
were saved because that oil lubricated the machinery that runs
modern society from airplanes to cars to factories to electricity
generators there are people right now in a hospital near
you who are on life support they would die without
the life support systems and the lice those life support
systems are run by electricity from uh you know crude
oil generators but you and your myopia when you create
this us versus them mentality of like the populists versus
the elite the the evil elite corporations and so forth
you don't see all of the profound infinite interconnections of
these complex systems all you see is that exxon mobil
is pumping in pumping gas you know emissions into the
atmosphere and you know they're drilling in the arctic and
so and they're lobbying congress and they're you know corrupt
and all this this is what you see so from
your point of view they really exxonmobil really looks evil
but if you actually saw the full picture what would
happen is that you realize that they're not evil they
are behaving in the highest good that they know how
from their vantage point given their finite capabilities just like
you are the only difference is that you're not close
enough to exxon mobil to actually see all of that
infinite interconnected web of goodness that results from their activity
whereas you are close enough to yourself to see your
own innate goodness flowering through you in your life so
there's actually sort of a an additional mind that comes
from this it's sort of a mind within a mind
so at first you start to see how just how
selfish you are and you might start to feel bad
about yourself because you realize how much you've been fooling
yourself with how good you are relative to other people
but then when you go even deeper and you have
some really deep spiritual awakening and you really see the
infinite interconnectedness of all of these systems what you actually
realize is that the entire universe what it's doing is
it's manifesting maximum goodness through every individual finite incarnation of
itself such that actually all of the selfish stuff you
do that even you don't like about yourself all the
lying and cheating and manipulating and stealing and what other
other nasty things you've been doing all the collateral damage
you've caused what you ultimately realize is that all of
that collateral damage is necessary because you're just a finite
aspect of the universe and that your own finitude can't
help but act in finite manner and be selfish in
the way that it is because if you weren't selfish
you couldn't be alive and so at first it might
seem like i'm chastising you for being so selfish but
then you go deeper into this realization and you realize
that actually there's no there's no chastising there's no guilt
to be had about this you're selfish because you're a
finite manifestation of the universe and so is exxon mobil
and so is the guy in the taliban in afghanistan
and so is the president united states and so is
the president of china and so are the communists and
so are the capitalists and so are the jews and
so are the muslims and so are the christians and
so are the uh the scientists and so is everybody
you realize that actually every living being in the universe
is literally a manifestation of the universe's love and goodness
which is an absolute but absolute goodness and love will
always get corrupted and will always be less than infinite
when they are squeezed through a finite hole imagine sort
of like um you know those old i don't know
if they still make them play-doh um machines where you
got the play-doh that you play with you know like
clay and then um they had this sort of extruder
machine you would you would pump the clay in the
top and then you would push this sort of lever
and then you would have like a little template at
the on the bottom and you can kind of move
it and it would have different shapes you could have
like a circle a square a star a crescent moon
shape and then depending on which one you select it'll
push the the play-doh and clay through that hole and
make that kind of sort of extrusion that shape so
this is exactly what the universe is doing infinite love
and goodness in its purest absolute form has no form
at all it's completely formless we might say it's like
a giant lump of formless clay then if you want
to manifest it as a particular form whatever the form
is it doesn't matter that form is going to be
finite so you extrude it through this shape let's say
you select a square and you push it through there
as you push it through it's gonna it's gonna take
on the finite dimensions and characteristics of what it means
to be a square or a crescent moon or a
star and then it comes out and then it looks
like what it looks like it's no longer the infinite
lump that it used to be and therefore you might
say that it's love and its goodness is diminished it's
made finite in that process and so every human being
is like one of those shapes and then universal consciousness
is being pumped through that human being through that conscious
agent to produce some specific set of actions behaviors beliefs
attitudes goals ambitions intentions and so goodness is infusing the
actions of every agent on the planet but some of
these shapes can be larger or smaller than other shapes
some of these shapes are very twisted and corrupted shapes
and other shapes are are less so they're more holistic
and so the net effect of all of that is
that when you take absolute good intention and love and
you pump it through a very corrupt shape what you
get is a very corrupted form of love and that's
exactly what somebody like a hitler for example is or
in osama bin laden they're acting out of love they're
acting out of good intentions but from a twisted perspective
from a very self-biased and partial view of reality and
you might say well leo but but where is the
goodness and the love in hitler or in osama bin
laden i don't see the goodness i only see the
badness well because you're looking at it from your point
of view if you look at it from their point
of view and the point of view of the people
for whom they were doing what they were doing with
hitler for example he was doing it for the love
of his people but what he defines as his people
is very narrow compared to your definition so your definition
i hope of what counts as people is everybody in
the world if you're a hippie sort of person you
want to love everybody in the world equally but if
you're more conservative and the more conservative you get the
smaller your circle of concern gets if you're deeply deeply
far right wing then your notion of what counts as
your people is very small it's going to be confined
to just your country or your race or your ethnic
group and then if you're even lower in your stage
of development let's say your spiral dynamic stage purple it's
going to be just your tribe it's not even going
to be your country like for example in the middle
east you're not going to have a definition of people
you know the good people as all muslims that actually
takes a relatively high level of development to think so
unitively as everybody who's a muslim in the world is
part of my tribe no no no in the middle
east it's going to be much narrower it's going to
be even narrower than a single country it's not going
to be like well i'm an iraqi and i want
all of us iraqis to do good no your love
is too constrained to care about all iraqis all you
care about is you care about the sunni iraqis in
some particular little corner of that region of what we
call iraq and uh your little tribe it might be
a thousand people you only care about those thousand people
because those thousand people are the limits of your world
you didn't have the luxury of going to university where
they taught you about different cultures and exposed you to
japanese food and a you know uh asian history and
and black people and and aboriginal people and native american
people you didn't have this you have to understand somebody
who grew up and barely survives in iraq somewhere in
you know in a little village in iraq this person
only knows their little little local tribe they don't know
other groups of people they don't know other cultures they've
never eaten sushi they've never they've never met an asian
person in their life they've never met a black person
like their their worldview is so limited and so that
defines the scope of what they care about and what
they can love and then also they're scared if and
then later in life when they're when they are exposed
to other cultures let's say they're watching television or they
somehow they travel to a different country as a refugee
they're going to be exposed to different cultures different cuisines
different people different customs and different languages different religions different
ways of doing business different ways of thinking different types
of books different types of media this is going to
be very scary and threatening to such a person it's
gonna feel like a threat on his religion on his
cultural customs on his language on his ideas of uh
family of children of man and woman and how they're
supposed to relate to each other his sense of god
and allah because he has a very narrow version of
what god is too it's not even the muslim god
for this guy it's a much narrower version because see
he's even going to be freaked out by other people
who are muslims in other countries having slightly different versions
and conceptions of islam or allah even though fundamentally all
muslims believe in the same allah but to sunnis and
shiis shiites uh you know apparently that difference makes a
big difference to them now to us as westerners sitting
in america looking at that we say well how silly
you know sunni shia who gives a i mean they're
all muslims it doesn't matter you're praying the same allah
can't just get along and the answer is absolutely not
because these little differences become what seemed like like mole
hills become mountains when your sense of reality is very
constrained and limited and then you get ethnic cleansing and
you get war and you get genocide from this because
people are misunderstanding each other and they are ascribing bad
intentions to each other and we see this happening right
now in american culture see this this problem doesn't just
happen in the middle east somewhere in the middle of
nowhere uh it happens in america too we're seeing it
right now we're seeing huge polarization between the the right
wing and the left wing right now in america and
we're even seeing polarizations within those groups like within the
right wing you have a sort of a polarization between
the never trumpers and then the mega crowd or the
alt-right and then you have a polarization in the left
wing between the neoliberal types and sort of the corporate
democrats and then the uh the progressives and the more
socialist marxist type of folk and they're all fighting with
each other and they're all ascribing bad intentions to each
other even within the left wing you would think well
well certainly all the people in the left wing should
at least be able to see each other's good intentions
how everybody in the left wing is trying to do
the best for the country that they perceive according to
their worldview and their beliefs and their limitations you know
they're trying to do the best for the country but
no even even that fails to land on many within
the left wing it's very common to see progressives who
completely misunderstand the the good intentions of the corporate democrats
uh because they're angry at them and they don't really
understand how somebody can be a corporate democrat like a
socialist marxist type zoomer type who's maybe 25 years old
can't fathom what it's like for a corporate democrat who's
80 years old like nancy pelosi or something her worldview
can't fathom it so he demonizes her and attributes negative
intentions to her and calls her a grifter calls her
a sellout calls her corrupt all this sorts of stuff
you've seen all this on youtube right and really believes
that this marxist type of person really believes that and
conversely someone like nancy pelosi when she looks at that
marxist kid she doesn't understand where he's coming from and
maybe she attributes some bad intentions to him i don't
know um [Music] certainly the corporate democrats will demonize progressives
to win elections and so forth right and that's just
within the left wing supposedly these people should all get
along they're all they're all really close to each other
ideologically speaking now but you see what a socialist would
say here's leo how dare you even insinuate that i
would have anything to do with nancy pelosi oh i
like she's disgusting to me i'm not i'm not in
her camp at all how dare you lump us together
you see but that's exactly what the what the shiite
would say against the sunni and the sunni against the
shia in afghanistan or wherever in the middle east you
see it's going to be the same logic because your
ego mind is drawing these boundaries and it's defining what
group you belong to or don't belong to every group
you belong to you need some enemy to just differentiate
that group your group from that other group gives you
a sense of purpose to fight against them and then
this is this is survival and then of course the
situation is even worse when it comes to like progressives
trying to understand the right wing or the alt-right so
they call them racists and they call them sexists and
they call them misogynists and all the sorts of nazis
and fascists and all this sorts of stuff all this
language really it's just a cover for failing to understand
the good intentions of the alt-right and if you think
the alt-right does not have good intentions according to them
remember there's no such thing as absolutely good intentions here
it's all relative so when we say good intentions it's
either according to you or according to them or according
to me or somebody it's relativistic so uh the key
delusion here is to think that there's some absolute notion
of good intention there isn't there's no there's no such
thing as a good intention without an ego mind who
is interpreting that intention so what are the good intentions
of the alt-right well they're trying to preserve their race
their ethnicity their country from what they perceive as an
attack why genocide and all this now i know hey
i know it sounds kind of ridiculous if you're a
progressive you know it sounds like well they're just making
the aren't they just making this up uh uh ultimately
what you got to see is they're not making it
up any more than you're making your up see we're
all making it up all the reality is made up
so that's no excuse so what i'm trying to get
you to realize is that this infinite clay this play-doh
that is being extruded through these different shapes that that
is what all human action is and the sooner you
recognize that the more at peace you will be in
the world and the the more the more the um
the more clear your perception of reality will be you
will see things more truthfully you will be able to
understand others you will have more compassion and empathy for
others see a progressive actually can't have empathy or compassion
or love for someone from the alt-right because he just
has demonized that person as a racist sexist fascist how
can you love how can you love that you can't
the these terms are in effect i mean it's not
the same thing as calling someone a literal devil but
in effect that's what it is when you call someone
a racist or a fascist that effectively puts them in
the category in your mind of like a secular version
of a devil you're always gonna hate that person you're
never gonna get along get along with that person and
uh um you're always gonna misunderstand the person that's that's
the problem now i hear progressives here um making sort
of counter argument they say well but leo but why
would i want to love the fascist and the racist
why would i want to love him why would i
want compassion for such a monster um i mean am
i supposed to like hug a nazi kiss a nazi
make out with a nazi no we got to defeat
the nazis is what you might say and at a
certain relative practical level yeah you got to defeat nazis
if they're you know coming to town to actually kill
you um but first of all you should notice that
the majority of the alt-right are not actually nazis um
so don't overblow it um that's one of the problems
with this sort of black and white you know thinking
in this demonization is that you take it too far
you lose the nuance so first of all there's that
uh second of all though is that you will never
actually understand them and you will never have you will
never have a truthful understanding of their perspective and that's
what should bother you now i'm not saying that you
got to go vote for a nazi or a fascist
and i'm not saying that there's no problems with the
alt-right there certainly are many problems and i i personally
would never vote for an alt-right candidate for office and
i would in fact speak out against it but uh
there's a deeper meta issue here which is that regardless
of how you vote and what kind of policies you
you want and what kind of action you take in
the world more important than that is your capacity to
actually understand and make sense of other people's perspectives that's
more important because as soon as you drop your intellectual
integrity and you get sloppy with it and you start
misunderstanding other people's perspectives this is the beginning of the
end because you're detaching yourself from truth and from reality
the divergence now is going to grow between your ego
mind and your worldview and truth and reality and eventually
it's going to grow so wide that epistemic blunders and
catastrophe will happen and from this will result all sorts
of evils violence and war hatred and so forth so
what we're aiming for here i'm not saying something naive
here in the sense that like we got to go
hug and kiss terrorists and nazis and allow them to
rise to high office and so forth i'm not saying
anything that naive something something very challenging is required here
on the one hand you have to be ruthlessly pragmatic
and you have to be especially when you're talking about
politics for example you have to see what kind of
consequences various kinds of political leaders and ideologies will have
in the world and you have to adjudicate between which
ones will be better for the greater whole of mankind
and which ones will be worse that's important to do
but you can't let that pragmatism be the only thing
that drives your politics or your life even more important
than that is actually being able to understand other people
and perspectives and worldviews and groups and so on otherwise
you're actually not going to be able to to find
holistic solutions and you're actually going to delude yourself and
a lot of progressives end up deluding themselves about the
motives of conservatives and right-wingers and um if you're a
progressive you might say well leo who cares that doesn't
really matter as long as we're we're voting for the
for the right people we're voting for the good guys
as long as we're enacting the right policy changes it
doesn't matter if i misunderstand the intentions and you know
uh perspectives of some stupid fascist it doesn't matter but
it does matter you're being myopic you're not seeing how
this will boomerang on you untruthful perception of reality always
ends up mattering it's just a question of how long
will it take to boomerang it may not make a
difference in the next election cycle but eventually it will
make a difference especially when this is done in a
group as part of a collective activity because you see
you're not doing it alone it's you and hundreds of
other thousands of people like you millions of people like
you who are going to be buying into similar kinds
of perspectives which are all going to be distorted in
various ways and then that's going to build upon itself
and develop a life of its own and this delusion
will develop a mind and life of its own it
will become a collective ego of its own it'll turn
into an ideology and it will misunderstand reality and it
will act from that place and from that place will
be created evil and suffering it's a problem because of
if you watch my episodes very important ones um about
holism and holistic thinking part one and part two go
watch that see what i talked about with in that
episode i gave you sort of a master formula for
how reality works and i told you we equated remember
i equated consciousness and truth and health and holism and
i equated more things but we'll start with those also
love right the highest love is intimately tied with truth
consciousness integrity holism and health you can't have these things
separated because ultimately they're all one thing because reality is
a unity love and truth point you towards that unity
and i said that goodness is equivalent to all of
that goodness is the ability to see unity so if
you're as a progressive unable to see the unity that
you share with a fascist with what you call a
fascist and you don't see that fascist truthfully but in
some distorted way then you can't love that fascist and
if you can't love that fast you're gonna hate or
fear that fascist and hate and fear is ultimately what's
gonna lead you to act selfishly and to have various
kinds of attachments and that's ultimately going to lead to
a lack of holism in your perspective and a lack
of holism is the very definition of what you fight
against which is evil and oppression and injustice so it
will boomerang on you the problem is that you're not
conscious enough you don't have enough vision to see how
it will boomerang and so you think you can get
away with it but you're not going to get away
with it there's going to be a cost and so
it would be nice if you wised up to that
i mean i'm not just picking on progressives here i
mean the same problem even even more so applies to
to how the alt-right for example c progressives or how
they see socialist there's a lot of demonization of socialists
that's going on now within the right wing in america
and around the world and of course it's obvious why
the right wing is doing that because from their world
view their intention is good in demonizing the socialists because
in their world view they truly believe and they see
the socialists as just a rehash of the soviet-style mao
style marxism of the previous century and all of the
hundreds of millions of people that they believe it killed
as an ideology and so they're really threatened by that
and so they're literally willing to do anything to prevent
that kind of thing from happening again so can you
see how from the position of the alt-right or just
even moderate conservatives this idea of everyone now talking about
marxism and socialism and communism and demonizing capitalism and speaking
negative about how this is freaking them out these people
have not read marks they don't have a deep understanding
of marxism they don't have a deep understanding even of
capitalism there's a lot of stuff they don't understand but
but see that ignorance is what defines that world view
and you have to take that into account if you're
a progressive you have to take into account that the
people that you're demonizing are mostly just ignorant they haven't
been educated the way you have they maybe they didn't
go to school they didn't go to university or they
didn't get good grades or they didn't study the things
you studied they don't have a deep understanding of of
marxism and so forth and so can you really blame
them for being scared and for demonizing something that they
don't understand if you actually understood that as a progressive
this would actually improve your life so even though what
i'm talking about here at first it might sound like
oh leo you're you're being so overly philosophical none of
this stuff is very practical how is this going to
improve my life but it will improve your life because
right now you're caught in this battle and by the
way even though now this topic has gotten very political
here i'm just using this as an example i want
you to extrapolate this out way beyond politics you're caught
in a battle with other people in your life whether
it's with conservatives or with progressives or with corporate neoliberals
or with libertarians or with socialists or with capitalists or
with corporatists or with big oil companies or with elites
or with some conspiracy group that you're you know fighting
with so you're caught in this sort of battle and
this is draining you of your life energy fundamentally you
should be able to feel through an introspection capacity that
you've developed hopefully by watching my introspection episode you should
have you should be able to feel that this sort
of negativity is actually robbing you of your life energy
it's making you a bitter spiteful angry fearful person you
should also see that this is polarizing society at a
collective level so this is not just a personal problem
it's also a collective problem because as all of us
the more we start to demonize each other and attribute
negative bad intentions towards each other not able to see
the good intentions of all sides this makes us hate
each other more and we can't operate cohesively as a
society and then it might get so bad that society
will disintegrate people talk about a civil war you see
so it's a problem both collectively and individually and for
you as an individual if you're a progressive let's say
what it does is it actually puts you out of
alignment with your spiritual center your spiritual center is love
and goodness and positivity and creativity and being constructive and
being compassionate and being empathetic and you as a progressive
you value this you value empathy but you lack the
empathy necessary to radically understand and integrate something like the
perspective of a fascist and you justify that in your
mind by saying that oh well leo that's not practical
we know climate change is too important for us to
to compromise with fascists and issues of lgbtq rights and
animal rights and other things are too important to even
care about understanding the fascist perspective this i suggest is
a short-sighted perspective you're sacrificing a short-term victory in a
single battle but even if you win that battle you
might lose the ultimate war and you're so focused on
winning that battle that you're not seeing the entirety of
the war how it fits into the larger picture of
things and you're not even seeing how it affects you
individually how it robs you of your own spiritual center
how it diminishes your love and your own capacity to
be good and to be happy because you can't fundamentally
be happy when you believe that there are all these
actors in the world with bad intentions you're you're always
going to be bitter and fearful and this is the
karmic consequence of untruthful perception to him who is afraid
every bush rustles every shadow is cause for concern and
worry the point of spirituality is to raise the clarity
of your perception to such a high degree that literally
you expunge evil from the world and this is why
i'm so how should i put it i'm so um
antsy i guess i'm so anti-conspiracy theory i'm so anti-conspiracy
theory because fundamentally what conspiracy theories do is they make
you paranoid they make you believe that there are groups
and cabals of people out there who are conspiring to
do evil against you they make you feel like you're
the good guy and they're the bad guy and when
this is your worldview you better believe this shapes how
you feel it actually disconnects you from the highest thing
you can achieve in the world which is a recognition
of infinite love you are literally severing your connection to
infinite love and goodness and to god and to truth
whenever you attribute evil intentions to other people or groups
you cut yourself off from god not knowing that you're
doing so and so the reason we're having this conversation
is because i'm trying to guide you towards a realization
of infinite love but how can you realize infinite love
if you believe that there are actors in the world
with bad intentions so i would like you to just
try to adopt the following perspective put it on for
a while put it on like glasses you know put
this on like orange colored glasses wear them for a
week and just see how it feels and then you
can take them off if you like and go back
to your old ways so i would like you to
put on the orange colored glasses of for the next
week everything you see on the news every everybody you
argue with everybody in your life everybody that you think
about every group all the political activity going on every
government and so forth every corporation i would like you
to see all of it as actions from the highest
good and the most loving intentions but extruded through a
very finite form so of course it's going to be
limited and it's going to be corrupted and i also
want you to see yourself in that way as well
so we're not making any exception for you you and
all of your actions over the next week whether you
lie cheat steal manipulate or do some quote unquote traditional
good things you know you do some charity work or
whatever whatever you're doing in your life for the next
week i want you to see that whether it's good
or bad all that action is also coming from the
highest love and goodness but it's being extruded through the
limited shape of your ego mind that you are and
therefore it gets corrupted and it comes out in a
twisted fashion and so maybe you say something nasty to
your spouse over the next week or maybe you leave
some nasty comment in a youtube video over the next
week or maybe you steal some paper clips at work
because you're you're selfish or whatever or you're you're cheap
you don't want to buy your own paper clips so
you steal some from work you know whatever whatever you
do all of that i want you to see all
of that as love and goodness but corrupted finite and
then i want you to connect these things such that
what's being extruded through you really you see it as
the same process the same structure as what's being extruded
through the guy on the news or your political enemy
or opponent or that corporation that you don't like and
then notice notice what happens when you actually do this
notice how it makes you feel there's going to be
a shift an important shift and then if you're wise
you could intuit the power and the truth of what
i'm telling you here and then continue wearing these glasses
for the rest of your life be on this one
week you see you're going to try them out for
a week try try seeing the world truthfully and with
love for one week see if you can handle that
and then carry on for the rest of your life
and then deepen it too it's not going to stop
there we're going to keep working on this i'll have
more episodes in the future that will keep deepening this
love until ultimately it's it's all working towards something uh
ultimately this will help to inch you towards the realization
of infinite love that reality is the manifestation of infinite
love and then maybe you'll understand what what this is
all about and then in retrospect you'll look backwards and
you'll say oh my god how could i have been
so selfish and so blind as to actually believe that
there's any evil in the world that there's anything wrong
with the world you'll realize there was never anything wrong
with the world there was only something wrong with my
vision of the world with my ideas of how the
world should be the only thing that was wrong with
the world is my selfishness and actually you'll even then
realize in an even deeper self-embrace that even your own
selfishness and all of your biases they weren't wrong they
were absolutely necessary as part of what love is so
actually counter-intuitively and paradoxically selfishness and corruption are absolutely fundamental
to love you might think they're the opposite of love
they're not they're only the opposite of love in a
sort of dualistic sense when you fully awaken you'll realize
that selfishness corruption are just as much a part of
love as anything else because love is not just infinite
love is also finite and so while you can think
of the godhead as pure infinite love in its undiluted
uncorrupted form when you see a human being walking around
on the sidewalk you can look at that human being
and you can say that is a finite form of
love walking on the sidewalk it's going to express love
in a finite way it's going to be biased it's
going to be selfish because it has to be in
order to keep walking if it wasn't selfish if it
wasn't biased it couldn't walk it couldn't talk it couldn't
do anything it couldn't be anything it couldn't have any
form it would have to be a purely formless singularity
of love now that's great the only problem with it
is is that it has no form therefore it can't
look like a human it can't be any kind of
physical object it's effectively nothing so there's a there's there's
a very profound trade-off here between the infinite and the
finite and the reason that you don't find angelic human
beings very often the reason human beings act like devils
and they disappoint you and they're selfish and they're petty
and they lie and they cheat and they steal and
they manipulate and they are deluded and they are ideological
and they're closed-minded and they're abusive and they're vindictive and
they're fearful and they're petty and they're jealous and they're
argumentative and they don't get along and they fight with
each other and they go to war and they kill
each other the reason all this happens is because it
must happen because the only thing that can exist as
a perfect unity is completely formless if it has a
form it's going to be less than infinite which is
going to lead to conflict and it's going to lead
to suffering and this is just an existential trade-off between
the infinite and the finite and that's something you have
to swallow and accept and love and if you can
manage that then you have completely integrated all of reality
within yourself and then you're finally at peace regardless of
what's going on around you now mind you even though
i say all this you know i talk about love
and peace and and beauty and so forth god that
does not mean that the actual material conditions around you
will automatically be peaceful we could all die in world
war iii tomorrow so you might say well then leo
what's the point isn't the whole point to prevent world
war 3 no actually here's the point the point is
that if we're all going to die in world war
iii tomorrow i'm going to die knowing that it's love
and you're going to die crying and suffering and being
miserable of how the world went to hell that's going
to be the difference and you might say well leo
that's a who cares about that difference because we're both
going to die so it's it's it has no difference
except it does it does have a difference because the
other thing you don't realize is that uh death itself
is imaginary so you're not really gonna die you think
you're gonna die that's not the difference between you and
me i know that i can't die so the difference
is that if you actually have clear perception of reality
you can die in peace you're beyond death you've transcended
death and you can die without regret and you can
also live in peace and without regret and without guilt
you can be calm because you actually clearly and distinctly
perceive that reality is perfect that's the real key here
that i'm trying to guide you towards ultimately what i'd
like for you if you're following my work i'd like
you to reach a point where you can just sit
and realize that reality is completely perfect and that there's
nothing wrong and there could never be anything wrong no
matter what happens this is the ultimate power now the
mistake that people make here is that when a materialist
hears me talking like this they will say oh leo
but this is just some sort of hippie new age
that you've brainwashed yourself with i mean sure maybe i
can sit down for a few years and if i
watch enough of your videos eventually i'll i'll myself with
enough of your ideas that i will start to believe
like you that actually everything is perfect and that reality
is all love and i can i can do i
can fool myself with these sorts of illusions and fantasies
but it won't be true but that's not what i'm
telling you what i'm telling you is the exact opposite
of that what i'm telling you is that if you
go through this process it's a deconstructive process you deconstruct
all of your self biases you deconstruct your mind you
jail break your mind you do all this work you
become more conscious and as you're doing so it's not
that you're filling your mind with new age beliefs that
are all positive no no no all you're doing is
you're just clearing away the garbage and the ego smog
you're clearing that away and eventually when you cleared it
all away and your perception is perfectly clear what you
realize is that the truth is perfection itself and love
itself this is not something you are filling your mind
with as an ideology it's an emptying of all ideology
and what you'll realize the recontextualization mindfuck will come when
you realize that oh all that negativity and all of
my problems and all of my cynicism and all of
my conspiracy theories and all of my demonization of others
and including myself oh all of that was the layers
upon layers upon layers of that my mind was filled
with it's not that love is some new age belief
it's that fear and hate and greed and pettiness and
evil these are the materialist beliefs that you've been indoctrinated
into that you've never questioned you take them as reality
you take them as physics but they're not physics they're
just beliefs very bad very limiting beliefs and they're not
true see materialists fooled themselves into thinking like well um
leo i'm such a hard-nosed truthful person you know i
would love to believe that reality is is all happiness
and love like you say in god and all these
beautiful things and immortality i would love to believe these
things but i'm just i'm just too hard-nosed man you
know i'm too scientific i'm too i'm too rational i'm
too i'm too fact-based for you too fact-based and it's
just not a fact that reality is this beautiful thing
it's not a fact if only it were so but
you know leo i i can't fool myself i'm so
fact-based i can't fool myself into into believing everything is
so positive like you say that sounds delusional i would
rather be truthful than be even be happy if it
means you know if i have to choose between truth
and happiness and love i will choose truth and hard
facts and objectivity over all that hippie dippy stuff but
what you don't realize is that you don't need to
choose the universe is so structured that all you have
to do is choose truth but when you choose truth
you got to choose truth not your ideas of truth
you gotta actually question what truth is all the way
to rock bottom all the way to rock bottom beyond
anything you can imagine you got to choose truth so
deeply that it goes full circle and then you realize
when you actually discover truth that it is happiness and
love what kind of sick do you think designed this
universe that would make truth and love and happiness in
conflict with each other that's the beauty of the design
of the universe is that truth is love it is
goodness it is happiness that is your salvation is that
that is absolutely the case the only thing that's the
problem is you not realizing that it's a bit like
you're a millionaire but you don't realize you're a millionaire
because you never check your bank account and the reason
you never check your bank account even though i tell
you hey go check check your bank account you know
you're whining and complaining about being poor and you're struggling
to pay your bills and you're so miserable you've been
miserable for years complaining how poor you are and i
keep telling you go check your bank account and you
say but leo why i'm so poor there's nothing in
my bank account there's nothing there it's a waste of
time to even look and so you never look but
i keep telling you just go look go go look
in your bank account and you keep giving me stories
about oh leo my bank account is so empty you
don't know how bad it is and i just keep
telling you go look just go look and you keep
saying no leo it's it's hopeless it's it's it's a
waste of my time and then only on your deathbed
do you actually finally say okay fine i'm gonna die
tomorrow so it i'll just go check i don't care
how bad it is i'm just gonna go check anyways
just to prove you wrong and then you go you
look in your bank account and you realize your account
is infinite all right that's it i'm done here hope

long segments i have a great editor who's cutting up
all of my episodes going through my entire back catalog
of episodes clipping them up into short segments and then
posting those on the second channel so make sure you
use that there's still more to talk about in terms
of love we'll have more episodes about love and about
fear and about connecting you with that uh ultimately like
i just want to stress again i've stressed this in
the past but i i i'm going to keep hammering
on this point everything that i teach the entire purpose
of all of these topics even the most abstract and
the most philosophical and the most scientific and the most
technical stuff that i teach all the stuff that seems
like it has no practical purpose or that it seems
like it's got nothing to do with love the only
point of it is to help you to realize love
what i want you to start to notice is that
love is a much grander and more diverse thing than
you've ever imagined your ideas of what love is are
extremely limited and nobody in society has taught you the
true diversity of what love is love is not just
some hippie notion and it's not just a good feeling
love is the most profound thing that there is and
it takes a lot of work to be able to
recognize it in all of its forms and the reason
it's so difficult is because we're so afraid and we're
so biased and we're so attached to our finite notions
of love that we don't want to see the full
spectrum of what love is it's too threatening to us
so it's a process of opening your mind bit by
bit so oftentimes i'm trying to guide you to love
through an indirect means and so what's going to happen
if you watch all of my content and you start
to piece it together and you start to do the
practices is that gradually you're going to start to see
how all of this adds up to an overarching love
for reality that's the point of all this we're trying
to free your mind of all of the garbage that
it's been filled with all the finite limited garbage it's
been filled with limiting beliefs victim mindsets bad emotions fear
uh bad ideologies that you've picked up wrong ways of
looking at the world twisted and biased ways of seeing
the world we're trying to clear all that up just
to make room for what is the underlying ground of
existence which is love infinite metaphysical love and then we
can look at how it manifests itself through all the
different aspects of the of of of life through your
body through your emotional system through your mind through your
thinking process through your intellect and through society through different
organizations and corporations all of this is this is all
different gradations and manifestations of love and so we're going
to tie all those things together it's a deeply holistic
process and i'm going to have a lot more episodes
in the future talking about collective issues political issues helping
you to understand these things because to me it's not
about the politics don't get hung up on the politics
it doesn't really matter what your politics are or whether
you agree with my politics or not what matters is
the meta the structure behind what's being talked about in
these examples don't get hung up on the examples learn
the deeper lessons and be willing to let go of
various attachments that you have you see you're afraid your
mind is afraid of letting go of intellectual attachments whether
it's a political philosophy you have or your notion of
what freedom is if you're a libertarian or even your
your socialist ideas if you're a progressive it doesn't matter
all of these things will become limits for you right
if you're progressive and you fancy yourself this uh very
politically evolved advanced being you're not you're not that advanced
just because you're a little bit more advanced than the
other guys doesn't make you that advanced you got higher
stages to go to and i'm really excited to show
you how to experience life beyond your progressive worldview and
if you're concerned you've got a little bit more work
to do because first you gotta evolve up towards progressivism
and then you got to transcend that too so you
got more work to do but either way whoever you
are you've got a lot of work to do before
you realize infinite love and a lot more episodes of
mine to watch to interconnect all the pieces and fit
them all together so make sure you stay tuned for
that you
