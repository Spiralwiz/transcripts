[Music] welcome to another actualized episode and in this one
we're gonna be talking about the many facets of awakening
otherwise known as enlightenment this is an advanced episode for
serious students of non-duality I'm going to be telling you
over 30 facets of awakening that I have personally verified
and that I claim you can verify for yourself as
well in your spiritual journey these are some of the
deepest insights that a human being can have about the
nature of reality in life these are absolute insights beyond
the realm of science logic culture and human knowledge this
is as deep as it gets and I'm gonna be
giving you a whole list of these so you can
check them off as you're doing this work but before
we get into that let me just quickly remind you
actualized gorg did just launch on patreon which was a
platform for supporting independent creators many of you have contributed
and I'm very grateful and thankful for that if you
would like to contribute and support my work then you
can go to patreon.com/scishow and make a small monthly contribution
that helps me to improve the quality of my content
and my work and to stay independent and to expand
into new domains in the future all right so with
that said let's get into it so one of the
biggest misconceptions about enlightenment or awakening is that it's just
a single realization you have it boom it's some binary
switch that you flip from off to on and now
you're awake you're in line that's it done and that's
sort of the simplistic newbie notion of what Awakening is
like well it's not really like that it's far more
complicated than that there are facets to it there are
facets and there are degrees and so that's what we'll
be talking about most of the facets here you can
be conscious of one of these facets but yet clueless
about the others that's the interesting and tricky thing about
this work so you always have to be careful just
because you've glimpsed one of these things one of these
facets doesn't mean that you understand everything there is to
understand you might be missing something very important so sometimes
we use the metaphor of thinking of awakening like this
mountain or we think of spiritual work as a mountain
that you're climbing and we say that well of course
there's different paths up the mountain but all paths ultimately
leave to the same peak and this is a nice
cute little metaphor it seems like it should make sense
but what I've found is that actually it's more useful
to think of Awakening as a mountain range and not
a single mountain which means that not only are there
multiple pads up the same mountain but there's multiple mountains
and some mountains are higher than other mountains and even
though these different peaks share things in common they're still
different and it does matter which Peaks you're climbing and
which path you're taking and not all paths will take
you up to the same peak so that's a little
additional wrinkle to spiritual work so what is the value
of this list that I'm about to give you why
am i giving it to you so that you can
systematically pursue and literally if you want you can use
this as a checklist to track your progress in this
work and the other great value here is that when
you have this checklist it's harder for you to fool
yourself so that you don't miss any of them because
sometimes what happens is people climb one or two peaks
and they think that they're done when actually there's ten
more Peaks that they've missed that's what I tend to
find so that's the value of this list so let's
get right into it what are all these different facets
well in no particular order I will be listing them
to you of course you can experience them in different
in different orders you're not gonna necessarily it's not gonna
happen in the same order that I'm listening of course
so the first one is what is Samadhi to know
what Samadhi means or in other words to know what
a mystical experience is or to enter a non dual
state that's one of the first realization is usually that
you have in this work is that you have your
first samadhi experience your first mystical experience now of course
some teachers and people say well Leo that's not enlightenment
per se and all that that's fine but it's it's
it's a critical step in this process understanding what Samadhi
is what is Samadhi basically what it is is it's
a state of consciousness in which the duality between subject
and object has been erased where you realize that subject
and object are one and that's your like first mystical
experience and that's your clue that there's something deeper going
on within reality then you fought under the material materialist
paradigm and this is your first sort of glimpse into
mysticism or spirituality where you realize like oh [ __
] spirituality is not just beliefs and ideologies and crazy
religious people believing hocus-pocus there's actually something serious and real
here that I need to pursue further another facet a
very important one is what I call the facet of
no self Buddhists also call it this wearing you realize
that there never was such a thing as a self
and what do we mean by a self that human
self that I'm pointing at right now that I'm pointing
to you that thing that you think you are that
you have believed you are the whole of your life
this biological entity this creature this human this mammal that
you think you are who is born and is living
on this round rock that is orbiting the Sun all
of this this this kind of personal story that you
have of yourself so when you truly awaken you realize
there never was such a self that this self was
imaginary and that's a huge epiphany that gets us a
little bit more to the center of what awakening really
means and that's a very distinct insight that you can
have you could have a mystical experience you could have
a samadhi but still the insight that there never was
a self doesn't hit you or if it does that
it does see so all these facets that I'm going
to be explaining here you can experience them individually or
sometimes you can experience them in aggregate lumped in with
other facets it all depends so you can have a
Samadhi where you also realize that there never was a
self or you can just have a Samadhi or later
you can just have an insight into no self or
anything that I'm going to be mentioning on this list
the next of asset is the facet that I'm going
to call I am capital I am all capital letters
I am just simply that I am that you are
that that is the deepest truth of what you are
is that I am or we might call it the
self with a capital S so you might wonder well
doesn't this contradict to the previous insight where I supposedly
realize that I am just imaginary no it's just two
sides the same coin so when you realize no self
wish you're realizing is that that human self that you
thought was born the thing that we use your name
to refer to so if I refer to you as
John or if I refer to you as Mary and
that's your given birth name that's who you think you
are that identity you realize that that whole thing is
a fiction and it never existed but then the next
question arises of like well what what am i then
if I'm not that then what am i and the
answer is well you're not a human you're not even
a thing you're not even a physical object you're just
pure I am Nisour the self with a capital S
the universal self and this is of course what various
Hindu and Yogi traditions refer to as the the Atman
the like the Royal self the God self the universal
self the I am it's just an overwhelming feeling of
I am when you have this insight it's like I
am oh I realize that I am now when you're
listening to me say this you might say well leo
of course I am that's so obvious I am yeah
I already know that everybody knows that no you don't
know that you think you know that the problem is
right now yes you think you are but you just
think it there's a big difference between thinking that you
are and realizing that your i am-ness itself and more
specifically what you think you are right now is you
think you are a human that's here I am that's
not the true I am that's a false I am
the true I am is without humaneness it's not limited
to being a human or a creature or being physical
or material or anything like that it's just literally pure
i am-ness so of course it's here right now you
am right now but you're not conscious of it the
way you will be when you really awaken to it
this can also feel like you become conscious that you
are the entire universe so your identity expands from being
a limited human self to being the whole universe literally
you experience this awakening as though the entire universe is
looking through your eyes and that that's what was always
the case is that you have confused the universe in
a sense has confused itself for being a human that's
that facet the next facet is what I call omnipresence
it's the realization that what you are pure I am
this is completely omnipresent which means that it's not located
it's not located behind the eyes between the ears in
your skull in your head it's not in the brain
it's not here it's not there it's not in your
chest it's not in your heart it's not in your
body it's completely omnipresent it's absolutely everywhere and simultaneously nowhere
that's omnipresence that's you're realizing the omnipresence of God or
the omnipresence of consciousness or the omnipresence of i am-ness
your true self that can be a freaky realization because
usually when we talk about objects or things we think
of them as being located or centralized it's very counterintuitive
and illogical for a thing to be omnipresent and yet
that's exactly what you are and that's exactly what consciousness
is it says it's an omnipresent field which is not
located anywhere more than anywhere else it's everywhere and it's
know where the next facet is the answer to the
question of what is consciousness where you realize what consciousness
is so right now you're conscious but you're not conscious
of what consciousness is in fact you can conscious your
whole life but you still aren't any closer to realizing
what consciousness is but if you do this work long
enough and you have a deep awakening you can get
an answer to that question and what is consciousness well
it's not a verbal answer all these verbal answers that
I'm giving you they don't do justice to what we're
really talking about this requires a direct experience this requires
an awakening it requires a shift in your consciousness but
for the first time in your life you realize the
significance of what consciousness is and you realize that consciousness
is absolutely everything there is nothing but consciousness there is
nothing outside of consciousness and usually while you're realizing this
there is sort of an ancillary facet here that you
realize which is that there is no external physical reality
there is only consciousness and there can be nothing outside
of consciousness and even the idea that there ever could
have been an external reality seems ludicrous at this point
because you're so conscious you realize that there can't be
anything but consciousness another facet is the answer the question
of what is awakening we use this word awakening and
many people talk about being woke this is sort of
a becoming a popular term in pop culture like oh
that guy's woke or he's woke she's world bla bla
bla bla bla people who talk about being woke have
no idea about what what awakening really is the only
way to know what awakening is is to actually awaken
and it's a distinct experience that you have you awaken
literally what happens is that you awaken from the dream
of life when you awaken truly you realize that your
entire life has been just a dream exactly like a
dream exactly like waking up from a nightmare exactly what
it's like you awaken from that and you look upon
yourself you look upon your body you look upon the
room you're in and it's like looking at it for
the first time you're truly awake for the first time
in your life you're conscious of what everything is in
a way that was totally impossible just a moment previously
and you understand for the first time what that word
awakening really means and the only way you can understand
that is by doing it by actually awakening but what
you'll be amazed to discover is that that word awakening
is very accurate you're gonna be using that word I
remember the first time that I awoke the first words
that came to my mouth and to my mind is
just that like oh my god I'm awake this is
what it means to be awake like this is really
awake and like it's so awake that it it's it's
a level of woke mnestheus shatters all of physical reality
it's it's miraculous it's magical it's it's incredible you would
think it's impossible to be this conscious and yet here
it is you're that conscious and you're finally awake for
the first time in your life that's an amazing experience
and that that's what we might call a classic enlightenment
or Satori the next insight or facet is oneness or
non duality where you really realize for the first time
that everything is truly one before you've probably heard about
Yogi's and sages and maybe myself talking about oneness how
everything is one and all dualities collapse into one blah-blah-blah-blah-blah
you've heard it a million times you've read it a
bunch of times and books and so forth but you
still don't understand what one this really means you might
think one this is a metaphor and so forth but
here you awaken to oneness and you realize like oh
oh it's truly one it's absolutely one reality is one
complete singular unit or thing with no boundaries in between
anything all objects and things are completely connected in a
unified field of consciousness that's what you realize and this
has many ramifications and consequences that I've talked about in
the past and I'll talk about more in the future
but this is this is a radical realization of oneness
when you realize this oneness you realize that you're you're
literally one with everything with all beings with all objects
plants trees animals stars universe's galaxies like all of it
all of it is one and you realize how everything
that you thought was separate isn't really separate the separation
was imaginary the separation was a projection of your own
mind you finally understand what non duality means and you
have something to contrast it against with duality also now
understand what duality means so there's a contrast now between
the two as an ancillary facet or inside here you
could you could also realize that there is no difference
between anything that basically the difference between a cat and
a dog is purely imaginary the difference is relative the
difference exists if you think it exists the difference between
a taco and a human only exists and is real
as long as you believe it is as long as
you imagine that it is that's a very freaky insight
when you realize that all differences are totally relative so
that comes with realizing oneness and non duality another powerful
facet of awakening is the answer to the question of
what is truth truth with a capital T I have
an episode about that called what is truth where I
explain it in more detail so I won't go into
it too much here but basically you realize that truth
is the only thing there is truth and consciousness are
one truth is absolutely everything all perception and experience that
you used to think was perception and experience all of
that gets recontextualized as absolute truth and for the first
time in your life you understand what truth really means
not truth as a conceptual idea or a belief but
truth with a capital T like that which is actually
true what is that well you have to awaken to
what is truth I can't tell you and words will
never do it justice the next facet is what is
the absolute to realize that see the only way it's
possible to know what the absolute is is to awaken
to the absolute ordinary people 99.999% of humans have no
reference for the word absolute they could use that word
but they don't actually know what an absolute is they
only know relative things everything you know as an ordinary
human being is relative stuff all truths that you know
are relative truths but here you can awaken to something
that's absolute what that means is that it's true in
the ultimate sense it's true under all conditions that means
it's true even if the entire universe is destroyed it's
still true what might that be well you have to
awaken to what is the absolute you can't know what
otherwise another facet here is absolute infinity this is when
you realize that consciousness is infinite and this is where
you realize for the first time what infinity is infinity
is not a number infinity is also not a a
large-sized so when I say infinity you might think well
that means that like maybe the universe goes infinitely far
in all directions like up and down and left and
right back and forward that's not what infinity means what
I'm talking about infinity I mean actual infinity what is
infinity you don't know but there's a distinct insight you
can have into like Oh absolute infinity everything is absolute
infinity you realize that everything that's happening it has ever
happened is the manifestation of absolute infinity what's happening right
now is absolute infinity but you're not conscious of that
that's a very powerful insight life-transforming right there you realize
that you can zoom in and out of consciousness forever
it's completely endless there's no end to it another facet
that's closely related to this one is the realization of
absolute nothingness this is just the other side of the
coin where you realize that what is all of this
that's here right now it's absolutely nothing what is consciousness
it's absolutely nothing what is I am this what am
i what is my true nature what is everything made
out of absolutely nothing that's what all this is absolutely
nothing never nothing has ever happened you think things have
happened but nothing has ever happened everything that has happened
has just been nothing which is identical to infinity nothingness
and infinity are identical and that's another thing you'll realize
here maybe first you'll realize absolute infinity but not yet
nothingness then at another occasion you can realize the facet
of nothingness but not infinity and then on another occasion
you can you can merge the two together and realize
that oh nothingness and infinity are literally identical and then
you have a more complete understanding the more complete awakening
so this is closely related to the facet of answering
the question of why is there something rather than nothing
you can answer that question for yourself and you will
answer it when you realize that everything is infinite infinity
and everything is absolute nothingness and that the two are
identical and when you realize that you'll realize that oh
why is there something because something literally is nothing and
the two can't be distinguished from each other because all
distinctions are relative and in the absolute sense there are
no distinctions which means that everything is totally one that's
a powerful realization that basically explains to you the origin
of all of reality I'm talking about these things as
those if there are little insights that you have now
these are a gargantuan insights when you're hit by one
of these insights it floors you it knocks you to
the ground like it it baffles you it leaves you
speechless it leaves you reeling it leaves you crying it
leaves you shocked and paralyzed and terrified of course your
reactions to these insights will vary depending on how you
feel what you're doing how developed you are and so
forth the next insight or facet is the answer the
question of what is God it's the direct encounter of
God you realize that God actually exists and that God
is real and you realize for the first time what
the word God is pointing to everybody knows the word
God even atheists and scientific people but 99.999% of people
who use that word have no idea what it really
refers to they think it refers to some idea some
belief some imaginary being in the sky whatever but you've
never actually become conscious of what God is until this
moment when you become conscious you can also become conscious
of what I call the Godhead or what people call
the Godhead it's not just my word or you become
conscious of the very very crux the very essence of
God and then there is yet another facet here related
to God which is where you become conscious that you
are God and you might think that these two are
the same like well Leo if I know that God
exists and if I know what God is and I
know the Godhead that means that I know that I'm
God automatically no not necessarily you can have an encounter
with God but still not realize that God is you
that's a very important realization that many people miss when
they're doing this work you are God literally that means
that you are the creator of all of reality and
the entire universe that means that you have all the
properties that are traditionally given to God by the way
I have a two-part series called what is God Part
one and Part two that explains a lot more of
this in depth if you're confused so I won't go
into that here but but yeah you basically take back
your full authority and your full power as God you
stop denying that your God the way that most people
do and you realize that you are God sitting here
right now and that you have put yourself into this
very position that you're in right now by willing into
being because you have the power of infinite mind to
imagine anything and we'll get to that as another facet
in a moment so that's a very important realization to
me you're not fully awake unless a you realize and
have a direct experience of God and be you realize
and acknowledge that you are God if you are denying
that you're God you're not fully awake if you're denying
that God exists you're also not fully awake that's a
very very distinct insight and realization and it can take
you multiple awakenings to reach that far you may not
realize on your first awakening that you are God or
what God is for that you have to go really
deep the next facet is that self equals other and
that other equals self which is the collapse of the
boundary between yourself and other sentient beings or creatures or
humans in this realization you realize that all others that
you have thought as being real beings people creatures and
so forth you realize that all of them are just
partitions of your own consciousness that all others are imaginary
including your parents and that actually and this is another
sub facet here is that you realize that you as
God are all alone that's one of the consequences of
oneness one of the consequences of non-duality when all dualities
collapse that very critical duality of you versus other beings
also must collapse and at that point you are totally
one totally alone and this can be an especially shocking
and jarring epiphany because up to this point you might
have had some mystical experiences and awakenings and maybe you
even realize your God and all this and it feels
wonderful and nice and all that but then to really
come face to face with the the realization that there
are no other beings but yourself this I don't know
how it is for others but if you're like me
this was one of the insights that perhaps was most
difficult for me to swallow it's very shocking it almost
feels like you're losing your mind and that you're going
insane because you want to be able to be comforted
by others you want to be able to like reach
out to somebody and ask them like hey is what
I just experienced real or am I fooling myself but
the problem is that when you realize that there is
no other and that other is just a projection of
your own mind you realize you can't reach out to
other because by reaching out to other you're just reaching
out to yourself at this point you also realize that
for example whenever you're talking to others you're always just
talking to yourself when you're hating others you're just hating
yourself when you're having sex with others you're just masturbating
you're having sex with yourself it's impossible to have sex
with somebody else you're always masturbating it's impossible to truly
hate somebody else you're always only hating yourself it's impossible
to harm somebody else you're always only harming yourself but
for that you have to realize that yourself includes all
others you see another facet is the answer the question
of what is love when you become conscious for the
first time of the love of God absolute love infinite
love this is also a very emotional insight for people
it's it's it's shocking it's utterly baffling because under the
materialist paradigm the way science has taught us it's taught
us that the universe is indifferent Nature doesn't care about
you it's cold heartless and brutal and it doesn't feel
emotions it's just some dumb brute physical object but here
in your love awakening you awaken to the fact that
consciousness is love love is not an emotion it's not
some sappy romantic feeling it's not some wishful thinking some
New Age philosophy love is the very substance of consciousness
that everything is made out of and that's a shocking
realization because you realize that all the evil and hatred
and violence and murder and rape and incest and God
knows whatever other horrific things you could imagine torture and
war and genocide and racism and theft and corruption and
all manner of evil that all of that is actually
a manifestation of love and that can be very shocking
awakening that you can deny and resist your mind and
ego can resist it because you spent most of your
life hating people judging people criticizing people fighting evil and
then you realize that all of that was actually love
that's a bitter pill to swallow for the ego a
sub facet of this realization is the realization that truth
and love are absolutely identical you could have that realization
I remember when I realized that I was I was
looking at my hand and I realized that my hand
is literally MANET of love and I realized that truth
and love are totally identical and it was such a
beautiful insight it was like you might say the cherry
on top of my my sundae of all these different
awakenings that I've had to finally realize and to put
the two together that truth and love are just two
sides of the same coin and that they're absolutely identical
that was an amazing amazing insight and I think that
a lot of a lot of people missed this one
even if they have other sorts of awakenings another facet
that you can realize is that everything is absolutely imaginary
or as I otherwise call it infinite mind when you
realize that the only thing that's real is the mind
mind with a capital M infinite mind that's what reality
is when you see a car a tree a human
a star a planet some clouds whatever you're doing all
of that is just infinite mind it's the it's the
work of a cosmic mind that is imagining all of
this the entire universe is happening within the mind of
God which is of course your own mind not some
other mind but your own mind and this very moment
that is here right now me talking this is just
me hallucinating all of physical reality everything is imaginary your
past your future other people your dog your memories of
childhood the difference between a human and a taco the
difference between a cat and a dog all of it
is imaginary it is that way you imagined it to
be but only as long as you're imagining it that
way another way of saying is that reality is a
dream or another way of saying is that realities of
whose nation everything is a hallucination you're constantly hallucinating if
you're not hallucinating you're dead life is hallucination and death
is the end of hallucination in a sense we'll get
to the death question here in a moment that's a
separate facet but for now let's focus on everything is
imaginary that's a very epic epiphany see you can have
various kinds of awakenings but still not fully grasp that
like literally absolutely everything that you think is real is
completely imaginary including the physical wall the floor you're sitting
on the earth the sky the air you think your
breathing your brain your mind science religion society culture your
parents DNA atoms molecules cells biology chemistry physics everything is
absolutely imaginary that's quite a mindfuck quite difficult to accept
that but a very crucial insight of course because this
allows you to understand how all of reality gets created
and what it really is the next facet is what
I call self design the realization of self design and
this is a really twisted strange loopy mind [ __
] realization where you realize that you are creating yourself
for example when I realize this I've realized this multiple
times but the first time I realized that I realized
that every hair right here on my arm that I
see every single hair it was as though I planted
each one on my arm when I was designing my
own body using infinite mind see that's how God did
it literally the kind of attention to detail that you
know those though some of those old retired people that
sit there and they build that that model sail ship
inside of a bottle sort of thing you know very
carefully they spend the year painstaking the little tweezers putting
together like every little rope on that sail ship and
every little plank of wood they put it in there
they glue it all together and they paint every little
you know screw a nail on this little model that
they're building with such attention to detail and love in
such precision and then you know finally they put up
on their shelf and it's this beautiful creation well that
same attention to detail you put into creating and designing
the entire universe and of course your own body so
what she realizes that the human body that's here was
it didn't it didn't somehow evolved randomly through random selection
and mutation all this is that you designed it with
infinite intelligence you designed yourself and that's really shocking to
realize and to accept because it seems so counterintuitive it
seems impossible it seems like well how could I have
designed myself but you did you just forgot that you
did the next facet is when you become conscious of
how you were born what your birth really is and
here of course you realize that you weren't born at
all you existed forever your birth as a human is
totally imaginary and so you realize that that story that
you've believed in your whole life that you were born
like you were a a creature that crawled out of
your mother's vagina that whole story you realize that that's
just an imaginary story it didn't actually happen that way
the way you were born is by imagining that you
born that's how you were actually born and that's a
that's very very jarring and shocking to accept that because
you have to admit that all the all the stories
of your birth were just stories they weren't actually real
you've been alive forever there was never a time where
you did not exist you existed for more than a
trillion years imagine a trillion trillion trillion trillion years of
a being just sitting there an empty space existing for
trillions upon trillions upon trillions upon trillions of years before
there were there was even a universe before the Big
Bang there was a being that was sitting there just
hanging out in empty space well all of that is
just less than 1% of how long you've actually existed
you existed forever it's pretty shocking which leads us in
the next facet which is the realization of eternity or
no time or the absolute now you realize for the
first time what now really means you realize that there
is no past and there is no future because they're
both imaginary they're both being imagined right now in the
now everything that's happening is right now and the now
is absolute and it's eternal you realize what the word
eternal means eternal means completely outside of time it says
though time never existed you realize that this moment right
now is eternity this moment right now me talking here
to you you sitting there listening to me this has
been here and is here for eternity it's completely eternal
this is not happening inside of time time is an
illusion time is a projection of the human mind and
the human mind is just a projection of God's infinite
mind so even your body it seems like your body
grows old and it dies no your body is actually
totally eternal it exists forever outside of time which leads
us to the next facet which is the realization and
the answer to the question of what is death or
in other words the realization of immortality because time is
just a projection of your own mind it's just imaginary
because there is no past and no future other than
in one's imagination because everything is eternal the now is
eternal now is what you are now is i am-ness
you realize that what death is is death is purely
imaginary there is no such thing as death death is
impossible you are totally immortal and eternal as God as
nothingness as infinity you exist as all things at all
times it doesn't matter what form you exist in because
you are all forms you incarnate as all beings you
are looking through the eyes of all beings so yes
you can kill this lio body sitting here but it
won't matter I'll just respawn is something else you realize
that God cannot die because God has nowhere to go
if you were to kill God or destroy God where
would God go God has already nowhere and nothing God
is already at the place where God would be if
you killed him so to speak and then you realize
what is death death is just a story that I've
been telling myself death is a story the ego creates
it's always something you imagine there is no death in
the now and then now is the only thing there
is death is as humans conceived of it is always
some future idea literally purely imaginary and you realize this
on a visceral level to the point where you are
fully immortal and at this point usually comes the next
facet of realization here which is the realization of paradise
or heaven or perfection you realize that reality is absolute
perfection with the realization of immortality you have no more
fear because nothing bad can happen to you you've literally
transcended death and so as an immortal eternal being that
you now realize that you are you're in paradise you're
in heaven you realize that heaven is right here right
now heaven is not some place you go to heaven
is just the realization of eternity of absolute love heaven
and hell you realize are not physical locations the only
difference between heaven and hell is how much you're attached
to your ego the more you're attached to ego the
more you're in hell and when your ego is completely
surrendered and you realize that you're no self that you're
immortal you're in heaven and that doesn't depend on changing
your physical location it only depends upon your state of
consciousness how conscious are you of your own immortality if
you become conscious that you're immortal right now you will
automatically be in heaven which brings us to the next
facet which usually comes and accompanies this realization I was
talking about which is the realization of bliss or ecstasy
people use this word ecstasy and bliss a lot but
again this word rings hollow for most people for 99.99%
because they they don't have a reference experience for what
ecstasy really is ecstasy is not just extreme pleasure ecstasy
is the realization of immortality and the realization that everything
is heaven when you realize that it's so good it's
infinitely good it's not just good it's good to the
infinite degree it's so much goodness that you can't contain
it your body can't hold it your entire body shakes
and shudders in a cosmic orgasm of bliss it's perfection
it's total peace it's absolute love that's truly ecstasy and
very few humans have a reference experience for for that
word ecstasy but you can reach that and then you'll
know what the word ecstasy actually means you'll know what
I'm talking about some of you actually know what I'm
talking about many of you don't that's something to work
on the next facet you can realize is what I
call infant intelligence you realize that consciousness is infinitely intelligent
you realize that the intelligence of human beings is just
a tiny little infinitesimal part of infinite universal intelligence this
intelligence is baked into the physical substratum of reality it's
not just a matter of thinking intelligently or having a
high IQ these are all woefully inadequate definitions of intelligence
here for the first time you realize what intelligence really
is everything is intelligence consciousness intelligence that share that tree
that wall that house that human your own body everything
that's happening is pure infinite intelligence intelligence you realize is
not something your brain does it's not being able to
pass some sort of fancy IQ test intelligence as being
there's infinite intelligence in the cells that are making up
my hand in my body and you realize that and
for the first time you see how intelligent the design
of the universe is you've never realized this before sure
you've marveled at beautiful photographs of animals and galaxies and
nebulas and sunsets and and this and sometimes maybe you
look at your body and you say wow look my
body is quite amazing it's ingenious look at how everything
works together like my bones and my skin and my
arteries my veins the heart pumping blood through my blood
vessels and how it all works and how my hands
they have these different textures and fingerprints that can be
used to grasp a glass of water and all this
and I can drink and I can eat and I
can do all these amazing things and I can think
and I can create art and all of this and
I can design stuff in humans design stuff different phone
gadgets computers and cars and electronics and all this but
even if you understand all that you still don't understand
how deeply intelligent all of this is it's not just
intelligent it's infinitely intelligent you realize that all of this
is the mind of God and that it is responsible
for creating this well-oiled machine that is reality and for
the first time you realize like oh my god it's
so [ __ ] intelligent it's so perfect it's so
ingenious how all these different systems work together you know
males and females and relationships and communication and business and
art and entertainment and sexuality and animals and the ecosystem
and the environment and the solar system you know planets
rotating around stars and there's asteroids and comets and all
this it's it's functioning like a well-oiled machine and all
the laws of nature everything that science studies the DNA
in your cells and all of this is it all
functions perfectly without a single hitch you might say oh
but leo there's like genetic mutations isn't that a mistake
how could you say reality is perfect when there's genetic
mutations you don't understand the genetic mutations that's part of
the intelligence it's so intelligent that your limited finite human
mind can't grasp the intelligence of it you think you
can design reality better than it is you can't you're
just being a fool and you'll only realize that when
you awaken to infinite intelligence another facet you can realize
is absolute goodness goodness with a capital G you realize
that there's nothing bad in the universe at all that
badness is purely a projection of your own selfishness once
the selfishness is gone only absolute goodness remains you realize
that everything is absolutely good including everything you used to
think was evil you might say well Leo isn't this
the same insight as infinite love and here it's a
little tricky it could be you certainly could realize absolute
goodness and infinite love in one fell swoop but also
I've had it where I've realized infinite love but I
still didn't quite realize absolute goodness so there can also
be a distinction a subtle distinction there which is why
we call them facets fascists have ultimately the same thing
another thing you can realize as a facet is the
answer the question of what is will infinite will will
with a capital W you can realize in this insight
what you realize is that absolutely everything that's created that's
happening right now is happening through the will of God
through the will of this infinite mind which means that
when God wills something because it's an infinite mind it's
an infant intelligence what happens is that that thing instantly
materializes instantly so my physical body as it's sitting here
right now is the crystallization of the will of God
right now if God wasn't willing this body to do
what it's doing and to say what it's saying and
to move the hands as it's moving them it wouldn't
be happening this is the will of the entire universe
reality is willed into existence it's not something that happens
accidentally through some dumb brute force process some mechanical means
it's actually a mechanical it's directly willed and then what
you realize that your human will what we call human
free will is just a tiny sliver of God's infinite
will of the will of the universe and so the
will that you use as a human to do your
ordinary stuff like to go to the gym to lift
weights to get some work done to answer an email
to go to the grocery store this will that you
use to meditate and so forth that's a tiny sliver
of God's will so if we just expand that out
to infinity then you realize that you can use that
God can use that to create everything in fact that
is what you're doing you're just not conscious of it
yet you also can become conscious here of a sub
facet which is unlimited power power with a capital P
infinite will means infinite power with infinite will you can
create absolutely anything and here you become conscious that there
is no limit upon God God or infinite mind is
totally unlimited which means that it can create absolutely anything
it wants there's no limit to what it can create
so whatever physical limits you think there exist if you
think there exists logical limits to the universe to reality
none of that is ultimately true all of that is
relative truth ultimately God can do anything because if God
is one what is there outside of God that would
limit God nothing God even is the nothing so how
can God be limited it can't other than by its
own will so what God can do is God for
example can create a human and can limit the human
in fact a human is a limit so in this
sense a human isn't all-powerful human doesn't have unlimited power
because what a human is is God imagining itself in
a limited form but the Godhead itself is pure unlimited
power the next facet it is omniscience this is a
very distinct one where you can literally become totally omniscient
the mistake people make here is they think that omniscience
means that you know everything like if you ask me
what is the distance from the earth to Jupiter if
I'm omniscient I should be able to tell you instantly
right no that's not what our missions really means omniscience
is much deeper than that omniscient happens at the level
of being not at the level of conceptual knowledge so
you can be totally omniscient at the level of being
but still not know what your neighbor had for lunch
this morning or this afternoon omniscience is is an incredible
experience incredible shocking experience personally I experienced it much later
in my later awakenings not in the early steps but
it's possible another facet is the realization of divinity magic
and mystery once you realize that consciousness is divine you
don't know what the word divine is until you've deeply
awoken you don't know what magic is until you've deeply
awoken this human perception all these colors and sounds and
feelings that we're experiencing right now that make up reality
for us usually we just think of this as human
experience but it's not just human experience this is literally
divinity right now the light of consciousness that's shining forth
and bringing all this into our awareness as a human
this is divinity it glows with divinity when you awaken
it's like you walk down the street and everything just
glows at you that's sort of how it feels I
would have to describe it and at the same time
there's a deep and profound mystery to everything you look
at everything and it seems so mysterious and the reason
it seems so mysterious is because there's a sub facet
here where you realize not knowing you realize that actually
you don't know anything about being because being is prior
to knowing and here there's also another sub facet where
you realize that knowledge and being really they can collapse
under non-duality and oneness they can collapse together and you
realize that knowing is just literally another form of being
and so God doesn't know itself per se because it's
prior to knowledge God just is itself it's being speaking
of which there to be other facet here of realizing
what is being by being I'm just referring to everything
that is everything is being but what is being well
you have to awaken to that being we might say
is the substance of reality but what is that substance
what is the substance of reality that's something you can
awaken to we might say it's being or we might
say that it's consciousness consciousness is the substance of reality
but what is consciousness what is the substance of consciousness
well at this point you could you can't go any
further because consciousness is actually nothing so here you need
to realize that being literally is nothing or its distinction
its differences and what are differences they're nothing so you're
not gonna understand it just by me explaining it you
have to actually become deeply conscious of this to get
it but it's profound to get another fast that you
can realize is that the universe is an infinite fractal
you can zoom into it and zoom out of it
forever and it's self-similar this is why we call it
a fractal it's self-similar at at the macro and micro
levels you could also realize the facet of what is
perception I have an episode about that and what is
perception which explains it human perception is recontextualized as being
or truth another sub facet of this one is that
you can realize that perception has infinite resolution consciousness has
infinite resolution another facet you can realize is the answer
to the question of what is life what is life
what does it mean to be alive you can realize
that the entire universe is alive it's not just your
body that's alive but that chair or that table or
that wall or that house is not alive all of
it is alive as incredible as that might seem so
this question that science is struggling to answer which is
you know where did life come from it didn't come
from anywhere because everything is alive it's just a question
of what form does it take the mind of God
is alive and then it can take different forms you
can take the form of a concrete block of a
brick of a house of a plane of a train
of a human of a dog of a cat of
a tree of whatever and then whether it moves or
not breeds or not has blood or not that's these
are distinctions relative distinctions that you make as a human
the whole system is alive we might say another facet
you can realize is what is the purpose or point
of existence why does it all exist what is it
all for why all this complexity why all this form
why all this elaborate stuff white planets and stars are
circling around each other and why the earth why plants
and animals why humans why societies why war why politics
why all why everything why anything why you can understand
what the ultimate wha why is and the ultimate why
is love it's all a manifestation of your love as
God so there you go those are the facets that's
the list there's some bonus ones I want to give
you as well you can realize the facet that I
will call channeling or communication with God you can actually
communicate with God which is really nothing other than communicating
with yourself but you're communicating with your higher infinite self
you're communicating with infinite mind which usually humans are not
tapped into in their ordinary consciousness as you're going about
life so that's a that's a interesting breakthrough you can
have you can actually get direct insights from God you
can talk to God ask God questions God can hear
you and answer you in profound ways so that's that's
pretty cool they realize another bonus facet is healing you
can realize that it's possible to actually heal yourself because
of course you're connected to the will of God and
everything is just an infinite mind so if you want
you can heal yourself and you can heal others actually
this can be useful and very beneficial to you and
to others many mystics and sages in the past have
claimed stories of miraculous healing and you will realize why
that is you'll realize those were just stories and myths
but that it's actually possible and you can you can
actually go deeper into that and to realize how healing
actually works that's pretty amazing another bonus facet or feature
that you could realize is collective consciousness you can realize
that consciousness is not just individual but that there's layers
to consciousness it's like an onion there's many sort of
a nested chain of various consciousnesses and hierarchies and you
can realize and think of for example the human collective
consciousness or the collective consciousness of a different species and
you can tap into that it's pretty cool another facet
that you can realize is a total extinction of perception
the Buddhists talked about this advanced meditators talked about this
how literally you can sit there in meditation for so
long that the entire universe just disappears everything just goes
blank personally I've not had that experience myself but I'm
pretty sure that's possible given how many people report that
another facet is that there's various kinds of paranormal phenomena
that you can tap into as you do meditation practice
and various other kinds of insights come to you you
can develop various paranormal abilities there's like clairvoyance there's telepathy
there's mmm past law tapping into your own past lives
I guess channeling is also considered a paranormal activity sort
of hyper intuition about the future this sort of stuff
and finally you can tap into the facet of alien
entities other entities which are non-human and you can tap
into those and you can commune with them interact with
them and gain insights from them rather controversial many people
don't want to admit this kind of stuff they think
it's woohoo New Age stuff but it's possible don't believe
me discover for yourself actually do it go do it
actually contact a [ __ ] alien and commune with
it now of course understand that if you commune with
an alien you're just communing with yourself an alien is
just a a projection of your own mind it's just
one more entity within the mind of God so you
know just like a dog and a cat our projections
of your own mind they're imaginary your parents are imaginary
and so are aliens but they do have a relative
reality in the same way that we say like well
if I own a cat we can say I have
a cat my cat exists okay well what does that
really mean that's a relative distinction that we make and
we say that yeah leo has a cat okay well
likewise we can make a relative distinction that you met
an alien and you communed with it okay so we
can do that there's a higher truth though which is
that in the absolute sense that alien in my cat
there's just all figments of my own imagination but you
know we live mostly in the relative domain so it
can be useful to communicate with an alien maybe you'll
get some good insights about how to how to overcome
your erectile dysfunction or how to love people more or
how to earn more money or whatever whatever aliens want
to teach you alright so that's the list of course
this is not a complete list I'm mostly talking about
things that I've personally experienced now this bonus list that
I just gave you a lot of these I have
not experienced for example I have not tapped into past
lives I have not met aliens I have not had
a total extinction of my perception but it's it's it's
very clear to me at this point that this stuff
is possible given everything else that I've experienced most the
other stuff that I told you I have directly personally
verified not even once but multiple times but I'm always
open to more like I said it's not a complete
list there could be a lot more that I'm missing
still although I think I've got I've got most of
the important ones here so what you need to understand
about this list is that all of these are distinct
insights that you could have direct experiences things you can
become conscious of you can either have these individually or
in aggregate or in clumps like you can realize simultaneously
oneness and maybe God and maybe what consciousness is you
can get that all in one blast but also you
can get it in three separate blasts where first you
realize what God is then you realize what conscious is
then you realize oneness or in whatever order the orders
can all be different on top of that there's also
degrees of depths so it's not just that you can
realize that your god how deeply do you realize that
your god and how deeply do you understand what God
is there's lots of degrees of depth just to that
one facet and generally that's true for all the different
FASTA says there's degrees of depth to each individual facet
so you can see that we are starting to sort
of create like a table or a matrix here of
different facets let's say going horizontally and then different depths
of the facets going vertically and so at least we
have this two-dimensional matrix maybe even more so you can
see how quickly this gets very complicated and we can
see how you know if we make this table or
matrix we can take an individual teacher or guru or
person and we can sort of check off which of
these boxes they have become conscious of and you can
see how most people are probably not gonna have a
checkmark in every single box because it's a big table
there's a lot to realize here in a lot of
depth to each realization and so now we start to
see the true complexity of spiritual work and why there's
so much confusion and disagreement oftentimes between different teachers and
teachings and traditions because actually they're not all the same
I could shoot a whole video or on each one
of these facets in fact I have shot long in-depth
videos about what is love what is intelligence what is
perception what is truth what is the absolute and what
is consciousness and what is duality what is non duality
blah blah blah blah blah I've shot many of those
and I will do more in the future until I
basically exhaust the whole list of these different facets in
this work it's important to sort of stitch together these
individual facets because sometimes like you could have one facet
reveal to you today but then six months will pass
until you get on there facet reveal to you and
then another six months will pass you yet another one
so you know as the time flows oftentimes there's months
or even years in between different facets you can get
one but then you kind of forget the other one
you lose it so you have to come back and
sort of stitch them together it's almost like assembling a
giant jigsaw puzzle sometimes you know you fit together ten
different jigsaw pieces and you get a little piece of
the image you see like oh that's a foot and
then you assemble ten more over here and say oh
that's an ear and then you assemble ten more over
here it's like oh that's a tail but then even
if you see that you still don't know what is
the actual animal that you're gonna get at the very
end so it's important to stitch it all together so
that you can put them all together to say oh
yeah so that's a foot that's a tail that's an
ear that's a nose oh it's a cat oh that's
what we're dealing with it we're dealing with a giant
cosmic cat and that's sort of what you're doing each
of these insights can be its own epic mindfuck it
can leave you reeling for four weeks four months it
can leave you in denial it can leave you resisting
you can leave you depressed it can leave you with
an exponential crisis while you're coping with it your ego
is coping with it and struggling to integrate it it
can leave you doubting yourself sometimes you can think you've
lost your mind by realizing one of these insights for
example you might get the insight that I'm God but
then you know a few days past you start to
question yourself and you say well am I really got
or did I just lose my mind yeah - two
days ago no you're really God it's just that is
such a profound and shocking insight and it's so contradictory
to what society around you has told you and taught
you that you can sort of fall back into the
beliefs of your society what your parents and your friends
tell you you know you you tell your mom hey
I'm God and she'll tell you no you're not and
then who are you gonna believe well oftentimes you can
get tricked by people outside of you have it have
these experiences they can start telling you that you're crazy
that you're losing your mind well actually they're the crazy
ones now of course it's also possible that you are
losing your mind you know it's possible to misinterpret these
these insights and these facets and to some sort of
arrange some sort of you know twisted distorted picture which
isn't true to reality which is some sort of twisted
amalgamation of your own egos projections and shadow that's also
possible so it's it's it's dangerous you can definitely screw
it up there's no guarantees here you always have to
be careful about self-deception as I've warned you about in
my self deception three-part series but just be aware that
you might doubt yourself here which is why this list
is so valuable because maybe I'm the only person in
your life who's actually telling you that you're not losing
your mind and that can be helpful to you and
really the only people who can help you are those
who have gone this deep but not just this deep
but also this broad you see because what could happen
is that you can go to your spiritual guru you
could tell him hey I had the realization that I'm
God and your spiritual guru until you know you're not
God because let's say he was from the Buddhist tradition
and in the Buddhist tradition they don't talk about God
they prefer to call it nothingness or emptiness and so
when you tell him I realized that I'm God he
tells you no you're not God you're nothing and you
haven't realized nothingness yet you don't realize yet that God
and nothing just are actually one but he doesn't realize
it either your guru cuz he hasn't had the insight
that he's got but you as a student you don't
know these subtle distinctions so you can get tricked by
even gurus and teachers that are supposed to be helping
you it's important they keep in mind that very few
spiritual traditions and teachings teach you and explain in clear
terms all of these different facets that I've laid out
for you here many teachings are lopsided and tend to
emphasize one facet over other facets they tend to elevate
one facet over other facets you know some teachings will
emphasize the God other teachings will emphasize the love other
teachings will just emphasize nothingness or emptiness other teachings will
emphasize infinity other teachings will emphasize who knows what and
why is this because usually the people who create these
teachings are not super well rounded mystics usually they excel
in one or the other they have a preference for
one or the other facet many times they haven't even
realized half the facets so they only go with what
they got the best they can do they're doing the
best they can do but that's not always good enough
oftentimes they don't know what they're missing see it's rare
that a teacher realizes all of these facets and integrates
them all together in a clear manner and then teaches
them all very clearly and explicitly to you that's quite
rare some people do it but it's rare because oftentimes
people who awake they awaken through some dogmatic narrow path
like they're a particular sect of Buddhists or they are
particular adherent to some yogi path you know they follow
some one particular yogi and that's all they know and
they have not studied Buddhism they have not studied Christianity
they have not studied Islam that's all they know so
when they awakened through only one narrow dogmatic path that
leads them to think that they're fully awake and that
they've understood everything there is but really they haven't because
they haven't studied all the teachings and they haven't gathered
all the different facets and their tradition probably didn't teach
them all the different facets and they probably weren't good
enough at meditation and yoga and whatever else they were
doing to gather all the facets independently by themselves to
discover them very few people actually discover spirituality independently most
people just dogmatically walk some sort of path they do
some sort of narrow practice like meditation or prayer or
contemplation or self inquiry and that's it but they don't
realize that you know self inquiry it can awaken you
but it can also limit your awakening as well so
be careful assuming that your guru or teacher or teaching
or the book you're reading is fully awake that it's
not missing any facets because you know what even the
best teachers I found that they often will not admit
that they're missing a facet when you confront them about
some aspect of their teaching that you think might be
lopsided or lacking usually what you get from them is
denial and ridicule and dismissal they will dismiss your questioning
of their teachings and their lopsidedness they will dismiss it
as your own ignorance so yes very easy for a
guru or a teacher to do because they start to
take it for granted that they have all already fully
awoken there's nothing more for them to learn of course
this is just like another form of uh of a
sort of spiritual closed mindedness they're resting on their laurels
you can go to a teacher and ask them about
love and if that teacher has never experienced love he'll
tell you that love is [ __ ] that love
is just a human emotion and then it has nothing
to do with awakening or you can go to a
teacher and ask him about omniscience or about infinite intelligence
and they'll tell you all forget about that just go
and start stop the stuff thinking about that and just
go ask the question Who am I see that's because
maybe they haven't realized what infinite intelligence is and that
doesn't mean they're not awake they can be awake but
they can still not realize all the full nuances of
the various facets that I've outlined for you here and
this difference between the different depths and also between the
different facets becomes very apparent on psychedelics which is one
of the reasons that psychedelics are such a powerful tool
because different psychedelics allow you to hit awakening from different
angles and perspectives from different states of consciousness allows you
to have different insights then you normally would be able
to do this is very difficult to do if you're
practicing only one narrow meditation technique or self inquiry technique
or some yoga technique see it becomes like one dimensional
it's almost like you're playing a piano but you've only
been taught a few notes on one side of the
keyboard so you're you're punching these notes here but you
don't even know how to move across to the other
notes that you're missing see but psychedelics especially if you're
using a broad range of them different ones like LSD
mushrooms DMT five amiyo DPT whatever you know MDMA they
can all hit different facets and notes and then you
can you can see the spectrum you can see the
mountain range that is awakening a lot better that's one
of their benefits and some psychedelics are better at hitting
certain notes than others for example MDMA it's that love
note really well five immuno DMT hits the god note
really well and you know it varies it marries that's
a that's a complex topic for another day so as
you contemplate as you meditate as you self inquire as
you do psychedelics as you do yoga whatever your practice
is it can be hard to predict which facet you're
going to stumble upon next it's somewhat random it depends
a lot also on what your intentions are what do
you want to know what are you genuinely curious about
the most you might wonder like well leo let's say
I think that I'm missing the facet of absolute love
or I'm missing the facet of infinite intelligence how do
i target that particular one and here it's a little
bit hit or miss a bit of a trial and
error situation I don't think there's a foolproof way but
if there was one way I think the most important
way would be through your intention what is it that
you genuinely want to know what does your heart want
to know about reality see why are you doing this
work at all why are you questioning why are you
pursuing this facet of love or why are you even
interested in this facet of infinite intelligence you have to
really want to know and for that it's it's helpful
to have a question that you're latched onto as though
your life depends on it like for example a question
like what am i or a question like what is
reality or a question like what is God or what
is love or why does anything exists or what is
consciousness or why am I even here what is the
point of my life what is the purpose of my
life these sorts of questions channel your mind via intention
and will into some particular direction you see and it's
not enough just to be pursuing one of these insights
simply to check off a box you have to really
want to know it like there was a time in
my life where I really needed to to know what
reality is and then I got that desire answered because
I cared about it so much and then once that
was answered then I was like okay I'm satisfied with
that answer now I have it but I have a
different answer now I want to know like what is
God and then that desire is satisfied and then so
I get that one and I say okay well now
I understand God but I still don't fully understand like
why is all of this here and then I'm questioning
that one and then I get an insight into that
one and then finally I'm like okay now I understand
why it's all here and then I'm like well but
I still don't quite understand what's the connection between love
and truth I'm still murky on that and so I
question that the next time and then I get an
answer to that and I'm like okay now I understand
now I realized that love and truth are actually two
sides of one coin okay that's clear but then there's
something else I'm confused about and so this is how
it's worked for me and it probably I assume will
work for you in a similar way questioning is very
powerful in fact I have I have no less than
four episodes for you to watch about questioning one called
the power of asking questions another one called contemplation which
teaches you how to contemplate another one called how to
contemplate using a journal which teaches you contemplation using a
journal and then I have another one an older one
called the 64 most fascinating questions that a human being
can ask which teaches you about various kinds of existential
questions that might be interesting and meaningful for you that
can spark your curiosity and get you motivated to do
this work and to get these questions answered don't take
questioning for granted really high-quality questioning is like the backbone
of all self-actualization work and your questions don't have to
always be existential there can also be more minor questions
like questions like should I get married should I have
children or so stuff like that you can ask questions
like that as well and those can be answered so
you might wonder Leo how do I realize all these
facets what's the best way to get them all gotta
catch them all personally I found psychedelics to be the
best way if you're actually interested in hitting all of
these facets psychedelics are a great tool because you can
use different ones to target different facets you don't get
stuck in some one-dimensional technique they allow you to contemplate
and to set intentions at the beginning of each trip
you can record your various insights and piece them together
you can do multiple trips and connect all the dots
and then it becomes like this journey of an ever-expanding
panoramic big-picture view of what consciousness and what reality is
what guy is now of course people here object and
they say Oh leo but what about without psychedelics I
don't want to do psychedelics is it possible to get
all this stuff without psychedelics of course is possible but
also it's very easy to miss some it would be
wise to use all tools at your disposal but if
you insist on only doing yoga or only doing self
inquiry or only doing meditation okay that's an artificial limit
that you've set upon yourself fine then work within those
limits that you've set upon yourself try to do it
that way see how far you can get you can
probably get pretty far if you really want to and
if you're serious about it and you're really curious and
you want to check off all the facets you probably
could through yoga or meditation or whatever but also at
some point you got to wonder why are you limiting
yourself if there are other ways really if you're serious
about this work you should not be attached to the
method you should be attached to understanding as a whole
what you want to care about is just understanding about
consciousnesses and then how you get there shouldn't matter to
you whether you do through yoga or meditation or psychedelics
who cares as long as it gets you there of
course there are pros and cons to every approach I'm
not saying psychedelics are necessarily the best approach I'm saying
that they're particularly good at hitting a diversity of facets
and showing you the broad range the mountain range of
awakening yoga might be good for taking you down one
very narrow specific facet for example or a cluster of
facets now you might say but leo this contradicts what
you're saying here with Buddhism or with Hinduism or with
what my guru says because they don't talk about all
these different facets in the same way that you do
that's right so part of this contradiction can just be
an apparent surface level contradiction in the sense that for
example Buddhists might not talk about God but that doesn't
mean they haven't had that insight although some of them
might not have so it's a little bit tricky here
I might be collector addicting what your guru says or
maybe I'm just using different words and I'm just phrasing
things differently and I'm just articulating these facets in a
different way you see not only are there all these
different facets and depths but we can also talk about
them differently we can use different metaphors different words different
language that very much depends on your tradition and your
on on your inclinations and so forth but also I
would just caution you don't take for granted that you're
a guru or teacher knows everything that I'm talking about
that they have checked off every box that's not guaranteed
and that doesn't necessarily diminish the greatness of your guru
for example your guru might be really really good in
one or two facets or a cluster of facets but
still be missing some other one see there can be
trade-offs between depth and level of mastery versus breadth see
so just keep that in mind after all how do
you know which specific facets your guru has realized have
you sat down with your guru and asked them to
check off this entire matrix of facets of course not
most gurus wouldn't allow you to do that anyways even
if you asked they would hand wave you away and
just tell you to do their technique they're not gonna
sit there and argue with you about all these different
facets and for you as a newbie how are you
gonna know to discuss these facets with your guru you
won't know you won't even know which questions to ask
them you won't know whether they're giving you valid legitimate
answers or not you won't know when they're dismissing your
question because it's a bad question or because they're actually
ignorant of the answer gurus could be sneaky this way
a lot of times they'll ignore a good question and
blame you for being ignorant or being too nosy or
something like that when actually they're there they're hiding their
own ignorance it's very difficult to know the degree of
understanding that some guru has and most followers and never
even occurs them to ask or to question what does
their guru really understand few gurus tell you everything they
understand so this means you have to take responsibility you
have to be careful don't just make blanket assumptions about
people don't assume that all awakenings are the same don't
assume that all gurus are equally enlightened don't assume that
all pads lead to the same destination in this work
if awakening was simple and binary there wouldn't be so
much disagreement between different schools and teachers and gurus how
do we explain this disagreement clearly just these disagreements exist
and they have existed throughout all of human history across
all continents so this can't just be something I'm making
up clearly there is a vast variety of spiritual teachings
and techniques what are the chances at every single technique
would hit and be equally effective at reaching every insight
and every facet that there is very little chance they're
all perfectly equal chances are that certain techniques hit certain
facets better than others see certain teachings are deeper than
others certain teachers or teachings are broader than others there
really isn't one state or one insight that all awakened
people reach that's a mistaken assumption which is why it's
wise to play various gurus off one another you can
do that you can actually spot contradictions between gurus this
way you know take one great guru from the east
take one great guru from the West then you know
read their books and then take the sayings of this
one and direct it at this guy and take the
sayings of this guy and direct it at this guy
and you'll see that there's going to be a conflict
between the two and how do we explain this well
I explained it that they have different depths and different
facets that's how I explained it beware that partial realizations
can be dangerous for example you could have partial awakening
where you fail to realize love absolute love and then
your teachings will lack love and that will be a
problem Aurra a shame really to have a teaching of
awakening without the love component or you can teach awakening
but still deny God for example sam harris has some
bit of awakening but not that deep not that broad
he talks about no self he's done various kinds of
buddhist meditation for years supposedly he's pretty good meditator and
so forth but he doesn't know what god is he's
not conscious of that he's in denial about god and
so in this sense he's misleading his his students that's
a great shame especially because he's God what is the
point of being awake when you don't realize you're God
that's not full awakening or for example you can have
various other kinds of teachers who awaken in some way
but their teaching is kind of nihilistic that's also limited
and problematic in my opinion you can have a partial
realization but then you can your ego can still hang
on it can create fear and rejection of this realization
that you've had and that can spin off in a
sort of distorted direction or you could have some deep
realization insight but then you can dismiss other valid teachings
from different traditions and different paths for example some student
comes to you practicing the path of love but you
dismiss them and you tell them to stop because you
tell them that love is [ __ ] and that
it's not not right because your path was a path
of like hardcore [ __ ] meditation or strong determination
sitting and then you want the student to follow your
path without realizing that your path isn't necessary than work
for for her or for him see and you might
dismiss some yogic technique because it doesn't fit in with
your ideas of how to do self inquiry well some
inquires just one way to do it yoga's another way
to do it there's a lot of different ways to
do yoga and many more spiritual techniques besides those to
see so partial realizations lead to these various kinds of
conflicts because yeah it's partial from a partial perspective you
misunderstand other perspectives that's the whole problem with partial perspectives
another objection that arises is but Leo if awakening has
all these facets you talk about doesn't that contradict the
most important point which is the oneness of truth the
oneness of reality it's a good question and the answer
is no it doesn't contradict because actually the distinction between
oneness and many nough sits elf something that must collapse
into a higher greater absolute oneness you see so many
nests is not the opposite of oneness really have to
realize they're the same thing which is why I call
them facets the metaphor in my mind is out of
a jewel or a diamond a diamond is one thing
that has many facets that's exactly how it works or
the classic you know Hindu metaphor of the elephant the
five blind men and the elephant that's what we're talking
about here the elephant is enlightenment or truth and each
blind man is groping a different part so what's true
is the elephant one thing or is the elephant a
collection of things like a tail a foot an ear
a tusk a trunk and whatever else it has on
it it's both see my hand is one but it
also is five fingers you might say that the fingers
are different facets of my hand I can know each
finger individually or I can know them all together collectively
each way of knowing is important it's important to know
them all collectively because it would be a problem if
I deny like that I have a thumb let's say
see I would be dysfunctional if I had to deny
to myself that I have a thumb but also it
would be a problem if all I knew is my
thumb and I knew it really close and I knew
all the intimate details and wrinkles of my thumb and
all the scars that are on it but then I
didn't use it holistically in sync with all the other
fingers of my hand so that I could use it
as an actual hand I would be too preoccupied with
the thumb and then I'd be pushing stuff with my
thumb all the time and the only way I'd be
interacting with the world is with my thumb and I
would ignore the other possibilities of my hand you see
that's what's going on here so what I'm about what
actualize or it is about is learning how to use
the whole hand holistically but also taking interest in individual
aspects as well right so we need to be able
to zoom in and zoom out be sometimes specific and
limited and sometimes holistic and very broad you might wonder
how many facets are there in total is there an
infinite number of them do they never end do we
just keep finding new facets all the time honestly I
don't know how many facets there are in a certain
sense it depends on how you split them up what
do you count as a facet that's relative so there's
not someone absolute number of facets like there's thirty five
facets and that's it or there's 52 facets no it
depends on how you count them practically speaking I would
say there's at least two dozen major facets that are
important and crucial to your path to realize and if
you don't get this two dozen facets your awakening is
not going to be very complete in my opinion and
then beyond that is sort of extra some of the
facets are more important than other ones some of them
are kind of tangential and not so important I mean
in the end if you want you can consider literally
every physical object in the universe to be a facet
of God a facet of truth with a capital T
every one of my fingers is a facet of the
absolute in a sense but you know we don't want
to get that granular we're more interested here in like
major facets like do you understand absolute love do you
understand what God is do you understand that you're God
do you understand what nothingness is do you understand what
infinity is do you understand what will with a capital
W is do you understand with truth with a capital
T is if you're missing some of those you're missing
something important I would say but don't get hung up
on counting them now a warning even if you get
all of just checkboxes here that I'm talking about and
you get all these 30-some facets that's still not the
end of your work not even close you're still missing
many other important domains of this work these facets don't
guarantee you for example emotional mastery they don't guarantee that
you're gonna transcend suffering they don't guarantee that you transcend
your shadow you still got shadow work to do they
don't guarantee personal development you got personal development to do
they don't guarantee you relationship mastery you got that to
do communication mastery you're missing that life purpose you're missing
that changing your behaviors and bad habits that's not guaranteed
just because you know all these 30-some facets doesn't mean
that you have quit all your bad habits and addictions
it doesn't mean that you've dropped all of your limiting
beliefs and fallacious beliefs about reality you might still have
some silly conspiracy theory in your mind you might still
believe that your culture your Hindu culture is superior to
other cultures you might still believe that psychedelics are evil
or whatever see that's still possible you can still hold
false beliefs even if you're awake how about spiral development
spa the dynamics wise knowing these fastest doesn't guarantee that
you are now maxed out on your cognitive moral interpersonal
or political developmental lines it doesn't guarantee career development it
doesn't guarantee technical skills there are technical skills you need
to develop in life to be successful see so you
got all that to work on and none of the
insights that I talked about guarantees a permanent embodiment of
that insight so just because you realize that you are
God does not mean that now you live every single
day as though you were God just because you realize
that there's no such thing as evil doesn't now mean
that you walk around every day never seeing evil anymore
loving absolutely everything it doesn't guarantee that usually that will
take a lot more work to be able to fully
embody these profound insights that's really where the bulk of
the work lies in this work not realizing the insight
but then fully embodying it that's the really hard part
so even though I've realized many of these insights again
don't don't take me to be greater than I actually
am for example I still struggle with the notion of
death I would still say that I haven't conquered fully
my fear of death even though I know the death
is imaginary now you might say well but how could
that be well because this it's a very big thing
to embody it's hard to truly be so conscious all
the time that you're immune to threats to your physical
survival that that's hard to embody that will take you
probably decades at work or some really profound awakening see
it's hard to be loving all the time when people
are being [ __ ] to you what can you
say it's hard this is this is our work here
see even though I know that everything is love that
doesn't mean that I'm always in a lovey chipper mood
and if someone does something nasty or evil to me
or devilish you know people can still behave like jerks
that doesn't mean that I won't get triggered sometimes I
won't get angry I won't feel bad about it or
whatever now of course in the bigger picture I can
kind of come back and recenter myself and say okay
yeah that guy's an [ __ ] I should probably
love him and I can see the love kind of
the twisted form of love that he's expressing towards me
and how I'm judging him to be evil yeah okay
I can I can kind of see this but you
know in the heat of the moment it's not always
that that easy and even with everything I said here
there are still millions of minor insights that you can
have for example you can realize everything above that I
told you but still you can lack insight into things
like how does science work what is science that takes
a specific insight what is evolution what is art what
is a relationship what is technology what is leadership what
is pain what it's motivation what are thoughts what is
fear what is anger what is happiness how do psychedelics
work what is collective ego what is devilry how does
society work what is society what is culture what is
ideology and this list is basically endless you can question
reality at this kind of granular level basically till you're
dead till your body drops dead at least and there's
a lot of value in answering these sorts of minor
questions I mean these aren't really minor they're they're pretty
major but they're minor relative to the bigger stuff I
talked about above so just kind of start to see
that there's there's a lot to this work probably start
with the big stuff then you can move down the
food chain to the smaller stuff depend on how curious
you are you know many people probably burn out their
curiosity will burn out after they get the major stuff
and they probably won't even care about the minor stuff
but personally I love I love questioning this minor stuff
as well like for example I'm interested in questions about
society and culture and politics and understanding leadership and technology
and evolution and science and these traditionally many spiritual teachers
would say oh all this is just nonsense but it's
not nonsense in fact it's these more minor insights that
are in a certain sense more practical and more useful
to helping us to advance and to evolve society and
making it better but of course those big ones are
also very very important and life transforming so start with
us focus on those as you pursue awakening be careful
not to stop prematurely just keep in mind that it's
probably deeper and richer than you ever imagined and ultimately
what we really care about here is how deeply do
you understand reality at the ultimate level how deeply do
you understand it how conscious are you of it and
that determines how well you're also able to embody it
so when you're not able to embody it fully that
probably means that you're not conscious of it fully and
that you don't understand it fully my notion of understanding
is a very deep and profound notion so there you
go now you have your list now you have your
work cut out for you go and see how much
of this you can realize for yourself don't believe me
for all you know I'm wrong for all you know
I'm lying for all you know I'm deluded how would
you know you don't know the only way you'll know
if the things I'm telling you are true is by
doing it and having these insights for yourself see how
many of them you can validate and then you'll be
able to know how right or how wrong I was
there you go all right I'm done here please click
that like button for me and now I got to
tell you a bit of a about patreon go check
out patreon at action at patreon.com slash actualized or click
the link down below where you can do a little
donation action and come check out actualize that org there
you will find exclusive content stuff I post on my
blog new insights new videos vlogs that I'm releasing on
a weekly basis check out the forum check out a
life purpose course check out the book list and I'll
be doing more courses in the future so check back
periodically because you never know really when tall release some
new course or some new resource that could potentially change
your whole life as far as the patreon thing goes
I'm excited to see where it goes I'm grateful for
your support but also I want to warn you that
I want to leave open the possibility that in the
future you know I do this kind of work but
it's hard for me that the deeper I go in
this existential work it's harder for me to to know
what my future plans are like it's hard for me
to know where I'll be in five years or ten
years whether I'll even be doing this work whether I'll
be passionate about it whether I'll outgrow it or I'll
come up with some new better idea or whatever so
I want to leave the possibility open that I might
just like renounce life and become a monk and just
disconnect from business disconnect from society disconnect from teaching disconnect
from running a giant organization and this sort of stuff
so right now I am somewhat committed to building actualized
org and to growing it and to releasing a lot
more content writing some books and so forth making some
more courses so that's sort of my medium-term plan over
the next few years maybe doing some tours and workshops
and so forth I am excited about those possibilities but
also I feel deep down that there is sort of
a deeper calling for me all too and at some
point I might have to take some time away from
doing this work because it does take a lot of
my time and mental energy to do all this activity
and just like go deeper into myself retreat deeper into
myself maybe do some month-long retreats or even year-long retreats
where I don't talk to anybody where I don't produce
any kind of work where I just work on embodying
these various facets that I talked about here within myself
with the ultimate aim of then coming back and then
doing the work I've been doing but at a next
level at a much deeper level so just keep in
mind that that possibility is out there if I decide
to do that for a long time like if I'm
gonna take a year off or even more I might
cancel the patreon entirely for example I don't know you
know we'll see how it goes because part of the
thing with the patreon donations now is that I sort
of feel like well if you guys are donating to
me that I kind of feel even more obligated to
like release weekly content and make it good because you
guys are supporting me and that's good it motivates me
but also I don't want to be totally beholden to
that in the end to me the most important thing
is taking my own awakening as deep as possible because
what I know is that the deeper I can awaken
the more loving I can become the better I can
embody it the more powerful I become as a as
a human and ultimately as a leader and as a
teacher and then the more I embody it the less
I have to speak about it the less I have
to be analytical with my teachings the more I can
just walk down the street and influence people just with
my presence and that's ultimately where this is probably going
I'm just not sure exactly how all of that will
play out so be flexible with me here let's just
see where it goes and how this evolves because we're
doing something new I'm sort of documenting my whole spiritual
journey on video here along you I mean I'm like
teaching you but at the same time I'm learning myself
every single week so I'm not coming at you from
some high position on a mountaintop really I'm sort of
coming at it from from a lower place where you
get to see me grow along with you in this
journey and you know there's there's pros and cons to
doing it that way so let's just see how it
goes hopefully it's more relatable to you and you kind
of see me struggling and suffering through this journey and
then you can relate with that and then that inspires
you and motivates you and makes this whole process look
a little bit more human and down-to-earth for you and
makes you feel like you can do it too like
hey if he's struggling through it and he can do
it then maybe so can I so stick to the
stick around stay tuned and you'll see more of that
to come you
