hey guys this is Leo for actualised org and in
this video we're doing something special I want to introduce
you to a cool guy he's a dating advice coach
in Los Angeles California and his name is Tripp say
hi Tripp hi Tripp what sounds video thanks for having
man yeah my pleasure we did an interview where I
was on trips Channel Tripp has a great dating advice
for men channel on YouTube and it's called trip advice
and that's trip with two peas right that's right all
right and he's also got a website trippadvice.com so if
you're looking for dating advice then check out his website
check out his youtube channel it's got a lot of
videos there unlike my videos which are 40 or 50
minutes long his videos are really short they're like five
minutes each and they go right to the point and
gives you straightforward advice for men on how to date
in this video what we're going to talk about is
a little bit of the psychology of being an attractive
man and Tripp is the guy to be asking these
kinds of questions and one of the things that I
have and wanting to do with actualised at work is
not only to be having my head talking but also
to have other talking heads on the channel so you
can get more well-rounded advice from other people because I
have my own biases and quirks especially when it comes
to dating advice and Tripp has his own ideas so
we're going to kind of bounce back and forth and
ask him some questions to help you guys get better
at dating with girls and if you're a woman and
you're watching this one of the benefits you might get
is a perspective into the male mind because I think
that most women aren't really good understanding some of the
challenges that men go through when they're struggling with dating
and it's a really big problem I've had my own
problems with it I'm sure Tripp has had his own
learning experience and so we're going to talk about that
awesome all right Tripp so let's just crack into it
what's the point of learning to be better with girls
it's an interesting question you know it all comes down
to what you want out of your life right and
I'm going to assume that most heterosexual men want to
be with a quality woman right so I think the
real question is not what's the point of learning this
stuff but um why do you why does someone want
to find that quality woman and I think that a
lot of guys they don't even think it's possible this
was like something that I had to deal with years
ago I never thought it was possible to even try
to get better and meeting women right so I think
the first thing is that you have to know that
it is possible and it's crazy because again I mean
this is like maybe 10 15 years ago there was
no lot of information that you could find or at
least at least no defined about how to get better
with women right that was one of the things that
was a really difficult to understand that you could get
better unless you maybe her friend about as you know
guys don't really talk to each other about like hey
dude I found this like cool thing I'm like how
to get better with girls and they teach you all
this stuff about talking and confidence and things like that
but I think it's really really key that you know
guys do learn this stuff so that they can have
the best quality woman that they can because a lot
of guys end up settling now I personally think that
the divorce rate you know it's like 50 maybe and
60 percent right now in the United States and I
think that that exists because guys don't take the time
to learn this stuff which has them settling for a
woman that they don't truly want because they don't believe
that they can get better quality women and then of
course that just ends in a divorce right or or
maybe not it ends in a really terrible life and
you're stuck with this woman you don't really want it's
not a good match for you it's not the kind
of person that's good for you and the person that
you really want and then it just again you need
this really miserable life so why guys should be learning
this is so that they can finally attract the woman
that they have been desiring right and I say this
to the guys not in the form of you know
do everything in your power to get that one girl
who you've been pining after that's a little bit different
they'll really watch a lot of videos on my channel
Leo's channel to learn how to become a better man
and become a better communicator and understand attraction and by
doing that you will start to see results and finding
the types of women that you really want all right
so I mean I mean that's what I think about
that yeah and for me my own journey what I've
discovered is that it's just as a man learned to
get better with women there's something deeper about it than
just getting a girl it's also a ballad like you
said becoming a man becoming stronger becoming more confident and
that's not just for the girls sake that's also just
for your sake it's satisfying to do that and I
think it translates and spills over into other areas of
your life yeah absolutely that's a cool thing when I
started to learn this stuff I was only in it
for the women which most guys are right that's why
they're learning it so they can get you know whatever
they want in terms of a relationship or a girl
one-night stand whatever it is but then you end up
becoming this stronger person because that's what women are truly
attracted to and you become this guy who's all of
a sudden really good at public speaking and really good
with communicating with employees or your boss or your family
you understand how to how to connect better with people
because a lot of the stuff that you learn in
terms of meeting a woman totally crosses over to all
these other areas of your life so it's a really
powerful training whole in itself awesome uh tell me a
little bit more about this gimmicky stuff because you said
gimmicks and sometimes there's this reputation about dating advice from
men is that it's gimmicky and it's all about being
fake and tricking the girl into sleeping with you and
so the girls don't like it because it seems like
manipulation but also guys then don't want it listen to
it because they feel like well like that's not very
mature way to go about dating so what's your take
on that yeah I should really like that and you
said that mature way about going at dating I never
really thought about that that's kind of what I'm always
trying to preach it's really a mature way of going
about it because the opposite immature is like yeah these
these manipulation techniques and tactics and trickery which by the
way I mean I always say you know I talk
about tricks and techniques on my videos but it's different
it's not about tricking the woman it's about a little
trick that can help you become a better person to
attract the woman but yeah I mean in terms of
that I compared to two things right all the gimmicky
stuff or the pickup material that's like eating uh you
know when you're really hungry and this is delicious unhealthy
cupcake in front of you okay it's eating that versus
maybe next to it is a really healthy protein shake
with good nutrients and vitamins in a banana but yeah
it tastes good but many signs as good as the
cupcake let's be honest and the analogy here is the
cupcake will satisfy your desires and make you feel really
amazing and it will do what it needs to be
done but in the long run what happens when you
eat a bunch of cupcakes you end up feeling sick
you end up low on energy your your blood sugar
raises all these bad things in the long run and
when you drink the protein shake which sort of satisfies
the same exact craving but it's a little bit different
a little healthier for you and build your body in
your immune system for the long run that's like learning
more natural techniques so and the reason why that is
because when you start to to learn the pick up
stuff that quick kind of gimmicky manipulation easy to lie
to girls easy to kind of make up stories or
it's so easy just remember as a fake story tell
a girl has nothing to do about you but it
will attract the girl yes you'll get that sadist the
satisfaction in the beginning because you get to sleep with
the girl over you be you get to get the
number it feels really good right but in the long
run here's what ends up happening you end up coming
to this point where you've lost yourself there's a disconnect
between what is you and the stuff that you're spitting
and inevitably there becomes this crash and burn because you
start to realize and I'll spoil it for you for
the guys who just want to go to that route
first I'll spoil of you right now what happens is
you start to become more lonely more scared less confident
because you're realizing that all these girls that have become
attractive you are not really attracted to you they're attracted
to this other made up version of yourself and so
while it's great in the beginning because you're getting these
quick results in the long run it starts to become
old and I'll tell you right now it feels so
much better to just build yourself into a confident person
in a better person in general so women can become
attracted to you yeah it's a little harder takes a
little longer not by much but that's going to be
the way that you're going to feel better in the
long run and you're never going to have a crash
and burn because you're going to feel good that you're
doing or I should say you're building yourself in order
to attract these women so that's kind of how I
see the difference between those two yeah I love the
long-term thinking approach that's definitely what I try to do
with every area of my life that I'm trying to
master is take the long-term perspective on it so that's
definitely smart I've also found that the guys who are
the best even though they started off perhaps on routines
or tricks and it wasn't authentic at first ultimately what
they ended up doing is they kind of consolidated all
that stuff they took the stuff that really worked that
that was natural to them they integrated that part like
really firmly to their personality and they became so authentic
with the way they act so it's not about being
fake it's just that sometimes the routines and tricks they
help you to get started like like training wheels and
then you throw those away and then you do you
know the the real kind of authentic type of stuff
and that's what attracts women women are attracted to situations
when you can be really authentic yeah I mean I
mean I'll be honest I was the same way I
learned a lot of that stuff too in the beginning
I just didn't get too far with it personally because
I already felt the disconnect just because I'm like very
intuitive and I'm just like whoa this isn't working so
I had to kind of find out other stuff so
what I tell guys is you know there's ways to
use some of those little tricks and techniques are those
routines and be able to actually create your own that
it has to do with you you know just basically
about being able to create your own stories again it
takes a little bit longer because it's different than just
reading a little routine right you have to sit down
and really think about it and understand what are the
attraction triggers that you want to hit a woman that
make her attracted to you and and what in your
life can you apply to that and create a story
out of it so I always tell guys let's take
that let's take some of the concepts and the ideas
behind maybe some of the some of the pickup material
and you read out there right the core concepts of
what it is that's attracting the woman and then blend
in your life and your stories into those concepts that's
kind of what I'm trying to push out you know
beautiful yeah I love it so then let's move on
to the million dollar question which is what actually matters
what actually makes an attractive man guys are always asking
me and this is something that was always on top
of my mind which really screwed with my mind is
still looks matter am i good-looking enough to do it
you said you can get any girl but can I
get a girl if I'm looking the way that I
am do muscles matter does my height matter does my
money situation matter what about my nationality what about size
what matters and all this stuff okay cool okay I
want to hit on like all those because those are
all like amazing points okay so first really quickly what
stuck out nationality I'll say right now nationality does not
matter yes it will be easier if you're white to
attract a white girl and if you'll age into attractive
asian rule and if you're black to attract a black
hole and so on and so on but cross nationality
you can attract I know plenty of women who are
attracted to different types of nationalities from their own so
that doesn't really matter ah money money I'll be honest
it helps obviously if you have a lot of money
it helps because it's telling the girl with the attraction
trigger that it's hitting is it's telling the girl that
you're successful and that you're passionate and that you've done
well for yourself in your hard work and those are
very dominant alpha male traits that women are attracted to
but here's the cool part it's not necessary you don't
need a million dollars in the bank account to attract
women it's not like that is the thing that if
you don't have it within you're screwed not at all
so it helps but there are plenty of ways that
you can attract a woman by letting her know your
passions and letting her know that you're happy with your
life and you do these great things in your life
that are motivational and and and always growing and all
these things that are great about you that show success
rather than being being it in terms of what the
dollar is in your bank account but at the end
of the day the cool thing is and I know
Leo you talk about this a lot is that if
you do work on yourself and do work on on
loving what you're doing finding your passion which you hit
all the time one of the great side effects is
making a lot of money so it kind of works
handing on there and then in terms of looks looks
do matter to an extent okay so when it comes
to looks it's not like well if you don't look
like Brad Pitt you can't get that ten okay yes
if you do look like Brad Pitt of course that
is going to help us just be honest but it's
not necessary but in terms of looks you do need
to have what I call style or really just a
fashion sense right so you need to do the things
that you need to do to become your most physically
attract itself physically attractive self so um that is in
terms of grooming that's in terms of wearing the things
that look the best on you that's different for everybody
usually it's fitted type clothing but you need to really
study fashion study style so you can look your absolute
best and at that point you kind of in a
good way you've maxed out of that capacity of being
a most attractive self is that just going to help
you in the end but even so I know plenty
of guys who don't do any of that stuff and
still get the girl because yeah it's only a part
of it but I see the guys like work on
the fashion and work on the style because it's kind
of an easy part that will just help you know
to me like why not make it easier ends whatever
get just get a new wardrobe or shave the scraggly
beard you know whatever it is oh no is he
yours hold on like this you got a stubble there
now your little bit well-groomed uh goatee which is fine
but if you had icy guys' it can't really grow
a beard and it's like kind of there and just
like ah you just shaved it you would look ten
times better and it would just be so much easier
if you don't like go and approach a woman and
the rejection rate would just lower you know so it's
like things like that yeah so all good points I
mean what I found in my own jury which totally
blew my mind is that yes the money like women
just aren't really that attracted to money I find uh
it's like an average girl she's not gonna like require
you to have tons of money and as far as
nationality I've had some of the like weirdest friends that
are like different nationalities from like Indian to Pakistani to
black to everything else and like if you amazing they
do way better than I do some of the best
guys I know are short like they're super short like
not even average short but like five four one of
those guys I know is so short he looks like
a little but like he's ridiculously good he's way better
than me like I'm floored to watch him just do
his work girls love him and as far as like
the looks like one of the things that really blew
my mind is when I started to get into pickup
and I started to go out there actually hit on
lots of girls like it always blew my mind that
it was very random like sometimes an ugly girl will
reject you sometimes a hot girl will reject you but
then sometimes a hot girl will love you better than
an ugly girl will like it's just for for any
random reason like they just love you for your personality
they just happen to be down that night or whatever
and I found that I've been able to attract virtually
like any hotness of a girl that I want as
long as I work hard on myself and as long
as I could go out there talk to lots of
girls that's possible yeah exactly I say like I had
to really come down to a concise I guess version
of what a guy needs to work on in order
to to to be your most attractive self to a
woman it's I'll be speaking in broad terms here but
a lot of stuff even is fine on my channel
but really it's about how you carry yourself and how
you talk to women you know it's just about the
words that are coming out of your mouth and in
your body language you know and then how you walk
over to her and how you look at her and
the way that you touch her right and then the
things that you say the stories that you tell the
excitement and the energy coming from from your voice and
how you're talking to them it's like those things if
you could just master those or just practice those as
much as you can that's gonna already just super supersede
is that a word supersede uh it is a work
okay good because it superseded that looks money nationality all
that other stuff yeah that's what I tended to find
myself okay so next question what is it that when
that men need to understand about how women think that
they don't currently understand so I find that there's stuff
there's like there's like a gulf between how men think
and how women think that's how I think about in
my mind like our psychologies are different and so I
find that when I started on my journey I didn't
really understand how women thought I thought that women thought
like men think and then I was shocked to learn
that that's not the case so in your experience tell
me a little more about what you see as the
gulf there like what women are thinking yeah what is
it that that men need to understand about women in
order to attract them better yeah well I think men
need to understand that I mean this is going to
some David data stuff which I know you're big fan
of as well you really have to understand about the
the polarities and this blew my mind when I read
about this from the way the superior man right the
polarities and and because that's what's going to create attraction
right so you if you understand uh basically the feminine
essence and the masculine essence and what both of those
mean like you understand that for a woman in that
firm and you can really start to understand what pulls
those two together right so you know I'd say in
answering it quick in terms of a female she's looking
for a man that he's in control of his life
and kind of like I mean in like twenty first
century terms like has his act together right and has
purpose which again Leo you talk about all the time
which is just amazing right about finding your purpose and
having purpose in this world and again it you can
get have no purpose and you can probably find a
girl and still attract a girl but you might not
attract that girl that you're super attracted to and like
a one that's really quality but but a woman almost
wants that and she wants she wants to feel also
and I'm trying to be light here with my words
because I can imagine a lot of women being like
no what are you talking about but a woman wants
to be dominated in a sense but there's a fine
line between that it's not like she wants to be
told what to do and she wants to be a
slave unless you're into some kinky stuff but but that's
a whole thing to that's why sometimes people are into
that because that's massive polarity right um but in terms
of like evolution right a woman a role for a
long time was you know the gatherer and and be
taken care of like the household not saying that's how
it is now that's how it was for a long
time and a man was going out and he was
hunting right so I mean that's how it kind of
started and that's how the contractions started those with the
alpha male qualities those with a female qualities and that's
the thing too I know a lot of a lot
of men are attracted to women who are super feminine
and one example that is like when you're in a
relationship or when you're dating I know a lot of
guys including myself I like it when a woman asks
me to take care of something to fix it or
change the light bulb - to fix this to help
build this it makes you feel masculine and then actually
make because you feel the masculinity you feel attracted to
her mm-hmm right and the fact that you're able to
maybe do that request or do something like that that
makes her feel attracted to you that you can do
that right that you can conquer that little task right
so I think basically to sum it up you know
women are attracted to men who can who can take
control who can who can make decisions and bring a
sense of life just ultra confidence - to all the
little and big situations that life has - boy yeah
I totally agree with that one I think is very
important to be grounded as a man and to allow
the woman to to basically partake in that because there
are emotional creatures and they're kind of up and down
and up and down they like the man to be
the one grounds them and kind of stabilizes them that
makes them feel good and it also makes the man
feel good so you've got this kind of yin yang
relationship going yeah why not I'll say one thing one
I remember this is one part and I actually use
this in my own relationships this is one part of
the book in the way the superior man that shows
this really well what you just said is that like
a woman might be like uh you know super emotional
at a point for whatever reason maybe she's upset of
something maybe she's mad at the guy for something and
one of the best things you could do it as
a man in that situation instead of like trying to
like out logic her or explain to her why she
should feel better or why she shouldn't be mad you
just go over to her and give her a big
hug and just like polaron and then I think it
was something like saying like I love you or like
don't worry like it's going to be okay you know
what I mean and just like pulling her in and
just saying stuff and this I haven't heard just be
like in your arms this tight squeeze and I wasn't
whoa like that's so intense and it works yeah that
stuff is great like a lot of the problems with
women like you don't want to try to talk them
out of it like that's the worst thing you can
do is to to reject a woman's emotions and to
tell her to like stop being emotional because that's what
she loves to do she actually likes that um and
she she hates it when you don't validate her feelings
so a lot of times you can just kind of
skirt that issue by doing something physical like what you
just said right exactly and that brings in a lot
of elements and I was just talking about dominance and
control and things like that yeah I found that I
had to like reprogram my mind to to like do
stuff like that or also like using humor in very
like strategic ways like when some serious issue comes up
or something like that like being able to reframe the
situation be able to like ask a different question like
have the woman switch her perspective or just like focus
on something else a lot of times like that will
solve some of those relationship problems because as guys a
lot of times we tend to want to like be
logical about it and solve it in a logical way
and women hate that when we try to do that
with them yeah yeah there's there's times when women want
actual advice they do want logical steps like hey you
know leo what can I do right now to fix
this issue at work or whatever and sometimes they just
want to be listened to and I find as myself
I'm not super like that like a woman but there
is sometimes a part of me maybe like 20% of
time I don't really want an answer I can't just
want to talk it out I just want to just
release the emotions a woman on the other hand usually
they're the opposite right they just kind of want to
talk about talking motions out they just want someone to
listen and be there and understand and empathize and sympathize
right so that's kind of one of the things you
should be doing like you should actually one tip is
like you can ask the girl like hey like did
you want some advice on this or do you want
me to just kind of listen and they hear what's
going on and I'm here for I'm here for both
so what would you like and then they can tell
you and then you can just kind of be them
or maybe they'll be so emotional that they might not
be able to answer that question and just listen that's
far the best bet it's always a good idea to
just assume to listen and then at the end of
it say like is there anything I can help you
with this is there anything I can help you do
with this and then that would kind of be the
answer like they'll be like no like I just wanted
to talk to you about it or they were like
yeah what can I do and then you'll be like
I time to put the logical hat on and help
the girl in whatever situation it is okay awesome let's
move on uh do you think it's easier you know
you talked about being a man and how situations were
a long time 100 gather situation what about how society
is really changed in the last let's say 50 or
70 years especially with women getting a lot more of
their own rights their own lives together now every woman
is pretty much independent so is it harder or easier
today to be a man do you think that it
was 70 or 50 years ago well I think it's
yes it's all relative but I think that it's easier
now I mean like I'm I'd rather be in the
now then then be in like you know 50 60
years ago over the 1940s 1950s I'd rather be a
man now and of course I know that sounds a
little biased because I am but hey I mean in
terms of this I'd rather be in the now in
terms of music I'd rather be in the 1940s 1950s
like hands-down not just me but in terms of this
stuff you know I think it's easier for men even
though I know there's this argument like women are becoming
more independent and it's harder because we're losing the vision
of you know how a man is supposed to be
with being chivalrous versus like oh we should open the
door for them but we shouldn't because they can do
it themselves and all this and I know that there's
a lot of blurred lines there but I think nowadays
it's better and easier because one we have the capabilities
to get so much more information like a YouTube video
right or whatever it is to be able to learn
how to attract better quality women when like 50 60
years ago it was kind of like your dad taught
you maybe you learn to trick from a friend and
and that was pretty much it and you do the
best you could do right and again it's all relative
back then this part is like whatever to them because
they didn't realize that seven years later the internet would
exist and you can get better at something like this
um but another thing is this I was thinking about
when you said you know women are more independent these
days you know a lot of men including myself that
are attracted to women who are more independent it's actually
more of an attractive quality as long as that woman
still has a lot of feminine qualities and can still
have that feminine essence you know and not be so
in control everything and take away from the man because
the man will then not be is attracted to the
woman but but I like and I know a lot
of men who like women who are independent they can
do things on their own they're not always relying on
on other people or they're really passionate about what they
do you know a lot of that stuff is very
attractive yeah I agree with you I love that stuff
too I think that's a definitely a plus for women
too to be doing that and still trying to balance
that out excite with that feminine energy good one of
the things that a lot of guys that I see
when they start off getting better with women is that
when they start that journey they're just so needy to
begin with and nothing is less attractive to a woman
than a meaty guy who just wants that sex or
wants that relationship like I know when I started all
in one was just like a girlfriend a relationship but
like everything I did then sub communicated that neediness that
I had so if a guy is needy and he's
listening to this right now how does he go about
curing that kind of thing okay first of all I'll
quickly explain why needing this is unattractive and it's basically
everything we've been talking about when you're needy you lack
control when you're needy that means that you're relying on
outside forces to please you and to get you happy
or get you more in control which you won't ever
be because it'll just it'll be a cycle of neediness
right and so neediness showing that you're not in control
is just one less very important alpha male quality that
you need to attract women right a man who's in
control he doesn't need he doesn't need anything of course
you need the very basics food shelter whatever water but
beyond that you should have everything that you need because
otherwise you're just going into a downward spiral of having
to seek validation and in anyways I'm kind of going
out into a whole tangent here but at the end
of the day it's showing that you don't have your
life together because you need other things that's not you
when you should be okay with what you have in
the moment so that's why neediness doesn't really work so
knowing that and understanding that what you can do to
not be needy is to I mean there's some practical
things as meditation is one of the biggest things right
so we stress out and we're we're really worried and
anxious all the time about all the little things in
our life right all the time and meditation actually starts
to Center you and help you focus on the present
and again coming back to that idea that what you
have in front of you is all you need and
this is it right right now your I mean unless
you're like literally in a torture prison what's better than
the moment right in front of you as long as
you're under a roof you just had a meal and
a glass of water right so that's one of the
ways to get rid of your neediness knowing that everything
you have is actually right in front of you and
inside of you right now that's that's brilliant but one
of the things that when I chart office is like
yes you have all those things but a guy for
example he doesn't have a girlfriend he's gonna feel like
well but I need that right I need that and
the reason that you can say that oh I'm just
sitting here comfortably is because you got girlfriends or you've
already had a bunch of sex and you're already good
with girls and so because of that you feel like
you're fulfilled but what do you do when you're kind
of like desperate for a girl you haven't had sex
in a couple of years there's something like that and
it's just like this like oh my like you need
it because you I mean honestly you do need it
right there right right and it's a and it's a
catch-22 right because the more you need it the more
you're going to try to get it so hard and
then you won't get it because you're showing your neediness
so here's what it comes down to I call it
faith in the process okay faith and belief in the
process that you're going through right now to become better
with women so of course I mean hands down we
need to like take the steps and do the actions
to get better with women right don't just be running
around needy bumbling fool but work on yourself and work
on all these attract techniques and through that you're going
to be like okay I want the results now want
the results now like a media like I just want
the sex you need to like take a step back
and may I just remind you right now that this
is a process that's going to take some time but
have faith a faith and belief that with enough work
the results will come but the second you stop trying
and stop learning and stop trying to be a better
more attractive man it's never going to come so you
have to be patient you have to be patient and
let the process take hold and let everything fall into
place as you as you continue to try and get
better at this stuff so if you want to you
know just be lazy and not go out on a
Friday night or maybe like walk by a pretty girl
on a random weekday and not do the approach and
not try and not go after it then at that
point you're just going to go back into the old
routine of wanting it wanting it but never getting it
because you're not doing anything and not taking not having
faith in the process so it's really an act of
patience again going back to the whole meditation thing that
brings it in it's about being okay with what's happening
right now but also working at it because obviously we
don't work at it then you will never get anywhere
and I'll tell you I went through the exact same
thing I did be very very patient for a long
time but I saw that the more work I put
into it the faster I got the results so just
focus on the actions that you need to take and
less on the outcome yeah so that's a beautiful thing
is they're focusing on process and this applies not only
to your improvement in dating and with women but if
you're starting a business or with your career or anything
else in life that you really want to achieve that's
worthwhile especially if you're struggling in that area right now
you're gonna have to expect they're going to put in
some time and some energy into it and some money
maybe even before you finally get the ultimate results that
you want and you just like you said you have
to have that faith in the process okay great and
so finally let's wrap up with how do you actually
get started on this stuff because let's say that I'm
a guy right now and I really not good with
women I'm really upset with how good I am I
don't think that I'm I'm capable of becoming good but
maybe in the back of my mind I think you
know maybe it's possible but what would I need to
do what are the top three actions that a guy
needs to take to start to get better with girls
this is a great question I'm gonna give you very
specific things and you could do right now and they're
very like very specific not going to give you some
broad things like work under confidence learn how to talk
to girls I'm just gonna give you the three things
that you should do right now that will hands-down get
you better at meeting women okay in no specific order
no importance just all three all equally important one go
out and get clothes that fit you that's it don't
doesn't be like skin-tight just get clothes that fits you
just do that one thing and that's automatically going to
make you look more attractive okay that's number one go
do that number two I want you to start talking
to every single person that you come across and you
might not be thinking about where these opportunities lie but
they're everywhere I don't mean it has to be every
hot girl that walks by but I want you to
get used to talking to strangers and people that you
don't know that can come in the form of talking
to a taxi driver for a couple minutes and getting
to know him that can come into um you know
walking down the aisle of the grocery store and someone's
looking at something maybe if you're not truly interested in
like what they're picking up just talk about it for
a second open up the conversation finding any way possible
to have more conversations and if you're not if you're
like a homebody and you never leave your house well
then the priest step to that would be go out
leave your house in any excuse to just get out
and get around people that you can have the possibility
of having interaction with okay and I'd say the third
thing in terms of getting quicker results meditation that's the
third thing going back to what we're talking about before
because that's going to work on the inner stuff right
so I want you to talk I want you to
be working on the outer stuff like getting the more
fitted clothes talking to people and getting used to more
conversations and then working on being able to meditate and
relax oh so the specific example of meditation they'll want
you to do is after watching this video get your
phone set a timer for five minutes and just sit
for five minutes which is going to seem like an
eternity when you do it but it's not that long
it's five minutes out of your day and just sit
there and focus on your breathing and every time you
kind of like stray off just go back to your
breathing and it's going to be very boring and York
and you're going to be like I can't wait till
this is over but just try it out and feel
that feeling after you're done and you'll see a little
bit more of a calmness and then all three of
those there's more you can do but you want to
take all those to the next level but those are
the three biggest like specific takeaways a guy can do
right now to become better as a human being really
and also become more attractive to learn okay awesome beautifully
I love that I love the meditation at the end
that I think the the first two are also very
practical and I ended up doing all three of those
when I was getting better of course I did a
lot of other stuff too and we're going to be
wrapping it up here but if you guys are interested
