hey this is Leo for actualised org and I'm gonna
take you back I'm gonna give you a blast to
the past in pop culture do you remember the movie
Star Trek The Next Generation I know kind of nerdy
of me to bring you back to those days but
this was like an early 90s movie and it got
me really thinking because lately I realize like I'm the
main villain from that movie do you remember what the
plot in that movie was you probably don't because you
just remember the characters etc at Star Trek you just
they're always up to some shenanigans but actually the plot
of the movie was really interesting in that plot what
was happening was that the the enterprise was fighting this
main evil villain and the villain was creating trouble because
there was this magical wave that rippled through the universe
and it's like a wave of energy that ripples through
and rember that wave of energy comes to contact if
there's somebody standing in the presence of that wave that
what happens is they get transported back in time in
their mind into reliving their best memories so it's like
this euphoric nostalgia it's almost like this drug that they
get hooked on and was called the Nexus and so
the main character the plot is the story goes that
this main character when he was a young boy he
encountered this Nexus and it felt so good for him
it was such such a nostalgic moment such a hit
of euphoria that he then spends the rest of his
life chasing and finding where this wave is gonna go
and he's now trying to control the wave because the
wave is is random and sporadic and it's traveling through
the universe and you can't really catch up to it
but his plan was to destroy civilizations and planets and
all this just so that he can get at this
Nexus it's that he can feel as good as he
felt back then and I realized that the last five
years for me were really much like this guy chasing
the Nexus and trying to get back to that point
to that place except it was a little bit different
the way it was different I'm not chasing after some
nostalgic memory from the past but here's what happened with
me after I graduated college I really wanted to become
a game designer so I spent about eight months right
after my graduation working on a big project that I
needed as part of my portfolio so that I can
get hired by a studio no studio would hire me
unless I had something good to show them so I
figured you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna build
a game and I'm gonna put it out there to
the public see what kind of reactions I get I'm
gonna learn in the process get some good experience and
do what I love doing which is creating games and
then hopefully get hired and finally be a professional designer
and so I went through I designed the game I
worked my butt off to program it to do all
the artwork for that basically was one-man shop and did
everything that I needed to do to get this launched
and it was a mod for oblivion maybe you played
it it's called la spires and in anyways long story
short I ended up really working hard on that and
launching it releasing and I was really happy with it
myself but then much to my surprise I was really
kind of astonished that it ended up being the number
one mod for oblivion and it got downloaded over a
hundred thousand times and what I loved seeing wasn't just
those numbers I mean the numbers were certainly rewarding because
I felt like my design senses got validated it's always
nice to to have the external reward to kind of
match the pleasure that you get in working on the
project and for me that really was a labor of
love it was something that I really was passionate about
and I put it out there and I would have
honestly been happy if it hadn't been played or downloaded
at all it was just satisfying for me to do
plus I was doing it for work reasons but on
top of this I get flooded with a bunch of
user comments and I got flooded with all these ratings
and reactions and rave reviews for this mod and basically
people were so in love with it they liked it
so much they got so much value out of it
they loved playing it so many times that became kind
of like a cult hit within the modding community for
oblivion and it was really a surreal experience to watch
that I remember when I worked my ass off to
launch the mod and I set a time schedule for
myself and at that point I was really splint because
I knew that if I didn't finish by a certain
point that I would never finish it so I set
a launch window in August and I said that by
the end of August I would launch and finally the
end of August was coming up and then it was
like the last day of August and I couldn't push
back anymore and I still had so much work to
do on the model I wasn't satisfied there's still many
bugs to work out so I was ironing out all
the bugs and putting it all to find a little
polishes on it but I had to release and people
were waiting for it and asking me when it's gonna
launch and I'm like well I'm gonna launch just like
I promised the end of August and so the last
day I end up crunching and I end up working
for 24 hours straight to get every possible bug that
I could out of this thing and I would literally
I've never done this before I like nearly worked myself
to death I was so delirious working on the bugs
that I felt like I had an out-of-body experience but
I had to launch so anyways I ended up doing
that launching and then as soon as I launched I
didn't even look at the reactions I just went to
sleep and I slept for a day and then when
I came back the thing was still full of bugs
and people reporting bugs but people were also reporting how
happy they were how thrilled they were and just like
thanking me and asking questions and that sense that I
got from about that point when I launched at the
beginning of September this was I think in 2007 or
2008 2007 I think it was and then for the
next about six months I just remember riding this wave
and it was the greatest feeling that I ever felt
and this was a feeling that I never ever felt
before in my life and I haven't felt really since
and it was the pride that you get from seeing
your creative work out there and not only the pride
that you get in putting the energy into the creative
work but then seeing it validated by other people and
it's not so much about you wanting the validation but
it's more about like yeah you know that put a
smile on someone's face and that was my work that
did that and not only that but it was the
fact that I gave myself permission to trust my creative
my creative direction on this project and that I had
to take creative risks in it to say you know
what are people really gonna like this game are people
gonna like destroy that put into it are people gonna
like that the artwork that I did here if you
were gonna like these directions that I chose and I
just said you know what I'm not gonna care what
people like I'm just gonna do what I like what
I feel is right what I would want as a
gamer and I ended up going with that decision and
I'm putting it out there and people ended up really
loving it and I felt very validated by that and
felt awesome it just felt awesome to be able to
go out there and to share what I consider a
gift of mine at the time was my my design
sense to be able to share that with people and
to bring joy to people's lives with that and to
me that that was such a moment of pride that
really lasted not just for a day not a week
it real a stood for like six to twelve months
that I knew that that was that was it somehow
I just randomly stumbled upon the feeling that I was
most that maybe most engaged with life and the feeling
that I really wanted to like if I could latch
onto that and to hold it and or if I
can just like bottle that feeling and sell it to
other people to me that's the greatest feeling in the
world is to have some sort of creative vision whether
it's a vision for a business that you want to
build or something you want to do with your career
something work-related and then to go out there into labor
for it and to build something new create something unique
create something that your patent really passionate about and that
you can get other people passionate about and then going
out there and then saying here here's a gift take
it and sure you can charge money for it whatever
but in the end you're giving a gift you're giving
yourself in a little package in a service or a
product you're giving this to someone and you're like this
is my heart I'm pouring my heart out to you
here it is and then when you see that that
person is is happy with it and that they accepted
them they love it and they want more of it
from you that is like the greatest pleasure in life
and to me that's the creative creative content and creative
contribution that you can have and that you can get
when you're really on top of your game with your
job and your work in your career and that what
to me is makes the difference between just having a
job and having a career and then really having a
life calling where you're putting yourself into your work you
really care about your work you're bleeding into your work
and your sharing it with others and it's something positive
that's making a big positive contribution to society to other
people and you know I'm not under some grand illusion
I don't think that this little game project that I
made in the grand scheme of things really made that
big of a difference but it was still enough of
a positive difference that I could get those those feelings
from it you know I didn't cure cancer I didn't
cure AIDS I didn't put the first man on Mars
or do anything super ambitious like that but even putting
a game out there that someone could play for let's
say 10 to 15 hours and have a blast playing
it and me just knowing that you know they played
that and for them that was 15 hours of pleasure
that they received for free I put this thing out
for free I could have charged money forward people still
would have paid but the fact is that they were
playing it and they loved it and you know someone
might have had a bad day at work that week
when I released or someone might have been having a
shitty situation and their family they might have had a
relationship breakup and then all the sudden this this game
launches and then they go they play for 15 hours
and the kind of escape and they enjoy the things
that I put in there they enjoy the story danger
they enjoy the art work and they just kind of
get drawn into it drawn into it they play it
and then they get something from it right that's me
making a positive impact on the world to me that
was huge and what happened after that is that I
launched that project it was really successful because of that
success I was getting some interviews got the interest of
some studios and I got hired by a nice studio
in Boston I went and became a professional game designer
and I worked there the problem though is that really
I spent the next five years that was five years
ago I spent the next five years trying to recapture
that feeling and I still haven't really recaptured it until
today today is the first time that I'm really starting
to feel a little bit of that and the reason
that is because I launched my personal development blueprint and
I'm putting new videos out and I'm starting to get
that sense again of creative contribution and I haven't even
gotten any reactions from anybody yet for this content but
I'm just seeing that I'm proud of it myself I'm
proud of I'm putting out there and I'm starting to
see again that feed getting that that that tingle of
that feeling that I got five years ago when I
knew that I was on the brink of releasing something
that was gonna impact people in a positive way and
not only that but I was putting my soul into
it like this is me putting myself on the line
I'm not sure really how people are gonna react I'm
not sure if I'm going the right direction so I'm
just saying you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna do
it I'm gonna express myself I'm gonna give my gifts
and I'm gonna see how it's gonna work and this
has been really challenging to me for five years you
might ask well why did it take you five years
to get back to this point and well that's a
good question I've been asking myself that for five years
now because I've been that that hit that drug that
I got after that release of creative you know that
sense of creative contribution I've been after it for five
years now and it's almost kind of scary because I
forgot what it feels like until just now and it's
like it's tingles down my spine and when I think
about that it almost brings tears to my eyes because
it's such a powerful feeling and I think that if
I wasn't lucky to have just kind of landed that
hit with that game that maybe I wouldn't have even
realized that that was a peak experience that was even
possible for me and so I kind of wonder like
do people even know that this is something that is
out there for them I think that a lot of
people don't because they just the way that I see
people thinking about their jobs and the way that people
work their jobs just kind of the nine-to-five grinding it
through not really putting their soul into it not working
in creative in a creative capacity not really sharing themselves
not really caring about having a sense of contribution when
I think about that that I'm like these people probably
don't even realize what they're missing out on this is
like the greatest jewel one of the greatest joys in
life that you couldn't put that you can kind of
put yourself in and going back to to this nexus
idea right this is exactly what was happening in the
Star Trek next generations is that this guy had an
experience a peak experience by interacting coming in contact with
this nexus then it was so powerful that everything else
in life wasn't that important it's he was after that
and then he could dedicate his whole life to pursuing
it and so back to my point as to why
it took me five years to get back here it's
because after I graduated and then I went on and
became a professional developer the problem there is that I
went to work in a big team environment and I
never got that sense of contribution to the project that
I got when I was working on my small little
thing it's a little bit counterintuitive because I thought that
when I was graduating and becoming a professional and that
I would be working on a big real game you
know what I was working on in the end was
piddly stuff when I was working on a big game
that was gonna be sold and you know Best Buy
or Walmart one of these big stores and it was
something that's gonna be on a console like the Xbox
or the PlayStation or the PC then that's gonna be
like even a bigger sense of contribution but what I
ultimately found was that when you're working in a team
environment your sense of creative autonomy and creative contribution gets
diluted if you got a hundred people working on a
project versus one person working on a project then it's
almost like you're getting one hundredth of the amount of
input into that project especially when you're just starting off
and you're a newbie and you don't get that much
creative autonomy you're having that much say in this project
and so there when I was working for about a
year I didn't get that sense of creative contribution and
I started realizing that if I wanted that same kind
of sense of contribution that what I really needed to
do was go into business for myself and then I
couldn't do that in a studio environment I couldn't do
that working for somebody else so for me that that
first year of of working as a game designer was
really bittersweet because on the one hand I finally made
it and I made it to the big leagues right
this was like my dream job this is something that
I've been dreaming up since I was a kid and
I worked really hard to get there but on the
other hand it was really bitter because I felt that
I wasn't getting that sense of contribution which was the
whole reason of why I tried to get there and
so I started to realize that really I came to
this kind of dark and saddening conclusion which made me
very depressed is that I have to because what I
really need to do is they need to go into
business for myself and at that point I had no
idea about how business worked how to do that I
didn't have any capital and have any money I couldn't
quit my job because I didn't have the money to
quit my job I needed to stay there to make
ends meet and I didn't really know how to create
a game studio I didn't know how to take the
passion that I had for game design and convert it
into something like a business so I started getting some
ideas started researching it but I also knew that I
just didn't have the capital for it because it's hard
to start a game studio in your basement this was
just before mobile gaming got started so at that point
it wasn't really feasible there was no really way to
start a low-budget game and so I was thinking well
I have to raise capital and what I did then
is I started my own business and internet marketing and
that was something that I really didn't enjoy doing I
didn't enjoy their new market in fact I didn't like
marketing at all I had a real hatred for marketing
because I don't usually like the kind of values that
that marketing espouses and so I said you know what
screw it because I need to get myself a financial
and financially independent I'm gonna go into internet marketing I'm
gonna do that for a few years with the hope
of building up enough capital to start my own studio
etc etc etc and to cut this long story short
what ended up happening is I did quit after a
year started my internet marketing business but then the internet
marketing business kind of dragged on and on and on
and on and even though I became really successful for
me and I did end up creating quite a bit
of independent financial independence for myself I was never able
to to reach that point where I was able to
really start my own studio and at that point mobile
gaming went went really really caught on fire and I
started doing a little bit of that but I felt
like because I wasn't working in that studio environment and
because I quit my studio job I felt like I
really wasn't a game designer anymore and so I wasn't
getting I just wasn't really getting that same passion that
I had anymore for game design and I ended up
quitting that and just focusing on inner marketing for about
three or four years and that really took me off
track because I was partly seduced by the money of
it was partly seduced by the comfort that I was
now in because I had the money I didn't really
need to work much anymore I didn't need to push
myself creatively which is challenging to do and so I
ended up not having that creative hit anymore and I
didn't have any sense of create about the creative contribution
nothing like I got from that game project that I
started and so I was like that guy is Star
Trek the next generation that came into contact with the
Nexus and felt so great about it but then that
Nexus moved away and it moved into other into other
galaxies or whatever and he no longer could be in
the Nexus and he couldn't feel it anymore but he
wanted it so bad and so for many years that
was the case for me is that I was doing
internet marketing and on the one hand I had to
be fully involved in that because it required all my
time on the other hand I always had my eye
out on something bigger because I wanted that hit that
drug I got from creative contribution and I was never
able to really make anything that made that click for
me and you know I'm struggling with it struggling with
it struggling with it and then I started kind of
even losing the drive to pursue it because what happens
after a while you know a year passes two years
pass what happens is that your mind just kind of
shifts on to new things and you kind of tend
to forget that feeling no longer feels as palpable as
it was at one point and so you slowly forget
about it forget about it and you start rationalizing away
and you start saying yeah you know what my life
is pretty comfortable it's pretty good I don't really need
to be go out there I don't need to be
rattling cages and doing all this crazy stuff and taking
all these crazy risks just to get that little hit
bit of hit of creative contribution and so that's what
ended up happening is that I kind of forgot about
it let it go thought that maybe it was naive
or that maybe I'll get it in the future somehow
and so I didn't have it and then you know
at one point I just got so fed up with
the internet marketing stuff that I had to say you
know enough is enough and that I have to find
something else for me and I knew that it was
no longer gonna be game design and what I had
to do is I had to make this really challenging
transition which I didn't even know that I that I
that was possible at the time was I had to
shift life purposes and for me that was really challenging
because I had to say okay my life purpose was
game design and that was something that came about relatively
randomly through my childhood just because I started playing a
lot of games and I got involved with it and
I'm like well what's what else could it be for
me if it's not game design is there even anything
else that it could be and so I'd have to
do a lot of soul-searching and just kind of looked
into what I was doing as my hobbies and one
of the hobbies that I had at that point was
reading a lot of personal development stuff and I thought
you know this is kind of interesting and then from
there I transitioned it into going to a coaching program
and then it took me a year of training and
doing all that and a lot of insecurity just to
get to the point where you know I launched my
website and then even after I launched my website still
a lot of insecurities and challenges and still not getting
any creative juice because you know building a website is
something that takes months maybe even years to do especially
the quality level that I wanted to do it and
I felt like you know I needed to I needed
to really put myself into the website and I didn't
just want to build a cookie-cutter site like everybody else
I wanted to build something that was unique something that
was expressive of my gifts of myself so I needed
to make something creative and it was again like what
is that going to be and all the creative challenges
involved because expressing yourself creatively is a whole topic onto
itself and all the challenges and fears and limiting beliefs
that come with that and all the emotional kind of
toil that goes into that and all the self-doubt and
self-sabotage and all the resistance that's created there I'm probably
going to shoot a lot of videos on that topic
in the future but the point being that only just
now five years after going through this kind of discovering
what my passion was and then losing it and then
trying to find a new passion and then working on
that and then trying to work through all the challenges
only after about five years of that whole that work
that I went through do I now feel like I'm
getting to the point where I'm back on track and
it's still gonna take quite a bit of work for
me I'm still battling all those creative challenges again now
that I'm in this creative position with with this website
and the videos that I'm shooting in the coaching that
I'm doing and all the personal development research that I'm
doing but just now I'm starting to feel it and
it feels amazing and I'm so excited about what the
future can be for me with with this peak experience
of creative contribution the reason I mention it though is
because I want a tangible example I was trying to
talk about creative contribution in other videos but it's been
difficult for me because it's hard to communicate something so
abstract I think many people out there don't even realize
what this feels like it's almost like trying to describe
sex or an orgasm to someone who's never had it
or it's trying to describe you know the taste of
a ripe peach on on a hot summer day to
someone who doesn't have any taste buds it's like it's
difficult to describe that or describing the beauty of like
a sunset or the beauty of some natural Vista out
like in the desert or in the forest like those
are experiences that are almost transcendent and like tap into
the highest the highest self a certain like a higher
level of consciousness is required to hit those and I
think that a lot of people go through life without
experiencing these high these high states of consciousness and without
experiencing these peak experiences specifically creative contribution and I think
that's my biggest challenge to you with career and life
purpose is that if you're coming to me with questions
about life purpose if you're coming to me with questions
about career or if you're just wandering about you know
what is the best that you can get out of
your work what is the best you can get out
of your business I think this is it it's creative
contribution and I'm not the only one that says this
most self development experts out there especially that are working
and experienced in the field of career will tell you
that one of the greatest pleasures in life is contribution
right it's giving of yourself it's not about focusing on
yourself and getting more money that stuff tends to be
very shallow it's about what you can contribute and not
only contribute something positive but contribute yourself where you're self
expressive so there's a difference between say me going to
a soup kitchen right now and labeling it out soup
to people and me contributing to society in the way
that is tapping into my greatest gifts because you know
I am NOT a good soup later laid ler I'm
not a very interpersonal kind of guy who likes to
you know go out there and and hobnob with with
the poor and the hungry I'm not a mother Teresa
type figure so for me that's not like my thing
that's not mice that's not where my talents lie my
talents lie and being analytical and in sharing my expertise
and my knowledge of my understanding with people I'm really
good at looking at something studying it dissecting it creating
a model of it modeling it and then saying here
you go here's this model how can it help you
in your life and so that's a different form of
contribution and when you're looking for ways to contribute in
your life instead of thinking about well I could just
earn a ton of money doing something on over here
and I can go and take that money and maybe
go contribute it to a charity or I can go
give that money to my family instead of contributing in
that kind of way what I want to urge you
to do is to set up your life so that
the contribution is happening through your greatest gift and that
is happening through your work or your career or your
business I think that's a much more powerful way to
go about it so a lot of people do it
backwards right a lot of people will go work a
dead-end job or maybe even not a dead-end job but
a great job but it's still not very fulfilling for
them but it earns them let's say a lot of
money like maybe a lawyer will be working as a
lawyer because he's earning a lot of money but he
doesn't like doing the legal work and he doesn't really
think that he's helping people with his with the legal
cases he might be miserable doing that but he says
to himself well I'm earning a lot of this money
which I can use and put to good by helping
my family out by helping other people through charities and
through my donations and the social work that I'm doing
and the stuff that I'm doing on the side with
my hobbies so that's definitely not a bad strategy you
can do that that's better than what most people are
doing out there but I think there's a much more
powerful route and that is looking at what are your
greatest strengths what are the gifts that you really want
to share what does the creative contribution that you want
in part on the world what do you feel is
most important what is the biggest difference that you feel
would be necessary out there in the world and if
you went out there and you made that difference and
you made that positive impact that impact is positive so
you're contributing by making that impact for example for me
I think one of the greatest things that is lacking
in the world right now is awareness around psychology specifically
practical psychology how do you get your mind how do
you understand your mind so you can go out there
and create a really successful life and be very productive
and have high performance and be successful and be happy
I think that if more people understood that then the
world would be much better off so for me I
do that by a shooting of video or I do
that by writing an article and I do that by
coaching somebody that's how I do it and for me
that's a really powerful way to contribute and when I'm
putting my analytical strengths into it because my greatest strengths
I think is my analytical abilities when I'm putting that
in there and I'm sharing my understanding with you in
a profound way that comes back to me that comes
back to me not only in me feeling really good
it makes me feel super fulfilled that kind of feeling
I can't buy with anything it's like I'm back in
that nexus zone and it feels amazing so not only
am I getting that but it's also making me very
motivated it's making me very passionate and it's making me
really want to work hard on my business it's making
me want to create all this content and in the
end I'm gonna be able to design all that hopefully
so that it comes back to me both in the
feelings that I get but also in financial rewards because
I want to get well compensated for what I'm doing
as well and then of course I'm gonna have the
best of both worlds because I'm gonna have the money
then then I can then use however I want both
for myself but then I can use it for my
family and I can use it for charities if I
want to and I can use it all sorts of
different ways or I could even maybe reinvest it back
in my business so that I can contribute even more
by scale my business up so that I can reach
more viewers so that's just one example with myself I
wanted to give a very specific concrete example because it's
hard to talk about this stuff in the abstract so
the takeaway here is I really want you to bind
to this vision of the power of creative contribution and
how much joy and fulfillment you can get from that
that's really a feeling that cannot be purchased no matter
how much money you're making and then of course that
when you do have that feeling you're going to be
in a much better position to earn a lot of
money so you're really not sacrificing anything when you pursue
this the only trick is that of course you have
to do some introspection soul-searching to get this to come
about in your life for me it was really a
five-year process of doing this and it was a scary
process I didn't really know if it was gonna work
for me I didn't know a lot about personal development
I didn't have the resources that I'm providing to you
right now at the time so I had to kind
of experiment and use trial and error to figure a
lot of this stuff out with you I'm trying to
fix that problem is I'm trying to make you a
little bit more aware about what your options are and
I'm trying to give you the motivation the push that
you need to go out there to pursue it I
think you need to live on your edge if you
want to have that kind of powerful exciting life where
you're really on your edge and you're getting the most
out of life and you're gonna die with no regrets
then it's gonna come down to this it's gonna come
down to saying you know what the job that I
have right now maybe isn't quite as thrilling as I
know it can be and so I'm gonna have the
courage to go out there and do some soul-searching and
look around at the different opportunities and possibilities that are
out there even though in the short run that might
cost me some energy might cost me some time maybe
I'll even have to take a cut in pay in
the short term to figure out how this is all
going to come together and you tell yourself that basically
you're going to commit to it and then you're gonna
find a way because that's what I did as I
said I'm gonna find a way and I didn't know
how but eventually you know it took five years and
I almost felt like I didn't make it but the
end I did and I think that that path with
help from coaching mentors the resources that are out there
books seminars you can definitely figure it out the only
thing that's going to really determine whether you do it
or not is your motivation is your drive your want
for it so that I see as being my biggest
objective here is to instill you with that vision so
the vision is creative contribution it feels amazing you want
it in your life if you haven't felt it before
you're really missing out and I would I would almost
urge you to do something creative and put something creative
out there in the world so you can just get
a sense of it get a sense of what that
feels like to have it and if you've had it
in the past and you don't have it very consistently
anymore the same way that I did it then I
encourage you to do a little bit of soul-searching go
through these videos look especially on my stuff on life
purpose and get that stuff handled so that you have
that experience very consistently in your life that's what I
want for you that's what's gonna make you really fulfilled
that's what's gonna make you really successful all right if
you have any questions or comments I want you to
leave them down below I love hearing comments about this
stuff especially this topic life purpose for me is a
really deep personal topic so I love hearing about your
guys's struggles and how these ideas could be helping you
out and what else I can throw out here for
you that can help you get this stuff figured out
all right this is leo signing off
