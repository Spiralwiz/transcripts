            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/GC7KNAyDt4I' target='_blank'>Id, Ego, Superego - Understanding An Old School Psychology Concept</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding Id, Ego, and Superego</b>: Leo Gura talks about the concept of id, ego, and superego in psychology which originated from Sigmund Freud. The id is equated to horses pulling a buggy - representing our base desires, the rider controlling the horses represents our ego - the part of us that cogitates and controls, and lastly, the father yelling instructions to the rider is the superego - representing our societal and moral constraints. 
</li><li><b>The Model's Critique</b>: Maintains that this model, though not a literal representation of mind functions, is helpful in understanding the potential lesser self destructive drives and habits within us. These lesser self habits, even the socially acceptable ones like leisurely spending too much time watching TV or partying, can impede us from unlocking our potential.
</li><li><b>Advisory on Internal Critics</b>: Leo discusses the critical nature of the superego, which although necessary, is not the highest self. He explains that societal conditioning and moral values do not necessarily align with our highest self and urges a need for a distinction between the lower unconscious self and the higher conscious self. 
</li><li><b>Consciousness and Personal Development</b>: In Gura's view, the conscious self aspires to live up to ideals and seeks out what is beneficial. His recommended route to personal development is recognizing and differentiating between your lower and higher self. This differentiation through introspection and experience help in making wiser decisions and actions without constant self-criticism. 
</li><li><b>What is Self-Actualization</b>: Self-actualization is achieved when there is a clear distinction between the lower and higher self, allowing an individual to easily steer towards actions that are conscious. Once this level of consciousness is reached, a person becomes at peace with themselves, they stop self-judgement - resulting in a healthy foundation for positive action. 
</li><li><b>Promoting Psychological Concepts</b>: Gura stresses the significance of spreading awareness on psychology concepts and recommends viewers to explore his website, actualized.org for content and tools to help individuals self-actualize and live fulfilling lives.
</li><li><b>Revision of Freud's Model</b>: Freud's model of the id, the ego and the super-ego has limitations, especially in its representation of the 'super-ego' or higher self. The model incorrectly mixes negative, critical aspects with positive, idealistic ones in the super-ego.
</li><li><b>Defining the Higher Self</b>: The higher self should not be understood as a moralistic entity shaped by societal and religious parameters, but as a conscious self that embodies wisdom.
</li><li><b>Becoming Fully Conscious</b>: Achieving a state of full consciousness allows for better decision-making, long-term thinking, impulse control, and complete awareness. It encourages us to be at peace with ourselves and our imperfections, aligning us with our higher self.
</li><li><b>Flowing toward Conscious Actions</b>: Increasing our consciousness helps develop a stronger connection with our higher self, leading to a more disciplined and conscious approach to life. This involves recognizing and differentiating between our lower and higher selves.
</li><li><b>Benefits of Conscious Living</b>: When operating from a state of high consciousness, it becomes easier to guide oneself naturally towards healthier, more beneficial choices. This feeling is not forced, but flows naturally as a part of our personal development.
</li><li><b>Importance of Personal Development</b>: Engaging in personal development can help refine the distinction between the lower and higher self, enabling individuals to effortlessly engage in healthy habits.
</li><li><b>Self-Actualization</b>: Self-actualization is the result of a clear distinction between the lower and higher self and the ability to effortlessly guide oneself towards beneficial choices.
</li><li><b>Promotional Content</b>: Leo encourages viewers to sign up for his newsletter at actualized.org for more information, personal development tools, and a chance to win free coaching sessions.
