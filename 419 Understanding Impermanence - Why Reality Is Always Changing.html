            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/ZCS4NsCdQaM' target='_blank'>Understanding Impermanence - Why Reality Is Always Changing</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Introduction to Impermanence</b>: In this part of the video, Leo Gura introduces the concept of impermanence. It's a key teaching in Buddhism and Hinduism. The term "Anita" from the Buddhist Pali language, and "Anitya" from Sanskrit, both mean "non-constant". The notion of impermanence conveys that all forms (including physical objects, feelings, emotions, etcetera), are non-constant; they always arise and then pass away. This concept might seem simple but has profound implications for leading a quality life. 
</li><li><b>God as a Shapeshifter</b>: Gura presents the concept of God not as a religious entity but as shapeshifting consciousness  shapeshifting in the sense that it constantly changes forms to maximize diversity and love. He compares it to a television screen that displays a variety of images rather than sticking to one. Similarly, God keeps changing forms to remain unlimited and foster a maximum creative output. If a TV screen malfunctions and sticks to one image, its function as a medium of variety is defeated. In the same way, if God stays with a specific form, it restricts the diversity and creativity of the universe. 
</li><li><b>Infinity and Impermanence</b>: Gura highlights consciousness as an infinite entity trying to maximize its diversity and love. This infinite consciousness, in the form of God, constantly changes forms to encompass all possibilities, similar to a TV screen. If God sticks to one form, it becomes limited and less diverse. Hence, the universe's and God's fundamental trait is impermanence. 
</li><li><b>Underlying Principle of Reality</b>: Aligning with the concept of impermanence, Gura compares reality with an "Etch-a-Sketch," a toy where drawings can be wiped clean to create new ones. This constant creation and refreshing of forms constitute the reality. It points to the unique aspect of the universe  that change is the only constant. The universe operates more like a perpetual motion machine, always in change and movement. 
</li><li><b>Impermanence to Embrace Life's Quality</b>: Gura asserts that the idea of impermanence might seem simple, but understanding its depth could bring significant enhancements in life quality. The notion might need more examples and convincing to comprehend its power. Practicing impermanence through specific exercises could accentuate the significance of this concept in one's life.
</li><li><b>Understanding the difficulty of accepting impermanence</b>: Humans, being selfish, have a hard time coming to terms with the concept of impermanence. The selfishness arises from one's constrained perspective and the tendency to prioritize their wants and needs over everything else. An example given is that of a parent who might want to freeze their child in their current state, preserving the perfection they see in them at that moment. This is born out of attachment and a limited understanding of love. 
</li><li><b>Impermanence embraces all conditions</b>: God's love is compared to parental love to illustrate the concept of boundless love that embraces all conditions, even those that are considered unpleasant such as sickness, aging and death. God's love is seen as superior because it allows the free-flow of experiences and incarnations with the aim of discovering the entity's infinite nature, as opposed to a parent who'd attempt to shield their child from experiences they personally fear or see as detrimental.
</li><li><b>Love as surrendering and detachment</b>: Merely admiring or appreciating a loved one in their perfect states could be limited love, while true love delves into their imperfections and still holds strong. This kind of love comes from detachment from a particular form or state and embracing change. This form of love is also deemed as radical as it loves indiscriminately and transcends attachment, selfishness, and personal bias. 
</li><li><b>Face evils with a deep understanding of impermanence</b>: In order to handle life challenges better, understanding impermanence is critical. It equips an individual with a mechanism to face the concept of evil, which arises from a skewed perspective of loss. Loss, a manifestation of impermanence, is not in contradiction with the universes perfection and goodness, but rather, an evidence of absolute love. This realization can be reached through deep comprehension of impermanence, which recontextualizes the meaning of loss.
</li><li><b>Concept of Impermanence and Survival</b>: Leo Gura dives deeper into the concept of impermanence and how it ties into survival. He explains that people have a tendency to try and freeze different parts of reality due to the survival instinct. However, this is problematic because everything is in constant motion, and attempts to cling to temporariness can lead to suffering.
</li><li><b>True and Unconditional Love</b>: Gura brings to light the limitations of personal love. He suggests that by loving something or someone particular (like a parent loving their child), one is limiting their love. God's love, on the other hand, is considered as a broader, universal kind - a deep love that cannot cling to any one particular thing because it loves all aspects equally. 
</li><li><b>Dualism of Love</b>: Leo introduces the conflict between personal love and God's love. While individuals may selfishly desire protection for their own loved ones, God has to consider the needs of all beings across time and universes. Leo emphasizes that challenging circumstances, such as the death of a loved one from disease, can be viewed as part of a greater plan for the benefit of the universe. 
</li><li><b>Personal Anecdotes</b>: Gura provides personal experiences to explain the concept of unconditional love. He uses an example of his childhood when he wanted to give equal love and attention to all the rabbits in a pet store, paralleling with the idea of God's love. However, he also emphasizes on the difficulty for humans to emulate such boundless and formless love. 
</li><li><b>Impermanence and Devilry</b>: According to Gura, devilry arises when individuals try to make the impermanent permanent. He describes this as clinging to reality, which leads to manipulations and lies to maintain a certain situation or state. Furthermore, he explains that when a form tries to maintain its current configuration, it hinders the cycle of life and the evolution of beauty and creativity in the universe. 
</li><li><b>Limitations of Finite Perspective</b>: Leo discusses the limitations of a purely human perspective, focusing on immediate concerns without considering broader universal or future implications. He invites the viewer to consider the potential harm caused by freezing current states and preventing the birth or evolution of future beings. 
</li><li><b>Concept of Zero-Sum Game in Reality</b>: Gura brings up the idea of reality as a zero-sum game. Even though reality is infinite in its potential, when manifesting in specific forms, it becomes finite. This means one existence takes up space and opportunities that could have otherwise gone to other potential beings, thus reiterating the importance and inevitability of impermanence in the cycle of life.
</li><li><b>Concept of change and impermanence</b>: Individuals often find it challenging to embrace change, instead clinging to familiar forms, which can lead to suffering and create evil in society. This attachment goes against the universal law of impermanence.
</li><li><b>Impermanence as an effect of oneness</b>: Impermanence is the result of non-duality, meaning no part of reality can dominate another, as all parts are equally potent across time. The struggle of one part to overpower another is seen as an attempt to defy impermanence, akin to devilry.
</li><li><b>Impermanence enhancing appreciation</b>: Experiences and possessions are often cherished because of their temporary nature. The value and beauty of objects, experiences, or relationships lie in their ephemerality. Examining the impermanence of things can shift the perception from feeling threatened by change to appreciating life's transient pleasures.
</li><li><b>Exercises to realize impermanence</b>: Identifying and letting go of the forms one is trying to freeze in life is a significant exercise. It helps to understand that clinging to certain aspects of life fosters evil, and letting them go could potentially eliminate evil.
</li><li><b>True spirituality involving acceptance of impermanence</b>: Genuine spiritual growth involves embracing life's impermanence and understanding that strivings to make the temporary permanent can lead to suffering. It involves seeing impermanence as a gift rather than something to be feared or resisted. 
</li><li><b>Impermanence as a tool to reduce suffering</b>: Embracing impermanence can liberate individuals from suffering and heighten the appreciation, love, enjoyment, and beauty of the formed world. The temporary nature of enjoyable experiences makes them precious. 
</li><li><b>Appreciating temporary experiences</b>: Favorite foods or other rare experiences are enjoyed precisely because they're temporary and cannot be frequently accessed. This unavailability heightens their appeal and shows the importance of impermanence.
</li><li><b>Appreciation of Impermanence</b>: Leo Gura discusses the appreciation we have for various experiences in life because of their impermanence. He highlights how our memories, relationships, experiences, and even entertainment are precious due to their fleeting nature and limited time of occurrence. If experiences were constant and never-ending, they would lose their appeal and could even result in discomfort or boredom. 
</li><li><b>Impermanence in Entertainment</b>: Leo discusses how the impermanence of entertainment, such as video games, movies, and books, adds to their enjoyment. If only one video game or movie were to exist permanently, it would lead to the eventual loss of creativity and diversity in the entertainment industry. 
</li><li><b>Impermanence and Acceptance of Loss</b>: Leo discusses the importance of valuing life's impermanence, emphasizing that our lives are fresh and exciting precisely because they are short. He proposes that we do not truly desire all of our desires to be satisfied, but rather enjoy the thrill of their transient nature. This understanding calls for the appreciation of loss as part of the cycle of life.
</li><li><b>Maximizing Creative Diversity</b>: He speaks about God's role in maximizing the creative diversity of life, highlighting that no single species, culture, or race should monopolize the planet as it would lead to the loss of life diversity. This speaks against ethnocentrism and ideologies like white supremacy that aim to preserve one culture or race, an aim which is impossible due to the inherent nature of impermanence.
</li><li><b>Impermanence and Appreciation of Life</b>: Leo underscores that one's ability to appreciate life is due to its impermanence, highlighting the need to appreciate the short-term nature of experiences, including relationships, entertainment, and wealth. 
</li><li><b>Impermanence and the Cycle of Life</b>: Leo touches on the importance of death as part of the cycle of life, creating room for new life to arise. This understanding allows for an appreciation of the transient nature of all things and evokes a sense of melancholy that arises from witnessing the fleeting beauty of life. 
</li><li><b>Dealing with Loss</b>: Leo shares a personal experience about dealing with his pet's loss and the importance of developing a healthy way to cope with loss. He introduces the concept of "Moe no no owari," which is about feeling saddened yet appreciative of life's transient nature.
</li><li><b>Appreciating Life's Journey and Experiences</b>: Leo recalls his pet's life and the multitude of experiences she had, emphasizing that despite her passing, her life was not cut short but full and meaningful. He suggests that attachment to the desire for more time could lead to suffering, encouraging instead a healthy acceptance and melancholy in coping with such situations.
</li><li><b>The Impermanence of Aspects in Life</b>: He explores the universality of impermanence, highlighting that everything from family, wealth, health, relationships, cultures, species, scientific theories to the universe, will eventually fade, change, or die. This understanding indicates that trying to cling to or defend certain aspects of life, even religious beliefs or spiritual teachings, can lead to corruption and deviation from their original essence.
</li><li><b>The Costs of Birth and Death</b>: Leo elucidates that life and death, as dualities, are both cost and consequence of one another, remarking that the attempt to cling to certain states or forms is a denial of this inherent process of life and leads to suffering.
</li><li><b>False Preservation of Spirituality</b>: The attempt to codify or preserve teachings from spiritual gurus through strict memorization is criticized. Leo argues that this approach could lead to distortion and misinterpretation in the long run, deviating the teachings from their original intent.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Personal Experience</b>: Emphasizing spirituality, language, and even religions as evolving entities, Leo encourages viewers to perceive truth not as a fixed tradition but as derived from personal experience in the ebb and flow of the present moment. He further advises observing impermanence in daily life and practicing detachment from attachments. 
</li><li><b>Impermanence in Business and Language</b>: Referencing the demise of corporations like Kodak, Polaroid, and Blockbuster who failed to adapt to change, Leo highlights the destructiveness of clinging to outdated business models and practices. Similarly, he disputes the desire to preserve a language as it is, citing the evolution of the English language as a natural process. 
</li><li><b>Cessation of Harmful Businesses</b>: Leo criticizes cigarette companies for continuing their trade despite proven health risks. He suggests that these corporations must acknowledge the impermanence of technological and societal trends and evolve towards creating healthier alternatives.
</li><li><b>Misinterpretation of Death and Identity</b>: Most people attach their fears and identities to the idea of death. However, Leo explains that death is not an end to existence but merely a change of form. As infinite shapeshifters, we continually evolve and adapt, thus death is a necessary process in evolution. Clinging to our current form leads to fear of this transition.
</li><li><b>Perception of Immortality</b>: Leo criticizes attempts at achieving immortality through technology or biological means. Instead, he asserts that immortality can be achieved through spirituality, by surrendering everything and realizing one's true nature as a shapeshifter.
</li><li><b>The Dual Nature of Impermanence</b>: While the impermanence of good things in life is disappointing, the impermanence of bad things offers relief. Suffering is finite, and no one can remain in a state of unconsciousness forever. All beings are bound to awake and return to God, their true nature  eventually.
</li><li><b>Creation of Suffering</b>: It is attachment to things in life that creates suffering and disappointment. Transcending this attachment is a path to liberation taught by all major spiritual philosophies worldwide.
</li><li><b>Misidentification of Self</b>: The mistake lies in identifying ourselves as human beings. Our true identity is that of infinite shapeshifters. When we cling to one form, we suffer because it goes against our true nature. Our human identity is temporary and changing, while our identity as shapeshifters is the only permanent thing.
</li><li><b>Connection of Permanence and Impermanence</b>: The concepts of permanence and impermanence, though seemingly paradoxical, eventually converge to illustrate that everything is interconnected. Underlying this is the concept of oneness and the interconnectedness of all parts of reality.
</li><li><b>Practice of Observing Impermanence</b>: Leo encourages listeners to observe impermanence in their own lives and practice letting go of attachments. This will involve deeply observing the changes in experiences and emotions, appreciating moments of existence, and learning to embrace the flow of life.
</li><li><b>Understanding Maya and Nirvana</b>: There is often a misunderstanding that the physical world (Maya/Samsara) and the formless, true self (Nirvana) are distinct entities. However, true enlightenment is the realization that these two aspects are identical. Initial awakenings often involve stepping from form into formlessness, creating a duality between the two. To become fully enlightened, one must come to understand that this distinction is merely an imaginary construct, ultimately uniting the two.
</li><li><b>Criticisms of Borrowing Concepts from Buddhism</b>: Leo argues that despite perceived similarities, his teachings are not simply reiterations of Buddhist principles. While he acknowledges the value of various religious and spiritual traditions, he emphasizes that important philosophies are derived independently across cultures and eras. This suggests that these principles of truth are universal and not confined to any one tradition. 
</li><li><b>Truth Cannot Be a Tradition</b>: Leo asserts that truth must be derived from the present moment rather than relying on past or traditional knowledge. Just as mathematical proofs must be reasoned through by each new generation, spiritual and philosophical truths must be rediscoved and reconsidered by each individual.
</li><li><b>Usage of Impermanence</b>: To fully understand impermanence, one must observed it in their daily life, rather than simply acknowledging it intellectually. By recognizing the transient nature of experiences and emotions, one can learn to let go and reduce suffering. This process involves actively observing impermanence at a micro level every day and surrendering attachments over time.
</li><li><b>Impermanence as Meditation</b>: Leo recommends practicing the observation of impermanence daily, akin to meditation. He encourages noticing the constant change of personal experiences and emotions, and to be mindful of attempts to cling to particular states. Letting go of the urge to prolong pleasurable experiences and instead learning to appreciate the fleeting nature of such moments is emphasized. 
</li><li><b>Appreciating Impermanence</b>: By actively releasing attachments and ceasing efforts to prolong pleasure, one can learn to appreciate the fleeting nature of experiences, enhancing the enjoyment of seemingly mundane events. Leo suggests that this allows for the appreciation of impermanence to flourish and the quality of life to improve.
</li><li><b>Value of Impermanence</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of recognizing and valuing the impermanence of tiny moments in everyday life. He suggests exercises such as wearing a wristband and remembering to observe the fleeting nature of every moment when it catches your eye. This practice, Gura asserts, will make every moment feel more special, and is a form of achieving true happiness. 
</li><li><b>Understanding True Spirituality</b>: Gura counters the popular misconception that spirituality involves positive thinking and escapism. Rather, true spirituality, according to him, involves confronting and accepting the impermanence of life. By training oneself to observe and let go rather than cling, one can learn to appreciate the flow of life. 
</li><li><b>Criticism of Ray Kurzweil's Idea of Immortality</b>: Gura criticizes the notion of achieving technological immortality, as espoused by futurist Ray Kurzweil, wherein the brain could be uploaded onto a computer to achieve eternal life. He calls this a "ridiculous idea" and a form of wishful thinking, and suggests that real immortality is available through the practice of spirituality instead.
</li><li><b>Advocacy of Deep Thinking</b>: Gura articulates the importance of engaging in deep, philosophical thinking about one's life and existence. He believes that investing time in profound contemplation is not wasteful, but rather adds depth to one's experience of life.
</li><li><b>Criticism of Mainstream Institutions</b>: Gura criticizes mainstream news, science, religion, and other spiritual schools for favoring a narrow interpretation of reality and overlooking its full depth and breadth. He suggests that this content and discussions we engage in offer a deeper understanding of life unavailable from most other sources.   
</li><li><b>Personal Reflections on Journey</b>: Gura reflects on his journey of sharing his insights and ideas, highlighting the depth and quality of the content he offers, despite being able to share only a fraction of what he would like to. He acknowledges that understanding the depth of his message and seeing its payoff might take years for the listeners.
</li><li><b>Encouragement of Listener Engagement</b>: Gura encourages his listeners to actively engage with his content, inviting them to visit his website, Actualized.org, for additional insights, check his blog post, life purpose course and forum. 
</li><li><b>Value in Depth of Life</b>: Lastly, Gura concludes by expressing that depth in life is what most people lack and by questioning reality at deeper levels, one can achieve a fulfilling life. He assures listeners that their time spend understanding the depth of life is an investment in the future fruitfulness of their lives.
