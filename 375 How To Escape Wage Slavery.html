            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/yIsbVpBJ110' target='_blank'>How To Escape Wage Slavery</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Definition of wage slavery</b>: Wage slavery refers to undertaking laborious work that you don't find meaningful, simply to pay the bills and afford basic necessities. This situation obstructs personal and spiritual development, limits individuals from contributing meaningfully and creatively to society, and forces them to help others climb the societal pyramid, often through exploitative means.
</li><li><b>Effects of wage slavery</b>: Wage slaves do not have the time for personal pursuits such as meditation, self-care, travel, and personal development as their primary focus becomes self-preservation. Oftentimes, they unknowingly contribute to societal evils by working for corporations that exploit, harm or misinform others. 
</li><li><b>Understanding the societal pyramid scheme</b>: Our society has evolved from tribes enslaving other tribes and consolidating power, to a structure where modern individuals serve their nations. Although physical slavery has been outlawed in many societies, forms of enslavement persist where individuals have limited power and wealth compared to ruling elites. 
</li><li><b>Power dynamics in society</b>: Society operates on a battle for power, where those with more power amass even more, resulting in power equating to wealth. The desire to survive and maximize personal resources is a key driver of these dynamics, leading to a skewed playing field in favor of the powerful.
</li><li><b>Unconscious contribution to societal dysfunction</b>: Most individuals are unconscious contributors to societal evils, exploiting and causing harm because of their need to survive. This happens in various professions including programming, healthcare, customer service, and more, where employees unknowingly further the agenda of their superiors, often at the expense of the public good. 
</li><li><b>Denial and responsibility</b>: Many people deny their participation in societal ills due to a feeling of disempowerment. They often believe that they can't control the harmful consequences of their work, which Leo argues is a result of them feeling enslaved and thus shrugging off their responsibility. 
</li><li><b>Starting point for change</b>: The starting point for change is understanding the depth of the societal problem. Once people acknowledge the reality of their enslavement, they can work towards regaining control and stopping the unconsciously harmful work they partake in.
</li><li><b>Ego and the insatiable hunger for wealth</b>: Despite having accumulated great wealth, the ego never feels satisfied or secure. It constantly desires more, even at the cost of exploiting others. Leo emphasizes that the feeling of insecurity or survival threat doesn't decrease with the accumulation of wealth or power; for instance, a billionaire is just as concerned about the survival of his billion-dollar company as a common man is about paying his electricity bill.
</li><li><b>Government and societal structure</b>: Government controls individuals in society, but this control isn't a product of a deliberate conspiracy; it mostly happens unconsciously. Societies are intentionally designed to have unequal power distribution, with those at the top seeking to maintain the status quo and ensure their survival. 
</li><li><b>Culture and education system's role in maintaining status quo</b>: The education system and cultural norms play a crucial role in maintaining societal structures. They feed us certain ideas and beliefs as we grow up, constituting our perception of 'reality' and making us defenders of the status quo. This programming is often so deep-rooted that it resists change, even if it goes against the individual's survival agenda. 
</li><li><b>Wealth as a power disparity</b>: Wealth is not about being rich in absolute terms but is relative and based on pressuring others into doing things for you without having to reciprocate. Its about having advantageous power disparities which allow individuals to exploit others within the societal system. 
</li><li><b>The pyramid scheme of society and accumulation of wealth</b>: The society operates on a pyramid structure where only a few can get to the top, not everyone. Wealth is often accumulated by exploiting and manipulating others, disempowering people, rigging laws, and being in close proximity to existing sources of wealth. Industries like finance, politics, defense, healthcare, law, entertainment, and tech act as wealth springs where affluent people typically originate from.
</li><li><b>Climbing the corporate ladder</b>: As one ascends the corporate ladder, they inherently rise to the top of the societal pyramid, which increases the power disparity between them and lower-level employees, translating into wealthier positions. This exploitation is baked into the system, which provides plausible deniability and lets people sleep at night with a clear conscience.
</li><li><b>Power Dynamics within Society</b>: Society operates in a pyramid structure where power and wealth are concentrated at the top. Wealth, typically generated through manipulation of this structure, not independent creativity, is also controlled and often passes down among relatives, friends, and syndicate members.
</li><li><b>Syndicates in Every Economy Field</b>: Syndicates are small networks formed by top individuals in various economic fields to gather and share insider knowledge, trade secrets, and schemes for personal advancement and collective exploitation of those left out. These syndicates rig the game, creating a skewed playground against newcomers.
</li><li><b>Denial of Pyramid Structure</b>: Most people are oblivious to these dynamics, being in denial about the pyramid even when it's explained. Those at the top deny the skewed structure, associating their position with their own hard work and initiative, ignoring their privileges and advantages like good genetics, positive upbringing, and social connections.
</li><li><b>Wealth from Exploitation</b>: Considerable wealth is generated from manipulating government legislations and subsidies, obtaining government contracts, and exploiting social connections. Successful people often underestimate their privilege and good fortune while overvaluing their hard work and intelligence.
</li><li><b>Status Quo and Systemic Exploitation</b>: The pyramid structure is accepted as the status quo, with complacency leading to acceptance. These patterns of exploitation extend to global power dynamics, with first-world nations often exploiting third-world countries, maintaining their wealth and power while whitewashing their actions.
</li><li><b>American exceptionalism</b>: Gura critiques how citizens often gloss over the harms and downfalls of their home countries, using America as an example. He implies such attitudes represent a form of ego-driven denial about the less savory aspects of their nations histories and current practices. 
</li><li><b>Society as a dysfunctional family</b>: Using the analogy of family dysfunction, where abuse is frequently denied by all involved parties, Gura explains that societies likewise often deny systemic problems, as acknowledging them would require difficult and painful adjustments.
</li><li><b>Political ideologies as justifications</b>: He asserts that ideologies like conservatism and libertarianism are created as a way of justifying and preserving societal inequalities, typically by those who are comfortably in the middle or higher sections of the pyramid and have not experienced the harsh reality of being at the bottom.
</li><li><b>Clarification of intent</b>: Gura clarifies that his critique is not an anti-capitalist rant, rather, his aim is to expose the realities of the societal pyramid of power and wealth that exists regardless of political systems. So, his end goal is not to ignite political action, but to promote individual responsibility and conscious change.
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness of the system</b>: Leo emphasizes the interconnectedness of the economy, labor, and life. He argues that even seemingly innocent work can indirectly contribute to harmful practices, as all parts of the system are deeply intertwined.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of survival realities</b>: Gura points out that modern societies simplified survival to a paycheck, which hides the possible unethical practices carried out to ensure survival. He suggests the necessity of acknowledging these realities, as understanding the full depth of the problem pierces societal denial and can stimulate true change.
</li><li><b>Inevitability of the societal pyramid</b>: Leo asserts that even attempts to remove oneself from the societal pyramid by joining monasteries or ashrams, or by obtaining significant wealth, simply puts one in different parts of the pyramid. He argues that unless one lives entirely independently, the societal system and its pyramid are all-encompassing and unavoidable.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of Societal Structure</b>: The discourse emphasizes the acknowledgement of society as a pyramid structure that has existed for thousands of years and will persist. It concludes that it would be productive for individuals to accept this structure and take responsibility for their roles in it.
</li><li><b>Schooling and Wage Slavery</b>: The video talks about how schooling and college education, if not approached with intent and strategic planning, are likely to groom individuals into becoming "wage slaves" - having to do jobs that might not resonate with their passions, but that they have to do to survive and pay their bills.
</li><li><b>Wasting Youth and How to Avoid it</b>: The video admonishes the careless spending of youth on unproductive activities and urges for strategic skill development, purpose identification, and independent thinking during these formative years. 
</li><li><b>Options for Escaping Wage Slavery</b>: Leo provides two options to escape wage slavery - the first involves working hard with clear vision and intent, and providing significant value to society. The second one involves exploiting and manipulating the system to reach the top of the societal pyramid.
</li><li><b>Problems with Second Approach of Escaping Wage Slavery</b>: There are potential ethical and personal fulfillment issues highlighted with the second option - as it involves exploitation, manipulation, and potentially harming a lot of people. There is a suggestion to opt for the first method as it also gives the person the satisfaction of contributing valuable services and products to humanity.
</li><li><b>Taking Responsibility and Developing a Vision</b>: Leo advises listeners to take full responsibility for their lives, which is vital to escape wage slavery. He underlines the importance of having a clear and compelling vision to guide one over several years. Determining whether one wants to be a follower or a leader is also a significant decision, with the latter requiring extra responsibilities, self-trust, independence and a unique vision.
</li><li><b>Becoming a Leader</b>: He further elaborates on the role of a leader, which not only includes leading oneself but also others around one. Leaders need to take on extra responsibilities, work harder, have a better vision than everyone else and develop self-trust. He recommends his other video on leadership for more details about being a good leader.
</li><li><b>Becoming a Massive Value Provider</b>: Manoeuvring oneself into a position to provide disproportionate value compared to others is mentioned as a strategy to escape wage slavery. Meaningful value provision is associated with the ability to offer creative, strategic and system designer solutions to serious societal problems.
</li><li><b>Creativity and Vision to Escape Wage Slavery</b>: The video suggests focusing on developing skills that allow to provide value and creative solutions to societal problems. It emphasizes that most individuals in society provide little value, creating an opportunity for those who can provide more than the average person. This involves high-level thinking, creativity, strategic planning, and a systems-thinking approach to problem-solving. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Training, Education and Learning</b>: Leo highlights the significance of obtaining specialized training and education aligning with one's purpose and chosen field. He notes that a general education is often not enough to become a massive value contributor and emphasizes the need for creativity, originality and unique solutions.
</li><li><b>The importance of solving serious problems</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that dealing with grave problems, either for individuals or society, is a fundamental part of providing substantial value. This does not always mean finding solutions to life-threatening issues, but can also extend to areas like music and entertainment, where individuals ease people's misery by providing beauty and joy.
</li><li><b>Value provision through mastery and training</b>: To become a substantial value provider, one requires a clear vision, focused efforts, and expertise in their chosen field. Acquiring such mastery typically necessitates 3-5 years of focused training and practice.
</li><li><b>School education vs. targeted, field-specific education</b>: Gura acknowledges that school and college education can provide a broad understanding of subjects, but often fails to create individuals who can offer significant societal value. To actually address specific problems and provide tangible value, one needs specialized knowledge and skills, often beyond whats gained through traditional education.
</li><li><b>Finding one's life purpose</b>: According to Gura, one's life purpose is unique and specific to each individual. To figure it out, one needs personal introspection rather than adopting or mimicking someone else's life path. It is also noted that a clear life purpose fuels your journey to acquiring knowledge and providing substantial value.
</li><li><b>The role of creativity</b>: Gura stresses the need for originality when providing value to society. Similar to evolution, society and technology are constantly changing, and therefore, individuals need to come up with original and creative solutions to stay relevant and valuable. It's pointed out that the origin of this creative value often forms the basis for high remuneration.
</li><li><b>The importance of Leadership</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the crucial role of leadership in escaping wage slavery. He advocates for individuals to take their power back and stop relying on others for guidance. Instead, he encourages them to become leaders themselves, coming up with unique and original ways to lead others and push society forward.
</li><li><b>Becoming a conscious creator</b>: Gura points out that becoming a conscious creator puts individuals in a position to contribute significantly to societal improvement. Harnessing your creative potential can lead to a sense of personal fulfillment and vast enjoyment in life.
</li><li><b>Studying entrepreneurship, marketing, and sales</b>: Gura suggests that mastering the skills of entrepreneurship, marketing, and sales can substantially aid in escaping wage slavery. He underscores the abundance of resources available to gain these skills.
</li><li><b>Finding a niche in the world</b>: Gura explains the importance of finding a unique career niche to distinguish oneself from the crowd. He emphasizes that individuals must invest time in extensive research and introspection to discover their unique role in the world.
</li><li><b>Society and Wage Slavery</b>: Despite the detailed plan to escape wage slavery, Leo Gura emphasizes not everyone can escape it due to the pyramid scheme society operates on. Many won't mobilize themselves to actualize this, choosing to remain in their current lifestyle instead. Living this 'sheep-like' existence might be satisfactory for some, depending on their personal temperaments and life circumstances.
</li><li><b>Considering Personal Goals and Values</b>: Gura recommends that individuals set a goal to escape wage slavery as this promotes personal development and conscious living. Achieving financial independence is of utmost importance, enabling more time, freedom, and vitality for pursuing visions and values. Escaping wage slavery allows opportunities for self-actualization, self-education, and spirituality.
</li><li><b>Financial Independence Aligned with Life Purpose</b>: Leo suggests aligning financial independence with your life purpose. This involves focusing on your personal development and offering value to others by helping advance mankind in meaningful ways. Despite the challenges this plan entails, going through the process can be truly rewarding.
</li><li><b>Taking Full Responsibility</b>: Leo stresses taking full responsibility for personal development and upliftment. Despite societal limitations, he emphasizes that we are slaves only to our minds, which we can change. Whether wage slavery is right for everyone is a matter of personal preference and varies depending on individual temperaments and values.
</li><li><b>Age and Financial Independence</b>: Despite the age one is at, whether younger or older, it's always possible to work towards financial independence. It does, however, require creating a clear plan and vision, committing to it, and viewing it as a valuable pursuit. 
</li><li><b>Achieving Goals while Escaping Wage Slavery</b>: Leo mentions that escaping wage slavery allows individuals to have more time to delve deeply into personal development, self-education, and spirituality. It's important not to fret about past mistakes but to look forward and establish a clear path and plan for achieving personal goals. Escaping wage slavery thus opens up opportunities for achieving personal fulfillment and contributing positively to society.
</li><li><b>Aligning Work with Life Purpose</b>: Leo Gura suggests that one should aim to offer significant value to society, helping to elevate humanity in a meaningful way. The work you do should align with your life purpose. The goal is to have such a significant impact that others would deeply miss your contributions if you were gone.
</li><li><b>Value Others See In You</b>: The reason people value you is because of what you offer them. It's a utilitarian concept; if you stop providing value, people stop caring. This point re-emphasizes the need to be a value provider to others.
</li><li><b>Brace for Hard Work And Challenges</b>: Pursuing your passion to escape wage slavery involves working hard, feeling lonely, experiencing suffering, confusion, and feeling stuck sometimes. Despite the challenges, the aim is to work hard for a few years and eventually gain freedom to pursue personal interests, family time, etc.
</li><li><b>The Pyramid Structure</b>: Leo explains that the pyramid structure of society is a wise structure from nature. This structure allows individuals who are willing to take up leadership to rise and lead those who prefer to be followers.
</li><li><b>Life Purpose Course</b>: Leo endorses his Life Purpose Course, which he developed to help people figure out their values and life purpose. The course is not a quick route to richness but instead, a slow scheme rooted in working principles. 
</li><li><b>Importance of a Conscious Way of Making a Living</b>: Despite the importance of enlightenment and spirituality, it is crucial to systematically create an income source. This approach not only contributes to personal satisfaction but also contributes to the betterment of society.
</li><li><b>Holistic Approach to Life</b>: Actualized.org, created by Leo, adopts a holistic approach to life. It discusses not just enlightenment or spirituality, but also topics like relationships, health, career, nutrition, etc. He emphasizes that all these pieces fit together to create an amazing life.
