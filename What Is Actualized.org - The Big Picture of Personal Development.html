[Music] what is actualized.org such a gargantuan question i don't
even know where to begin but i guess i could
summarize it as this actualize.org is a catalog for those
of you who are new it's a catalog of the
most powerful concepts that i have pursued and studied and
discovered in my own life in order to make sense
of what life and reality are and how to live
the best life possible it's focused specifically on the biggest
picture perspective what you'll find out there if you're getting
into self-help and self-improvement advice this is a giant field
with many sub-fields and mostly what you get within all
these different subfields are narrow specialists who give you a
little bit of advice about this narrow region of your
life or that narrow region of your life whether it's
business advice relationship advice family advice career advice emotional advice
advice about your addiction problems or your weight problems or
your money problems or whatever else and don't get me
wrong all of that is very useful and good but
as i entered into self-help originally just for myself not
as a teacher or as a coach or as some
guru but just for my own self when i got
into it maybe 15 years ago when i first discovered
it maybe when i first picked up my first tony
robbins book it was great but the problem that i
had from the very beginning is that it wasn't holistic
enough it didn't really give me the understanding the depth
was lacking nobody brought all the different puzzle pieces together
into one cohesive image nobody really wanted to understand reality
for reality's sake they were just providing advice for how
to satisfy some personal petty need like money or sex
or love or whatever and those are fine to satisfy
those but i wanted something more and as i started
reading all these different books and all these learning from
all these different teachers taking courses and workshops and so
on i started encountering various profound concepts almost like principles
by which one could orient his or her life and
i started making notes and writing these down and i
became very enthusiastic about creating a catalog of all of
these and i was amazed that such a catalog basically
didn't exist anywhere online and so my mission my project
became to create this catalog and so that's what actualize.org
is in a nutshell it's this catalog of hundreds of
episodes eventually it's probably going to be thousands of episodes
dealing with important principles and concepts for how to live
the good life and how to understand how to live
the good life we cover a very broad range of
subtopics and subfields we cover basic self-improvement advice we cover
some relationship advice we cover some health advice we do
a lot of psychological work we cover various fields within
psychology developmental psychology i focus a lot on but we
also look into positive psychology we take from psychoanalysis and
from various therapies within psychology that have been developed we
take and pull uh useful nuggets from that we're basically
pulling useful nuggets from from anywhere that we can find
we pull from philosophy we pull from epistemology from metaphysics
from science from history from sociology from anthropology from systems
theory and systems thinking and uh and basically anything else
that is useful to our ultimate objective which is what
is reality how do i live the good life if
i've got this one life which conventionally speaking is what
we've got how do you know what to do with
it see we both grow broad but we also go
deep at the same time breadth times depth actually is
called scope so the scope of actualize.org is beyond anything
that you'll find anywhere out there as far as these
kinds of teachings most teachers either have a lot of
depth but very narrow breadth or are very broad a
lot of depth but uh not very deep and we're
trying to do both at the same time here so
the core thing you have to understand is that when
you were born you were born into a society which
is still in the dark ages right now we fancy
ourselves as these advanced beings living in the 21st century
who have all this fancy technology and know so much
about reality we basically believe we have reality all figured
out except for a few minor details that's the general
notion that is fed to you by society in school
in university and just through mainstream media and elsewhere you
just basically are indoctrinated in with this uh it's not
even a belief per se it's just a very it's
just sort of a background assumption that uh that that
grounds your sense of reality and so we're living in
the dark ages though we're not that advanced this is
still the dark ages we know so little about reality
we know less than one percent about reality less than
one percent about how consciousness works how the human mind
works how to live the good life we know so
little there's still so much more to discover we know
so little about how to structure our societies and our
economies society right now as good as it might seem
for some of you uh it's very brutal and cruel
for many others and is filled with deep deep deep
ignorance and close mindedness and misunderstanding so that's what we're
tackling here one of the core things that will transform
your whole life is understanding that the way that most
people live their life all of your friends family members
teachers everyone you basically know that they're living life at
one percent of their capacity and they will never go
beyond maybe two or three percent and that's with assuming
they will be exceptional and do some basic self-help work
which most people won't even do that see so there
is there is a level of depth to life that
you can live that is beyond anything that any human
has ever taught you or led you to believe is
possible these levels are so profound and so amazing that
we could call them superhuman these are states and levels
of consciousness and ways of embodying consciousness and living life
that are beyond the human but this is not conventionally
given to you as a possibility when you're growing up
when you're growing up your culture indoctrinates you into basically
accepting all the limitations and standards and norms of whatever
culture you grew up in some are you are in
more developed countries others of you are in less developed
countries but even in the most developed countries the standards
are still extremely low and so there's a sort of
an artificial glass ceiling that's created on your potential as
a human because see when you're born here's what you've
got to understand you don't know anything about life you
don't know what reality is and basically you still don't
other than that you think you do because of all
the stuff they taught you in school but really you
don't and you didn't come with an instruction manual and
in a sense that's what actualize that org is attempting
to do is to create an instruction manual for life
and for reality but it's much more tricky than you
would ever imagine because it's not just some simple one
two three step procedure that can be laid out in
a linear order everybody just reads the manual goes through
you know the first hundred pages and just follows the
steps then gets a certain result it's way more complicated
than that if you think about it you and i
us humans we are the most advanced bio machines that
have ever lived on this planet as far as we
know over the last four billion years we have instruction
manuals that come with our refrigerators and our washing machines
and our computers but nobody gave us an instruction manual
for how to operate this most sophisticated biomechanical device on
the planet can you see how that might be a
problem think of all the problems you can run into
with your computer for example if you don't know how
to operate it but how much more complex is your
brain your mind your psychology and your body than uh
even the most advanced super computers way beyond way beyond
anything a computer can do this thing is doing every
single minute of your life so the real question is
when you're born into this life don't assume you understand
life or reality and don't look to others for answers
about how to get the mediocre results that they're getting
because everybody around you is basically getting mediocre results in
their life even if they're successful they're still getting mediocre
results in terms of their internal mood emotional states and
their consciousness and their psychology but the real question here
is it's a meta question that you ask you don't
start off life by saying okay well let me just
go become a computer programmer or let me become a
doctor or let me become an engineer or let me
go get married or let me have a bunch of
sex or let me get a bunch of money become
a businessman on wall street these are all the wrong
questions the first question the most fundamental question you have
to ask is why am i here what's going on
in the biggest possible picture perspective what's worthwhile doing and
what isn't what are the traps and what am i
how does my machine work if i think of myself
as a machine how do i work what makes me
tick and so most of your energy should be devoted
not externally towards running around and doing crazy stuff in
the world and having fun and entertainment and going to
parties and getting into relationships and falling in love no
all of that is distraction the true core of life
if you want to live a good life is to
turn your gaze inwards and to ask deep penetrating questions
about how to live life and how your machine works
and basically what i've discovered throughout my 15-year journey or
so through self-help and spirituality is that all of our
problems stem fundamentally from a lack of mastery of this
machine and specifically of the mind the mind the mind
its power is very much underappreciated and underestimated by most
people because we live under what's known as the materialist
paradigm where we tend to believe that we're living in
a material objective three-dimensional world that exists independent of our
minds and that our minds play some role within reality
but a minor role basically and that there's not very
much that the mind can do to change reality this
is dead wrong you couldn't be more wrong this is
one of the most pernicious assumptions and latent beliefs that
people hold that creates that glass ceiling beyond which they
can never grow beyond maybe one or two or three
percent of their true potential as a human you have
to start to see that the way that everybody around
you is living their life including your family members brothers
and sisters and parents your friends your teachers your co-workers
your bosses the celebrities that you see on television the
youtubers that you admire on youtube and elsewhere instagram models
and so forth that this this is this is not
how to live life this is all idiocy these people
are not truly tapping into the potential of a human
in living life and ultimately what do you want in
life what is it you want you see because we
assume that well you know leo it's studying the outer
world that's really challenging like studying science is hard studying
math is hard you know exploring the moon and mars
outer planets in the solar system this is difficult stuff
but don't we already know like what we want and
who we are this is these sorts of questions what
what use can come from these sorts of questions they
seem very abstract and philosophical and kind of fluffy hairy
fairy not very tangible you couldn't be more wrong you
have no idea what you are on every level you
don't know yourself at the physical level at the psychological
level at the emotional level at the spiritual level you
don't really understand yourself and of course if you think
about it why would you you were born into this
life but you don't know how you were born you
don't really know where you came from or why you
appeared you just mysteriously appeared out of nowhere one day
here you are society gave you some stories about where
you came from and how you got here and how
it's all normal and there's nothing weird and mysterious going
on and it's all not very special but life is
very very special if you just take a moment to
really reflect upon it in in solitude life is very
special it's very mysterious it's not quite clear how you
got here it's not clear where you're going and how
to get there and where you're going to go in
the ultimate end after you die so the key is
to turn your attention inwards and to start to question
how your mind influences how you see reality your mind
is what generates all of your results in life now
we're going to be talking about multiple levels of development
here we're going to be talking about some advanced potential
for spiritual stuff so when i'm talking about the ultimate
potentials i'm talking about advanced spirituality but even before we
get to that there are earlier levels of just self-improvement
and self-actualization which are just more simple and down-to-earth and
more practical and they can be just something as simple
as learning how to take care of yourself financially stop
being a wage slave becoming financially independent or dealing with
your creative anxiety if you're an artist so you can
do better art or dealing with some emotional attachments that
you have so you can have nicer relationships or getting
over certain fears that you have about starting a business
or whatever this is all this is all great stuff
this is where you start but but notice no matter
what level you're at it's your mind that is the
gatekeeper because it's through your mind that you interact with
all of reality nothing comes to you other than through
your mind everything all the people you interact with all
the all the stuff you learn whether you're learning science
or history that's coming through your own mind your mind
is interpreting that stuff it's not just receiving raw facts
and objective data from the world you're constantly interpreting making
meanings out of it throwing away and ignoring things filtering
stuff out coloring things with your own biases and putting
your intentions and goals and objectives on certain things pursuing
certain things while avoiding other things this is all the
work of your mind so if you've been living an
ordinary mediocre life up to this point getting rather mediocre
results and suffering for it and the suffering could look
like depression anxiety a lack of results it could look
like sexual frustration it could look like wage slavery it
could look like being stuck at your job and hating
it it could look like motivational problems health problems emotional
problems addictions uh a feeling of laziness and listless about
life a lack of passion for life all of this
you know how you develop passion for life by taking
control of yourself and making yourself into a self-help project
that's how you become passionate about life that's the work
we're doing here there's a lot to this work this
is a multi-decades-long project this is not something you do
for a few years to get a quick result and
then you stop this is something you do for the
rest of your life in fact this is what gives
life its zest and its juice without this life becomes
utilitarian at some point once you get your girlfriend or
your boyfriend or your husband or your wife or your
car or your house or your business or whatever then
life just becomes about maintaining that it becomes a grind
and then that itself becomes a form of depression and
suicidal thoughts and feeling of being trapped and frustrated and
all that because you're living life at this very utilitarian
survival level where you're just surviving like an animal that
needs to stop you need to pursue life beyond survival
that doesn't mean that you ignore survival needs you have
survival needs many of them sexual ones financial ones emotional
ones material ones by all means those need to be
intelligently satisfied within reason and limits but uh but your
eye needs to be on the prize the prize of
life is living beyond survival it's living for something deeper
connecting with life itself on an emotional intuitive spiritual level
that's what makes life satisfying now make sure you don't
make this mistake it might sound like at this point
well leo how is this different from religion or from
some other cult ideology it's very different because what i'm
proposing here and actualize that org from the very beginning
was conceived on non-dogmatic non-ideological grounds from the very beginning
of this project i understood the dangers the epistemological dangers
the very deep dangers of turning this sort of work
into mindless debating and arguing about theoretical notions and beliefs
systems getting locked into various kinds of belief systems and
just speculating about things that i might want reality to
be like and so forth that's not what i'm proposing
that's not what this project is this project is a
collection catalog like i said of of concepts and principles
that you can use to guide your life insights that
you can yourself have everything that i talk about can
be directly validated by you and if it can't then
you shouldn't believe it and then it isn't true so
truth is not based on what i say truth is
not based on you having faith in the things that
i propose truth is not based on the logic of
what i say truth is not based on how persuasive
i am truth is not based on how many subscribers
i have how many clicks i get how popular i
get what kind of tv shows i get on what
kind of interviews i do and all that truth has
nothing to do with that the truth of the things
i say are in the ideas themselves and in fact
if you make this work about me this is a
problem this work is not about me i am just
a vehicle i am an imperfect flawed underdeveloped vehicle that
is delivering truths insights and principles and understandings that are
of the universe they are not coming from me as
a individual human they are coming through me and i'm
just one medium to express these to you and of
course if i can tap into these insights and have
these realizations and share them with you that means the
source that i got them from you can go to
that source directly and get them yourself and in fact
this is imperative that you do so everything i talk
about must be derived for yourself you must validate everything
i say because one of the core problems core epistemological
problems that we face when we are born into this
world is who do we believe there are so many
different people out there and groups trying to fill our
minds with ideas and philosophies and worldviews telling us what
to do how to think what's good what's wrong what's
evil what's worthwhile to pursue what's not worthwhile to pursue
you have christians and muslims and buddhists telling you different
things and hindus telling different things and jews telling you
different things then you have the scientists and atheists telling
you a different subset of things then you have your
agnostics telling you something else and then you have your
new agers telling you something else and there's a different
different categories of new agers that will all disagree and
tell you different things uh so who do you believe
who do you trust well of course the obvious answer
is you don't trust anybody you don't believe anybody you
have to undertake a serious commitment to investigate these matters
for yourself can you believe me no how would you
know that i'm not deluded that i'm not factually wrong
that i don't have a bias or some sort of
financial agenda to mislead you or whatever you have no
idea nor do you have such an idea about anybody
else that you learn from not from your professors not
from the doctors you go to see uh not from
the lawyers you consult with not from the scientists not
from the academics not from the other youtubers out there
not from tony robbins or any other self-help teacher you
just don't know that's where life starts you just don't
know the problem though is our mind is very much
like a computer it gets filled programmed with beliefs and
worldviews and assumptions from very very early on from before
you were even fully conscious of yourself as a human
you were already getting programmed this is crucial to understand
and to realize how just how significant this is because
you see now when you're trying to really change yourself
and to grow yourself and that's what we're talking about
here is growing ourselves and getting much better results in
our own life to achieve that what we need to
do is we need to focus on the internal workings
of the mind and we need to start to question
many of the programs that were installed in our mind
in the first let's say 20 years of our development
and upbringing in education because during these initial 20 years
we hardly questioned anything that we were programmed with we
didn't question our religion very much we didn't question science
very much we didn't question history very much we didn't
question nutrition very much we didn't question culture we didn't
question entertainment we just assumed that all this stuff is
just the way that the real reality is the world
is but actually all of these were interpretations very limited
very highly partial perspectives and and uh interpretations and beliefs
that were programmed into our minds which are now running
the one thing the gatekeeper for all of the results
that you get in life if you're struggling to attract
women if you're struggling to get the husband you want
if you're struggling with addiction problems whether it's porn or
drugs or smoking or alcohol or whatever food if you're
struggling with finances if you're struggling with your fitness and
your weight if you're struggling with your emotional state like
depression anxiety and these sorts of things if you're lonely
if you're suicidal if uh you're not happy with life
if you feel demotivated and lazy all the time if
you're stuck in a rut playing video games endlessly and
achieving nothing in your life the solution to that is
to change how your mind works that's the ultimate solution
to all of those problems the problem is not out
in the world if you have a financial problem yes
of course the problem is that you don't have money
in your bank account but this is way too short-sighted
a way a way to look at it the true
problem is how you're thinking about money how you're thinking
about your career and your job and your work that's
the deeper problem that needs to be addressed and so
one of the first principles i'll give you here one
of the most fundamental principles if you really want to
change the quality of your life if you're really fed
up with the with the bad results you've been getting
is you need to stop blaming and making excuses for
how all the external factors out there aren't aligned so
that you get the kind of good life that you
want you need to take responsibility and you need to
realize that actually it is you who is responsible for
perpetuating your suck situation and that the only one who
can turn it around is you this is both a
good thing and a bad thing it's a it's a
good thing because hey uh it means you can change
and you can get a quality life it's a bad
thing in that you're gonna have to it's gonna sting
your ego a bit to admit that you're not taking
enough responsibility so a lot of what we're doing here
as we're growing and developing to higher levels as we're
taking more and more responsibility for our life we stop
living it according to the standards and and norms of
everybody around us and uh we actually take control of
our life whereas before we were just living on autopilot
and one of the most important things you got to
take control of is your own mind you see because
your mind is keeping you stuck in patterns of thought
and emotions and behaviors which are perpetuating the precise kind
of mediocre results that you've been getting that have made
you so demotivated and lazy and depressed and frustrated with
life see your mind is like a computer i really
like this analogy we can take this analogy very far
once you realize that your mind is like a computer
you can appreciate that in a computer and we could
be talking about a desktop computer or a smartphone doesn't
really matter they're both computers uh your computer has multiple
layers of software in it at the surface layer it
just has your basic apps microsoft word or your facebook
app or something like that just the basic apps that
you use these are these are apps that your grandma
can use without too much thought basically the apps on
your iphone are designed for the for the dumbest people
on the planet so they can still click with their
fat fingers and still get something accomplished and buy something
that's how these apps are designed and i mean that's
fine that's good we want the apps to be simple
but but also i mean this is this is the
level of interaction at which most people are living their
life is it the level of using apps the apps
that and then for most people it's even worse than
that it's like they use the apps imagine if you
got a phone pre-installed with all the apps you're not
even you're so you're so irresponsible with your use of
this phone that you don't even know how to install
an app maybe your grandma is like this she doesn't
know how to and you got to do it for
her um but she but once you do install a
few apps for her and she learned you know through
some difficulty she learns how to use a couple of
her favorite apps okay she gets that down and then
she can use that and she can man it but
then you know we need to install a new app
she doesn't know how to do that or when something
goes wrong with the old app it needs to be
updated she doesn't know how to do that and she
clings to the old app even though there's newer ones
that came out that might be better because she doesn't
want to learn how to use the better ones so
this is exactly what's happening with most people around you
is that see their mind has come pre-installed with apps
as they were in the first 20 years of their
development all that stuff you learn in school through your
family through your church all the moral systems you learn
the worldview you learned all the basic science you did
in history all of that created a a core a
core foundation and then programmed you with uh with a
bunch of these uh preset default settings and really it
goes the problem is much worse than just not being
able to change an app on your phone the problem
is much deeper because you have your app layer below
that you have the operating system layer and then below
that you have something even more fundamental which is like
the bios the kernel of the operating system itself the
assembly language in which the operating system is written like
the very lowest level uh of hardware software interaction and
so of course most people have no idea how to
code a new app they couldn't design their own app
if they're live dependent upon it let alone how to
change the operating system recode the operating system let alone
how to actually get into the like binary code of
the bios and start to tinker around with with that
assembly language type of low-level code and so because of
this most people are going through life simply using the
stuff that their mind was programmed with not consciously programming
their mind with new software and then going even deeper
than that but but questioning the very foundation of their
whole world view which would be like questioning the operating
system rewriting the operating system because you see your operating
system was not something that you consciously designed for the
first 20 years of your life your operating system was
just what you were born with you know the instincts
that you were born with as an animal basically as
a homo sapien and then and then 20 years of
schooling and various kinds of education and programming that resulted
in some kind of operating system for you whatever that
is if you were in a christian environment you have
a christian operating system if you were a muslim you
have a muslim operating system if you were an atheist
you have an atheist operating system if you were raised
a scientist in a sort of a scientific household where
your parents were teachers or professors and they were very
secular then you have a secular operating system but all
of these are still operating systems they're not all the
same some of them are worse than others they have
different pros and cons and advantages and disadvantages some of
them are more conscious than other ones uh some of
them will limit you a lot more than other ones
but still basically all of them limit you severely even
if you were raised in a high quality like let's
say your parents were mit professors and they raised you
really well and read you all the good books and
raised you with a nice high quality secular modern world
view uh you're still gonna max out your human potential
at three percent whereas a christian they'll max it out
at half a percent or a muslim half a percent
all right um so don't go thinking that just because
you were raising a secular and you have a secular
worldview that this now somehow um means that you're you're
maxing yourself out no you're not um so you see
the problem here is that if you want to get
significantly better results than the average or what you've already
been getting for most of your life if you want
something something drastically better you can see how it's not
going to be enough just to rearrange the apps on
your phone that will get you some results but it's
not going to deeply fundamentally change the way your phone
operates if you want to really change how your phone
works upgrade your operating system or if you really want
to get fancy and you really want to do some
cool stuff with your phone that is going to be
blowing people's minds because see to blow people's minds you
just got to do something that their phone can't do
so how do you do that well you got to
root the phone jailbreak the phone and then you can
do some really fancy stuff i don't know if you've
ever looked into jail breaking phones i've done it a
few times on my older phones and it's it's an
interesting it's an interesting experience it's very technical it can
come with a lot of risks and problems um yeah
you could spend you can spend hours and hours pouring
through various kinds of technical doc documents and obscure esoterics
you know um programmers speak and jargon to try to
understand how to unlock your phone jailbreak your phone and
then how to install new operating systems and change various
kinds of settings that the manufacturer didn't want you to
change and that's really the heart of actualize.org that's what
makes it different than all the other common self-help teachings
that you'll find out there is that yes we talk
about rearranging the software on your phone sometimes i give
basic business advice basic financial advice basic career advice basic
love advice sex advice this sort of stuff i give
that advice sometimes but really i only give you that
advice to the extent that you need it in order
to get more interested in actually working on the operating
system and ultimately what we want to do is we
want to get down to the kernel level and start
to tinker around there because that's where the real change
happens that's how you become super human is by tinkering
around deep in there and understand this because we live
in the dark ages nobody almost nobody in society in
first of all they don't even know this is possible
this is outside the realm of their possibility space so
even doctors and scientists and self-help gurus generally don't know
that there's this possibility that's one problem uh the other
problem though is that they will actively discourage you from
even trying this they will fear monger about it they
will say it's impossible they will say it's crazy they
will say it's a cult they will say it's a
it's some new age stuff they will say it's just
wishful thinking they will say it's just philosophy and theory
it's just ideas after all what can an idea really
do to change your life don't underestimate the power of
even a single idea to change your life new ideas
will change your life but see most people are closed-minded
they're so close-minded and this is a feature of their
operating system you see how close-minded or open-minded you are
is a setting within your operating system the more closed
your your mind is the more locked down the entire
ecosystem is so a closed mind is sort of like
the apple the apple ecosystem where you can't you can't
do anything they don't allow you to do anything it's
not this like nice free open source sort of linux
operating system where you can screw around and change stuff
and branch you know do different branches in this and
that and change settings to your heart's content and you
know do whatever but of course you see there's a
trade-off here the apple ecosystem why is it so popular
because it's designed for morons the apple ecosystem is designed
for morons but that's actually what makes it so smooth
because there's very few settings you just do what apple
tells you to do it's a locked ecosystem you can't
really do anything else you got to go through their
app store jump through all their hoops and if you're
willing to do all that and you're just willing to
be a sheep then it's perfect for you because it's
convenient it's simple and that's how most people live their
life you can tell i have a anti-apple bias here
um at least as far as their software goes um
their their hardware is pretty good um although overpriced and
uh so so so we got that analogy going um
but but you see once you get on onto a
windows machine or a linux machine or something like that
you can you can really get in there sort of
tinker around the settings you can you can make it
work in in much more optimal ways for you because
you see apple when it designs its walled garden ecosystem
it's not designing it for your for the maximization of
your potential as a human it's designing it for the
maximization of apple and its profit margins likewise when society
is programming you with various ideas and worldviews and belief
systems it's not doing it with the objective of getting
you to superhuman levels of human development and satisfaction in
life when you're going to school or university they're not
interested in any of these things they're they're just they're
following some sort of cultural norms and objectives that are
good for society perhaps and even that is questionable um
but are not not good for you if you want
to reach the highest levels of of your potential as
a human and live the best life possible you see
nobody at school was interested in teaching you how to
live the best life possible isn't that amazing it's amazing
right i mean we're we're alive the one thing that
connects all human beings and really all all living beings
is that we're all alive so given that we're all
alive when the most obvious thing to be is to
start teaching a child how to live a good life
but of course that assumes that you know how to
how to live a good life that the parent does
or the teacher the professor they themselves have to know
it first which of course they don't we're living in
the dark ages they themselves don't know so it's not
some sort of evil conspiracy where government is trying to
keep you down it's just that they themselves don't know
you see the only way you can really teach somebody
how to reach the top superhuman levels of development is
by going there yourself which very few people have done
and the only way to go there is by jail
breaking your mind which very few people have done so
returning to the jailbreaking of the mind example you know
i've done this in the past it's it's tricky there's
dangers for example if you if you jailbreak your phone
in the wrong way you can you can actually break
your phone your phone will stop working entirely you'll have
to just throw it away it'll be useless or you
can make all sorts of mistakes and the trade-off is
that it's complicated it's hairy you can make mistakes you
can install stuff that's not right you can install a
virus in there whatever you see when you're in the
simple apple ecosystem apple handles most that stuff for you
and you have to worry about those details and that's
how mainstream society is designed if you just want to
go through life painting by numbers following the herd and
getting the kind of results that the herd gets you'll
get about three percent of human development that's about all
you'll you'll get in your whole life and uh your
level of passion and fulfillment will be around three percent
if you want more than that you're gonna have to
do some more uh advanced work you see and that
comes with trade-offs it's it's more complicated it's more nuanced
there's more traps there's more potential for failure ways things
can go horribly wrong um it it requires a lot
more time and energy more responsibility on your part you
have to be serious about it you have to stick
with it for for years and for decades it's not
something you can do in one weekend it's not some
sort of magic pill or quick fix for anything in
your life so the key thing you have to understand
is that the idea that we've been implicitly taught as
we grew up is that there is this objective world
and the subjective world has objective physical laws and rules
that everybody has to follow and that people get certain
results by doing certain things and that there's not much
that can really be changed about any of that and
that that stuff is not part of the mind that
stuff is out there it's part of the world but
that itself you have to see that whole world view
is itself just software in the mind that can be
changed that's the operating system of your mind you can
go in there and start to tinker around with it
but but it's tricky it's tricky because you see all
the stuff you've been taught in your life science history
morals religion even ideas you have about spirituality whatever you
think that might mean uh or ideas about god if
you bring all of those you see are locking down
how your mind is able to think it's it's preventing
it's not giving your mind enough degrees of freedom to
be able to outmaneuver and break free of those limited
ways of looking at the world there is no such
thing as an objective external material world out there that
is separate from the mind the mind and the material
world are fused together and how your mind thinks and
sees the world literally is the world that is seen
out there now at first this seems a little far-fetched
because you start to wonder like well leo so i
can just imagine a million dollars and it'll show up
on my door doorstep no unfortunately it doesn't quite work
that way it's it's complicated you see it's not simple
this is a very ingenious mechanism of life and reality
and mind the mind is a beast of deep deep
deep intelligence and complexity you have to work through this
complexity to unlock your mind jailbreak your mind but you
know in these phones the manufacturers they install anti-jailbreaking software
on a samsung phone which is what i had when
i was jailbreaking one of my earlier phones um they
actually had a specific software had some name i forget
what it was even called samsung has some sort of
proprietary anti-jail breaking software which is running at the very
low level it's running it's even running like almost below
the operating system level because it needs to in order
to stop hackers at the very you know you gotta
if you're trying to stop a hacker you can try
to stop him at the upper levels like with software
it's not gonna work so well you can stop him
trying to stop him at the operating system layer he
can hack through that but if you try to stop
him at the very bottom that's you know ideally you
would stop them at the hardware level um but uh
but or like at the kernel level and so um
what i'm trying to say is that you need to
outwit your own anti-jail breaking software in your own mind
your mind isn't really interested in you going all the
way down inside of it and reprogramming it and seeing
how the mind constructs all of reality because the mind
is in the business of constructing reality if the mind
is in the business of constructing reality it doesn't really
serve the mind's agenda to reveal to you all of
the secrets of how it is constructing your reality because
if you do that you're deconstructing reality and that's against
the agenda of the mind so the mind has very
powerful mechanisms within it to prevent you from going on
this journey of jailbreaking you and you can see it's
it's paradoxical it's strange loopy because unlike with a phone
a phone is a separate object from you that you
are trying to hack in jailbreak but what happens when
you are the phone and you are the one who's
trying to jailbreak yourself you can see how twisted that
gets because after all you are trying to hack yourself
and the system that is trying to stop you from
hacking yourself is also yourself so which system is going
to win which subpart of you is going to win
because there's a one part of you that wants to
jailbreak yourself and to free your mind and to experience
radical new possibilities of consciousness and human potential and then
there's other parts of you that doesn't want to change
that is just lazy scared angry bitter doubtful skeptical cynical
and close-minded and just doesn't want to change you have
both of these forces within you my job as a
teacher here is to show you the possibility and to
inspire you to connect with that part of you that
wants to liberate yourself that wants something more out of
life because if you'll notice most other people in your
life are not going to encourage you or inspire you
to do this in fact they will do the opposite
they will may say it you go to them and
you tell your parents about how i'm jail breaking my
mind and i'm going to change my operating system all
this and you know your parents are christians or they
were raised muslims or they were atheists or whatever and
they tell you whoa what do you think you're doing
you're crazy you've joined some sort of cult and now
you're gonna jail break your mind and then what and
then what's gonna happen you're gonna lose your mind you're
gonna go insane it's they're gonna fear monger to you
and your own mind will fear monger to you and
that's right because you're going into the unknown for all
you know i could be some cult leader or i
could be uh someone who's gonna you know tell you
to do something with your mind that's gonna end up
you know frying your brain and killing you for all
you know that's possible but that is that is the
nature of the beast the nature of the game because
what we're doing here is we're exploring uncharted territory this
is the distinction that very few people make within society
most people do not recognize the difference between living life
or doing something in life which has already been done
and well documented by others versus doing something for the
first time or being one of the very few people
who ever did this see most of the stuff that
people do in life has been done by millions of
people before and is completely well documented well known so
it's completely safe all of the dangers that used to
be there like for example when you go to study
math all the dangers that used to exist with studying
math have been completely uh child proofed for you there's
no danger in studying math anymore there's no danger in
learning english there's no danger in in in many of
these things that you can learn and do in life
because we've already we've already eliminated those dangers you know
a modern car for example has a bunch of safety
features that didn't used to exist in early cars it
has safety belts air bags it's been tested to hell
with computer simulations varying various crash simulations it's gone through
hundreds of iterations and and different models to perfect it
such that when you get into a car crash you'll
probably survive chances are very high but if you got
into a car crash in a car from 50 years
ago that was another story no airbags no seat belts
no crash testing very different animal no safety glass so
um you see and and you had to go through
that phase before you can get the safe cars you
couldn't have safe cars before you went through the dangerous
cars because it had to go through an evolutionary process
well likewise in order to get out of the dark
ages if you want to go beyond the center of
gravity of your society and your culture your culture will
only teach you how to get to its level if
you want to go beyond that now you're on your
own nobody in your culture not your teachers not your
friends not your parents will encourage you or even understand
what you're doing if you're trying to go beyond the
center of gravity of your culture whatever it is see
and the further you want to go beyond that center
of gravity the higher you want to go the the
lonelier it will be the fewer people will support you
the fewer people will encourage you and the less resources
you will have at your disposal to get there and
also probably the more risks there will be because there's
a good reason why people don't venture out too far
beyond the herd it's dangerous beyond the herd there are
wolves and predators out there there are sand pits and
traps cliffs and gullies and raging rivers and tornadoes and
thorny plants that you can stick yourself on so for
the purposes of survival most animals stick with the herd
and that's what you've been doing most your life but
see i'm here to encourage you to go beyond that
and i'm trying to share with you the concepts and
principles that you would need in order to do that
if you were going to seriously undertake this self-improvement project
this is not an ideology you do not believe the
things i say that is an obstacle to this work
to really do this work you need to take my
ideas test them validate them against other sources validate them
against your own direct experience and in the end if
it doesn't produce a transformation a positive transformation in your
life then it's a bad idea and you shouldn't use
it and also what's tricky about going back to the
example of writing this instruction manual for how to live
life that's what we're talking about here is um see
it's not so simple it's just writing an instruction manual
that works for all people because people are different people
have different genetics different personality types um different metabolisms different
physical appearances different needs different desires different fears different obstacles
different capacities different strengths and weaknesses they live and were
born in different parts of the world different environments different
climates different cultures different levels of development of their of
their countries different economic levels different physical ailments and diseases
and obstacles so all of this determines what your instruction
manual is going to look like the only one who
can write your instruction manual is you in a sense
that that's what life is about you're born without an
instruction manual then you spend the next 50 years of
your life writing the instruction manual for your own life
by looking inwards and figuring yourself out you see most
people are at such a low level of development they
don't they don't even know what they want out of
life they don't even know themselves deeply enough to know
what they really want and what they don't want how
can you get something that you want when you don't
even know that you want it and then also most
people are so naive and dumb about this process of
pursuing their desires that it never occurs to them to
take one step back and to question their own desires
for example people desire money or sex or entertainment or
partying or whatever a big house cars business success and
then they go pursuing that just blindly and it never
occurs to them to stop and to wonder wait a
minute but how do i know that these desires are
valid how do i know that these desires will actually
produce the good life how do i know these desires
aren't tricks and traps of my own deceptive operating system
where desires come from were they programmed by culture by
parents by teachers by stuff i saw on the tv
when i was a kid watching saturday morning cartoons and
getting pumped full of advertising the movies i've watched you
see life is a lot trickier than you ever imagined
the reason it's so difficult to jailbreak your mind is
precisely because your mind controls you and manipulates you like
a puppet master with your emotions see you can have
all the fancy logic in the world you can be
this rational scientist this sam harris type or this ben
shapiro type who has the facts all the facts and
all the sort of all the logic in the world
uh but all that flies out the window when push
comes to shove because their whole lives are run by
emotions all of ours are because all logic is is
a handmaiden to emotion when you get horny when you
get hungry when you get thirsty when you get scared
when your children are threatened when your life is threatened
when your business is threatened how are you going to
behave when you get jealous when you get angry bitter
frustrated tired pissed off confused how are you going to
behave your desires your cravings for food for money for
fame for status for superiority over others see all of
this runs you this is what really runs the show
most people are run by all these emotions without even
being aware of what these emotions are they can't even
distinguish just this small list of emotions that i just
rattled off in the list of courses much deeper than
that and of course all these emotions have various gradations
and they show up in different ways and it never
really occurs to us to question these emotions too deeply
we mostly just react to them when we're scared we
try to quickly do something to alleviate the fear when
we're angry we punch the wall or we yell at
somebody or throw something at them when we're frustrated we
we grind our teeth and we and we are in
a shitty mood when we're depressed then we do something
else you know when we're horny we go chasing for
sex we when we want love we do stupid things
in the name of love and when we try to
question any of this of course the way the anti-jail
breaking software in our mind works is that it says
that's dangerous that's bad you shouldn't be doing that that's
evil it's satanic it's impossible it's a waste of time
it's just philosophy it's just mental masturbation it's never going
to work you're always going to be stuck in this
job you're always going to be fat you're always going
to be lazy leo's just filling your mind with [
__ ] because he wants to get some money from
you see you have to start to become aware of
how sneaky your mind is all the thought patterns that
your mind comes up with are all cleverly designed to
keep your existing worldview in place and to not allow
it to change change is a paradoxical thing because on
the one hand when your life sucks you want it
to change but see your mind doesn't like change what
your mind wants is your mind wants all the fruits
and benefits of the change without actually changing itself so
if you don't have the money or the sex or
the love or the approval or whatever that you want
of course you want that to change and you want
all those things to be nice and good you want
pleasure and positive emotions in all those areas and success
and wealth and all that but then when i tell
you well yeah you can have that but you'd have
to deeply change yourself then you would say oh well
that that's crazy that's crazy why would i ever want
to change myself how can i get all those things
leo how do i get all those things without changing
anything about myself well see that's impossible that's what keeps
you stuck you have to bite the bullet and to
say okay fine i'll change myself i'll change everything about
myself it's tricky it's very counterintuitive mind lies to you
your mind deceives you your mind bullshits you your mind
gives you excuses and stories about why you can't change
why you shouldn't change and in a certain sense your
mind is right there there's good reason to worry about
change because change takes you into the unknown the unknown
isn't always guaranteed to be safe it can be dangerous
it's possible to make a change for the worse in
fact sometimes oftentimes you have to make a change for
the worse before you can make a change for the
better it's not always the case that you can just
make positive changes immediately there's costs to making changes and
ultimately the reason your mind doesn't want to change is
because change you know what changes changes death and ultimately
that's what you're afraid of when you're afraid of change
you're afraid of death because if right now you are
a fat lazy slob that goes to work in some
dead-end job that doesn't exercise that has terrible nutrition doesn't
read any books just you know watches trash on youtube
and gets involved into conspiracy theories and whatever other toxic
ideologies that are out there if that's the kind of
person you are right now just taking a hyperbolic example
um for you to experience a really deep fulfilling life
at the superhuman levels of development that i'm proposing for
you you would have to completely change and effectively that
means you'd have to die that fat slob fat lazy
depressed miserable slob that is irresponsible and is you know
involved in these conspiracy that that thing has to die
but that thing is what you're attached to that's the
thing that's the last thing that you're willing to let
die you want to somehow maintain that fat lazy slob
while at this on the other hand getting money and
success and sex and everything else that you want so
um the solution to this is to is to grow
up and to bite the bullet and to say [
__ ] it i'm tired of being this fat lazy
slob i'm sick of these mediocre results deep down in
my heart i know that life can be lived with
more fulfillment and passion it shouldn't be this frustrating in
this this mediocre and that i'm willing to actually do
some work to change myself and i'm even willing to
drown my old self in the bathtub if that's what
it takes to make it happen and it's only when
you reach that point that you can really get some
serious results but even then that's just where the work
begins that's just the beginning of the work you'll still
spend decades now actualizing on that initial commitment and promise
what you've discovered with actualize.org here is something very very
rare you are not going to just you're not going
to find this level of depth and quality of wisdom
and life advice anywhere in mainstream media nor in most
books most books and most teachers they don't give you
the big picture what they do is they silo knowledge
we have a huge problem of siloed knowledge today in
society whether it's within science within medicine within philosophy within
spirituality or whatever everybody's just becoming this narrow specialist and
is good at one little thing you know within the
scientific fields you've got like the microbiologists then you've got
the uh you know the the quantum physicists then you've
got the evolutionary biologists then you've got the psychologist then
you've got the socio and they all are doing their
own separate thing and they're not communicating with each other
properly so they're not getting a holistic understanding of reality
because all the parts of reality turns out they all
interconnect perfectly together and you can't understand reality through its
parts you need to understand reality holistically so one of
the huge things that i stress is the holism of
this work and you will discover that more and more
as you get deeper into my content to really understand
what you should be doing in life you need a
holistic understanding of reality it's not enough to understand little
bits and pieces because the way reality is it's very
magical it's more than the sum of its parts way
way way more so you got to study different sources
different perspectives different fields and subfields and then bring them
all together into something larger you are like the executive
the chief executive of your life the chief executive is
responsible for integrating and coordinating all the work of all
the other sub departments within a corporation all the other
vice presidents the marketing department the sales department the engineering
department the research and development department they all need to
be coordinated together to have a company working properly and
the ceo's job is to sit there at the top
like on a mountaintop looking down at all thinking about
the future thinking about how all the different departments are
working on their little narrow projects and making sure that
they're all gonna do the right thing in the big
picture because it's no good for example for the engineering
team to design some sort of new contraption that the
sales and marketing team are unable to market because there's
no market for it that's no good and it's no
good for the sales and marketing teams to market something
that the engineers can't deliver on that's no good see
so who's gonna look out to make sure that all
the things are working smoothly the ceo likewise in your
life people will be giving you all sorts of advice
throughout your life telling you to do this and that
you'll read all sorts of books but then who who
integrates all of that and and makes the ultimate executive
decisions about what you should do next in your life
what kind of goals you should pursue what kind of
desires and cravings you should maybe avoid or let go
of or transcend only you who can write the instruction
manual for your life only you i can't do it
for you i can give you some building blocks but
in the end you have to do it because you're
unique and also because that is the joy of life
this is not just we're not doing all of this
as a grind to get to some ultimate peak enlightenment
state although we are but uh uh we're also enjoying
the process we're enjoying the journey because once you do
reach your peak enlightenment state after decades of this work
what you'll realize is [ __ ] i wasted 20
years of my life grinding through to get to this
ultimate enlightenment state and really all this enlightenment state tells
me is that i should have just been enjoying those
last 20 years why was i so stressed you know
struggling and fighting with myself that's the that's the circular
nature of this work that's fine you're gonna struggle it's
gonna be difficult at times it's going to be frustrating
you're going to get confused you're going to make mistakes
you're going to fall into traps you're going to you're
going to make epistemic mistakes the anti-jail breaking mechanisms in
your own mind they will they will outsmart you it'll
take you years of trying to outsmart them before you
learn to successfully outsmart them because they're going to outsmart
you more than you smart them for the first 10
years of your life as you're doing this work really
what this work is is it it's philosophy it's philosophy
but since we're living in the dark ages our mainstream
notions of what philosophy is are very corrupt and distorted
philosophy falls into one of two camps usually camp number
one is people who regard philosophy as just pure mental
masturbation completely irrelevant to human life and uh just nonsense
uh and then camp number two are the professional academic
philosophers who have turned philosophy into a into a farce
where it's not even true philosophy it's a history of
philosophy you you pick a couple of dead old white
men uh like descartes or kant or liveness or whatever
and then you go study them plato aristotle you go
study them with a with a magnifying glass you study
their text and then you you try to ask yourself
well what was what was plato really thinking was he
thinking this or was he trying to say that and
then you argue with somebody else some other philosopher who's
in your field and say well no he was actually
trying to do this and then you argue write papers
and it's all technical nonsense completely disconnected from reality and
improving one's life and really trying to understand what what
reality is i was a philosophy major in university and
i was very disappointed with my philosophy education because the
true reason that i went into philosophy was to to
do this work that i'm doing now to understand how
to live life and to answer the deepest questions about
the nature of reality because i can't know how to
live life until i understand what reality is you get
that you can't either see until you know what reality
is how can you know what you should be doing
in reality what's good what's bad what's worthwhile what's not
worthwhile how can you answer those questions without understanding what
reality is so that's the ultimate most fundamental question but
see today's philosophers aren't interested in this they argue about
technical minutia that's completely disconnected from reality every i mean
everyday life and uh they have no idea really they
have no understanding of reality itself what they understand is
they understand the works of old dead white men but
they don't understand reality this is very unfortunate what we
need is we need to return society back to a
to an appreciation of the function of philosophy as in
a sense the king of all sciences and fields of
of knowledge everything else is a subfield of philosophy really
whether it's physics math psychology biology chemistry all of these
fields are deeply permeated by metaphysical and epistemic and philosophical
questions that are not properly addressed by these fields which
is why these fields are stuck and are not able
to make progress in understanding reality at the deeper levels
that are possible so i recommend you become a philosopher
a lover of wisdom not just as theory but taking
on the burden of when you understand something new about
reality and it's a true and a deep understanding the
burden then is upon the philosopher to embody that understanding
it's not enough to say oh well yeah i know
that god exists or i know that uh so and
so that you know that i know that that money
is not needed for happiness or i know that whatever
um i know what suffering is okay yeah you know
what suffering is but do you still suffer see to
truly understand what suffering is is also then to transcend
it to truly be able to understand what happiness is
and what money is is to also be able to
not be under its spell anymore so in the classical
ancient greek sense the true philosophers were those who pursued
a deep penetrating inner understanding of reality and themselves and
then embodied it you pursue the understanding so deeply that
it transforms you one of the biggest problems with modern
science and with psychology especially is that these psychologists they
have a lot of theories and they work with they
work with a lot of patients and they might help
them in certain ways but they don't truly embody what
they're doing they treat the patient or they treat their
science experiment as though it's separate from them or they
treat the theories or the work or the research that
they do as though it's separate from them as the
individual such that it's just it sits at the top
surface level of their mind it doesn't transform the actual
operating system in the kernel of the bios level of
of their own mind and this is very obvious once
you get to levels that are very deep because once
you yourself understand how to transform your own bios and
you've done enough of that then you're going to see
very clearly which people have done it and which people
have not which people understand how it works and which
people do not similar to how a hacker will recognize
a hacker and it's very easy for a hacker to
see that your grandma is not a hacker but it's
difficult for your grandma to really understand what a hacker
understands see so what we're talking about here is a
philosophy that is intimately connected with all of the results
you get in your life that you're unhappy with because
you see with a scientist like a scientist can go
like a chemist can go into the lab do his
work on his research experiment then he can come back
home he can drink a bottle of whiskey because he's
tired he wants to unwind he can he can even
curse at his wife because you know his wife is
annoying him for whatever reason because he was working late
and not making love to her properly he doesn't know
how to how how to properly make love to his
wife because he's just you know he's like this academic
nerd type he's got money problems uh he's got emotional
other emotional problems like baggage from his childhood and whatever
else and so but this is this is considered acceptable
for a scientist because a scientist is just a narrow
specialist who works you know on on chemistry in a
lab and when i'm working on chemistry in a lab
it doesn't matter if i abuse my wife it doesn't
matter if i can make love to my wife properly
it doesn't make matter what my emotional state is none
of that matters as long as i can just do
the lab work but this is a this is a
very fragmented approach to reality in the end a scientist
is supposed to be pursuing an understanding of reality but
science has become so overly specialized and utilitarian that it's
completely disconnected from that scientists are in no way doing
science in order to actually transform themselves which would be
the true function of science sciences function is not to
create cool gadgets the function of science is to deepen
our understanding of reality and to transform ourselves and society
in alignment with that and really that's the function of
philosophy science is philosophy centuries ago science was called natural
philosophy it was a subset of philosophy when the ancient
greek philosopher heraclitus was asked by one of his students
or onlookers how did you reach this state of enlightenment
he became enlightened he said i studied myself above the
temple door at the oracle of delphi in greece there
was an inscription that read know thyself that's true philosophy
because the truth is that there's nothing but the self
if the mind and the world are one which they
are you are the world and therefore to know yourself
is to know the world the mistake though is to
try to know yourself by looking into the world you'll
never achieve that you'll never know yourself through the world
you can only know the world through the self so
you've got the process backwards turn around do a u-turn
go deeply inwards the deeper inwards you go the better
you will start to understand the world than reality and
now i want to conclude with my final point which
is that and look pay very careful attention right now
because this will change your whole life ideas change your
life one idea can change your life listen to this
no human has ever told you that total understanding of
reality is possible no one has ever told you this
i am the first person in your life telling you
this total understanding of reality is possible and that is
our goal our goal is not to meet some petty
survival needs of yours we'll try to meet them as
much as we need to in order to get you
to survive long enough to reach something higher but our
goal is way beyond that our goal is total understanding
of reality for its own sake if you achieve this
goal total understanding of reality that is the only thing
you want in life nothing else matters everything else is
just a distraction from that total understanding of reality imagine
if you understood the origin and function and purpose of
the entire universe seems far-fetched seems outlandish seems utterly impossible
given what sciences tell you but consider that maybe those
are just limitations programmed into you in your childhood and
that they aren't really true what would happen what do
you think would happen if you were able to go
so deeply into this project or endeavor of jail breaking
your mind that you broke through every single limit of
the mind what would happen if your mind became unlimited
maybe that's possible how do you know unless you try
it people have done it i've done it at least
for short periods of time i'm not saying that you
won't be able to fall back into delusion or problems
you will self-deception is inescapable in this work mistakes are
inescapable in this work do not beat yourself up for
making mistakes make more mistakes fail faster you can't avoid
epistemic mistakes in this work it's too tricky make the
mistake and just learn from it take responsibility for it
change your behavior for next time some mistakes you will
repeatedly make for hundreds of tries you need to have
enough perseverance to fail hundreds of times to break through
that's just one of the principles of being successful there's
hundreds of principles hundreds i've outlined them throughout all of
my work i encourage you to go and and look
through my vast catalog of content and material and to
take it very seriously get serious about life like get
really serious about life stop screwing around stop playing video
games stop wasting your time on social media stop being
a sheep with your friends all all of them are
idiots they're wasting their lives and you better believe they're
going to suffer for it and pay dearly for it
the biggest regret you're going to have if you start
doing this work today if you make a commitment to
do this work for the rest of your life the
biggest regret you'll have 10 years from now is that
you didn't start this work 10 years earlier this will
work will transform your life you will not see the
world in the same way again you will access new
levels of consciousness and understanding that are super human beyond
science beyond religion beyond dogma and ideology you will understand
the purpose of life you will transcend your fear of
death you will discover levels of love and passion and
fulfillment that you never thought were possible this work will
bring you to tears of joy and happiness but not
immediately it's going to take vision and foresight and commitment
from from you to do some years of work before
you can start to tap into just some a little
bit of these amazing fruits that i'm talking about and
if you got to begin with basic stuff begin with
basic stuff if it's money it's money if it's sex
it's sex if it's nutrition it's nutrition handle those basics
build that basic foundation most of you are missing that
that's what you need and i have some older content
about that and i'll have some more content in the
future about that because i know how much you need
it in a sense my job is to build a
bridge between the highest ultimate understanding and then the level
that most people are at which is not very advanced
and so all of my content is trying to be
like a staircase that moves you up and up and
up and up and up and up but i warn
you though this content by the very nature of it
it's radical there are some radical ideas here there are
some radical consequences of this work most people do not
appreciate the radicalness of this work until they get some
number of years into it and then it starts to
dawn on them and even then they still don't understand
nearly how radical this work is because reality is a
radical thing see and since the results are so radical
that also requires a radical mind a radically open mind
a radically serious commitment to life i recommend you stop
playing around seriously commit to life beyond the meeting of
your survival needs what if from today onwards you would
no longer live life from meeting of your survival needs
but for something beyond that what might that be your
connection to life itself feel into the fact that you
are conscious and alive right now this feeling of connection
with reality and just if you reflect for a moment
on the fact that you exist at all try that
that's profound what you really want is a profound life
you don't want to be wealthy you don't want a
fast car you don't want a harem of girls you
don't want the perfect husband and children what you really
want is you want a profound connection with life that
moves you to tears that's what you really want and
in those moments if you think back in your life
where you were able to get that for little glimpses
little brief periods whether you were looking at a sunset
or you watched some artistic movie that moved you or
you were making deep passionate love to your lover or
you looked into the eyes of your child when when
it was born those all those moments what they really
were were you getting that sense of profoundness from life
that is you connecting with spirit otherwise known as consciousness
that is the whole function of spirituality all of spirituality
boils down to one thing that prof cultivating a profound
connection with life to such a degree that you you
practice it every day more and more and more and
more that after a certain point that sense of profundity
is everywhere it permeates your entire field of consciousness and
awareness and then you're living from that place you're interacting
from that place with people you're working from that place
your work connects with that all your elements of your
life align with that your relationships your career your life
purpose your finances and then that is the good life
the good life is not so mysterious people have known
about how to live the good life for over 5000
years the problem though is that living the good life
is a radical move and it is not something that
most people easily accept therefore it can't be sold to
them it can't be marketed to them it can't be
put into the form of a of a magic pill
or a pharmaceutical it can't be uh you know it
can't be part of some sort of cult or religion
it can't be codified in some sort of one two
three abc paint by numbers formula that everybody can follow
like a like a sheep and then reach the good
life the good life has to be engineered by you
and you can't have the good life so long as
you're deluded by all of the programming that has been
injected into your mind like a virus hijacking your natural
spiritual connection to them to reality because we live in
the dark ages and so even though mankind does and
has known about how to live the good life and
what reality is and ultimate understanding for over 5000 years
in practice it's extremely rare because nobody is going to
spoon feed it to you no one can do this
work but you and the only way you can do
it is by having a vision of it in your
mind a vision so juicy so compelling that it excites
you to wake up in the morning and get to
work roll up your sleeves and then work for 8
10 12 hours to do the stuff that is necessary
to to move yourself in that direction and this catalog
of material that i have assembled is going to be
the closest thing that you'll find in society that is
trying to spoon feed you this information i hope you
appreciate that you
