[Music] understanding survival part 2 let's jump right into part
2 go watch part 1 otherwise you're gonna be very
lost I hope that you actually did your homework assignment
from part one it was an extremely important homework assignment
because when we're talking about survival here I want you
to really understand that we're not talking about theory or
philosophy or just cute ideas and it doesn't matter what
conclusions you come to about survival or how much you
understand it intellectually what really makes the difference between whether
this information is gonna change your life is if you
actually observe it happening in your life you need to
do a lot of observation work to be able to
understand the things that I'm talking about here otherwise it's
just gonna go in one ear and out the other
so do that homework hopefully you did in which case
let's move in I have a few other points I
want to address here before we properly get into part
two so first of all a note about part 1
where I mentioned the part the part about squirrels being
oak murdering machines and some people in the comments responded
and they say well below squirrels you know yeah of
course squirrels eat a lot of acorns but also the
squirrels they gather the acorns they bury them in stashes
and then the squirrels forget about the stashes and then
those Oaks grow from those stashes once the squirrel forgets
about it so in this sense the squirrel is not
being selfish but it's actually helping the oak trees and
yes that's true there is an element of that and
one thing that I want to illustrate with this example
actually it's really good is that survival can be symbiotic
it's not always the case that when you're engaging in
survival activity you're always only doing something for yourself and
never helping anybody else so in this case as in
the case with many dynamics within nature within the ecology
between predator and prey and so forth you see a
lot of these kind of semi symbiotic relationships but here's
the key point that I was making with that squirrel
example is that the squirrel does not know what it's
doing whether it's being selfish and murdering a bunch of
oak trees or helping sometimes to plant a new oak
tree by accident all of it is mechanical and the
squirrel has no idea what it's doing it's just running
on autopilot see and that is the key point and
that is exactly what's happening in your life as well
see in your life you're not a purely selfish machine
that only does stuff to benefit itself and nobody else
know you of course benefit your family in various ways
you benefit your friends you benefit your co-workers you benefit
society in various ways but a lot of times you
don't and so it's a mixed bag it's a combination
stuff the key is you're not conscious of what you're
doing or how it's happening and also I want to
point out that remember ultimately we can't have a duality
between selfishness and selflessness you can't just separate these two
as though they're water and oil and they never mix
no there they're constantly mixing in ultimately when you get
to the to the root of reality you need to
become conscious that really selfishness goes full circle and it
becomes selflessness the highest good that you can do for
yourself ultimately becomes the highest good that you can do
for others as well when you realize that self and
other are actually one now of course a lot of
people are far from that but I expect you to
be able to see the Beast these two things are
gonna have to come together everything is gonna have to
come full circle here when you get to the rock
bottom of it so keep that in mind don't don't
hold that as a duality don't hold survival as some
sort of duality as in like survival is bad over
here and then selflessness and love is good over here
it's not that simple it's much more complicated also I
want to point out that unlike animals humans off you
skate survival so with animals it's pretty easy to see
how most the stuff they do is survival like you
go outside you look at the birds one of the
birds doing their flying around singing songs looking for bugs
attract mates maybe taking a bath in a puddle or
something that's what birds do all that is survival but
see with humans we get very sophisticated and fancy with
our survival such that then we forget that it's even
survival we somehow think that the stuff that we do
is so advanced that it's beyond survival when really it's
just a more evolved complex form of survival and what
you see all throughout the animal kingdom and and of
course up through humans including humans is that the more
evolved and complex the life-form is the more sophisticated its
survival strategies become so you know if you take a
little worm it doesn't have super advanced survival strategies but
you take a snake it has more advanced ones and
then you take a chimp it has more advanced ones
then you take humans and of course we take it
to to a whole new level but don't let all
that complexity off you skate what's really going on because
what's really going on is rather simple you're just surviving
yourself also understand though that just because in organisms survival
strategies complex and elaborate and full of deception that that
organism is conscious of what it's doing it's not it
needs are two very different things most humans have elaborate
sophisticated highly intelligent survival strategies but they're unconscious of them
they don't even realize that that's what they're doing and
that's a very important distinction to make because sometimes people
make this misconception they say well but beliya I'm good
at survival as though like being good at survival means
you're conscious of your survival strategies that's not the case
for example Donald Trump is very good at survival he's
been surviving his whole life by hook or by crook
you know scheming and manipulating every sort of way but
that does not mean he has a clue as to
what he's doing and why he's doing it he's doing
it all on autopilot see that's very different those those
two are very different things so it's not enough for
you just to become good at survival what we're talking
about here is what's even more important which is you
becoming conscious of how and why you're doing survival these
days notice that it's it's it's very easy to take
survival for granted because society outsources and hides survival the
complexity sophistication brutality of survival is obvious gated and justified
and rationalized with complex social systems such that most human
beings don't even understand what goes into their survival like
you think you just go to a grocery store and
just pick up some bananas or some meat and that's
how you fulfill your basic food needs but you don't
understand the sophisticated logistical chains that these grocery stores have
developed in order to provide you with these bananas and
this meat at the cost that it's being provided at
the inspections that go in to this the imports and
exports the tariffs the various political systems and orders that
need to be erected and also toppled in order to
get you these bananas that you otherwise wouldn't be able
to get from halfway around the world the shipping logistical
chains you know they have to be shipped bite bite
by sea and by truck and like is this extremely
complicated sea but none of that is is seen by
most human beings and so it's easily taken for granted
and in a sense this becomes very dangerous because it
disconnects us from our survival like if you were just
living by yourself in the rainforest or in Alaska somewhere
you would be connected with your survival functions because you
have to actually like go fish for some fish hunt
for some squirrels or for some rabbits or whatever you'd
have to maybe grow your own vegetables build your own
cabin and so in this sense your survival would be
very kind of simple straightforward and honest but in modern
society our survival becomes very convoluted and filled with all
sorts of deceptions and ploys and facades and fake fronts
my nose is a dream today and so you got
to be you got to be clear-eyed enough to see
through that you see especially like within business business off
you skates survival so much most people they just go
to a job they work they're doing some sort of
grindy secretary work or whatever and then they get a
paycheck at the end of the month but they have
no idea how they fit into the entire machine that
that business is and what that business is actually doing
maybe your secretary for some giant a military industrial complex
company like Lockheed Martin or something and you have no
idea that actually the work you're doing is leading to
the bombing of civilians halfway around the world you see
and so this makes us irresponsible about how we survive
and in this way a lot of devilry and quote
unquote evil can arise because everything is so compartmentalized and
siloed that you don't ever see the big picture of
what you're really doing when you're working for that company
that's problematic another thing I want to point out which
I mentioned in part one but I didn't I don't
think I I stressed it enough I want you to
really start to appreciate how intelligent survival is it's unbelievably
intelligent like it's it's brilliant beyond comprehension your survival or
even the survival strategies of of simple animals it's incredibly
intelligent like it's unbelievably intelligent but just because this intelligent
does not mean that the animal is conscious of it
the intelligence is sort of just a force of the
universe it's the intelligence of evolution which we'll talk about
another time but now let's move on so here's a
key insight for you about survival of the more central
that an object is to your survival the more emotional
and upset you will become if it's threatened so just
consider a couple of different categories of thing your children
your parents your pets think about how upset or emotional
you get if one of them is threatened versus if
your car or your house or your bank account is
threatened versus something rather small like if a towel that
you use is damaged or you get a flat tire
or you lose a shoe so these CC these are
these are three categories of of centrality of these objects
to your life you will react very differently to losing
a child into losing a shoe why is that well
it's because of how central the child is to your
entire survival strategy so of course you get much more
emotional about your children your pets and your parents than
you do about lost shoes because the more energy you
invest in a thing the more you need to defend
it because it's central to your survival and like I
said in part one we tell ourselves all sorts of
elaborate fantastical stories about why something is so important to
us or why we're so emotional about or so upset
about it without admitting to ourselves the true reason so
like if you ask a parent well why do you
really care about your child what it what's wrong if
the child gets kidnapped well you know the parent will
will come up with all sorts of flowery stories but
the bottom line is that it's central to the parents
survival it's because the parent has invested so much energy
into that child that's really why it's not out of
love because your love for your children is not unconditional
parents love for their children is extremely conditional so that's
a lie see what we do is we tell ourselves
these flowery stories about how the stuff we do in
our lives we're doing for the good of mankind or
we're doing it for the good of our children are
out of love and all this other sort of stuff
when in reality a lot of times this is just
[ __ ] you tell yourself [ __ ] that
society helps you to tell yourself because Society has already
pre-made stories and narratives about why you do the things
you do see we've concocted these together to make our
human actions look much more Noble and selfless than they
actually are and then we wonder how come our life
isn't working well maybe it's because you're living your life
so selfishly but then you say oh no but I'm
very selfless you tell yourself that you're selfless but you
actually selfless cease we've got to be brutally honest with
ourselves here another key insight just because a survival strategy
fails does not mean that it's not a survival strategy
this is important people get hung up on this for
example going to the grocery store is a survival strategy
and it still is a survival strategy even if I
go to the store and accidentally buy some spoiled lettuce
and get poisoned and die from it that was still
my survival strategy I just happened to be unlucky in
this case I chose my lettuce poorly and and then
I died yeah that that happens a lot survival strategies
fail frequently or for example robbing a bank is still
a survival strategy even if even if I get killed
in the process now you might say believe didn't you
just say that survival strategies are highly intelligent but what's
intelligent about robbing a bank it seems like any fool
should understand that robbing a bank would would be a
terrible idea because it would endanger one's life so how
come this person is doing it out of survival well
there are many degrees of survival strategies and there are
many degrees of intelligence to survival strategies even the stupid
ones that we would call the so-called stupid ones are
still rather intelligent you know a lot of intelligence gets
put into robbing a bank even if you don't succeed
still requires a lot of intelligence to do that and
to execute that but of course there are many self-destructive
survival strategies there are both short-term survival strategies and long-term
survival strategies in a lot of times when someone is
in a sort of a needy State a very fearful
state and they immediately need money or resources because they're
in such a tight bind or they have mental issues
or whatever of course they can devise all sorts of
unhealthy and toxic and self-destructive survival strategies and we'll be
talking a lot more about that as we keep going
here so that's extremely common in fact that's usually the
case it's usually the case that you get stuck with
some survival strategy which is actually dysfunctional and counterproductive and
is actually damaging you but the problem is because you're
unconscious you're running the survival strategy on autopilot and so
therefore even when it hurts you you still stick with
it because also understand that survival remember is not simply
about physically thriving it's more about surviving whatever you were
so for example for a bank robber like a criminal
a criminal is a certain state of mind the criminal
maintains that state of mind to be a criminal mind
you have to keep doing criminal stuff it's an addiction
it's hard to break that so someone who's robbing a
bank he's probably been robbing cars before that and probably
been robbing grocery stores before that and so on all
the way back to his adolescence you know I had
to start somewhere so that that program that sort of
way of looking at the world of like how do
I rob somebody how do i exploit some system that
sort of way of looking at the world that's a
that's an entire worldview and that's very difficult to change
and it's that worldview that is truly being survived in
the case of somebody robbing a bank see it's not
merely just about getting a bunch of money and then
having food to eat it's a lot more complex than
that because we humans our survival goes way beyond simply
putting food on our table and keeping the the lights
on it's a lot about our our personal identities remember
that also for example smoking is still a survival strategy
even if it gives you cancer in the end and
kills you how is it a survival strategy well consider
how most people get into smoking usually they do it
when they're teens and why do they do it well
usually because smoking is something new is something hip it's
something cool it's a way to to challenge authority to
challenge parents to challenge teacher so in school if you're
if your friends are smoking and you're the odd one
out you don't want to smoke then see that's that's
part of your survival agenda is you don't want to
look weak in front of your friends you want to
look cool too you want to be accepted you want
to be part of the group so part of being
human is being part of the group so activities which
make you part of the group automatically become important survival
activities so you guys listen to the same music and
you talk about the same stuff and you wear the
same clothes right it's a it's a bonding activity and
then maybe being cool helps you to get attention from
the girls helps you to get laid whatever that might
be so that's all survival social survival and that's mostly
what teenagers are struggling with during that part of their
life is how do I survive not just as an
individual but within a collective amongst my friends and peers
teens are learning how to do that of course they
make many mistakes and then once you are hooked on
this on the tobacco then later in your life it's
a survival strategy to keep smoking because now you're physically
addicted your brain has been changed and altered by the
nicotine and so now when you stop smoking you get
restless you get stressed you have withdrawal symptoms all this
and so now of course it serves your survival because
survive big part of survival is comfort psychological comfort so
smoking a cigarette gives you that psychological comfort now of
course you might say well Balea but you wouldn't even
need that psychological comfort if you didn't start smoking in
the first place so it was stupid to start yes
of course but the person wasn't looking that far ahead
when they started and now that they have become addicted
to it well now it's certainly a survival strategy to
smoke a pack of cigarettes a day or whatever it
is even though it's wasting your money and it's ruining
your health and it's ruining your teeth and all sorts
of stuff see but then you actually a smoke or
a long-term smoker will actually develop a certain kind of
identity about being a smoker and then they will actually
bond with other smokers and you know they'll see a
smoker in the airport and they'll say oh yeah and
then like automatically there's a kind of an automatic rapport
that's built even though these people never met or just
because they're two smokers and so it becomes it becomes
a certain lifestyle and really a certain kind of identity
likewise depression is still a survival strategy even if it
leads to your suicide in the end how can depression
be a survival strategy well just think about it what
is depression really about depression is a certain emotional state
this emotional state is actually a very important signal that
your subconscious mind is creating based on in the situation
you find yourself in so for example maybe you're working
in a nine-to-five job that is ruining your potential in
life you're just wasting your life there and you're feeling
miserable and eventually you get become depressed that's a signal
from your subconscious mind telling you hey buddy this is
not the job for you you need to move on
to something else something bigger there's bigger stuff for you
to do out there in the world but maybe you're
too scared to act on that maybe you're too lazy
to go find a new job or to develop a
new career from scratch it's hard and so you just
kind of stick with it you say that I it'll
it'll improve it'll improve I don't need to change anything
but it just gets worse and worse and worse you
get more and more depressed until eventually maybe you kill
yourself so this was a survival strategy in the sense
that you were surviving as that lazy self that's scared
self they didn't want to go out there also the
depression was a signal you weren't listening to it see
it was telling you to wake up and to do
something new and to change but you didn't listen to
it and then eventually got you two or got you
also it could be that you develop a certain identity
about being depressed and you can turn that into a
whole victim identity getting attention from other people and so
forth and then that becomes your survival strategy same so
hmm it's very very sophisticated especially your entire emotional system
is very sophisticated in how it sends you signals that
help you to navigate life and you know a lot
of people they are depressed but they never tell themselves
what happens is that there pressed for a few years
or so forth and then finally they admit to themselves
that okay this is enough I can't do this anymore
I got to go to a therapist or I got
to stop drinking or I got to stop smoking or
I got to stop whatever I'm doing that's contributing to
this depression and they do they change the career they
maybe they quit a bad relationship which was depressing them
and then their depression lifts most depression of course doesn't
end in suicide speaking of suicide suicide bombers that's a
that's a survival strategy right there now you might wonder
but believe how seems like it's the opposite of that
seems like it's destroying your whole case here for survival
but not at all because look a suicide bomber he's
got very strong religious convictions and beliefs he believed believes
in an afterlife he believes in Allah he believes in
in the importance of defending his homeland against foreign invaders
or whatever it might be or against the corruption of
the West against the Great Satan so this guy who's
doing the suicide bombing he's got a very strong ego
and a very strong self-image about being a loyal Muslim
who's gonna be a martyr and dying for the cause
and then he does so and by doing that he
believes he's gonna go to an afterlife and and all
that good stuff and that is what's being survived not
the physical body the physical body is not what's primary
and actually it's you who's judging this person for being
foolish you know cuz in the West we look at
that and say well how stupid to think that there's
an afterlife and and that you can go to heaven
for blowing yourself up but actually joke's on you because
what do you think happens to the suicide bomber after
he dies he becomes infinite he becomes Allah so he's
not wrong about that what he's deluded about is thinking
that the suicide bombing is a is is is somehow
necessary and not hurting people is somehow necessary in order
to reach Allah that of course is not at all
the case and that's that's a very self-destructive and counterproductive
but you know these survival strategies can be very very
twisted is what I'm trying to say many of them
are self-destructive and that's precisely why we want to become
more conscious of them because the survival strategies we pick
up when we're young and from our culture and from
our environment they tend to generally be quite self-destructive and
that's because they're picked up unconsciously they're programmed into us
either in school or in our church or by watching
television or from our parents and friends or whatever is
here's another very important insight about survival which is that
there is no such thing as the one best survival
strategy there are millions of unique survival strategies because there
are millions of unique selves in fact each human self
on this planet seven-plus billion of them has unique needs
of course we have a lot of common needs we
all need food and water and so forth but then
I'm talking about that ego self what does your ego
self need that's unique for every individual and what most
people don't understand is that the survival strategy that works
for them is not going to work for others this
is a common mistake that people make because they're so
stuck in their perspective and they're so not conscious of
their own survival and also survival in general how it
works they think that well if if being a Christian
works for me it must also work for the Muslim
and it must also work for the Jew and it
must also work for the primitive tribal peoples living in
the Amazon so let me go and start a missionary
work and doing missionary work and starting to spread the
message of Christ because it's gonna work for everybody no
that's just your personal survival strategy it's rather arbitrary and
it only works within a certain text in a certain
environment in a certain time in a certain culture given
certain geopolitical conditions you see there's no such thing as
a survival strategy independent of one's environment there needs to
be a perfect match between what's going on in your
environment and then your survival strategy that's what survival amounts
to in the same way that there's no such thing
as the one best animal in the animal kingdom right
there's no best animal it's always a question of what
environment is the animal living in and how well fitted
or suited is the animal to that environment so if
we're talking about the Congo rainforest a gorilla or a
chimpanzee might be perfectly suited to that environment maybe even
better than a human if we're talking about some Arctic
Circle type of environment then maybe penguins or polar bears
are perfectly suited for that and so you can't take
a polar bear and put them in the Congo it's
not gonna work and you can't put a gorilla into
the Arctic Circle so a lot of what the kind
of very simple and obvious mistake but most people don't
understand is that that people that humans have been making
throughout history is we've been trying to push our own
personal survival strategies onto others of course your parents have
been doing this to you since you were a kid
at a teenager which is why you rebelled against them
but also your culture has been doing this to you
and your culture has been doing it to other cultures
so this is where we get the culture wars and
especially when you get stuff like you know when the
West is trying to interfere with Middle Eastern affairs for
example and then it all goes to [ __ ]
why does it do that well because it because there's
a clash between the environment and the culture that's already
there and the survival strategy that you're trying to enforce
upon them you see it's foreign it doesn't work it's
like trying to stick a polar bear in the Congo
of course it's not gonna work you need to become
cognizant of that but you can only become cognizant that
if you're able to step outside your perspective and kind
of like look at the big picture and also if
you're able to respect other people's survival strategies and needs
recognize that people have unique needs if you're a parent
understand that your children will have unique needs from you
of course they need food and water in the basics
but they have a different personality type you might be
artistic and they might be very mathematical or vice versa
you might be very masculine and your your son might
be more of a feminine type of guy and you
got to understand that otherwise you're gonna be trying to
like force him to go to the gym and force
him to do masculine stuff but he doesn't want to
do it I mean it's it's very obvious but people
overlook the obvious also what people overlook is that all
of us are at different stages of development this is
where sprawl that Amex comes in this is why spiral
dynamics is so good at helping us to solve various
kinds of thorny sticky political problems social problems is because
sprawl dynamics helps us to disaggregate D lump people from
one group because before you learn Spile dynamics you think
if everybody is just being the same after you look
to learn smile dynamics you realize that no people are
stratified in two different levels and these different levels they
occur in in a certain sequence and so someone who's
that stage red is not going to resonate with stage
green survival strategies and vice versa see and different people
are at these different stages so they need teachings and
material and information and guidance which will be suitable for
the stage that they're at and of course spiral dynamics
is all about understanding survival societies and cultures are playing
the game of survival at different levels consider the survival
that's happening within the United States which is differ from
the survival that's happening within Scandinavia differ from Russia differ
from Africa differ from the Middle East different from the
the rainforests or living in a prison these are all
very different it's that require different survival strategies and that
explains all of the cultural diversity that you see around
the world all the major cultures and also all the
subcultures they are all different survival strategies that uh see
even just look at something like the cuisine of every
country in the world maybe you've seen some Anthony Bourdain
or something like that or you know the guy travels
around the world showing you different cuisine and you're looking
at it and so weird you know people eat such
weird stuff in different parts of the world they eat
stuff you've never even heard of in certain parts of
the world they eat insects and they eat giraffes and
rhinoceroses and who knows what else you know they eat
all this weird alien stuff and it's amazing kind of
opens your perspective because you're so stuck to your cuisine
like your cuisine is so limited if you're only thinking
about American cuisine or European cuisine compared to all the
possible cuisines out in the world but why is this
well if you look into it the cuisine always reflects
the resources that are available within that culture so for
example parts of the world where there are plenty of
insects that are edible they eat insects and in parts
of the world where there are giraffes they'll eat your
ass so the reason we don't eat giraffes in the
head States they don't live here see so it's all
about working with like what you've got also I want
you to notice that survival has co-opted all social institutions
including the military businesses corporations nonprofits charities schools universities governments
think tanks media Hollywood you name it every social institution
is simply another level of survival because he knows see
we we humans are very social creatures so we survive
individually but then we slide survive collectively as well then
our collectives become an extension of us so this complicates
survival even more of course you can see this within
the animal kingdom - like with ants individual ants care
about their survival but even more so they care about
the survival of their ant colony and in fact I
have a whole episode called collective ego where I talk
about collective survival it's one of the most most important
and profound episodes so go check that out and it's
because humans survive in a highly social way that's what
makes us so powerful as a species politics become so
central to human affairs a lot of people dislike politics
and they say uh politics is just I don't want
to have anything to do with it it's all [
__ ] but yeah it's central to survival all of
these social institutions are filled with politics I'm not just
talking about mainstream politics of the nation that's obvious but
I'm also just talking about you know politics within your
little corporation that you work in or politics within your
non-profit politics within the military politics within a sports team
it's all there the politics is there why is it
there that's how you do survival in a social environment
see that's the equivalent of going and picking fruit off
a tree you know a chimp will pick some bananas
off a tree politics is the human equivalent of that
and of course even chimps have politics within their chimp
troops actually quite sophisticated politics you can read about I
have a I have a book on my book list
which is really good talks about chimp politics and actually
how remarkably it parallels human politics it's quite scary we
truly are the third ape as we're sometimes called another
key insight for you is because identity the thing being
survived is a fantasy ideas and beliefs become central to
survival not just objects and people or material goods defending
your worldview is a huge part of survival as a
human people underestimate this because we generally when we think
of survival in a sort of a material physical istic
sense of just like surviving your body biological sense then
we tend to place too much importance on material objects
and people and you know it's obvious that a car
is a material object which significantly enhances a human survival
ability extends it but even more important than a car
is a human beings worldview because a car is still
just a very local thing it's just an object you
can change it you can replace it quite easily people
go through many cars their lifetimes but a worldview this
is actually imprinted into your mind from birth this is
very difficult to change almost impossible to change if you're
talking about just changing the entire thing your worldview is
like your operating system which governs how you interpret and
understand everything that's going on around you and of course
human beings we take in all these ideas and beliefs
and we're always interacting with other human beings through symbols
through language through ideas through concepts through philosophy this is
very much all wedded to your worldview how you interpret
and think about the world this affects everything it's your
operating system and of course the operating system is is
more foundational than any individual app that is installed on
it see so for humans defending their worldview becomes a
huge part of survival and in fact you could battle
someone to the death over a conflict of worldview you
would think like well that's so silly why would people
kill each other over a world of you but you're
under estimating just how significant a world you is it's
more significant than a car sometimes it's even more significant
than a family member you know some parents would rather
disown their children than give a part of their worldview
that happens all the time around the world especially in
in many developing countries where their worldview tends to be
quite dogmatic it's by the dynamic stage blue or lower
so for example your idea of what a family is
or is supposed to be this is part of your
worldview and it's very central or your idea of gender
what gender is or what a male or a female
is and suppose is supposed to be this is central
to how you define yourself as male or female the
idea of scientific materialism your metaphysics in other words you
believing that you're living inside of a objective external reality
that science can measure in a factual manner that's not
relativistic that's central to your entire understanding of your life
your religion your ethnicity all of these are part of
your worldview and they shape you very much why do
people get upset by the idea that their identity for
example is a fantasy they get very upset by this
because of course the whole point and premise of survival
is that you need to create an identity manufacture it
but then deny that you've manufactured it because you need
to take it as reality II take it seriously so
if you're conscious that you've manufactured your own identity this
is this just in and of itself is very threatening
and problematic for many people because then all of a
sudden if you admit that then you have to kind
of admit that your identity isn't real and if my
identity isn't real more than why bother protecting it or
surviving it and of course the answer is you're right
there's no reason to bother surviving it but that doesn't
help you to survive does it so of course this
is what I meant earlier in part 1 where I
said that survival is not rational it is its own
end survival so in this sense if you can come
up with some fantasy and then defend that fantasy and
actually buy into it so deeply that you believe it's
reality that literally becomes your reality and that's how you
survive because if you didn't care being male or female
or being a Muslim or a Christian if you were
just kind of willy nilly about it like one day
you're a Muslim the next day you're a Christian the
next day you're you're something else you're a Jew like
if this was your approach isn't it funny how nobody
takes this approach like this is unheard of nobody does
this why like when I was younger I used to
think like why why don't people just like spend a
month being a Jew and another month being a Muslim
another one being Christian well it's because of course it's
their identity they're attached to it it's precisely because they
can't do this because if they did this they would
literally dissolve and die as that you can't be a
Muslim and then next month become a Christian because in
a certain sense then you weren't a Muslim to begin
with because what it means to be a Muslim is
that you're completely certain that Islam is true and it's
the best and if you're if you're gonna open your
mind even a little bit to doubting that then you're
gonna very quickly stop being a Muslim or a Christian
or a Jew or a Buddhist or whatever you identify
as you see so this is the core problem this
is why people get so ideological and dogmatic all the
time about all things is because they create these identities
out of out of it and then that is what
they're trying to survive and this is the chief obstacle
to spiritual work because spiritual work reveals to you that
all these identities are constructions but of course is precisely
because it's true that people are so threatened by that
they become hostile when you tell them this see people
become very hostile when you tell them that physical reality
isn't real why not because this calls into question everything
you're basically mm-hmm it's like pouring salt on a snail
you're going to dissolve their entire operating system and their
entire sense of self this is very painful and scary
for people so they react with hostility they get very
defensive they start to project upon you they start to
act stupid they they go into denial and all sorts
of other survival strategies are used in order to maintain
their identity they'll threaten you they'll they'll try to burn
you at the stake as a witch or you know
whatever they're gonna do they'll call you a liar they'll
send you threatening letters that's what people do what do
you think that like the Spanish Inquisition was about see
it was a bunch of Catholics who wanted to defend
their Catholic identities not because it was true but precisely
because it was false see truth needs no defense your
true identity as nothingness it doesn't need any defence at
all what needs defending us is all the fabricated identities
Christians Jews Muslims atheists as well atheists is a fabric
an atheist is a fabricated identity a scientist is a
fabricated identity don't think that just because you're a scientist
or an atheist or a rationalist or skeptic that somehow
you're immune to these identities those are all identities secular
identities are still identities you can be some fortune 500
CEO who doesn't believe in God and doesn't care about
any science or anything all you care about is just
money and business that's your identity that's what you're defending
and so when someone comes and tells you that all
of your money means nothing you're gonna get very defensive
and threatened and you're gonna be very hostile about this
of course because it undermines your entire way of life
why do people get hostile when you tell them that
you are God or that they are God precisely because
they've developed this belief in God this dualistic separate God
this sort of authority figure and they have used God
as an authority figure who sits and judges you and
other people and they use this to build a moral
system this moral system is their way of surviving because
see they they've grounded their moral system in the judgments
of God which means that it can't be questioned so
it's divine it's God's divine judgment and and justice and
so that allows them then to judge the rest of
the world because they say no I'm not judging it's
God who's judging and I'm just obeying God's rules or
God's commandments or whatever see and then you tell them
that know your God or I'm God you tell them
that and they get they get very flustered they get
very defensive about it and say no Leo how dare
you god guy can't be God you can't be God
this is blasphemy yeah that's your survival strategy for defending
that identity and the reason that it triggers you or
upsets you is precisely because it's false your identity is
false and the truth is nothing the truth is that
you're God but you're in denial about it why do
people get hostile when you tell them that gender is
a social construct for example which it is because they
don't want to admit that's something like gender can be
a social construct that's scary you're you're going down a
slippery slope there see that might get them to start
to think and question their own identity maybe that'll open
themselves up to secret homosexual urges that they've had see
they know what admit this stuff because their culture tells
them it's wrong they have part of their identity is
that homosexuality somehow deviant and wrong and somehow less than
heterosexuality see it's a slippery slope because you know if
if we start to admit that gender is a social
construct that God and religion is a social construct even
there I say science is a social construct and law
is the social construct and government is a social concert
well what's left is everything a social construct am i
a social construct maybe you'll discover that you are and
then poof those your whole life see it's very threatening
because you're attached to surviving as a physical entity and
maybe there isn't one see that maybe there isn't one
so of course such people get upset and threatened it's
only natural that's their survival strategy their survival strategy in
these cases is denial judgment criticism hatred violence bigotry closed
mindedness criticism I think I already mentioned that one yeah
so it's all that projection that's a huge one it's
all the self-deception mechanisms that I've talked about in my
self deception three-part series go check that out here's another
key insight for you you are totally oblivious to your
survival and your selfishness because oddly enough it doesn't help
your survival to be conscious of your survival strategy because
becoming conscious of survival strategies if there are low consciousness
survival strategies tends to interfere with them in the same
way that for example if you're working on Wall Street
and you're making millions of dollars every year by selling
junky stocks to to old people let's say you're running
some sort of hedge fund and you're you're fleecing people
and you're manipulating and you're exploiting but you're earning millions
of dollars doing it does it serve you to become
conscious of all that all the trickery and manipulation that
you're using it does it serve you to see that
everything you're doing is just automatic robotic survival strategy because
you're fundamentally insecure within yourself and that you're a greedy
does it serve you to know this of course not
because if you truly admitted this then you'd have to
realize that I can't keep doing that you'd have to
find higher consciousness survival strategies because it would be too
painful and also you have to somehow admit to yourself
that all the all the evil you've done in the
past that that that was wrong or that it was
selfish at least and so of course an entire culture
on Wall Street has created to preempt becoming conscious of
these survival strategies so see it's not enough that one
person on Wall Street deludes himself about the kind of
devilry that he commits every single day by working on
Wall Street that's not enough there needs to be an
entire culture all the people on Wall Street because they're
in this together need to get together and create an
entire culture a subculture really that justifies that what they're
doing is actually necessary and for the good of the
nation and so that's what they do not just on
Wall Street but everywhere in the military in charity organizations
in the government in the Republican Party the Democratic Party
every social institution justifies to itself why what why it's
saving its own ass is actually good for for everybody
else because they want to paint themselves in the best
light possible because that's what gives them the moral high
ground see you want to take the moral high ground
so it's simply not in most people's interest to become
conscious of their survival strategies consciousness makes blind selfishness untenable
that's the that's the problem with consciousness a lot of
the unconscious stuff that you used to do you can't
do anymore once your conscious consciousness comes with great responsibility
when you're really conscious you can't steal from people anymore
you can't rape people anymore you can't have slaves anymore
you can't fleece people through scams and con artistry that's
a problem for us people see cuz most people in
the world are living in in in in such a
desperate state that they need to do those things just
to survive see so in practice high consciousness teachings become
the enemy of the survival of the majority of people
because most people are surviving is such a crude low
level of consciousness that just the existence of high consciousness
teachings and high consciousness people threatens them the very existence
of it is threatening because it shows them that there's
a higher possibility and that they're too afraid to pursue
that possibility because they're too greedy or too fearful or
too selfish or too hateful or too closed-minded and of
course they need to deny that in order to stay
that way how does a closed-minded greedy bigoted person maintain
that by executing on on the greediness the fearfulness and
the closed mindedness most people grossly underestimate how selfish they
truly are because they're constantly bullshitting themselves about it and
also because they distract themselves this is another key technique
see my episode distraction the egos favorite defense mechanism most
people distract themselves from their own selfishness by externalizing the
problem and criticizing the selfishness of others and judging the
selfishness of others this is a classic technique it's of
course its its projection it's it's a very tricky and
sneaky technique because if I invest all of my time
for example building a career creating videos about how that
person is wrong and this person is wrong and that
person is evil I could spend the rest of my
life doing that and hurt a lot of money doing
that and that will be perfect smokescreen to avoid looking
inside at my own selfishness and of course from this
results all the war and chaos and and evil that
were accustomed to seeing in the world which leads us
to perhaps the most important next insight of this series
which is this that what you call evil let's put
that in quotes what you call evil is just somebody
else's survival strategy I really want you to understand this
rape slavery theft war poison murder cooze violence torture assassination
exploitation lying manipulation backstabbing cheating blackmail prostitution threats plagiarism scamming
con artistry child abuse selling drugs human trafficking corruption brainwashing
propaganda terrorism kidnapping genocide abortion cults female genital mutilation crucifixion
beheading homosexuals stoning people to death burning witches what is
all this this is somebody's way of surviving all of
these are necessary for people to be who they are
now that doesn't mean we have to be that way
in perpetuity all the way into the future we can
change humanity can change and of course individuals can change
I'm just saying that you got to see that all
of these things it's not just evil that's somehow just
happens or that it's caused by the devil no no
this is this is all coming from everybody else being
just as selfish as you and not being conscious of
what they're doing and then justifying it to themselves as
good proper and necessary so the key inside here is
that you have to stop judging other people's survival strategies
you have to go Metta and understand that there's no
one to blame for survival when you're judging a rapist
or a murderer or a warmonger or a Nazi really
what you're doing it's as ridiculous as judging a crocodile
for ambushing its prey or judging an octopus for changing
its colors they're just surviving and even more here's an
additional layer of mindfuck for you is that your judging
of these different survival strategies which you call evil that
itself is how you are surviving that's your survival strategy
you see because you're demonizing survival by ignoring your own
survival why would you judge certain survival strategies as being
wrong bad or evil unless it was central to your
survival to do so that's exactly what morality is about
morality is all about taking the moral high ground so
that you can deny other people their favourite survival strategies
by making them feel guilty about doing it see so
it helps you as the moralist that you think you
are to think that you're above rape and murder and
theft and all these things because then you can deny
other people the legitimacy of doing so and then what
you can do is you can get some other authority
figure you could go tattletale on the rapist and you
can say look that guy's a rapist look he's he's
evil punish him for me imprison him for me execute
him for me because he's a threat to me into
my family of course that's the whole game is being
played with morality now don't misunderstand me I'm not saying
that we should legalize rape I'm just saying understand why
this moral game is being played I'm not here saying
rape is good or that it's bad I'm saying I'm
just pointing out what it is it's a survival strategy
and the reaction against rape is also a survival strategy
and your reaction against me saying this if you're having
a reaction if you think that what I'm saying is
wrong and it's upsetting you that is also your survival
strategy otherwise you wouldn't be upset why would you be
upset about something that doesn't affect your survival you wouldn't
be see survival isn't bad survival is absolutely necessary it's
a precondition for all human life so you as the
moralist that you are put yourself into a very adversarial
relationship with reality when you demonize other people's survival strategies
because while you're demonizing that person over there for their
survival strategy you yourself are engaging in a survival strategy
just the very fact that you're demonizing them is already
a survival strategy so see when people judge Nazis or
rapists or murderers or whatever they think that well but
leo but but what's the problem like I'm not a
hypocrite because I'm not a rapist and I'm not a
murderer and I'm not a Nazi so there's no problem
that that's true maybe on the surface level of course
some people will actually judge a rapist and they themselves
will be a rapist so that's that's a whole other
level of hypocrisy and projection that all assume that you're
not in that situation so let's give you the medal
for the day that you're not like that but still
you have a hypocrisy problem the fundamental hypocrisy problem you
have is that all of these people at the big
picture level are just engaging in survival and so are
you and the reason that you're upset by all these
people and their survival strategies is precisely because you're vulnerable
and therefore you're gonna use any means necessary to survive
including fabricating the worldview that what those people are doing
is wrong evil and then telling yourself that you didn't
fabricate it but that it's objectively true and real and
unquestionable and that allows you to trick yourself and your
community as well because you're not just doing this alone
you're doing it as part of the community allows you
to trick everyone around you into a collective hallucination of
morality which then allows you then to to take the
moral high ground and then to dictate laws and governmental
systems which stop those activities that you don't want which
then creates a society which is conducive to how you
want to live now you might say well Leo isn't
that good what's wrong with that there's nothing wrong with
it I'm just saying it's survival and you're not conscious
of how you're doing it and also you're not conscious
that is a fantasy that you're creating it's a hallucination
so you're outraged all of your moral outrage what I'm
telling you is that all of that is [ __
] because in reality there's nothing to be morally outraged
about it's just survival is the gazelle morally outraged that
a lion chases it no because the gazelle isn't sophisticated
enough to be able to [ __ ] itself with
complex conceptual moral systems it just runs away see it
doesn't demonize the lion but if the gazelles could get
together and create a worldview what would they do they
would create a worldview where the Lions were the most
evil ones in the in the animal kingdom because that's
what would serve their survival and that's exactly what humans
do it's not good or bad it just is what
humans do it's survival survival is not good or bad
it's just survival what unites all of life it's that
we're all selfish as [ __ ] and what unites
all humans is that we're all selfish as [ __
] and we're totally dishonest about it to ourselves we
don't admit it but also some of us are much
more selfish than others so let's not pretend that all
of us are equally selfish there are degrees of selfishness
and it is important to take these into account the
reason I'm telling you all this is because it's important
as part of your growth process in your maturity process
to appreciate the brutality of life and survival it's a
very brutal game and it's important to integrate survival and
spirituality you can't hold these two things as separate a
lot of times people actually use spirituality as a sort
of pseudo survival strategy and what they do is they
use spirituality to either attain a moral high ground or
a spiritual ego that they can use than judge people
who maybe haven't gotten as high in their development and
evolution but that's then itself become survival because if you're
truly doing spirituality properly eventually spirituality will lead you to
realize that the entire game of survival is a charade
is a fantasy and that it must be transcended and
ultimately that's what you'll do if you follow spirituality to
its ultimate conclusion but of course most people are not
cool with this most people only want spirituality as an
enhancement to their survival strategy which is why we get
religion that's what religion is Christianity Islam Hinduism Judaism even
Buddhism in certain cases it's for most people to transcend
survival is such a radical thing that they can't even
open their mind to the possibility that religion or spirituality
actually is leading them towards that instead they co-opt spirituality
as just an additional tool that they can use to
help themselves to survive that's why this work is so
tricky because your ego is always going to co-opt these
ideas even the stuff that I teach with actualize that
org you've probably noticed that your ego constantly keeps co-opting
the things that I say in order to actually build
a sort of a spiritual self-actualization identity rather than actually
transcending all of that and so self-actualization becomes part of
your survival strategy watch out for that notice that it's
a very tricky trap also it's important at the same
time to realize that all survival is actually done out
of love and this is what unifies selfishness and selflessness
everything is made out of love every human action is
done out of love even even every animal action is
ultimately done out of love you know why does the
why does the lion chase the gazelle because he loves
life as a lion because the lion loves his family
ultimately and the only way he can maintain his family
is by hunting down a gazelle why does the bank
robber rob the bank out of love out of love
of money or out of love of being a criminal
or out of love for his family if he needs
to provide for them see it's just different degrees of
love there can be very high degrees of love and
kind of low consciousness degrees of love so all the
stuff that you call evil that's a low consciousness degree
of love it's a very partial love it's love only
for a very limited self whereas the higher versions of
love our love for self as the entire universe the
universal self so that's the only difference between devils and
saints they're both doing out of love but the devil
is doing at a very partial limited divided form of
love whereas the saint is doing it out of a
universal form of love and also very importantly the saint
understands that the devil is doing it out of love
if you don't understand this pull then you can't really
be a saint because the only way that the saint
can truly love universally is by realizing that he is
all the devil's as well and so the saint doesn't
really fight the devil's because the saint just realizes that
they are me and so really the saint loves the
devil's to death you might say this removes the duality
between selfishness and selflessness and always remember ultimately that the
devil is God in disguise all of it is won
all of it is God so make sure that you
don't hold survival as bad and that's very tricky that's
very hard to do because all of your impulses all
of your survival impulses are pushing you towards seeing good
and bad in the world good and bad that distinction
is itself a core survival strategy see only people who
have transcended survival can lay down the label evil and
bad because they literally don't see it in the world
anymore because those labels are a part of survival and
so so long as you're surviving and you're stuck with
in survival you haven't transcended it to anything higher then
you're gonna have to keep using that label of bad
and evil you can't help it you're stuck on autopilot
that's what survival is you know what evil is really
evil is anything that hinders your survival that's what you
call evil and this explains why evil is relative and
not any kind of absolute or objective fact and why
everybody has a different idea of what constitutes evil oftentimes
the reverse like you know in the Middle East they
might say that America is evil and in America we
might say that the Middle East portions the Middle East
are evil who's right it is however it looks to
you it's a perspectival relativistic matter precisely because evil just
means that it's against my survival so from the United
States point of view parts of the Middle East are
evil because it hinders American survival and vice versa nobody's
right or wrong because it's just a difference of survival
needs difference of perspective but of course people don't even
want to admit this because just to admit this already
now places a big burden upon you because now you
need to actually consider the other side you consider other
perspectives you see so multi-perspective ilysm in and of itself
is a dangerous notion for most human beings to allow
into their worldview which is why multi-perspective ilysm is so
rare it's a great burden and responsibility to take on
to actually consider others people other people's perspectives as though
they were as important as your own this is antithetical
to what the ego and the self wants the self
wants to only consider its own perspective on things you
see notice that playing victim is a big survival strategy
people love to play victim notice it within politics notice
it within relationships in intimate relationships or if you have
a conflict within your family what happens usually it's a
game of one-upsmanship as to who is the biggest victim
or who was wronged first or for example the israeli-palestinian
conflict what does that conflict ultimately boil down to the
Israelis claim that they're the biggest victim and the Palestinians
claim that they're the biggest victim who's right same thing
happens in your intimate relationships when there's an argument between
you and your spouse or your boyfriend or girlfriend you
try to claim that you've been victimized by them and
they try to claim that you know no you you
victimized me first you said this thing to me and
that's why you're a bad person then and that's why
you did me wrong and you say no no no
but before I said that you said this other thing
and you said it first so actually you're the wrong
one and so I'm actually the victim and I have
the moral high ground you see is this very twisted
and counterintuitive because you would think like in a debate
what people would want to argue over is who's the
strongest one right they'd want to prove their strength but
actually in these conflicts usually it's people are trying to
prove that they're in the weak one he's like I
was victimized I'm the weak one I deserve sympathy I
deserve redress and retribution and and justice and you don't
because you're the aggressor you see which is why every
war that every nation has ever waged they've accused the
aggressor the aggressor has accused the other side of being
the aggressor see so like when the United States goes
and invades Iraq we call Iraq the aggressor they force
us to do it see how it works this is
devilry inaction this is how the human mind works both
individually and collectively start to notice this also start to
notice that if you did not care about survival nothing
would be evil to you which of course is precisely
God's perspective because God is nothingness because God is infinite
God is immortal it can't be harmed you can't harm
reality and so to it nothing is evil or to
put another way everything is love when you realize there's
no evil then everything becomes love but you as a
selfish ego who's busy surviving as this organism that you
think you are you can't see infinite love because the
stuff that's gonna kill you you can't hold it as
love because you're you and you've placed you above love
so really the choices you can have yourself or you
can have love but you can't have both so which
are you gonna choose the denial that evil is relative
is itself a survival function how do you defeat evil
by going meta and by transcending survival by realizing that
all evil is actually done out of love and of
course this is one of the most counterintuitive moves that
you can make and people people are so scared of
this notion because they're so attached to survival they can't
see outside of themselves and their survival agenda that it
doesn't even occur to most people in their entire life
and they can live for 80 years and it never
occurs to them that that the way to defeat evil
is through love most people try to defeat evil by
doing more evil they think that by judging evil this
will stop evil and actually this just creates more evil
which explains why there's so much evil in the world
it's very counterintuitive to stop evil most people who try
to stop evil actually create more evil so watch out
about that you know because if it did it you'd
figure if it wasn't this way we would have stopped
evil thousands of years ago why would evil continue for
thousands and thousands of years all the way into the
21st century only if it was extremely counterintuitive and nobody
could stomach doing it that's the only way evil can
persist and that's exactly how it works another key insight
for you survival is absolutely relentless the ego is absolutely
relentless so you might wonder likely oh why is life
so hard why all this suffering why all this self-deception
why are people so evil and why is awakening so
hard it's simply because you're attached to survival and that
drive is so utterly relentless that you know nothing else
you can't help being evil you can't help being the
devil that you are it's relentless this is not a
a moral condemnation of you I'm not saying that you're
a devil and therefore you're bad it's just ignorance you're
just acting out of ignorance and unconsciousness and so therefore
you're not morally responsible for this you're not bad at
all you're just an ignorant devil if you knew better
if you were more conscious you'd stop doing it but
you don't know how to do that unless you do
in which case you're not a devil or you're less
of a devil than you would have been another key
insight for you is that survival is so important that
you the ego cannot be trusted with it so most
of your survival functions are automatic precisely because it's too
important to entrust to your conscious mind so its relegated
to your subconscious mind so for example your heartbeat you
know that's absolutely important if your heart stops beating for
even a minute you're gonna be dead so of course
that means we can't leave it up to your conscious
mind it's all done automatically for you likewise most of
your emotions work this way you're not conscious of how
you get angry or fearful or why you get excited
or horny or why you get lonely or depressed you're
not conscious of any of these emotions they're acting you
they're playing you this is how the body gets done
what needs to be done is by playing you you're
not playing it it's playing you like a piano with
these emotional keys and chords that it strikes every day
to get you to do what it needs to do
and the stuff that's relegated to your conscious mind to
your ego is some important stuff but a lot of
it is not that important the most important stuff is
is too important to leave to you because if you
if you had to say about whether you get horny
or not or whether you react with pain or not
to getting you know stabbed in the foot or something
like that you'd be dead long though you wouldn't be
here listening to this you'd be dead already see this
this stuff has to be relentless absolutely relentless and this
is precisely what creates that sense of reality a physical
reality a lot of people mistake pain and suffering for
reality and I think well Leo if it's painful it
must be real no that's actually precisely how the illusion
of reality gets created is we create a knee-jerk automatic
reaction from you against pain and suffering which prevents you
from ever questioning it the less conscious you are the
less you understand your own survival strategies therefore unconscious people
behave like Devils they are obliviously selfish shamelessly selfish and
of course the final twist that they put on it
the the ultimate devilish irony is that they think that
they are angels they think they're saving the world no
Hitler thought he was saving the world from his perspective
in his eyes he was an angel saving the world
against Devils that's precisely how a devil sees himself of
course unconscious survival strategies as I said before often short-term
but I didn't say also that they were mostly they're
often unsustainable and unequal because it actually takes a lot
of awareness and consciousness to have ecological sustainable survival strategies
therefore a lot of survival strategies which are short-term and
very kind of opportunistic they end up backfiring in catastrophic
ways and the reason this happens is ultimately because these
short-term survival strategies when they come from pure selfishness lacking
a larger perspective they are fundamentally dualistic because there's that
separation between self and other and environment and so therefore
when you separate what is ultimately one you stop seeing
the holistic interconnections between you others and the environment and
therefore you end up shooting yourself in the foot because
in the end you cannot treat the world or other
people as though they're separate from you you can't for
example just be a rich person and say ah to
hell with the poor people it doesn't matter as long
as I have my yacht and my private jet and
as long as I'm making a killing on Wall Street
then it doesn't matter what happens to those poor people
that's their problem because you see if you in the
short term that works in the short term that works
but in the long run doesn't work because eventually the
people become so poor and so desperate that they rise
up they'd rather pitchforks and they'd come for you in
your mansion they'd bust down your private gate and then
they they wrote they roast you on a spit and
they confiscate your private jet and your yacht and everything
else see so it only works for so long likewise
you can't just be like some oil executive which says
that oh well as long as I'm making my millions
and billions selling oil [ __ ] global warming [
__ ] the earth it doesn't matter because I can
just like live in my own little bubble I can
build up I can have so much money I can
just build an underwater city and live there and I
don't care if if the global temperature rises a couple
of degrees centigrade or if the ice caps no I
don't care I'll have enough money to to just buy
some nice property on some mountaintop or whatever that works
in the short-term but it doesn't work in the long
term see because you yourself are gonna suffer because you
know maybe you're an oil executive but you still for
example enjoy going to the coral reefs in Australia and
maybe you enjoy going to Alaska and seeing some polar
bears because you like wildlife people most people like wildlife
and maybe maybe your children for example like the rainforest
and maybe maybe your daughter becomes like a marine biologist
or something and somebody else in your family you know
isn't as rich as you so they live in a
city like Los Angeles where the smog and the pollution
just like you know keeps getting worse and worse and
worse and eventually they get asthma or some sort of
cancer of the lungs and then they die and then
it affects you even if you're living in your bubble
it's still gonna affect you because in the end the
whole point of spirituality is to realize you can't live
in a bubble you can't separate yourself from the world
you're part of it you're the whole of it even
if you do manage to separate yourself and some underwater
bubble and live there all by yourself with no friends
and no family and nobody else because you're all alone
and you're all self-sufficient and you've got your billions of
dollars well realize first of all the economy could collapse
which would just all your billions of dollars but also
in the end even if you have everything you want
and you're sitting on a mountain of gold bars or
a crypto coins or something in the end you're gonna
be sitting that bubble all alone disconnected from the world
you're gonna be spiritually bankrupt loveless disappointed lonely disconnected from
mankind and from your environment and you'll probably kill yourself
or at the very least you'll live a a miserable
life full of suffering and you'll miss out on the
greatest joy of life which is to realize the interconnectedness
of it all and to work towards towards that truth
rather than to work towards devilry which is fragmentation see
but it takes a lot of consciousness and fearlessness and
selflessness to realize some of these ideas that I'm presenting
here then your survival strategy starts to change so the
problem with selfishness is not simply that it hurts others
but that because self and other ultimately one it hurts
yourself so ultimately the devil ends up shooting himself in
the foot and it's by awakening to that mechanic that
the devil realizes that oh yeah my devilry it's not
gonna work in the long run it only works the
short term and it's not satisfying even for me so
why keep it up and that is the beginning of
true spiritual growth and the beginning of of a possibility
of transcending survival it might seem that unchecked selfishness is
the best possible strategy for surviving but this is not
true because life is nonlinear and life is counterintuitive and
there are twists and turns and things fold back on
themselves so often unchecked selfishness works quite well in simple
scenarios but as the environment and the system becomes more
complex the selfishness becomes too counterproductive this is why for
example Trump's america-first policy is so foolish from trumps point
of view and his level of consciousness and the consciousness
level of his followers it seems like it's a smart
strategy because by America just being more selfish it's like
yeah well we're not giving anything to the rest of
the world we're just gonna sort of like be by
ourselves and do what we want and flex our muscle
and put us first and that's gonna get us the
most that's gonna give us more jobs and all this
other stuff but this is a misdiagnosing of the problem
because our world truly is global and it is only
going to become more and more interconnected and so this
policy of putting your nation first this nationalistic policy is
a dead end it can't possibly work and the further
society advances and the more complex it becomes the more
integrated everything becomes the advantages of the integration are so
huge that to then go back to a policy of
putting yourself first is going to be extremely counterproductive and
in the end it's gonna lead to a net loss
and so see if trump was a systemic thinker he
would understand this but of course he's not a systemic
thinker people sometimes argue with me and say Oh leo
but but Trump is a brilliant systems thinker because he
can manipulate systems no no systems thinking is not about
manipulating systems I'll give you that Trump is brilliant at
manipulating systems but that is not systems thinking systems thinking
is about working towards the benefit of the whole system
because one recognizes that everything is interconnected and that you
are not separate from anybody else that's the that's the
true meaning of systems thinking and of course Trump is
is nowhere near that nor are most of his followers
they don't understand this because they're they're not cognitively developed
or consciously developed enough to see the interconnectedness of all
things they think they can get away with just being
devils and of course that's what they're trying to do
but it's not gonna work it's it's obviously not working
already and it'll only get worse the more you try
to push it in that direction this is the problem
with nationalism as human society evolves greater complexity unchecked selfishness
will work less and less this is a very clear
trend you can see throughout history your student history you
know like for example tyranny and monarchy are no longer
sustainable forms of government almost anywhere on the earth anymore
or as they were just 500 years ago why is
that because the world has become more interconnected and so
there's less and less tolerance of tyranny and monarchy there's
more respect for individual rights there's more respect for this
idea that we're all part of a community and that
you can't just execute people because they have a different
religion than you whereas five hundred years ago that was
totally normal it was totally normal in fact it was
expected that you execute people who have a different religion
than you because their threat they're a threat they're undermining
your sense of identity but now our identities have expanded
such that we no longer most of us I hope
at least no longer feel threatened if somebody next door
our neighbor is a different religion than us or as
an atheist or as a homosexual we don't feel I
need to kill them because we're more secure because our
identity is now more global a lot of it has
to do simply with the media the movies you watch
shapes how you form your identity and the movies you
watch are so international now that it's untenable for a
person to be born in the 21st century and to
really have a hatred and fear of Jews or Christians
or Muslims or atheists or homosexual or whatever it just
like it it's a non-issue but 100 years ago it
was a huge issue on the other hand though we
also have to say that being totally selfless also doesn't
work because you die too easily so part of your
job in life is to figure out the right balance
between selfishness and selflessness there is no formula for this
it's different for everybody because people are different and people
live in very different environments in some environments like if
you're living in a prison or you're living in some
ghetto where they're a bunch of gangs running around you
can't adopt the same kind of hippie lovey dovey strategy
that you can adopt when you're living in some stage
green or stage turquoise spiritual ashram like very different environments
you see let me also underscore that survival comes in
degrees like I said not all survival is the same
so we've got to be careful here we got to
make fine distinctions some degree of survival is always required
some survival is harmonious some survival is pathological this is
not a judgment right see I'm not making a moral
judgment this is important when I say that some survival
is pathological rather we're looking at how well does our
survival strategy allow us to live in harmony with others
and with our environment if it doesn't then it's pathological
literally it's a cancer so some survival strategies are cancers
that eat themselves alive destroy themselves so part of growing
up and maturing as an individual but also as societies
and governments as humans is for us to find healthier
and healthier survival strategies we can't all just escape survival
like that it's a gradual inching up process of bootstrapping
process that has been happening since the very dawn of
human civilization right we've been refining our survival strategies to
be more holistic and harmonious and not always have we
succeeded in fact right now we're sort of at a
precipice where our survival strategies are very unharmonious threatened the
entire planet in in a multitude of ways so by
finding these healthier survival strategies you grow you become more
conscious and you become more happy you become more peaceful
extreme survival strategies equal excessive selfishness which equals unconsciousness which
equals corruption which leads to chaos and a lot of
upheaval which of course threatens life because life requires order
and a certain degree of stability as a community we
need to reach a consensus about which survival strategies are
healthy and acceptable this is not avoidable so don't make
the mistake of thing you know what I'm advocating for
here is anarchy or no government not at all we
just need to be very conscious about how we do
government now here's another key insight for you survival is
tail-chasing all survival ultimately cannot win all survival ultimately fails
it's just a question of how long will it work
50 years 60 years 70 years 80 years a hundred
years but it's got to fail every organism dies every
organization ultimately dies or changes or involves to the point
where it's no longer recognizable survival is fundamentally unsatisfying because
it always ends in failure so wouldn't it be nice
if we could transcend survival somehow why can't survival ever
ever be one because because to do so would require
freezing all of reality that's literally what it would mean
to win at survival it means that you could rearrange
matter in such a way that you can create a
fixed static corner of the universe where it doesn't change
anymore but if you did that that would [ __
] the infinite diversity and beauty and goodness of the
entire creation which is never going to be allowed under
the grand design because the grand ultimate design is to
maximize diversity beauty and goodness to maximize perspective to maximize
diversity therefore you cannot gain a permanent monopoly over reality
because as soon as that happened the flow and motion
and creativity of reality would would be destroyed and this
would produce for a lesser reality and reality is designed
in such a way that it maximizes goodness through diversity
because ultimately all reality is one one part of reality
can never gain a monopoly or total power all over
all the other parts of reality which is why ultimately
all monopolies collapse and all life must die because you
see if for example humans were able to make themselves
immortal to never die well that means that by doing
so we would in a sense not allow other humans
to be born because you know we can only have
so many humans so by by this generation dying we
let a new generation come into being so we kind
of share the experience of life with others but if
we hoard it and we say no only I want
to live only this generations gonna live forever [ __
] everybody else [ __ ] the future generations then
we're destroying future generations in that in that way you
see and this this actually this actually lessens life this
ruins life so life is is meant to be cyclical
and impermanent that's a fundamental feature of reality is impermanence
now by this point you're probably thinking well leo so
what do we do about this this sounds all very
bleak is there anything we can do can we escape
survival well survival is inescapable so long as you want
to live even an enlightened person must engage in survival
you notice enlightened people still have to [ __ ]
they have to eat they have to drink despite what
some of them might claim they all do it they
all engage in survival now their survival could be much
more purified than an average person but they still engage
in survival as long as they're in a body you
know a body can only stay a body as long
as it's engaging in survival but there is a possibility
to change your relationship to survival to gain some sense
of freedom and relief that is possible it's possible to
improve your survival significantly that's possible there's also the possibility
of Nirvana moksha liberation being and unconditional love which we
should talk about now so in part one I ask
you to think about as a bonus question what is
it survival so let me give you the answer now
it's tricky because most of stuff you do is survival
but a rock for example is not a survival a
psychedelic experience is not survival non-dual consciousness or being is
not survival a meditative state of Samadhi of union is
not survival unconditional love God's unconditional love is not survival
truth God itself beauty and the absolute these are not
survival so the best answer this question of what's not
survivalist is simply being this requires that you actually have
a shift in your state of consciousness out of the
survival mode that you're costly in where your mind is
projecting onto the world and you actually look at an
object for the first time in your life and you
see it as the being of the object rather than
what the object is for you or what it means
for you or how you're interpreting it so for example
you can sit there and look at your hand like
this just from looking at your hand for a long
time until you start to see your hand as being
not as a hand it's it ceases being a hand
it ceases being an object which doesn't mean that it
changes shape or color it still keeps its shape in
color the raw sensations perhaps don't change so much but
your interpretations the context within which you're putting this hand
changes to the point where you look at this hand
and you longer even recognize it as a hand or
an object anymore it has no utility or function anymore
you don't care about what happens to it anymore it
doesn't matter if it gets destroyed or not you don't
think of it as your hand anymore and literally if
you do this long enough eventually you'll reach a state
of Samadhi where actually the separation between you as the
the onlooker the subject and the hand is an object
that will collapse you will enter Samadhi and then all
there will be is just like a hand floating and
for the first time you will you will look at
the hand as what it actually is pure being so
of course this is not unique to your hand you
can do with any physical object you can do it
with the entire room that you're sitting in you can
do with your physical body you can do it with
anything you can do it with other person you can
recognize the being of it by stripping it of all
of your survival projections see the problem is is that
even when you look at a rock for example when
most people look at a rock that's still not truly
an escape from survival because most people when they look
at a rock in the back of their mind their
subconscious mind is doing all sorts of sneaky stuff it's
either putting value or meaning into the rock or it's
saying that the rock is meaningless and unimportant or it's
just calling in Iraq or it's putting that rock into
some kind of context like for example you look at
a rock and you might say oh well that's a
that's a such-and-such a rock from such such a place
such-and-such a time you know you're putting it into a
context all of that is still part of your survival
but to look at that rock and not even see
a rock there anymore that would be you breaking through
the veil of survival into being and of course this
is what meditation is about this is what you experience
when you do psychedelics psychedelics put you into that Samadhi
state of pure being and it's just this magical state
of where you look around the room for the first
time in your life and you realize the magic of
being and it strikes you as pure truth and beauty
in God and that's right that's what it is and
and that's a very sharp contrast to your ordinary state
of consciousness where you're in survival mode where your mind
is constantly thinking ahead about what you need to do
what you need to say in order to survive the
next day or the next minute or the next hour
now it's it's a little tricky for example I wouldn't
say that meditation itself is not survival because actually most
people who meditate they're meditating out of survival and even
the pursuit of enlightenment itself I wouldn't say that it's
not survival because most people are doing it out of
survival they're doing it because they're suffering and they want
to escape suffering or they're doing it because their ego
has some notion that they're gonna find the truth or
the ego wants to co-opt that enlightenment for itself and
turn it into an identity that's still all survival but
you know we're not perfect we got to start with
where we're at so it's perfectly fine for example to
pursue enlightenment or to do meditation for egoic and survival
purposes at first I mean you got to start where
you're at you can't just become a saint overnight so
it's fine you know most people start to meditate because
of very selfish reasons like it helps them to relax
helps to quiet the monkey mind which drives them crazy
it helps to maybe relieve some some stress or some
pain that's all fine likewise with psychedelics and a lot
of people take psychedelics for very selfish survival reasons for
example they take a psychedelic because they want to escape
their depression or they're bored even you know bored in
this survival so you know you're just bored so you
take a psychedelic okay fine but see it doesn't matter
how you get there once you get to being once
you get to Samadhi whether it's your meditation psychedelic er
or whatever else once you're there you're there it doesn't
matter how you got there now you're in pure being
now you're out of survival for the time being the
problem is that these Samadhi zand these psychedelic experiences usually
don't last very long and then you come back and
you're back into survival and then you see oh man
now I got to deal with all this survival nonsense
again and you see just how stressful it is you
see how it robs you of your joy and beauty
and you feel disconnected from God when you're back into
survival mode and that's exactly correct and that's why these
states are so important for you to experience it's so
important to have a few of these mystical experiences whether
through psychedelics or meditation or the pasta retreat or whatever
because at least then you have some new reference point
of something beyond survival and you realize that survival is
actually a small aspect of a much larger thing that's
going on here and that can help you to then
refine your life refine your survival strategies so that they
become less selfish more universal more ecological this creates a
better society improves your life reduces your suffering until maybe
eventually at some point you might reach so I'm a
very deep level of awakening but even if you do
as long as you still want to be alive here
as a human you're still gonna have to maintain some
semblance of survival you can't just completely ignore survival unless
like literally or you're prepared to die so that's just
how how it seems to work the quality of your
life defence depends directly on how much you've transcended your
survival the wisest people are the ones who go as
directly as possible to transcending their survival but this is
this is pretty rare usually people aren't this wise here's
another key insight survival has no meaning value or purpose
in the ultimate sense how could it because the whole
thing was predicated upon a fantasy to begin with there
is and never was a reason that you should survive
survival only appears valuable if you buy into it but
of course there's no reason why you should buy into
it you buy into it irrationally but at the same
time if you didn't buy into it then you wouldn't
be here thinking about it and I wouldn't be here
talking about it so in a sense survival becomes its
own end point meaning and purpose in this way survival
is tautological it's a self-fulfilling prophecy it justifies itself it's
selfish it invents itself which is of course how it
must be cuz how else could anything exist if everything
is one it has to invent itself it has to
fabricate itself it has to pull itself up by its
bootstraps it must be a strange loop and that's what
it is the ultimate truth is that survival is an
absurd farce and that you have an infinite number of
lives and that actually you can't really die what you
truly are your true identity of nothingness can't die it's
immortal but so long as form exists and it wants
to keep existing it has to struggle to maintain itself
liberation comes by breaking this relentless cycle of survival by
breaking your attachment to life and to maintaining yourself as
any kind of form which means you have to recognize
that your true nature is formless and that all forms
are okay you can occupy the human form for a
while nothing wrong with it nothing bad about it it's
just that recognize that there are certain costs that come
to maintaining this form a certain impact you need to
have on your environment you can't do it isolated from
your environment and also recognize that your form will end
so don't get too attached to it and it's going
to end rather soon a lot sooner than you expect
so don't get too attached to it the more attached
you are to it the more of a devil you
will be in trying to maintain it and if you
really want to end suffering and be ultimately happy free
yourself from this whole burden and escape the entire cycle
not by destroying your form but by realizing that you
you never were the form you were the formless the
whole time you've mistaken yourself for the form survival is
the greatest obstacle to truth survival necessarily corrupts perception and
reasoning because perception reasoning are central to one's ability to
survive so it must be corrupted and co-opted which is
why most human beings are actually incapable of doing good
science or proper reasoning because they don't realize that their
mind has been co-opted by survival what keeps you from
awakening is your attachment to all your survival strategies and
changing your survival strategies is hard by design because survival
tends to be conservative it tends to maintain homeostasis because
every survival strategy must work in the real world it
has to actually stand the test of a reality you
can't just concoct some survival strategy in your own mind
and then it's gonna work it needs to be brutally
tested against reality which is what evolution and natural selection
does you might object and wonder here but leo you
said that many survival strategies are fantasies and now it
seems like you're saying that survival strategies have to actually
work in the real world so then they're not fantasies
which is it it's a little tricky survival strategies are
fantasies for most humans but see there's an additional wrinkle
because we're a collective of social creatures this allows us
a very unique thing it allows us to create a
collective fantasy which then becomes our reality so for example
a bunch of humans can get together and create the
fantasy of money we can agree that these green paper
notes somehow have some sort of worth or value and
if we all agree on it even though it's all
a fantasy as long as we agree that it's real
and we act like it's real it becomes real and
it becomes very effective as a survival strategy because it
allows us to now trade very easily in a way
that wouldn't be possible if we were having to trade
cows and houses and other things see so you can't
just come up with any random fantasy your fantasy has
to be good enough to convince others that it's real
and that's actually not that easy to do you would
think that well leo so so anyone can just sit
and cope with all sorts of horseshit and then manipulate
society that way not quite the the horseshit that you
spin has to work within the entire already spun web
of horseshit that humanity has been spinning for the last
5000 years or so right so it has to fit
with that and so in that sense the horseshit becomes
its own reality you see like Christianity has become its
own reality Islam has become its own reality science has
become its own reality and so now if you want
to be a scientist you have to work within the
fiction of science if you want to be a Muslim
you have to work within the fiction of Islam and
so forth so just because a lot of these things
are socially constructed does not mean that they're not significant
or serious there are very serious and sometimes you do
have to conform yourself to them if you want to
survive that's precisely the point is that they shape survival
so much for example if you get too out of
line with your culture a mob might arise and you
know come for you with pitchforks so in that sense
what the mob believes becomes real because they will ultimately
rather pitchforks and come for you and that's gonna be
real you're gonna feel that when they're poking you with
those pitchforks alright so in wrapping this up let's give
you your homework assignment I want you to compare the
survival strategies of your mom your dad your brother or
your sister your friends and even your cat and your
dog and of course yourself hopefully you've studied your own
survival strategy by this point keep studying that of course
because you're you're nowhere near done with that project but
but also I want you to compare especially within your
own household because see now I want you to notice
the differences I want you to notice how survival is
very relative and contextual and different for everybody so even
though if you're all living in the same household like
your family you're literally in the same environment but still
you have very different survival strategies for example your mom
your dad versus yourself or your your brother or sister
or your cat so notice that and study that notice
what annoys your cat what annoys your dog what needs
does your mom have that your dad doesn't have and
vice-versa don't judge them just observe a lot of observing
and compare that with yourself and then notice how that
creates a lot of conflict within the family all of
that that's where all your conflicts from where else why
would there be conflict if not for differences in survival
strategy and then if you want you can broaden that
out to an exploration of of your company or your
political party or your government or whatever I also want
you to study the survival strategies not just of humans
but also animals and for this nature documentaries are really
good look at the survival strategy between a lion and
a gazelle between a mosquito and a bird how differently
they survive between a fennec fox and a jerboa I
mentioned these specifically because I'm gonna post a video on
my blog go check out my blog you'll see a
video there a really great documentary like a short one
of the fennec fox hunting the jerboa in the desert
it's an amazingly shot a little documentary check it out
and just take a look at how every part of
the fox and every part of the jerboa are perfectly
designed to work in that specific environment it couldn't work
anywhere else it couldn't work in the rain forest it
couldn't work in the Arctic it works in that particular
desert it wouldn't even work in all deserts just that
particular desert like the hairs on the feet of the
tree boa the nose the whiskers on the fox and
the ears that it has in all of this and
how it all fits together the eye sight at night
and all this and I would all fit together how
one runs away the other one chases it and this
is this is survival but then I want you to
see that you are that your boa hopping through your
life and the environment you're surviving in is not a
desert but 21st century America or Europe or India or
wherever you live your culture is the milieu in which
you're trying to survive if a thing is alive at
all it must have a sophisticated survival strategy which fits
perfectly with its environment because if it didn't it'd be
dead and in humans compare survival in different parts of
the world for this documentaries can also be really good
baby watch some vice documentaries of how different people live
there are some great ones out there for example compare
the survival strategy of someone living in New York City
versus on a farm in Alabama very different and of
course it's not just what they do for work it's
how they educate their kids it's their world view it's
their religion it's their culture it's their values it's their
ethics it's their morals it's their political beliefs it's all
of that or compare survival at a corporate headquarters or
Wall Street versus survival in a prison or in a
gang or in the Middle East compare survival in Africa
versus Scandinavia versus Alaska I posted some videos in the
past a long time ago on my blog about this
great reality TV show about survival in Alaska I think
it was called life below zero if I'm not mistaken
great great show which shows you just how different survival
is in Alaska it follows a group of individuals who
live all by themselves in Alaska and just kind of
like live off the wildlife live in the middle of
nowhere off the grid and it's just amazing to watch
because it just shows you how disconnected most of us
are living in big cities from from our survival so
just start to start to look at all this and
put it all together put all the pieces together and
you're gonna see you're gonna see what all of this
life and self-actualization spirituality is all about and that's what
I love the most is kind of seeing the big
picture by putting all the little pieces together and I've
told you from the very beginning that one of my
biggest objectives with actualize that or ggest to help you
to see the big picture in a way that few
other channels or teachers do very few people do this
because it takes a lot of laying of groundwork you
know putting out hundreds of videos to ultimately be able
to put all the pieces together and it's then that
you get to really appreciate the the sophistication and beauty
and intelligence of life by putting all these pieces together
you notice just how amazing it is how it all
fits together so intelligently how well-designed all of it is
it's it's it's remarkable and that that's what makes me
so excited about this work is seeing these big pictures
and that's why we go into such depth and also
so much breadth covering various kinds of topics because ultimately
now as actualize that already sort of starting to reach
a sort of pinnacle we're interconnecting a lot of topics
and it's really the payoff now comes if you've been
watching my videos for years the payoff now is finally
starting to to come to fruition because now we're starting
to interconnect all the stuff we talked about God and
quantum mechanics and strange loops and collective ego and spiral
dynamics and whatever else I've talked about so many different
topics you know now we're starting to piece them together
and we get to see the really big picture emerge
but you can only get that if you put in
the work of actually watching all this stuff diligently and
keeping it in the back your mind and thinking about
it doing the exercises following up with the homework and
watching the videos and examples and documentaries and so forth
and then piecing it all together this is a this
is a multi-year long project but I hope that you
get to see the fruits of that for yourself so
in conclusion rewatched this two-part series on survival again later
this year next year keep REE watching it because there's
there's still I guarantee a lot of stuff got survival
that you've you've overlooked because you really need to study
it for yourself closely to start to appreciate all the
stuff that I put in these two episodes become an
expert on how survival works and that's it for today
please click that like button for me and come check
out actualize that org that's my website you'll find my
blog where I'm posting new insights and ideas and videos
and documentaries and bonus material you'll find the forum you'll
find that book lists will find the life purpose course
I recently updated the book list with amazing life-changing books
rare stuff that you're not gonna hear or find anywhere
else so be sure to check that out that update
is free for those who bought the book in the
book lists in the past I've updated the book list
eight times now I think for free for those of
you who bought it originally and of course if you
buy now then you get all those updates automatically and
the last thing that I'll say is you must do
the observation work to be able to follow actualised org
you're not going to understand the advanced stuff that I'm
talking about unless you do the homework that's the cost
it's not enough to treat this as entertainment the way
you do with other videos this is serious stuff we're
doing here this is not a joke we are developing
the most sophisticated and advanced understanding of humanity and life
and reality that has ever been accomplished in human history
that's what we're doing that's a grand statement but that's
what we're doing and it's different than Buddhism and Hinduism
and other traditions it's way bigger than that way broader
than that we're seeing a much bigger picture than you
will see through Buddhism I guarantee you that it's different
what we're doing here is new and different this is
cutting-edge stuff don't think it'll come easily don't think that
your friends and family will support you in this it
will be emotionally difficult it requires investment from you that's
precisely why it hasn't been done before this is not
easy stuff to do this takes up my whole life
doing this you see um but it's worth it it's
worth it so start doing the work start actually observing
don't speculate don't theorize don't disagree with me don't it
doesn't matter about all that do the observation work the
observation work will reveal what's true to you you don't
need to believe me the observation work will demonstrate to
you what's the case all that I'm doing is I'm
I'm presenting the conclusions of various kinds of observation work
that I've done and of course there's kinds of theory
that I've studied and triangulated various conclusions from I'm just
presenting that to you not as an ideology that you
need to believe but as something for you to pursue
and to realize for yourself and if I make any
mistakes which I of course can make mistakes I'm not
infallible then it's through the observation work that you'll discover
my mistakes and then you'll correct those not through leaving
me stupid critical comments and trolling in all this this
this doesn't help do the observation work and of course
you don't want to I know you don't want to
I struggle with the - you're gonna procrastinate you're gonna
be lazy you're gonna cope with all sorts of excuses
of course of course you will because if you fully
understand all the stuff that I talk about it's gonna
it's gonna be the end of you but luckily there
will be a new you you will be reborn rise
out of the ashes like the Phoenix as they say
but of course you're gonna resist that in the meantime
so you know struggle with it push yourself get out
of your comfort zone and make yourself uncomfortable and also
just be patient be patient with this whole process it's
gonna come together for you I promise you we're slowly
putting the pieces together this is a hobby this is
a long-term hobby that you're doing here you know some
people like to collect bottle caps some people like to
collect coins I like to collect concepts the deepest concepts
about life and I like to piece them together and
see life from higher vantage points that then other people
have ever seen it from before and I like to
look at it from different vantage points from different perspectives
because there's not just one and that's my hobby and
so I'm sharing that hobby with you and I'm trying
to infect you with my passion for that hobby and
in that process not only will you understand more of
yourself in the world in humanity but you will hopefully
also ultimately end up liberating yourself and that's what's going
to make it all worth you
