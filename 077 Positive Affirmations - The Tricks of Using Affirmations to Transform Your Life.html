            <ul>
    <li><b>Positive Affirmations defined</b>: Positive affirmations are concise statements repeated to oneself to reprogram the subconscious mind with empowering thoughts. 
</li><li><b>The power of affirmations</b>: Affirmations can fabricate self-confidence and faith which helps in achieving goals. Even if a goal isn't immediately real, affirmations help envision a possible outcome. 
</li><li><b>Repetition and Consistency</b>: It's crucial to repeat positive affirmations daily and consistently to effectively recalibrate the subconscious mind. A good practice is setting aside five minutes daily for this exercise, similar to training a pet through repetition.
</li><li><b>Choosing affirmations</b>: Affirmations should be short, memorable phrases. They can be centred around any life goal or problem area such as money, fitness, relationships etc.
</li><li><b>Believing in affirmations</b>: Affirmations work on the principle that the subconscious mind will accept what it is consistently fed, whether true or false. 
</li><li><b>Using affirmations 'correctly'</b>: It's important to use affirmations correctly for them to work. Consistency is key, doing them every day without fail; otherwise, they could be ineffective.
</li><li><b>Length of time for affirmations</b>: Commit to repeating a specific affirmation for at least a month, even longer if the limiting belief is deep-rooted or severe. 
</li><li><b>The form of affirmations</b>: Affirmations should be short and concentrated phrases; they are not lengthy narratives, abstract notions or flowery mission statements.
</li><li><b>Affirmation should be easily memorable</b>: Affirmations should be simple and easily memorizable so that they can be repeated many times within a span of five minutes. 
</li><li><b>Affirmations can be tailored to any aspect of life</b>: Affirmations can be created for any problem area in life or any goal you may have, be it fitness, relationship, money, career, business, hobby goals, or any personal development aspirations. 
</li><li><b>Phrases should always be positive</b>: Even if you are struggling with negative beliefs around certain areas of your life, affirmations should always be stated in the positive. 
</li><li><b>Avoid negative affirmations</b>: Negative affirmations such as "I am no longer fat" should be flipped to be positive, such as "I am fit" or "I am at my ideal weight." This is because the subconscious mind excludes the negative portion of what you are saying and focuses on the remaining part of the phrase.
</li><li><b>Initiate affirmations with "I am"</b>: Starting affirmations with "I am" helps shape a person's identity and self-image at the core. It helps internalize the substance of the affirmation as a part of oneself. 
</li><li><b>Affirmations should be concrete and specific</b>: The more specific the affirmation, the better. This might involve stating a desired income, a desired car model, or specific living condition. 
</li><li><b>Present tense affirmations</b>: Affirmations should always be stated in the present tense, despite how things might appear in reality. This helps to instill a sense of faith and confidence.
</li><li><b>Additional affirmation resources</b>: Extensive resources and additional tips for using affirmations are available at actualised.org/blueprint. Apart from affirmations, the site offers other techniques like visualization and contemplation which can further enhance personal development.
