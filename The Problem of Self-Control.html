hey this is Leo for actualize org and today I
want to talk about the idea of what self development
really is at its core and what self-regulation is and
why self-regulation is actually a very tricky topic I think
in nature overall and how it applies to maintaining a
certain stability in your own life and also I want
to talk about the parallels between that and how sub
regulation is a problem even in in larger organizations like
companies or let's say the American government so what is
so what is the bottom of self development to me
the thing with self development is that you've got your
brain that's trying to regulate itself but this is a
fundamental problem in that there's no stable way of doing
this the way I like to think about it is
that you even though you think that you are just
you that there's only one you in fact as a
human being you have trillions of cells within you in
each one of those is basically a tiny little organism
that has its own desire to survive in its own
agenda and all these little organisms came together and they
created you so you've got you basically as a human
being is very analogous to America being composed let's say
the American government being composed of 300 million citizens so
very much the same in that there's certain elements that
that want to cooperate and then there's certain elements within
that group that don't want to cooperate and they have
slightly different agendas and that tension leads to a certain
lack of stability if you want perfect stability that's very
hard to come by nature because I think nature is
naturally chaotic to some extent and maintaining a perfect perfect
balance perfect equilibrium which i think is ultimately the aim
of personal development is if you take someone who's not
personally developed at all whatsoever you take someone who is
highly developed and enlightened the difference is going to be
one of stability and you're going to it's going to
be very very palpable difference but sometimes might be hard
to articulate or put your finger on it and to
me it's that that that person that is not developed
is going to be well they're going to be all
over the map right they're not going to be able
to probably maintain a stable relationship or a stable job
they're not going to be happy they're going to be
addicted to to some sort of substance like food or
drugs or television or shopping or sex or whatever else
it might be and any number of things are not
gonna have their finances in order so all the things
that you typically think that constitute a happy life those
come with a certain amount of stability that you have
within yourself that then allows you to maintain those good
things in your life and achieve more and and basically
through a slow process you're going to add more and
more good stuff to your life and your life is
gonna get better and better and better and you're gonna
become happier and happier and happier that's like the ideal
I think for most people that is never actualized because
they're inherently unstable they're mentally unstable they're emotionally unstable it
doesn't mean they're psychotic or that they need to that
they need a therapeutic help or whatnot but I think
that the degree of stability that you have up here
in your head ultimately dictates how successful you're going to
be in life to a large extent sure you can
get lucky sometimes but with that said I think there's
also that parallel that can be drawn with government between
government and human beings so American government generally seen as
being successful in the sense that we live in a
society that's fairly stable if you want to raise a
family have it have a decent job retire and enjoy
yourself you're able to basically do that in American society
which is quite rare we take that for granted that
has not been the case throughout most of history and
that's not even the case for many countries around the
world today countries in Africa or countries in Asia etc
etc etc so what is it that allowed American government
to be much more stable to produce a stable environment
where other governments have not well there's a certain self-regulation
that goes into it there's a certain stability there whereas
other governments like you might think of some African governments
are highly unstable because they get overthrown all the time
direction shifts laws are not enforced it's difficult to just
have even the basics of security and safety and and
food and shelter and utilities and and basic human rights
those are absent because there's not a good enforcement mechanism
in place and a lot of times we tend to
think and we tend to take for granted that there's
some sort of absolute power out there that a government
turns to to to get its authority from when in
fact what we need to realize is that that authority
comes from all the constituents within the government right there's
no there's no higher authority that they that the American
government can appeal to beyond itself other than the forces
that are interacting with in this organism think of the
government as an organism think of yourself as an organism
as an organization of organisms and when you start thinking
about like that you start to see that all the
forces inside of it are what creates the thing itself
and then there's nothing else that's being appealed to so
one common objection to that might be well there's the
US Constitution isn't that isn't that the authority that the
US government is based upon and I would argue that
that's not the case the US Constitution is there and
I believe that there's somewhat of a myth built around
behind it in order to establish sort of a foe
stability but the fact is that the US Constitution only
has meaning insofar as it's being it's being enforced and
it's being honored by by who well ultimately there is
no such entity as government it's all made up of
individuals and maybe groups of individuals within society so if
there's no police force to enforce the Constitution if there's
no if there's no there's no judicial system to enforce
it if there is no army to enforce it then
the Constitution is entirely meaningless and I think that's the
case in many countries where you have rampant corruption and
constitutions are there but they're not enforced or they're there
in name only and they can be changed at the
whim of the current president or the current Parliament or
the dictator whoever else is running it and that's really
the trick is that there is no external appeal to
Authority Authority is something that needs to be well you
just get it through through consistent enforcement that's what Authority
is and control ultimately comes from from some sort of
source of power and traditionally I think throughout human civilization
it's come through through through physical violence because it came
through Wars that's how power was was exerted in the
world and nowadays especially if you live in America it
tends to seem like like that power is inherent in
certain things and maybe it seems like that power is
inherent in you like controlling yourself should be inherently easy
but it's not because what you really have is you
have a trillion neurons up in your head they're forming
connections and they're forming various neural networks and those networks
are causing certain behaviors and the more you do certain
behaviors the more of those networks get reinforced the more
you do others behaviors other networks get built if you
stop doing certain behaviors certain networks atrophy and die off
and ultimately what your brain is trying to do from
a day-to-day basis from the very biological simple standpoint of
like maintaining your temperature and maintaining your your fat and
maintaining your calories and maintaining maintaining all the subsystems in
your body that you need to live it's trying to
maintain equilibrium in an environment that is sometimes hostile right
like I can be out right now in the Sun
in 110-degree weather and my body needs to compensate for
that because if I don't stay in a certain at
a certain temperature to sort of equilibria I'm simply going
to die the body's not going to be able to
maintain itself this this organization of little tiny organisms is
going to it's going to disintegrate and so it it
starts to to regulate itself and it up regulates so
that it's able to deal with the temperature and then
if I go into I go into sort of a
cold environment then it's going to be the opposite effect
the body's going to need to to again regulate itself
in a different way in the opposite way and try
to maintain and there's only a certain range of temperatures
that the body is able to cope with when you're
outside those ranges if you're out in outer space or
you're jumping into a volcano their body can't do anything
about that and so how does this relate now to
personal development seems like we're getting very metaphysical here an
abstract well I think ultimately what your body and your
brain has in it is that it's running through patterns
there are neurons that are firing off and there are
there are channels and and connections being made entire networks
of neurons being made in your brain and the more
you get good at something the better you're reinforcing those
connections and to be emotionally stable the way I see
it is it's almost like you're building you have those
networks and then as you're doing self development you're building
an extra layer of neural network on top of it
and that extra layer is adding more self-regulation to the
whole system so that when one one network of neurons
fires off let's say and that network fires off and
let's say that's a network that has that has been
that has been causing you to overeat right that's a
network that you've been triggering for the last for the
last few years and that's causing you to overeat every
time that you sit down and have a dinner well
in that case you're you're following a pattern and it's
hard to break out of that pattern because you don't
have you literally don't have the wiring in your brain
to break out of it so it's a struggle you
have limited willpower there right and willpower thing ultimately gets
gets physically manifested in some sort of changes in how
your neurons are wired together and that when you have
more willpower what happens is that there's an extra layer
of neurons in there somewhere that is that is like
looping back on itself and it's observing the original the
original the original layer of neurons and it's it's connecting
multiple different networks together and it's like the overseer so
it's like the manager of the employees so consider that
every employee is some sort of pattern that you have
in your brain maybe there's a pattern over eat a
pattern to oversleep a pattern to not work a pattern
or maybe pause those are all negative patterns there are
positive patterns as well you know patterns to be nice
to people patterns to to to say I love you
patterns to you know to do whatever patterns to go
to your job on time so all of that is
there and that's just kind of like the basic Unseld
factual eyes type of human being they run through life
and they're going and they're firing off these patterns and
then when you start to do a lot of self-development
a lot of self-reflection and you start to become more
conscious of your patterns what starts to happen is there's
an extra layers are being built so now you have
these employees in the company doing each doing its own
little thing and sometimes when they're uncoordinated they'll cause the
overall organization to do something stupid so if you have
this pattern that's firing off that's causing you to eat
overeat all the time eventually is going to lead you
to be fat and now that might not be what's
best for you in the long run and so what
ends up happening is somehow the system starts to take
control of itself extra layers are added on and now
there's a manager there's like a manager there's that's overseeing
everything and so the manager is now telling the employee
that's overeating you know you got to cut that out
because we're going to be dead soon or we're gonna
we're going to end up in the hospital but we're
just going to look bad or whatever and and then
and then that manager also starts to oversee other other
elements it'll start to see how your how your eating
habits connect with your fitness habits and maybe how they
connect with your overall thinking habits and you start noticing
these patterns you start building connections and now all the
sudden you get a little bit more control over yourself
you're able to exercise more discipline more self-restraint and that's
all well and good but the fact is that that
manager that's managing all the employees all the different networks
well it has no inherent Authority so just like you
know that US Constitution that we're appealing to in some
way it's kind of like a fake Authority it's only
there and so far as it's being enforced and this
manager who's to say that this manager this second layer
is ultimately going to be able to regulate all of
the employees and maybe it can but then who's going
to regulate that manager so that manager might need another
manager and that manager might need another manager and ultimately
it's it builds like this pyramid this hierarchy of enforcement
and regulation and I think that's definitely there in your
brain if you're trying to do so if you try
to accomplish stuff and you failed or you've succeeded you've
noticed that there's some sort of structure in your head
that that is resembling this this hierarchy and sometimes you'll
notice that hierarchy works as it should and sometimes there
are like gaps in hierarchy and sometimes there's corruption in
there and things are not going always as smoothly as
they should be going very true for government and very
true for human beings and I think that the reason
that ultimately is is because there is no easy appeal
to just some sort of higher objective authority whatever whoever
is the top manager of that whole pyramid within you
that that manager ultimately has to not only regulate and
monitor everything that's underneath it also has to regulate itself
because what if that manager starts to slack off what
if that manager starts to to do his job bad
and he becomes corrupt well then the whole system is
kind of screwed isn't it and I think that that's
the inherent problem with control within nature in general in
whatever organization were talking about whether it's the organization of
your body as a biological organism or whether it's the
organization of level government and governments a good example that
I wanted to talk about because sometimes there's a tendency
you know corporations have a lot of sway in American
politics and it seems that a lot of what is
happening and a lot of public policy in America is
not really suited specifically towards empowering the individual a lot
of it is because a corporation has got in there
and has has changed the policy in a way that's
convenient for the corporation or a lot of money now
this is kind of bandit this idea is kind of
bandied about here and there but all and then I
got to thinking about I'm like well why isn't there
more why isn't there more control for the individual in
an American government why do these corporations have so much
power wouldn't it be wouldn't it be great if we
could just like cut the corporations out entirely and just
have a government that was like really for the people
by the people rather than these these entities that are
money hungry and that ultimately looking out for anything but
how much money they're able to return to their stockholders
and what if you think about that more deeply I
think that idea that you can just like cut corporations
out is it's fairly naive because that assumes that there
is like that authorities coming from some sort of magical
ethereal platonic realm but that's not the case American government
is what it is because of all the entities within
it and all the forces that they're exerting and ultimately
there's a certain stability that has been established over the
last couple hundred years since the government was formed and
that stability rests upon the US Constitution arrests about upon
the voting that can be done by citizens but it
also rests upon upon interests within within government so you
have varying factions that are there people want different things
people have different agendas those people then form groups that
then have their own agendas and those groups then buy
against each other for power and the ultimate example that
is like Republicans and Democrats but then you have different
special interest groups that are looking out for the interest
of their particular little sect within society with an American
Society and and then of course you've got corporations that
are looking out for themselves as as really they should
be because the corporation is what it's also an organism
it's also a collection of beings that is having an
agenda and then it's trying to really pursue that agenda
to its maximum survival ability right because an organization an
organization wants to survive really no different than then a
human being wants to survive and so when you think
about it like that and you think about the fact
that you can't there's no easy way to just cut
cut these forces out and get some sort of ethereal
appeal to Authority that Authority's coming in coming about because
you have these interests and the fact is that that
corporation the reason it's able to have the pole that
it has with the government is because frankly it has
a lot of money and ultimately you can say that
that's a form of corruption you know if a corporation
can go and pay lobbyists hundreds of thousands of dollars
to go do their bidding on their behalf and present
arguments to the supreme court and to all the different
politicians out there even if they're doing it totally aboveboard
and completely legit I'm not even talking about anything illegal
that's still an influence of power ultimately through money and
what does that mean that means that as corporations earn
a lot of money they earn power and that power
is is tangible so there's a certain amount of power
that comes with money and conceivably an organization or rather
I mean a corporation if it really wanted who was
rich enough I mean presumably it could it could raise
its own army and take over the government if it
wanted to do that it ultimately gets that power through
the money it has so a company like Apple that
has 20 or 30 or 50 billion however much it
has currently in its in its coffers if it takes
that that money and it really wanted to to raise
a standing army in theory it could and no one
could really stop them I mean the US government could
try to stop them but ultimately that attempt would depend
on the strength of government versus the strength of the
company so if a company gets theoretically to too strong
and becomes stronger than you government as a whole then
it would be able to exert whatever kind of control
it wanted and that's just a natural vying for power
because in the end that power has to come through
some means it has to either has to come from
from a passive acceptance of all the parties or it
has to come through domination and traditionally that's how power
was one is through domination nowadays domination is not a
key player in American society that much we tend to
be fairly peaceful you don't need to generally come up
to somebody in and Club them to death in order
to to feed yourself you can go and and work
for that person instead and turn some money or you
could form a business relationship with them and it's kind
of a win-win and that's great but it hasn't it
hasn't always been that way and I think that element
will never go away either because there's always going to
be this idea that you can that you can exert
power through through force and a lot of times that's
still the case I think that's still the case that's
still the reason why we have Wars and I still
the reason why we're going to have Wars for a
long time to come because the stability the there's nothing
inherently to appeal to the stability that we're assuming is
kind of that we're entitled to that we think that
should be there well that stability is coming from a
legacy of domination ultimately right now American society is is
built upon a long history of domination over other cultures
and that has historically been the case if you're a
student of history then you see that that's kind of
how how things play out and I think that what's
really fascinating about this is that that's how your mind
tends to work as well because there is no external
appeal and as you're developing yourself what ends up happening
is slowly you're building in those extra layers and those
extra layers help to add stability now as much as
I've kind of criticized the US government here for for
potential corruption and all this power and all this nonsense
I still think that American society is highly stable because
it was founded on certain principles and those principles have
been enforced and that the organism has been set up
in such a way that there are forces that are
opposing each other perfect example this is like Republicans and
Democrats seems like every election cycle they bicker back and
forth about all sorts of things but ultimately when it's
up happening is that well one election cycle the Republicans
win and maybe they stay in power for a few
for a few terms and then people get disenchanted with
that and there's a self-correction that goes on and then
all the sudden Democrats are now put into power because
people are fed up with the Republicans and they're not
happy with how how policy has been policy has been
managed and so now Democrats are in power and they
might be in power for a few terms and they're
going to be in power only as long as people
are relatively satisfied with the results that the Democrats are
getting and then as soon as that doesn't happen the
Democrats fall out of power the Republicans come back and
so there's just like back and forth up and down
and ultimately it seems like it's actually like a steady
state that's been reached and some people went might lament
that in fact at times you know I've lamented it
myself I'm I tend to be progressive and I tend
to things like well wouldn't it be nice if we
could just like get over this whole gate gay rights
issue and some of this other stuff all this nonsense
couldn't we just like settle that why does there have
to be in this opposition but in the end the
opposition is good because it's creating a steady state and
if it was easy to just go and add gay
rights into the Constitution and if it was easy to
go in and to add a bunch of other progressive
things in the Constitution it would also be very easy
to go in and do the exact opposite of it
so there needs to be a certain a certain balance
between these forces and I'm not saying that that it's
a dead even total draw I think in the end
society is progressing but right now I think like American
government has matured to the point where it's fairly stable
like an example of this is the fact that come
election time it's just generally assumed that the party that
gets the most votes and gets the most electoral votes
that that individual that presidential candidate can just come into
power and transition into power well why is that happening
why is there nobody questioning the fact that if I
got as many votes as I did that now I
just have the power just stroll into the Oval Office
and be President that's because there's a precedent there there's
a strong history of that having been the case to
the point where nobody really even questions it whereas in
other governments it's totally it's totally different you can win
all the votes then some somebody can can overthrow you
or there can be a coup or there can be
a revolt or an uprising or there could be some
sort of questioning and how the votes are counted and
tallied in all that nonsense and so that just goes
to show that there's a lot that we assume and
we take for granted in terms of how how control
is exerted in government and how control is exerted within
ourselves so if you try to accomplish it up in
your life and you try to make changes in your
life you will notice that there are a lot of
times there it feels like their varying parts within you
varying like factions that are vying for power it might
be two maybe three might before it might be even
more parts like one part of you might decide that
that you need to start going to the gym and
then another part of you will decide that you're not
going to the gym because you'd rather watch TV and
you'd rather pig out on doughnuts and that's a very
real problem because at one point maybe one one of
those parts of you is in power and at another
point maybe a few hours later that other part of
you is in power and so there are it seems
like there are there are like neural networks in your
mind waging war sometimes and if you want to be
enlightened if you want to reach that self-actualized state ultimately
what I see this exercise as being is is developing
a certain diplomacy within yourself and a certain steady-state where
those varying buying various vying factions within you are are
integrated and it's like it's basically like doing negotiation it's
like bring two parties to the table and saying okay
what do you want and what do you want what
are your problems what are your problems where your concerns
how can we find a balance between all of those
things and ultimately when you build those extra layers of
neurons you gain more awareness around what's actually happening here
you start to diminish that violent reaction between the various
parts they start to come together and they act holistically
to get you to where you want to be with
less struggle and less resistance who quite a deep topic
I think that that topic goes pretty deep and I
really I really like how how much depth there is
in the personal in this whole idea of doing personal
development I'm really passionate about it I hope that cleared
up some maybe some some feelings that you had about
it as you were trying to to get various results
in your life and I've been struggling with that I
know that to me this is a kind of very
personal intimate topic you
