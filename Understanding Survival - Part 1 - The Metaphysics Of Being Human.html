[Music] understanding survival part one this is going to be
to maybe a three part miniseries on survival and this
topic here is going to be utterly foundational utterly foundational
to any kind of personal development work that you ever
do in your life and to any kind of spiritual
work that you ever do this is the essence this
is the root of all behavior change in humans because
all human behavior ultimately is rooted in survival and by
the time we're done with this miniseries this will change
how you understand your entire life and how you see
the lives of everybody around you let me give credit
here - Peter Ralston who's been a pioneer in this
domain and really instrumental in helping me to understand the
extent and the importance of survival in any kind of
behavior change also let me read a quote to you
from Peter who's been ski now this is a different
Peter not to be confused with Ralston and he's got
a great quote that goes right along with our theme
here of survival Peter Spence Key says quote man is
a machine which reacts blindly to external forces and this
being so he has no will and very little control
of himself if any at all what we have to
study therefore is not psychology but mechanics and quote I
love that and that's exactly what we're gonna be discussing
over the next two episodes is a lot of mechanics
showing you just how mechanical you are this word mechanical
is a really good word because it describes why people
behave the way they behave they behave very much like
chimps or like animals or like robots and even though
I can tell you that and you can agree with
me the depth of it and the extent of it
has not dawned on you yet until we really go
through these explorations and I'm gonna give you some homework
assignments that are gonna help you to just start to
discover just how mechanical you are in your life and
of course mechanical is the opposite of conscious so if
all personal development and spirituality is about becoming more conscious
and it is then your greatest enemy is mechanical miss
so what we need to do is we need to
really study your own our own mechanical mnestheus of humans
so let's even take one further step backward and really
start somewhere very fundamental which is I want to take
a look at survival as a metaphysical thing not just
as a physical activity see the problem is that modern
science does not have a good handle on survival and
its importance in human affairs yeah you know as amazing
as that sounds it's true because the this topic you
know modern science thinks of survival maybe in evolutionary terms
as a biological process of course all organisms and life
needs to survive obviously but but there's something very very
deep going on here which is much more profound than
just biological survival or physical existence and this is the
metaphysical level so let's ask some metaphysical questions here such
as what is survival why do survival why struggle at
all why do anything at all in life why move
at all why doesn't organism just sit still for his
whole life why is it struggle why defend anything at
all because survival of course involves a lot of defending
of stuff and what is being defended why be one
way versus another way because that's a lot of what
survival boils down to is ways of surviving which means
you're choosing between one way versus another also why seek
any kind of change at all why manipulate anything at
all because of course survival involves a lot of manipulation
and what are we manipulating towards and perhaps most fundamentally
why even live why not just lay down and die
what's wrong with that and according to whom is survival
important and who chooses what should survive and what shouldn't
why survive some things but not others I'm gonna be
using survive in this weird way as a verb sometimes
why survive some things and not others which just means
why have certain things persist and not others is survival
and a rational activity or is it irrational and finally
is there anything which is not survival what is the
opposite of survival so those are some interesting deep questions
that I encourage you to contemplate on your own really
think about them and we'll be answering some of them
indirectly as we're going down here and covering all the
material that I want to cover but let's let's begin
at the very beginning I want to tell you the
story of how survival came into existence so imagine if
you will that in the beginning in the universe there
was absolutely nothing total emptiness or formlessness then all the
sudden a form appeared the very first form it was
a thing it was something distinct and specific and in
this case let's just imagine for sake of argument it
was just a cloud of particles like a gas cloud
out in in the middle of nowhere in this emptiness
so this gas cloud was like the first object and
there it was but then of course you know the
environment started moving around there were other objects in the
environment there was a wind and radiation and the pull
of gravity and black holes other things and so off
key of course all those are objects themselves but we're
just looking at this cloud so this cloud now that
it's interacting with all these other objects you see they
pull and tug and and warp and morph this this
form which is the cloud until it becomes something totally
different than it originally was like let's say the cloud
had a certain shape like it was a circular shape
perfect sphere and then you know by it by getting
pulled by gravity and wind and stuff it just after
a certain point it completely dissipated and you could no
longer tell that it was a cloud anymore and so
in a certain sense we could say the cloud died
now of course the cloud wasn't really alive it was
just a shape just a form and it didn't really
care about whether it was alive or dead and in
fact so this cloud you know see it didn't have
a sense of self and it didn't have any desire
to survive because it literally didn't care what happened to
it more than that it didn't even know that it
was a cloud see we as humans we look at
it and we project onto it that oh it's a
cloud it's a it's a form but you have to
think more fundamentally if there's no human to say that
it's a cloud does the cloud even know that it's
a cloud obviously not and so of course then it
can't say that it should survive now imagine what happened
a little bit later in the future after this cloud
died is that some new form came into being for
the very first time and this form was different than
all the other objects this form had a desire to
persist it had a sense of itself it could recognize
its own form separate itself out from the environment and
then try to maintain that form through manipulation and so
this shape this form lived significantly longer than all the
other ones because it could manipulate like if wind blew
at it could fly off to the side if gravity
pulled on it it could maybe adjust itself and change
yourself to maintain its shape and these of course became
more successful and they lived longer but eventually they also
died because there's only so much that you can manipulate
your environment until the game of manipulation is over and
eventually you disintegrate that's that's life and death for you
in a nutshell now notice a couple of very key
things here that many people overlook even though there's the
obvious is that a form does not have to care
about persisting and that in fact there's nothing rational or
logical about caring to persist as any particular form nobody
tells you you have to persist and also notice that
for a form to persist at all it must be
able to distinguish itself and tell to itself what is
it that is being persisted so it has to crucially
draw a distinction the most fundamental distinction the distinction between
self and other I am the form and everything else
is my environment its other to me it's the world
other forms or the environment is whole and so what
I have to do to maintain my sense of self
is to now manipulate either myself or the environment and
usually both in order to make sure that that that
distinction between self and other is maintained because as soon
as that distinction is lost what happens to me now
since a form any form is a part of the
entire universe it is never in full control of its
destiny because just by the very definition that we created
this distinction between self and other there is another which
is distinct from myself which can hurt me or which
can have a control over me by definition I can't
control that other thing out there because it's not me
I define myself as that which I can control and
manipulate at least directly and then maybe I can indirectly
manipulate other forces but see so that the predicament that
all life puts itself in is that it now has
to play this game of defending itself against these external
forces and the reason has to do that is because
all forms are temporary and because reality is constantly changing
and that that's a very important point about reality is
that it's constantly changing no part of it is ever
frozen or static for very long and if any form
totally changes nothing of it basically remains because the form
is what that thing was that thing whatever it is
this object that you're imagining it doesn't have any existence
to it other than the form that is so if
we change that form too much literally that change becomes
its death so what's being survived is the form so
fundamentally survival is about maintaining a static arrangement of form
or you could say matter or energy whatever you want
to call it a static arrangement within a sea of
change and survival is about maintaining order and so disorder
is an enemy of all living organisms and disorder is
your enemy as a human being and in fact one
of the most dangerous things for an organism is freedom
people don't really understand the significance of what freedom is
they think freedom is a great thing and they want
to maximize freedom but this is utterly impossible you as
an organism just by the fact that you're alive are
committed to restricting freedom because if you were totally free
you would scatter into a million pieces you would disintegrate
and you'd be dead so literally freedom is impossible for
human beings limitation intelligent limitation is what life is all
about so these calls for unlimited freedom this is just
complete nonsense simplistic thinking freedom is what you're terrified of
the most and so the irony is is that those
people who call for maximum freedom actually they themselves are
putting a lot of limitations on themselves and on life
and other people and on a society in order to
maintain themselves so there's a deep hypocrisy there but never
mind that's for another day so so basically survival boils
down to not changing so in a certain sense just
by being alive you're committing yourself to not changing you're
committing to freezing certain aspects of reality and then what
aspect of reality you wish to keep frozen well that
of course depends on how you define yourself what kind
of form you think you are survival requires a distinction
between self and other this distinction is not given to
you from the outside as an absolute so you might
think like well yeah I don't really know what's so
profound about what you're saying here because you know yeah
there are objects in the world and of course they
can get destroyed and they can manipulate the environment they
can live so what's the big deal huh you're assuming
objects there ain't no such thing as objects is what
I'm trying to get you to understand an object is
something that you project onto the world it doesn't exist
as an absolute so that cloud it didn't really exist
until you said it was a cloud that's what's so
profound about this and of course you the form that
comes into being you get to say what you are
because the universe doesn't tell you what you are the
universe doesn't define your identity you're free to define you
at any however you want so you might say well
Lea but what about a baby like a baby is
born and there it is it's a baby it's a
human I mean what do you want there it is
isn't that just like a biological physical fact and what
I'm telling you is no it's not see what you're
doing there is you're looking at that baby and you're
saying a baby that is something that you've constructed and
projected onto it precisely because that's what you did when
you were a baby in order to be able to
survive to the point where now you could call that
thing a baby you see this is not just a
physical issue this is a metaphysical issue because nowhere in
the universe is it written that that thing is a
baby you see when you come into existence you have
no sense of distinction between yourself and the world you
don't know what you are because you haven't defined yourself
now people think that well but but Lea what definition
could there be other than that I'm a baby and
that I'm a human and then I grew up and
became an adult how else could have I defined myself
well actually there are many other ways you could have
defined yourself and it's not just a matter of defining
yourself physically as a human or not it's a for
humans there's there's a lot more complexity to how we
define ourselves than just physically your physical definition is just
a tiny tip of the iceberg of your self definition
and really in this series we're going to be much
more interested in the other ways in which you define
yourself beyond your physical definitions although of course your physical
definitions are all constructed by you you constructed your physical
definition and you have actually separated yourself from you environment
such that you now think that's real and that's physical
when in fact that's purely mental and conceptual so you
created this conceptual distinction self and other or self and
world are created in a single slice in a single
step so what we ultimately have at the biggest picture
is we have an infinite field of consciousness that's what
reality is an infinite field of consciousness and then within
that by creating this distinction between self and other you
create a virtual partition it's not an actual partition you
didn't actually divide consciousness into it's a virtual partition I
use this concept of virtual partitions because I like it
from from creating hard drive partitions you know if you're
formatted a hard drive you create multiple partitions on there
and it's just a single hard drive but then you
can subdivide it into as many parts as you want
that's exactly what's happening within the universe that's how objects
are coming into being through virtual partitions and then their
death is the elimination of the virtual partition and if
you eliminate all the virtual partitions all you're left with
is the oneness of the original hard drive so imagine
it in infinite ha imagine an infinite hard drive with
an infinite number of virtual partitions of which you yourself
are one and so you came into existence when one
of these virtual partitions was created and that's when you
looked at yourself and you said oh I am this
and whatever you thought this was is what you became
so what survival is at the biggest picture level is
it's the maintaining of virtual partition within infinite consciousness that's
what you're doing here in the world that's life you're
maintaining this partition now notice about this partition it's not
a simple line that you draw like this between you
and the environment and notice when you draw one line
you're creating two parts see you draw one line one
division creating two parts self and other but this line
when a human draws this line is very complicated it's
not a simple vertical line it's a squiggly complicated messy
chaotic line this line is unique for every human being
and this line is what is being survived so to
speak and if this line changes too much you either
become a new human being that would be growth or
you actually die so the distinction between self and other
is what's creating the survival Drive but conversely this is
a two-way street the imperative to survive as a form
is what creates the distinction between self and other so
these two are working simultaneously sort of a chicken and
egg problem which came first they both feed into each
other so here's a key insight for you one of
many about survival that I'll be underscoring this is the
first one what's being survived is not a physical object
the way that people imagine the way that science imagines
the way the materials paradigm imagines rather what's being survived
as a conceptual boundary a fantasy that's why I call
it a virtual partition to distinguish it from an actual
partition so you are a virtual being in a certain
sense that doesn't mean you're living in a computer simulation
it just means that your sense of self is a
virtual thing and that survival is largely especially for humans
a conceptual activity not merely a physical activity so from
now on when I say the word survival I want
you to radically broaden your understanding of that word it
doesn't just mean getting food and sex and shelter the
way that people imagine it means something much deeper and
broader than that it means surviving as a conceptual self
as a distinction from your environment which is not necessarily
just food and shelter and water there's a lot more
that goes into that especially for humans because we're very
complex creatures and we'll be breaking that down into more
detail as we go on here see I want you
to consider the possibility that without a sense of self
or you you might cut off your own leg and
eat it for breakfast because you wouldn't know that it's
inappropriate to eat your own leg because you might not
consider your leg a part of who you are and
therefore it's appropriate for you to now eat it in
order to feed yourself see now that sounds kind of
silly you might say well you know that that that
doesn't happen in real life but don't take for granted
that your leg is is essential to your identity in
a certain situation you might cut off your leg in
order to escape and to live see maybe you might
even in a certain situation cut off your leg knee
dydt in order to survive but regardless it's not clear
at all that your leg is a part of you
see people assume that science gives us physical objects and
identities but the thing they overlook is that science cannot
actually identify anything because identification is not an objective scientific
fact it's not a given it's something that you create
so even for a scientist to go out into the
field and to identify some creature a monkey or even
a physical object like a rock see the scientist has
to project that onto the world because otherwise he wouldn't
be able to distinguish a rock from from a tree
from a monkey he's doing that but of course he's
not conscious that he's doing that he's assuming that what
he's doing is actually part of the physical world when
it's not and in fact physical world is a distinction
he's made himself and has projected onto this infinite field
of consciousness so it's quite tricky don't assume that science
tells you what things are or gives you identities because
it doesn't because identity is totally subjective and in a
sense arbitrary I also want you to consider that there's
nothing rational logical or objective about survival in fact just
the opposite survival is a highly irrational subjective activity survival
doesn't care about reason or logic survival co-opts reason and
logic in order to survive because you see when you
put yourself in this very life and death predicament of
maintaining your sense of self that's the most fundamental value
that you have nothing matters to you but being able
to live because nothing else can matter unless you your
life is maintained you see so for the organism the
organism can't really care about logic or rationality or truth
or objectivity because it's committed to the irrational activity of
maintaining itself given any means possible you see only later
after that if it is able to maintain itself successfully
only then can it sit back sipping pina colada on
the beach and think about some philosophical notion of truth
or rationality or logic see only if it's safe can
it do that not when it's under threat just the
notion that you should survive is already predicated upon falsehood
and illusion because see to get yourself to buy into
this whole game of trying to survive and you know
survival takes a lot of energy and effort it's exhausting
if you haven't noticed so you have to trick yourself
into believing that it's important because if you didn't think
the survival is important well you wouldn't try to survive
and therefore you wouldn't probably be here thinking about survival
you have to believe that survival is the most important
thing you have to be terrified to death of it
which is literally what death is to you why are
so scared of death and why you avoid death at
every possible turn because to you this is not a
game you've managed to trick yourself into thinking that this
is serious this is important and so of course you
never question the obvious you never questioned whether actually maybe
dying is totally fine and there's no problem and that
maybe survival wasn't important at all and that maybe survival
was totally irrational and the rational choice would be just
to lay down and die see you can't even consider
that possibility you'll say olio but that's so unreasonable that's
that's crazy talk you're just talking crazy now this is
dangerous exactly see you don't even want to open your
mind to these possibilities because they're so threatening to you
because you don't care about truth or rationality or fairness
or equality you don't care about any of this [
__ ] what you care about is your own ass
surviving see and that itself is falsehood and highly irrational
so your sense of self of course co-op's rationality and
so really the way that you use rationality is whatever
serves your survival is what you call rational that's really
how you define survival because it doesn't make sense for
you to have a notion of rationality in which your
survival could be a low value priority that wouldn't be
rational to you of course not because you've hijacked rationality
to survive because otherwise why do you even care about
rationality you don't you only care about rationality because you've
made an identity out of it that uh for you
rationals out there but I don't want to aggress too
much on that so the key point here is that
how you define yourself determines what must survive anything that's
part of your identity or self-concept automatically becomes important and
must be survived threat and danger are not real objective
things threatened danger are relative to however you define yourself
so for example let's say that for for you and
I if we're not rabid zealous Christians if you take
a Bible and you throw it into the fireplace I
wouldn't react I wouldn't really care you probably would neither
but if we take a like a serious hardcore zealous
Christian who really believes in the Bible grew up with
the Bible considers it a holy book maybe has a
Bible that his grandfather passed down to him over the
ages and it's important to him he's underlined it and
he has important passages in there that help him with
his life and all this see to him you take
that Bible and you throw it in the fireplace you
know that's gonna be a serious threat and danger to
him and he's gonna react very emotionally get very upset
might even cry might even you know become violent and
murderous for you doing this why what's the difference the
only difference is that he's created an identity out of
that Bible see he's attached to it it's important to
him why is it important to him precisely because it's
wedded to his sense of survival it helps him to
survive now here's the mistake that people make is they
think butBut Leo how does a Bible a Bible is
just full of of philosophy and silly superstitious ideas how
can that help with survival he's deluded actually it's you
who's deluded what you don't understand is that what's being
survived by this Christian is not his physical body it's
his identification with being a Christian it's that Christian self-image
that is the thing that's the most important that is
what we call it the ego as we what we
call the sense of self with the lowercase s see
and you have one of those as well it's just
a question of what is that for you so for
you throwing a Christian Bible into a fireplace probably would
would not upset you but there probably is something of
yours that I could throw in the fireplace that would
upset you very much maybe your baby you see now
you say alia but my baby that's my biological offspring
and that's very important everybody knows that babies are important
you don't throw babies in the fireplace that's ridiculous of
course I get upset no no not of course not
of course you will only get upset if you hold
this baby to be part of your survival and that's
not the case you know some mothers will dispose of
their babies because they don't want them see so it's
all about how you define what you are if you
define yourself as being a father or a good mother
then of course you need to protect that self-image and
so of course you can't let your baby get hurt
if in your mind you're telling us of all this
baby is my baby and my baby is more important
than all the other babies in the world is that
really rational of course not there's no reason that your
baby is more important than all the other babies it's
complete hogwash you made it up you made it up
now you say all do but but I'm related to
my baby my baby has my genes all human beings
are related to each other we're all basically brothers and
sisters if you look at our genetic code we're so
similarly related that there's really no reason why you should
care more for your baby surviving then for some other
baby surviving it doesn't matter you're just totally selfish and
you're completely blind here on selfishness and you're completely in
denial about your own selfishness precisely because you're engaged in
survival blind survival so see I want you to see
that threat and danger are not absolute things it depends
on what you need to survive so what is a
threat in a danger to one person or one nation
will actually be a boon to another and will actually
promote the survival amount of the of another you know
to a very scientifically minded nation science that's that's great
that's not a threat it's not a danger but when
you have a fee RC science becomes a great threat
and danger see that's the relativity of survival survival is
extremely relative and people don't understand that people because they're
so selfish and so blindly selfish they just assume that
well if it's good for me it's good for everybody
and if it's bad for me it's bad for everybody
again no not at all it depends on what you
are how you define yourself to be and all of
us define ourselves in very different ways of course there's
also a lot of commonalities also another fundamental point about
survival want you to understand is that for a thing
to be it has to be a particular way a
very very particular way for a thing to be one
way is for it not to be some other way
so for example let's take table salt for table salt
to be table salt it cannot be pepper sugar earth
metal plastic wood gold and a million other things because
as soon as salt becomes pepper it's as though the
salt was killed and pepper was born see so what
I want you to really understand about this is to
be an object to be a particular thing there's a
zero-sum game going on here because you can only exist
as you if you're not existing as something that's not
you see the two are being defined at the same
time and so to be one particular way you're necessarily
excluding actually an infinite number of other ways that you
could have been and that's very important to understand so
for example when you were born to be born a
billion other sperm had to die because only one sperm
could have fertilized that egg and that was you you
got very lucky you won the lottery see but all
those other sperms had to die now of course you're
completely oblivious to this and you don't care at all
but from the point of view of all those other
billion sperms they they all lost the game and they
all died all right so you have to under I
really appreciate this delicate trade-off that happens and one of
the most amazing things that blows my mind about reality
is that even though reality itself as a whole is
absolute infinity it's totally infinite and it has no limitations
whatsoever there are still zero-sum dynamics within this infinity there
are real trade-offs there is competition over limited resources life
is impossible therefore without death forms must feast off other
forms and this is extremely fundamental to reality and the
reason this must happen is because there's only one reality
and so it can't leech energy from anywhere but from
itself see so it's all about how do you partition
this one hard drive we only have one hard drive
now it's an infinite hard drive but when we create
these partitions we necessarily make choices about what is and
what is not allowed to exist within the world of
form see there's trade-offs depending on how you draw that
partition line and what I like to say here's a
little joke kind of example is that a squirrel does
not know that it is an oak murdering machine but
that's exactly what a squirrel is see the squirrel lives
his whole life completely oblivious to the fact that it's
murdered thousands of acorns which were supposed to turn into
mature oak trees so in a sense it's it's a
it's an oak baby killing machine but the squirrel doesn't
know or care about any of this and the squirrel
needs to behave this way in order to be a
squirrel otherwise it couldn't exist see and if all those
acorns turned into mature oak trees all the squirrels would
be dead because there would be nothing for them to
eat see so notice that trade-off because what I want
to tell you is that you are just like that
squirrel you've been running around your whole life engaged in
survival activities extremely selfish and devilish ones wrecking havoc on
your environment without a single thought about what's really going
on and what is what you're really doing so think
about how you are just like that squirrel now let's
a shift from sort of the lofty big-picture metaphysics of
survival into the nitty-gritty down-to-earth because you're probably wondering well
leo but how is this useful for my own self
improvement of course notice that's already a survival question you
see the very project of improving yourself fixing problems that
you have is already thoroughly permeated by survival you see
you see the problem here how are you going to
transcend yourself when all of your thinking and all of
your desiring is all about preserving yourself all you really
care about is preserving yourself and yet to develop and
to grow yourself you need to let go of yourself
and transcend yourself you see how you're getting in your
own way just to be able to change a behavior
of yours a part of you has to die because
to change your behavior means that some old behavior you
had now has to not exist anymore but of course
that old behavior because it's a part of your psyche
and your mind and your brain it's fighting to maintain
a solvent to survive which is why it's so hard
for you to kick bad habits why you keep backsliding
why you keep not getting results you see because actually
you're very conflicted about this whole jekt of changing yourself
because on the one hand you tell yourself that you
want to change yourself you want to be a better
person you want to be happier in all this but
on the other hand you don't want to change you
want to stay exactly as you were so really what
you what you want is you want the results of
the change without having to change yourself and that is
the entire problem with traditional self-help and why most self-help
doesn't really produce significant results in people's lives is because
what they're doing is they're trying to change themselves without
actually changing themselves and so the only way that you
will actually be able to truly get massive results in
your life is that actually if you're willing to bite
the bullet and to actually change who you are identity
level change which involves facing your death which of course
nobody wants to do because the thing you're fighting your
whole life is death you see so to liberate yourself
and to get to the highest levels of human potential
you need to do the most counterintuitive thing possible which
is to face your own death and to go straight
into it straight into the abyss the belly of the
whale which is exactly what nobody wants to do so
of course it's no accident that almost nobody in society
is very highly developed because it's so counterintuitive and it
ago goes against almost all your instincts because your instincts
are there to help you to be selfish and to
survive anyways let's get into the nitty-gritty your life is
completely dominated by survival I want you to notice this
every little thing that you do is what I'm talking
about so let me give you a long list of
examples to help you to become aware of this reading
a book wiping your ass taking a shower drinking coffee
going to the grocery store going to school watching makeup
videos on YouTube for you ladies taking your vitamins and
nootropics in the morning scratching an itch on your face
what is all of this stuff but survival why would
you do any of this stuff other than that is
served your survival you wouldn't in fact what I want
you to realize is that you do nothing in your
life which doesn't somehow serve your survival now the deeper
question is what exactly is it that you're surviving yes
of course your physical body but I mean more than
that because your your survival activities go way beyond your
physical body you might wonder well Leo you said reading
a book the first thing you said is reading a
book how is reading a book survival well why do
you read a book take a look at it you
read a book because you think you're gonna find some
good information there some important technique that's gonna change your
life maybe help you to develop a better career learn
some new skill that helps you to survive why do
you need that career to survive now you wanna say
oh Leo but uh but you know I like to
read non-fiction books science fiction and so forth I mean
sorry yeah I like to read fiction books like like
science fiction so in that case how is that survival
that's just entertainment but but what is entertainment but survival
entertainment is crucial to your ability to survive and also
a lot of people who read fiction books they develop
a whole identity around it so for example let's say
you like science fiction books you enjoy them they give
you pleasure they relax your mind from a hard day's
work so maybe you spent the whole week working and
now you get to the weekend he just want to
chill chill out and grab your favorite sci-fi book and
just kind of read it on the couch and enjoy
yourself that's survival see because if we made you work
non-stop every single day without giving you some break or
some rest or some entertaining activities like your favorite sci-fi
books then eventually you get depressed and frustrated you might
even kill yourself because you need that outlet to recharge
your batteries to refresh yourself to recharge your spirit you
see survival is happening on many levels simultaneously it's happening
on the physical level it's happening on the mental level
the emotional level it's happening at the spiritual level all
of it simultaneously you have various levels of needs that
are simultaneously being satisfied and of course sometimes they get
into conflict with one another but even more importantly think
of someone who really loves sci-fi they've actually developed a
whole identity around it see they probably have like actually
developed a connection with their sci-fi books such as if
we take their whole bookshelf of sci-fi books and throw
it in the fire they're gonna be very upset about
it because they have an emotional attachment to it because
those books have maybe help them to to figure out
parts of their life or get through difficult challenging times
through a bad breakup or something those books you know
they're attached to them or they have various kinds of
fantasies about sci-fi or whatever and then these books help
to feed those fantasies so what's being survived in this
case is not merely the human body or brain it's
it's that whole identity that you create it's all the
software like if you think of yourself as a sci-fi
fan there you go or maybe you're reading these sci-fi
books because you plan to become a sci-fi author yourself
and so to you it's actually it's like a career
thing as well and so that's a part of core
that's that's also survival so all of this is survival
I want you to notice that survival is very detailed
like the devil it's all in the details it's not
that you're just doing stuff vaguely to survive no no
you're doing extremely specific things to survive and you're not
just doing it like once or twice throughout the day
I'm saying that like within a five-minute span of your
day you do at least a hundred different survival activities
and each one of those who can break those down
it's like little chunks such that every two seconds you're
doing some new survival thing that's helping you to reach
larger survival goals so it's very nested right you have
like well very large survival goals that might take you
years to accomplish like you might have a goal to
buy a house for which you have a career for
which you study books for which right now you know
you're you're reading a particular book and so all those
kind of are like a chain of survival activities which
are ultimately get you to your house that you want
now of course most of the stuff that you're doing
most of your survival strategies like as I call them
are completely unconscious to you you don't really know what
you're doing because you're just behaving like a robot but
nevertheless they're still there so let's continue with this list
getting annoyed by a noise that's survival because if you
get too much noise in your ear might hurt your
ears or just might annoy you enough that drought will
drive you crazy see so what you're doing there but
when you're getting annoyed by noise is actually you're preventing
yourself from going crazy because it's that annoyance that then
gets you to shut off the noise or put on
some headphones go in the other room yell at your
family members to keep the noise now whatever see so
that annoyance is your survival strategy to then manipulate the
environment to turn off the noise or you could manipulate
yourself to tune out the noise that could also work
see there's many different survival strategies in fact millions and
trillions and trillions upon trillions of different survival strategies so
I'm just giving you a little list here tiny tiny
lists fiddling with your thermostat to get the temperature just
right in your room that's survival getting comfortable in your
seat speaking of which I should do that right now
that's survival checking the clock checking your smartphone wearing socks
watching TV calling your mother shopping for designer clothes wearing
a Rolex buying a yacht now I've specifically included some
of these luxury items on this list because sometimes people
get in there in their skull that survival is only
meeting your basic necessities and they might say bolio but
how buying a yacht this is not survival come on
don't be silly nobody really needs a yacht now this
is a very important point so listen closely a lot
of poor people and by poor people I mean people
under a million dollars in net worth they don't understand
how survival works for rich people because they think you're
still under the illusion that if you get enough money
then survival will be taken care of and you'll be
happy this is of course a complete pipe dream it
doesn't work this way here's how it really works because
what you're really surviving is not some physical body but
your own self concept and self image and ego it
doesn't really matter how much money you have because there's
no end to how much your ego can need or
want so here's how it really works so when you're
poor like if you're only earning $20,000 a year then
for you buying a loaf of bread might be a
struggle sometimes you're just paying your electricity bill and you're
like it's a matter of kind of like survival need
and life and death to pay your electricity bill because
you don't want to be a home without the lights
on you see and so you for you it's like
it's very important you take it very seriously to pay
your electric bill every month and then when you think
about some millionaires let's say a guy with a hundred
million dollars he wants to buy himself a yacht you
say well that's very frivolous but to him buying that
yacht is as important as to you getting your electricity
bill paid you see that because he's playing the survival
game at a very different level than you are when
you're poor for him he's already got his basic needs
all met he's already got five different houses all around
the world and he's got a bunch of fancy clothes
and all this and he's got a bunch of fancy
cars and so none of that is a challenge for
him he's surviving the image of himself on his physical
body the image of himself and for this guy 100
million dollars his image is that he needs to have
a yacht like all his friends do because if he
doesn't have a yacht then he's lesser than his friends
and they're gonna laugh behind his back and think that
he's poor all this sorts of stuff right so for
him it's it's just as important as for you a
loaf of bread is see going further down the list
how about shopping for panties at Victoria's Secret you would
think well panties these these one lingerie panties are they
really that important does it really matter hell yeah it
matters for the woman it matters because these panties are
packaging one of her most important assets survival survival wise
you see so if she can present herself in a
nice way to a guy with these panties gets him
to fall in love with her guess gets him really
attracted to her then he might marry her and he
might be a good lover and a good provider and
they'll have children a whole life together so it's not
just about her getting resources from the guy it can
also be about love and romance and all of this
good stuff all of that is survival all of it
see now when she goes into the store to buy
the panties to impress the guy is she conscious of
all of this is that wishes she see is she
thinking twenty years down the road about how all these
panties will help me to lock this guy in and
then he'll marry me and then and then we'll have
a bunch of money and baby see like no she's
not thinking about it like that this is all completely
subconscious completely subconscious nevertheless it's happening and in fact and
here's another very important point is that we we don't
we delude ourselves with false rationalizations about our survival strategies
so in this case with these panties she might say
oh but Lea I'm just buying these panties for me
it's not really for the guy I'm not a 1
anything I'm just buying them to look sexy for myself
yeah you can tell yourself that but there's there's actually
what's going on under the surface that you got to
look at you see survival especially human survival is a
very devious sneaky underhanded sort of thing it's not honest
because honesty doesn't help you to survive very well dishonesty
manipulation subterfuge double meanings and ulterior motives and purposes this
is what helps you to survive in the competitive marketplace
in the dog-eat-dog world that we're in but of course
see the problem is is that you also have an
idea of yourself as being a good honest person so
how do you balance out the ideas self-image of you
being a good honest person on the one hand on
the other hand you need to manipulate and scheme and
engaged all sorts of subterfuge and manipulation to give yourself
a survival advantage well what you do is you brainwash
yourself into thinking that all of the subsurf you should
lie in the inflation that you do that all of
that is totally normal and actually good it's good it's
logical it's reasonable and it's actually not dishonest this is
the game that's being played and you and your mind
are right in the middle of it your thoughts and
your emotions are right in the middle of it this
is what you're engaged in all day long lying manipulating
scheming trying to find every advantage possible to get whatever
you think you need and it doesn't matter what it
is it could be food it could be sex it
could be a house it could be just a self-image
maybe you just want to be a a good noble
Christian woman that's gonna be the thing that you're gonna
be surviving and if that's your self-image then you're gonna
be doing all the good noble womanly Christian stuff that
that person needs to do to be that way and
anything which disrupts that will be very threatening to you
because it's literally threatening your life as that thing that
you think you are going on with the list masturbation
sex of course these are all survival activities giving gifts
at Christmas smiling on a stranger and being polite what
do you think that's all about purely survival caring about
what people think of you it's all survival worrying about
your physical appearance cheating stealing arguing debating all survival activities
calling people names defending your culture or your religion this
is an automatic robotic survival activity driving an electric car
or being a vegan or being a spiritual person or
giving to charity these are good examples because a lot
of times people think that well if I'm giving to
charity or Leo if I'm being a vegan then that's
not about my survival in fact it's the opposite I'm
being I'm being generous and I'm being selfless by being
a vegan Leo because you know I'm not I'm not
killing animals the way all those other people are yeah
that's called pure selfish survival for you because you have
a self-image of being this this noble vegan who's saving
animals see and just me telling you that your veganism
is a survival activity already starts to upset you makes
you trigger at an emotional and defensive and all the
sudden your mind now search to know Lea what are
you talking to no I'm actually helping your daughter Stanley
oh you're deluded leo are you a vegan aw see
you're eating all look here look how many animals you've
killed see see what your mind is doing to defend
yourself yeah it's a very tricky very tricky this is
why this work is so difficult because all of the
most important truths that need to be told to you
and taught to you you resist because all of them
are completely threatening to the way that you live your
whole life into yourself and so you actively resist this
waking up process this growing up process taking your dog
for a walk it's a survival activity logging into your
online bank account checking your email installing software on your
computer dreaming up some new business ideas doodling in your
notebook in class when you're bored what does that do
that entertains you from all the boredom that boredom would
kill you if you let it last long enough cracking
a joke getting a tattoo listening to music you know
the tattoo thing is very interesting because people who are
really into tattoos they just keep getting them and getting
them and getting them you know some of those people
it's a whole identity thing for them the whole tattoo
subculture is is you know is its own very unique
kind of identity that you create with these tattoos and
it becomes sort of like your life maybe you've met
some of these people see are they conscious of why
they're doing it no of course not they're just behaving
like robots now of course this doesn't mean that getting
a tattoo is good or bad make sure that you
don't misunderstand me here all these things that I'm talking
about I'm not judging any of them I'm not telling
you that you should stop doing any of these things
we're just pointing out why you're doing them we just
want to notice why we do stuff we just want
to wash ourselves behaving like robots and chimps so that
we can become more conscious we're not interested in changing
anything yet we just want to observe listening to music
is survival getting high on weed going to a fancy
dinner party socializing with your friends taking out the trash
caring about your family and children lots of big one
that's huge as a huge part of your survival and
most people do not want to admit that all of
their family activities and children and all the thoughts and
emotions that are related to that has anything to do
with survival but of course it does which is why
it's so problematic for you there's so much tension there
getting at an attending church is survival being a Christian
being a Muslim being a Hindu being a Jew any
kind of religious identity that you have is all purely
robotic survival that you're doing Golf is survival saving pennies
at the gas station survival buying anything at all this
survival being depressed is survival and now we get to
the really important in huge categories all judgments of any
kind whatsoever are a survival activity you only do them
because you have an ego to defend if you didn't
have a self to defend you wouldn't judge anything all
meaning whatsoever that you have created and you did create
all of it is a survival activity if you didn't
have a sense of self that needed to survive nothing
would have any meaning whatsoever meaning is a survival tool
your mind generates meaning in order for you to know
which things to pursue and which things to avoid depending
on how they fit with your survival agenda you see
meanings are how you know whether something is going to
be beneficial to your survival or not those things which
are not beneficial or are irrelevant to you are meaningless
and those things which are beneficial and serve your survival
the most those are very meaningful for you and of
course all of that is completely relative depending on how
you've defined yourself all thinking is survival activity justifying rationalizing
creating stories and narratives all beliefs all logic and reason
complaining thinking up ideas fantasizing imagination philosophy any theories you
have scientific thinking this is all survival activity why else
would you be doing it all speech is survival activity
and then we come to perhaps the most important and
trickiest category of all which is all emotions I'm talking
about fear anger sadness happiness excitement arousal embarrassment disgust frustration
boredom jealousy desire craving suffering pain all of these are
how you survive how you manipulate yourself to survive these
are the internal levers that you are pulling to manipulate
yourself into relationship with the environment such that you could
survive and without this mechanism you'd be dead very fast
so it's a very complicated messy nest of tangled cords
through this whole domain of emotions and it governs and
runs your entire life all feelings of discomfort are about
survival are you feeling comfortable in your chair right now
I no I'm not what is that feeling of discomfort
on your ass when you're sitting on a chair it's
a it's a signal that helps you to move your
ass and get yourself more comfortable because otherwise you would
make might damage your ass my damage your body something
like that also to conclude this list politics religion science
business war celebrity and fame status money and resource distribution
fairness justice ethics and morality all of this is about
survival see so there's a lot here and we're still
just scratching the surface all of this is survival activity
and you are engaged in all of it all the
time every second of your life but you're not conscious
of why you're doing these things you're just doing these
things because you don't even know any other way to
live survival has completely dominated and taken over your life
survival has co-opted your entire emotional system your belief system
your worldview and your reason such that you can't think
straight you can't feel straight you can't see reality straight
because all of that had to be co-opted corrupted and
distorted in order for you to be able to be
you because if you saw reality as it actually is
you couldn't be you you'd be dead so in a
nutshell you are a survival robot and you are just
now starting to see the tip of the iceberg of
how much of a robot you are and you have
no idea how to change yourself or what to do
about this that's okay we'll help you as we keep
going for now don't worry about changing it or stopping
it rather worry more about becoming aware of it your
ability to change all these things is directly dependent upon
your ability to be aware of it and there's a
lot of it to be aware of here you could
spend the next five years studying all the stuff that
I just listed and you still wouldn't be totally aware
of all the stuff that's going on with that low
within within your life which is survival here's a really
important key insight for you take a note on this
survival is deeply intelligent stop thinking of survival as a
dumb mechanical process it isn't survival is subtle nonlinear and
full of sleight of hand trickery and deception survival knows
no shame it will go to any cost and any
length in order to win survival is extremely elaborate and
elaborate and sophisticated the sophistication of survival when you start
to really study it and to see it in action
is just jaw-dropping how sophisticated it is especially within humans
extremely sophisticated survival strategies humans invent in order to maintain
themselves within the environments that they find themselves in and
here's what people understand is that there are so many
different environments in which humans live and I'm not just
talking about mountains and deserts and tropical islands I'm talking
about social environments because humans primarily in order to survive
we need to survive in a social environment even more
so than physical one so humans invent very elaborate social
survival strategies and then they they they work their whole
lives to maintain those without having a clue of why
they did it or what they're doing and because they
don't have a clue of why they did it or
what they're doing they're not free to change it and
in fact what they do is they dig in their
heels like a stubborn ass and they refuse to budge
and this is where the problem of closed mindedness comes
in is that people are so closed-minded because they don't
want to change because they found their little niche in
life whatever it is whatever your niche is whether you're
a a corporate lawyer working for Exxon Mobil or you're
an assistant to the president in I today --tz-- or
you're some anchor on Fox News or you're some smear
merchant conspiracy theorists YouTube or who puts out videos or
you run a tabloid magazine or you're some corporate CEO
of Google or Apple or whatever you found your little
niche and now you're defending that little niche and you
don't want to change you don't want to know anything
beyond that little niche because that little niche is that
perfect fit between you and your environment that you're trying
to maintain desperately and this is what closes you up
and prevents you from really being free in life because
you're so attached to your survival strategy in fact your
survival strategies are literally baked into your physical brain the
neurons baked into it from from birth from childhood and
many of your survival strategies are extremely dysfunctional but they
were baked into your into your brain and into your
mind so early in your life because of the tough
situations and environments that you were in maybe you were
an abusive household maybe her parents were alcoholics maybe it
was a tough neighborhood you grew up in some some
ghetto or in the hood somewhere and you have to
be tough to you know just to survive or maybe
you had to steal when you were younger because there
just wasn't money in the family or maybe you came
from a poor country where you had to do some
some shady stuff to get by maybe have to live
and yet to manipulate maybe you have to extort me
you have to bribe maybe even have to kill people
maybe you have to kill animals yeah all that survival
that's how humans survive there's nothing just or fair about
it it's just raw selfishness and most survival strategies are
unconscious you don't even know that it's a strategy you
don't just sit down one day as a child and
come up with a strategy I'm gonna lie to -
every new boyfriend that I have you don't do that
it's not like that it's like no you're growing up
this environment where lying your family is just constant between
your mother and your father then you just pick up
on it and just gets ingrained into how you think
life can only be lived is that way through lying
all the time and you notice that your mother's always
lying to your father and so forth and then you
just pick that up and then you keep doing that
with all the boyfriends that you get yeah that's your
survival strategy and survival strategies when they're unconscious the problem
you might think well Leo survival is great because it
keeps me alive not necessarily because when you take your
selfishness in your survival just hog-wild no-holds-barred it actually tends
to circle back around backfire on itself and actually caused
you a lot of misery suffering and can even end
in depression and suicide and all sorts of terrible things
addictions of various kinds see because to really be good
at life you need to do survival in a conscious
manner most people are doing survival in an unconscious manner
it's not that I'm saying that survival is a terrible
thing be careful not the judge survival here I'm not
judging it I'm just trying to make you more aware
of just what you're doing we're just observing here that's
all we're not judging anything no here's a really important
point what's being survived is the mind or the psyche
when we're talking about humans that's really where most of
our work here has to happen and this is a
very specific thing your psyche it has unique psychic needs
attractions and aversions think of the psyche like a ghost
which has taken over the machine that is your body
this ghost is inside of you pulling various levers every
lever that it pulls is to maintain itself that's the
ghosts game and if it doesn't pull the right combination
of levers of the ghost will die and that's what
you want right now when I'm talking to you I'm
pointing to you you're that ghost you that thing that
you think you are that thing you think was born
that human that's sitting there right now listening to this
that's the ghost I'm talking about inside your skull that
ghosts that you believe that you are of course there's
no real ghosts there there's nothing there but you believe
you are that ghost you have an image of yourself
and so forth and so me just telling you that
you don't exist it's not gonna change anything for you
you still believe you exist this ghost you believe you're
important you believe you're the most important thing and so
you're your entire life is just a game of maintaining
that ghost this ghost of course not only has to
look out for physical dangers obviously but this ghost must
look out for psychic dangers as well like for example
contradictions within its own worldview that's a serious threat to
this ghosts worldview is a very important thing for this
ghost other things that the ghost must look out for
these psychic dangers are it must maintain a positive self
narrative it must think that it's the hero it must
think that it's the good guy because if the ghost
ever starts to think of itself as a devil or
the bad guy that's gonna be very painful and problematic
for the ghost it's gonna have to change its ways
can't maintain itself that way so the ghost needs to
maintain a positive self-image the ghost must justify all of
its actions to itself towards that end so that it
appears to be an angel to itself which is of
course very self-serving because what you're doing is you're taking
all your selfishness and you're calling that goodness you're taking
all of your dowry and you're calling that goodness also
the ghost must feel right and good and certain and
not confused which is why it needs beliefs in order
to eliminate uncertainty and confusion so of course this ghost
adopts a bunch of beliefs and clings to them incorporates
all these beliefs into itself so that literally the body
of the ghost is made up of beliefs and worldviews
which is precisely why people are so closed-minded to changing
them this ghost must make sense of the world must
explain the world to itself in a cohesive manner otherwise
it might go insane and it won't be able to
manipulate the world effectively if its models of the world
aren't very good at the same time this ghost has
so many flawed models of the world that it's really
put itself in a serious bind because on the one
hand its models are so ineffective and so dysfunctional and
obviously untrue on the other hand it's attached to its
models so it can't give up its models cuz if
I I value of my own my my models my
scientific models my Christian Islamic models whatever models I got
if I give up all those then I'll be dead
as this ghost because my body is made up of
these things that's the ghost in the machine see so
this is why people get stuck with very dysfunctional worldviews
you would think like well if they're dysfunctional then they
they hinder survival and therefore it would be very easy
leo to just shed them no you couldn't be more
wrong because well you're under estimating is the extent to
which your identity is fused with your models and belief
systems such that you would rather operate for the rest
of your life on a dysfunctional and untrue model of
the world which actually harms you physically or mentally rather
than admit that your model the world is wrong and
to change it that for you would be the greater
evil or at least for most people this ghost must
also look out and preempt external threats these threats can
be physical but also not physical psychological and it must
keep itself motivated too so that it can survive some
more another day I want you to especially notice your
survival at the micro level this is where really you're
gonna grow from this conversation I want you to monitor
every tiny thing that you do all day long sometimes
even minute by minute and check how it relates to
your survival so you're blowing your nose one minute look
at that how does that relate to your survival how
is that helping you to survive you're scratching your ass
the next minute how about that you're fueling up your
car well that's survival you're driving to the store that's
survival you're texting a friend that's survival notice all those
little things even within that one incident where you're sending
your friend a text message notice which letters you're typing
in and notice how every letter every word that you're
typing into that message every thought about what you're supposed
to say in this message is all survival that's how
granular I want you to get with this right we
got to get really granular so you really see it
happening in your life this is not theory this is
not a philosophy of mine this is something you're doing
all the time if you've been listening to me and
having various kinds of objections notice that what is that
that's yours ghost surviving maybe it's disagreeing with some of
the stuff I'm saying or maybe you're agreeing that's also
survival if you're saying oh yes yes leo what you're
saying is so true this is so well this is
so good for me oh my god I love all
this survival you're a self-help junkie so all my videos
are helping you to survive as a self-help junkie that's
what you're doing especially notice the specific survival demands of
your ghost your particular ghost has certain specific things that
it needs not just common I'm just talking about common
survival things like yes your ghost needs water and food
and sex and friendship and a job and money and
sleep that's all obvious you know all that anyways I
want you to notice what's unique to your self-image and
your ego to your ghost here are some examples maybe
you have a person that needs to wake up at
a certain time in the morning or otherwise you start
feeling guilty what's that about those are the needs of
your ghost maybe you need to wake up at 8
a.m. and there you go that's what you need that's
how you're surviving and what are you surviving you're surviving
a very specific particular way that you are so what
I want you to notice here is that unlike the
way that we conventionally think is that that we are
some way and then we do stuff that is sort
of what we do like we think of ourselves as
a physical object then we do stuff and that sort
of just like maintains the physical object change that model
rather think of yourself as literally being the things that
you're doing such that if you stop doing them you'll
stop being them and you might stop being at all
if you stop doing everything all at once see so
to be the way that you are you have to
wake up at a certain time in the day see
it's extremely granular but there's a lot of these granular
things which all add up to creating the unique thing
that you are the unique personality and psyche and human
that you are so this is what we're trying to
dissect and to deconstruct and to analyze here to observe
or for example maybe you need a certain type of
breakfast and if you don't get your breakfast you get
cranky what's that about see your ghost has developed a
taste for a certain type of breakfast and if you
get the wrong idea of breakfast you're gonna be upset
and what is getting upset all about that's a way
that you manipulate yourself and your environment to deliver to
you that breakfast that you want so if some server
brings you the wrong meal at breakfast you get angry
at him and then you you scold him and then
he'll by doing that he then brings you the right
breakfast and then you're happy see see what you're doing
but youyou don't of course know that you're doing any
of this you're just acting impulsively or for example you
need to drive a certain type of sports car in
order for you to feel masculine and if you have
the wrong type of car you'll feel emasculated and that
will be very painful and problematic for you because you've
developed this image of being this this macho masculine guy
and that hinges upon you having the right sports car
and then God forbid someone scratches your sports car your
your masculinity takes a ding see how this works your
sense of self is not only your physical body and
any ideas and worldviews that you have it's also the
things the physical objects that you get attached to as
well and the non physical objects you might get attached
to some idea like that you're an American or that
you're a German and then and then you have to
defend that or maybe you know you have some some
organization that you're part of then you're gonna defend that
organization it becomes an extension of yourself another example might
be that maybe you need to listen to some specific
type of music to help you relax and if you
get the wrong type of music like some heavy metal
music that you don't like that's gonna ruin your relaxation
what's that about see you're your ghost has certain music
that it likes and certain music that hates but are
you aware of that maybe you need to do your
meditation every morning or you feel guilty what's that about
because your ghost has some spiritual image of yourself as
some yogi or some meditator some self-actualize err and I've
I've programmed you through these videos to meditate every day
and so now see you've got that mind virus inside
of you and you say Oh leo but it's good
meditation is good yeah but how many of you meditate
really unconsciously and robotically and then feel guilty about not
doing it when you miss a day but Leo you
said I have to meditate every single day see it's
very tricky it's very tricky as you're growing through this
whole process you're developing and you're becoming more conscious it's
not like you can perfect yourself in a single day
you're really kind of like crawling out of a very
very deep hole inch by inch by inch by inch
so it'll take you decades to really perfect yourself so
you know it's like a bootstrapping process where bootstrapping ourselves
in this work and so don't expect to be able
to solve all of this and in a day or
a month or even a year this is heavy stuff
your life's work here right so be patient yeah there's
a lot of deception and delusion within you that we
just can't address it all at once we got it
like bite away at it piece by piece by piece
maybe you need to get a text message from your
lover from your girlfriend from your boyfriend from your spouse
in order to feel happy and if you don't get
that text message you feel upset or fearful or whatever
oh my god what happened to them why aren't they
texting me see your your ghost has those needs or
maybe you are a troll and so you need to
post your daily troll comment on some YouTube video or
on some online forum otherwise you can't survive as a
troll you see to be a troll you have to
do troll things if you stop doing troll things you
literally will die as a troll the troll and you
will die so you feel compelled to do it or
maybe you need to judge so-and-so today and that's how
your ghost becomes judgmental and stays judgemental or maybe you
need to worry today or maybe you need to procrastinate
today or maybe you need to play five hours of
video games today or maybe you need to watch three
hours of YouTube today because that's how you survive you
might think well Lea but three hours of YouTube this
is hurting my survival it's hurting the survival of some
imaginary self that you have maybe you imagine yourself to
be this very productive person so yes it's it's hurting
you becoming that but it's maintaining you as the lazy
person which is what you are right now this lazy
person how do you think you stay a lazy person
by doing lazy things see so what are all these
activities accomplishing they are letting you be you try not
doing one of these things and watch your ghost react
and [ __ ] and moan and come with excuses
and suffer and go through pain and torture that's what
it's like try going one day without wiping your ass
see how you feel you won't feel like yourself just
with that little tiny change you won't feel like yourself
anymore I'm not saying you have to do that or
live this way I'm just I'm just saying by notice
that by changing these things literally we're affecting who you
think you are and how you actually are at a
metaphysical level that's very important to get so I want
you to become very clear about what it is that
you are busy surviving what is that ghost pay extra
careful attention to your thoughts and your emotions because these
are the trickiest and the most significant and the most
devious ways in which you survive I want you to
notice that they have been completely hijacked to serve survival
such that you can't think straight anymore literally you can't
think straight every thought you have is a thought about
survival even all your lofty thoughts about self-improvement enlightenment still
they're all serving the ego survival everything you think and
feel I want you to notice has an ulterior motive
behind it one that you're usually not conscious of you
think and feel to manipulate and survive within the environment
you find yourself in so like if you're if you're
working some busy corporate job the thoughts and feelings that
you have have to be of a certain type in
order to maintain working there you have to tell yourself
certain things a certain story a certain narrative in order
to allow yourself to work there otherwise you couldn't work
there you'd quit or you wouldn't fit in with how
your other fellow employees thought like you can't work on
Wall Street while at the same time believing or seeing
rather how damaging Wall Street is to American society for
example you can you have to [ __ ] yourself
into thinking that what you're doing on Wall Street is
somehow beneficial to mankind or I don't know what kind
of stories themselves but they have to do that if
they ignore their own feelings you have to manipulate everyday
in order to maintain that whole house of cards called
Wall Street and you do that all the time at
your work and in school and everywhere else in your
relationship with your family on and on and on here's
a key insight for you all your emotional ups and
downs are survival in action all of your drama you
know that daily drama you go through the highs and
the lows it's all survival so if you want relief
from that you need to become a master of understanding
survival Oh it's important to distinguish here between being a
master of survival versus a master of understanding survive these
are two totally different things notice that I'm not telling
you here that what you need to do is become
more efficient at your survival no you need to become
much more conscious of your survival that's very different you
know because like the people who work on Wall Street
they're extremely efficient at their survival they're extremely efficient bullshitters
liars dissemblers manipulators exploiters you name it frauds con artists
and some of them are good people but uh you
know they're extremely effective at that so by being extremely
effective at survival that's actually the problem part of the
problem here is that you're so obsessed with survival and
you're so effective at it that has completely obscured your
ability to recognize anything else to live your life in
any way and so here's the fundamental problem of survival
and while we're talking about it is that survival is
suffering the reason you suffer and the reason you can't
be fulfilled or satisfied in life no matter how hard
you try no matter how many yachts you buy or
how many amazing people you have sex with you can't
be fulfilled because it's all survival and so you keep
trying and trying and trying you just spin your wheels
for decades and you don't know why it's not working
that's because you're stuck in survival and survival is not
designed to make you fulfill their happy survival is designed
to keep you in constant motion and to keep you
surviving until you're dead until you stall out the clock
the purpose of survival is for you to stall out
the clock yeah this is heavy stuff but also life-changing
stuff you know a lot to swallow so maybe you'll
have to take it piece by piece in conclusion let
me just say that survival understanding survival is absolutely foundational
to any kind of self-improvement or spirituality and this is
something that will require years of study and self observation
on your part so let me help you to begin
to do that with this following homework assignment study carefully
over the next week the unique demands the unique demands
of your ghosts what does it want what does it
hate who is it trying to be what is it
trying to avoid what threatens it who does it want
to be contemplate all that at the same time observe
yourself surviving for one week try to observe at the
most micro level that you can but also notice macro
survival strategies that you might have make a profile make
sort of a list in your commonplace book or in
your journal of all of your survival strategies that you
can articulate sometimes it's a little you know requires some
study to be able to articulate these to notice them
so start noticing them especially pay attention to your emotions
your thoughts and your reactions and also profile try to
articulate your philosophy and worldview what is your ghosts worldview
what kind of intellectual positions and beliefs is your ghost
attached to that must be maintained and survived at all
costs whether it's your nationalism your patriotism your socialism your
desire for feminism or anti feminism or whatever it is
materialism science rationality some religion that you have spiritual philosophy
you have make a list of that and try to
notice how you're reinforcing that as well you're reinforcing your
worldview by the types of books you read the types
of movies you watch the type of people you have
conversations with the types of YouTube videos you look at
the types of channels you're subscribed to you the type
of comments you leave under my videos see start to
interconnect all this stuff connect the micro with the macro
and vice-versa also let me warn you just as a
as a trap here be careful to distinguish between observing
survival versus doing survival so what I'm asking you here
is not to change your survival yet I'm not asking
you to improve your survival or to judge your survival
I'm asking you to observe it impartially scientifically so to
speak this whole conversation is not about enhancing your survival
because that would just be more the same that's already
what you've been doing your whole life that's what every
conversation you've ever had with anybody has been about we're
trying to do something kind of counterintuitive here something that
you might not even think has any value because you
see that the whole notion of value is already co-opted
by your survival agenda we're trying to sort of undo
the whole game of survival to see if there is
maybe a different way to live your life one that
is not centered around survival so much now of course
as you should expect your ego will object and I'll
say all billy-oh that's dangerous because you're undermining it my
survival yes from your point of view it'll look dangerous
that's why it's counterintuitive that's why I said long ago
that this work is counterintuitive in paradoxical and you need
to be able to be forward-thinking enough to see how
you know blind survival no-holds-barred is maybe gonna backfire in
your life and will not get you the satisfaction that
you think it will we'll be talking about that and
a lot more that I have to say about survival
in part two so make sure you stick around for
that that's it for this part please click that like
button for me and come check out actualize that org
that's my website you'll find my blog you'll find the
forum the life purpose course the book list speaking of
which I just updated with 25 new books that's free
for anybody who's already purchased it and if you purchase
it now then you'll get that update automatically I have
some very powerful new books there so make sure you
go check those out and the final thing I want
to say to you is this there is a possibility
of life outside of survival but just what that is
is difficult for most people to imagine because they're so
stuck in survival so we will be talking about that
in part two but for now I just want you
to ponder the following question over the next week what
in my life is not survival because by doing the
homework assignment I just gave you you're going to find
a million survival activities but can you find something in
your life that's not survival that's tricky but try to
look for it and I'll help you to to get
clear on it in part two you
