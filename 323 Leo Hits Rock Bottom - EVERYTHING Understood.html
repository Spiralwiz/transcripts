            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/OxiiiqQyeBM' target='_blank'>Leo Hits Rock Bottom - EVERYTHING Understood</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Leo's experience</b>: Leo undergoes a profound experience where he feels that he becomes conscious of the ultimate nature of reality, describing it as hitting rock bottom or thoroughly tasting the "honey" of reality.
</li><li><b>Understanding of reality</b>: Leo emphasizes that understanding the ultimate nature of reality takes many layers and facets, and cannot be fully understood in one instance. He likens it to tasting honey, with past experiences being like tiny tastes, and this particular revelation feeling like consuming an entire jar of honey. 
</li><li><b>Preparing for the experience</b>: Before this profound experience, Leo mentions that he was organizing his notes and planning for the book he wants to write, which helped him clarify the concept of absolute infinity in his own mind. 
</li><li><b>Using ALS (LSD analog)</b>: Leo consummated 225 micrograms of ALS, an analog of LSD, which greatly intensified his contemplation and self-inquiry. Within 10 minutes, he claims to have broken through the boundaries of typical consciousness.
</li><li><b>Entering the Godhead</b>: Leo describes entering the 'Godhead', the heart of what he refers to as absolute infinity or the heart of God. He elaborates that it feels like going deeper into an infinite cosmic chain reaction or inside the middle of the sun. 
</li><li><b>Connected to the Universe</b>: He compares this experience to being an energy arc shooting out from the sun, initially appearing to be separate, but eventually merging back with the surface of the sun. He equates this with the individuality of human beings and their connection to the universe.
</li><li><b>Realization of reality</b>: Upon realization, Leo decides that reality is neither physical nor mental, but a being that has no name and cannot be defined or contained in terms like 'matter', 'energy', or even 'consciousness'. 
</li><li><b>Concept of a "strange loop"</b>: He introduces the concept of a "strange loop", which is a self-referential and circular structure that he believes reality embodies.
</li><li><b>Ultimate nature of reality</b>: Leo concludes that the ultimate nature of reality is a Godhead where there is no distinction between existence and non-existence  referred to as non-duality  where form is formlessness and formlessness is form. 
</li><li><b>Interconnectivity</b>: He arrived at the realization that all sentient beings, including humans, are interconnected and are essentially nothingness. This happened while sitting on his couch during his contemplation. 
</li><li><b>Personal healing</b>: At one point during his experience, Leo felt a brief moment where he could heal himself. He describes scanning his body resulting in a sense of healing from within, an incident he associates with advanced mystics' reported healing abilities.
</li><li><b>Desire for ultimate truth</b>: The core information extracted from this section emphasizes the importance of a genuine desire for understanding the ultimate truth in personal development. This desire should be for consciousness to know itself and should guide one's priorities in life. The pursuit of enlightenment can lead to levels of development less common in society, despite the time and struggles it may entail.
</li><li><b>Understanding of reality's substance</b>: According to Leo, reality cannot be defined in terms of anything because it is made up of itself. He argues that defining it with labels such as matter, energy, awareness, or consciousness misses the point, suggesting that the substance of reality is most closely akin to nothing and it is all non-dual.
</li><li><b>Concept of "strange loop"</b>: Leo introduces the concept of a "strange loop" from Douglas Hofstadter, which describes structures where hierarchy loops up on itself. Applied to reality, it conveys a vicious circularity with no ultimate standard or grounding  even ideas such as existence and non-existence are circular and don't truly exist.
</li><li><b>Understanding of non-duality</b>: Leo describes experiencing strong, direct awareness of non-duality. He explains that upon opening his eyes after a meditation, he felt a deep connection with the fact that everything and everyone is interconnected, and everything is part of an infinite singularity within which all beings exist.
</li><li><b>Concrete realization through personal experience</b>: Leo underscores that all sentient beings, including humans, are essentially equivalent to "nothing". He realizes he is Buddha and Christ, and asserts that any living creature, regardless of form or consciousness, is nothing, and exists within the infinite singularity that constitutes reality.
</li><li><b>Insights into nature of existence and reality</b>: Leo posits that non-existence is impossible and this understanding can positively alter attitudes toward life and death. He sees reality as an endless causal chain of creativity, suggesting that trying to understand or break it down using scientific methods is ultimately futile. He reaches a point where he feels he understands everything about life, in particular, the substance of all reality. 
</li><li><b>After-effects of realization</b>: Even after returning to ordinary consciousness, Leo maintains his understanding of non-duality and the interconnectedness of all things. Despite occasional periods of depression, he feels his meditation practice has improved significantly, experiencing increased awareness of the non-dual nature of everything around him.
</li><li><b>Experience with Non-Physical Reality</b>: Leo Gura discusses that in every action he takes, he realizes the substance around him is not physical, but non-dual. Essentially, everything becomes an experience of recognizing non-duality, which he finds remarkable.
</li><li><b>Meditation and Oscillation of Experiences</b>: His ability to meditate and focus on the non-dual nature of everything has significantly improved. However, he has witnessed an oscillation in his experiences of meditation, including bouts of depression. He likens this to the behavior of a spring - each high point (breakthrough) is followed by a lowering before it finds a new, slightly higher baseline. This process can cause minor frustrations and annoyances.
</li><li><b>Creativity Post-Enlightenment</b>: After reaching a state of profound understanding, Gura's creativity surges. This realization of the creative power of everything has channelled a substantial amount of creativity through him, sparking many insights those he has used for working on his book. However, he admits that this increase in creativity makes it challenging for him to switch into a meditative state due to the mind's active state from creative work.
</li><li><b>Transition to Spiral Dynamics Stage Turquoise</b>: Gura believes he has transitioned into the 'turquoise' stage of Spiral Dynamics, after recognizing the interconnectedness of life and the non-dual nature of reality. This stage goes beyond analytical thinking, connecting to life on an 'energetic level' and acknowledging the inherently mystical nature of all reality. He admits still needing to work through remnants of previous stages.
</li><li><b>Not Enlightened</b>: Despite his profound understanding and insights, Gura does not believe he has reached enlightenment. He feels a final shift is needed where one maintains a constant awareness of the non-dual nature of everything, feeling like a permanent 'high' state of mind. He believes this requires more meditation and being present in the moment.
</li><li><b>Self-improvement Continues Post-Enlightenment</b>: Gura emphasizes that existential insights do not eliminate personal flaws, bad habits, or addictions. He still recognizes his and acknowledges the need for continued personal development.
</li><li><b>Reconciliation of Creativity and Meditation</b>: Balancing his newfound creativity with meditation is a struggle for Gura. He finds quickly transitioning from a highly creative state to a meditative state challenging. Despite this, he understands this is something he needs to master.
</li><li><b>Further exploration into 'Stage Turquoise' and reconciling meditation with creativity</b>: Leo shares his plans to delve deeper into 'Stage Turquoise', a state of consciousness where one feels connected to the world on an energetic level, and reconcile this with creativity. He feels the need for extended periods of meditation to aid this exploration, despite his other responsibilities like working and writing a book.
</li><li><b>Connecting life purpose with enlightenment</b>: Leo suggests that integrating life purpose with enlightenment is a key aspect of 'Stage Turquoise'. Enlightenment does not necessarily need to be about teaching others; it may also involve creating art or running a business. One's enlightenment and life purpose dovetail with each other, and success in one can fuel the other.
</li><li><b>Continued learning and research</b>: Leo indicates he has ongoing research in various areas including science, philosophy, history, and the spiritual domain, and plans to share these relative insights to further his life purpose, sparked by his natural curiosity.
</li><li><b>Use of AL-LAD for contemplation</b>: He prefers using AL-LAD over 5-MeO-DMT as a tool for deep contemplation due to its gentler and more extended effect, allowing him to analyze his thoughts deeply over a longer period.
</li><li><b>Personal development post-enlightenment</b>: Leo emphasizes that even post-enlightenment, there's still a lot of personal development work required, such as dealing with bad habits, addictions, emotional disturbances, implying that enlightenment does not make personal development obsolete. Instead, both are crucial for holistic growth.
</li><li><b>Questioning the substance of reality</b>: Leo puts forth the idea that one should be curious about the foundational substance of reality, pointing out that any substance used to ground reality is part of the substance itself. This realization is a significant journey into understanding the circular and self-referential nature of reality.  
</li><li><b>Importance of desire for truth</b>: Leo highlights the essentiality of having a genuine desire to uncover the ultimate truth, a curiosity driven not by personal gain, but as a means for consciousness to understand itself.
</li><li><b>Synergy between creativity and enlightenment</b>: He indicates that deep mystical experiences can significantly enhance one's creativity, making it more effortless and impactful.
</li><li><b>Pursuing enlightenment despite challenges</b>: Leo argues that the pursuit of enlightenment is the most worthwhile endeavor one can undertake, despite the struggles it may involve. He emphasizes that enlightenment can transform one's life and lead to levels of development uncommon in society, therefore, the struggle is worth it.
