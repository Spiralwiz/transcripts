Welcome to this special Halloween edition of actualized. Org. The
topic of tonight is going to be fear. And the
question is, what is that one thing that's worth fearing
in your life? What is the one thing that you
should fear tonight and every night for the rest of
your life so what is the one thing that's worthwhile
fearing in your life, the one thing that should be
constantly on the top of your mind. Take a second.
Take a good guess. Because here at actualized. Org, one
of the things we preach is lack of fear. And
getting rid of our fears, in the name of emotional
self mastery. What's perhaps one fear, that's a good and
healthy fear for you to have for you to remind
yourself of every once in a while, so you don't
get complacent. And he guesses the biggest thing you should
fear in your life is that you waste your life.
This precious thing that you've got this one chance this
one instance, this one shot that you get just one,
you only get one. I look around and throughout my
whole life. Perhaps what's made me a little bit different
than others. I consider myself to be average, fairly ordinary.
I don't think of myself as too exceptional. But perhaps
there's one thing I am exceptional. And that's that I
recognize that I've only got one life. And that that
means something special to me. And that means that I
need to make something special out of it. And that
from that one realization everything else in my life gets
reversed in reverse engineered around, designed downwards. From that point
all the way down from my desk all the way
down to today. My buddy Robert and I, we used
to joke, we would go out a lot to the
clubs here in Vegas. And we would joke because we
would say that we're living our lives right now, every
day, as though we're having a midlife crisis. And we
would look and we would point out people who seemed
like they might have a midlife crisis 20 years from
now, or 10 years from now, or five years from
now. But we were happy that we were living our
lives, as though the midlife crisis has already come. Because
at the end of your life, you're only going to
have regrets over the things you did not do. In
my own life, I already feel like I've gone through
two or three midlife crises, and I'm not even 30
yet. And I think that's healthy. Because what I see
is I see people stumbling around through life, unmotivated, petty,
shallow, pursuing things that they don't know why they're pursuing
them. busy running around like hamsters in a wheel. And
I've been guilty of this on a small scale, but
somewhere in the back of my mind on the large
scale, I've never really lost track of what we're playing
for here what the ultimate objective is, and that's to
make something special of your life. And to make sure
that every single month and year of your life, you're
staying on track with something big and special is what
you want to live a nice happy life with a
simple family and a nine to five job and into
retirement. That is what you're going to do. What's your
one life, that's it, that's what you're gonna do, you're
gonna go, you're gonna punch the clock for eight, nine
hours a day, for 40 years of your life, you
will work, you have no emotional connection to doing work
that isn't serving the universe or the world in any
especially important way. And then we're going to come home,
you're gonna sit on the TV, you're gonna eat some
boring food. Maybe you have some boring sex, maybe you're
gonna play with your boring kids, teach them some boring
things. And they're going to do that over and over
and over again. And then maybe once you retire, you
go fishing somewhere, you'll travel once in a while, and
that's what your life is gonna be. Really. That's what
your wife is gonna be. That's what you're gonna do
with this one life. Do you realize what this life
is? I feel like people don't really understand what what
life is. I mean, what is life? Look, look at
your hands. Like look around you. It's amazing. It's pure
magic. 12 or 14 billion years ago, there was supposedly
a big bang. Before that there was who knows what.
Not even nothingness. And then from that big bang came
out all the matter, all the energy, and it's a
billions of years for all that to cool, down, congeal,
create stars, those stars, morphs, and drew in dust clouds
created planets exploded again and again, and again, creating heavier
and heavier elements, until more and more denser planets could
be formed. And then, 4 billion years ago, we got
the earth. And the earth was just a molten ball
of lava. And then slowly cooled, it cooled, it cooled,
until finally little organisms started to run around it. And
then we had three and a half billion years of
evolution. This amazing thing, if you've ever studied the complexity
and richness of evolution, it blows your mind if it
leaves you to tears when you study how intricate everything
else, and how well it all works together. And from
that arose, reptiles and amphibians, and mammals and dinosaurs. And
then there was a giant Cataclysm 65 million years ago,
that wiped out the dinosaurs, and allowed for that mammals
to rise. From that there were 10s of millions of
years of evolution, until finally primates started to become more
like what humans are now. hominids. And then from that
there was a whole series of progression and evolution up
to the Homo Sapien. And that's what you are. And
then there were hundreds of 1000s of years of evolution
upon that of civilization and culture, technology and language and
all this, and art. And finally, here we are in
the 21st century now. And you yourself, what about you?
Your mom and your dad when they got together? The
average woman she has about 150 200 eggs in her
whole life. When your dad had sex with your mom
and conceived you, that was 150 million sperm. 150 million
sperm plus 150 eggs. What are the odds that it
was you that materialized from that? Well, you beat those
odds. Not only did you beat those odds, but then
you were just dating for nine months in your mom's
stomach. Going through nine months of pregnancy, which not everyone
goes through successfully. Many pregnancies don't go through successfully. So
you made it through nine months of pregnancy, and then
you were born. And you probably came out relatively healthy.
On deformed, you have all your limbs intact, you have
your eyesight intact. You have your hearing intact and everything
else about you relatively intact. Not only that, but like
Do you realize what you are you're not a one
thing. You're really an amalgamation of Now the nation, a
giant country as it were, of 40 trillion cells. That's
what scientists estimate 40 trillion cells comprise the human body,
roughly speaking. Every single day, you generate 200 billion new
blood cells to replace the ones that that die and
deteriorate with age. And, look, we're in the 21st century.
So many advances. You live in a good country. You
live in a good economy. There's no caste system anymore.
There's no slavery anymore. There's no serious wars right now.
We have relative political stability, we have laws, we have
amazing technology we have the internet, basically, right now is
the most freest most amazing time to have been a
human being ever, ever in the history of the universe.
That's where we're living right now. That's where you're living
right now. And beyond that, just what is what is
this reality that we inhabit? It's like pure magic. It
really is. And yet, what do you do with it?
You should all over it. You take this magical thing,
and what have you done with it? You've made yourself
bored, and miserable, and depressed, and whining and complaining, and
bitching and moaning and acting the victim and being unmotivated,
and being petty, worrying about stupid things, holding negative judgments
and opinions of others. Taking all of this for granted,
complaining about the bad economy, complaining about the bad political
system, complaining about the direction of your country, complaining about
all this stuff. When you should be on your knees,
thanking whatever gods you believe in. That this stuff exists
is pure magic. And the worst thing you do the
worst way in which you shit on this, you literally
wipe your ass on the face of the earth. You
like your ass on it? By keeping yourself busy with
stupid shit. So busy. Oh BillyOh my life. My life
is so full. My life is so important. I've got
the kids and I've got this and I've got that
and I've got two jobs and I'm holding down this
and I've got all these hobbies, I got all these
obligations. Bullshit. You're living a petty fucking life. Your life
is petty. It's petty. It's concerned about petty, stupid little
things. And the more busy you are, the more petty
your life is. I challenge you to live a noble
life. Take whatever goals you have for your life, your
highest aspirations and visions that you have for yourself for
who you want to be. For what you want to
happen in the next 20 3040 years and change them
they're not noble enough, change them to something noble, change
them to something beautiful change into something inspiring. And not
because I told you to do it. And not because
you care about the legacy you leave behind because none
of that matters. Your legacy doesn't matter. Everyone's gonna forget
about you. No matter how successful you are. In five
or 10 generations, no one's gonna know about you. No
one's gonna care. You yourself will care. When you're lying
on your deathbed you will care you will care about
what you do with your life and you will realize
done just how precious everything is. Imagine right now that
I told you that you only have till the end
of today to live take that in soak that in.
Just imagine that that was the case right now. How
would you feel? How precious would suddenly everything become? Should
you still be busy? With all that important stuff. I
want you to change your goals. I want you to
take whatever goals you have now. Make them less about
you. Make them more about the beauty of life. What's
your work doing that's doing something beautiful to advance the
universe that you're living in? What is that? Are you
proud of that? Are you proud of the work you're
doing? Are you proud of your creative output, if not
set some noble goals right now about that. And then
whatever goal you set, write it down, and then multiply
it by 10. So if you decide that you want
to go teach 50 people, instead, go teach 500 people.
And if you decide that you want to create a
green energy company, don't make it five times bigger 10
times bigger than you planned. Or go have it help
the environment or society or the world in a 10
times more powerful way, in a 10 times more beautiful,
more noble way. And see how that makes you feel
when you start to think along those lines. Because you
know what? You've got a very, very tiny little bit
of time left very tiny, very, very tiny. Such a
tiny bit of time left. And then when that time
comes you
