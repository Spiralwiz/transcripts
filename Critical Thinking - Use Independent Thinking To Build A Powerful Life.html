hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment I'm going to talk about critical thinking
all right critical thinking so let's crack into this one
let's crack with this one wide open critical thinking is
a critical skill to have and we're going to talk
about why it's important we're also going to talk about
how to develop it and we're going to go deep
on this one I'm going to give you some wisdom
not just tips but wisdom about why this is something
that you should be caring about so ultimately what is
what is behind critical thinking let's define it and let's
talk about why you want to develop it well the
reason that you want to develop critical thinking is because
it will allow you to solve many of the problems
in your life that you have the problems in the
bottlenecks and the obstacles that are holding you back those
will keep holding you back until you start to think
about them and analyze them and then work on them
and you can't work on a problem until you've identified
it become aware of it and a lot of times
you can't become aware of a problem until you've really
thought about it critically so this is a tool that
you will use throughout the rest of your life to
solve all your problems and all your challenges and to
take your life to the next level and the next
level in the next level personally for me critical thinking
has always been something that I valued just inherently and
something that I was good at so this came natural
to me and when I look back at my life
where I've come to now where I am now the
position I'm at now all the success that I've had
all the things that I've done for myself all the
changes that I've made there's no way in hell it
just baffles me there's no way in hell that that
could have happened without thinking about those problems really analyzing
them working my way through them independently right I did
that independently sure I got a lot of valuable information
from other people from other sources from books from television
from media from other gurus and whatnot but in the
end I had to take that on I took on
the burden of thinking through the problems myself and that
is what's really the core of critical thinking let's really
think about critical thinking let's use four to go thinking
to think about critical thinking which will show you what
critical thinking actually is so who are some great critical
thinkers in history let's take a look at a couple
of them how about Rene Descartes how about David Hume
Isaac Newton Plato Socrates Aristotle the Buddha Albert Einstein Pablo
Picasso Leonardo da Vinci just a short list we can
make this list literally thousands of names long but just
a short sampling of some great thinkers when you look
at these people and you study them or you study
their work or you even read just some little short
blurb about them on Wikipedia what you learn is that
these were deep thinkers and these were independent thinkers and
this is the key that I want you to take
away from this video is that critical thinking is independent
thinking that means that you are figuring out the problem
for yourself you're generating the answers for yourself you're not
just taking whatever is given to you it's very easy
especially now with the internet and all this information overload
that we have all this knowledge we've accumulated over the
last 2 and 1/2 thousand years of human history really
since the since the Greek times is it's what is
we've got all this wisdom we've got all this knowledge
we've got all this facts and information and trivia and
and all this and it's just out there and we
tend to just go and appropriate we just appropriate assimilate
and dudududududududu it's like we're just grabbing stuff we're grabbing
stuff but we're not critically thinking about we're not analyzing
it what tends to happen there is that you get
caught up in the values and the beliefs of whoever
you're taking that information from instead of yourself you're not
generating the answer yourself the best example I can give
you here and I hesitate to give it but I'll
give it to you because look it's important remember in
geometry class where you were given a theorem about let's
say triangles or parallel lines or the way angles work
you were given some theorem and you you could use
that theorem to generate answers to various problems but then
you were also asked later in the class to then
not just use the theorem but then to actually prove
it to derive it do you remember that yeah and
I mean I hated doing that but the point there
is that there's something important about being able to derive
a truth for yourself versus just taking it from culture
Society or somebody else when you do that even though
it can be painful challenging and it's much easier to
just take a theorem and just apply it without thinking
critically about it when you do that you get true
understanding you get true perspective you get real mastery if
you actually went through and did those proofs in geometry
class then you actually developed a deep understanding of why
geometry works the way it does if you just took
the theorems that were handed to you and you never
did the proofs you slacked off on that part and
then you just apply the theorems then chances are that
even to this day you don't really have a solid
understanding of some of the laws of geometry you don't
understand for example why certain angles add up to certain
certain amounts you understand why triangles are the way they
are and circles are the way they are and squares
and other things are the way they are you don't
understand that because you have it thought through the process
this is something that's very undervalued nowadays in society it
used to be very highly regarded in the Classical eras
like the Greek times the Roman times right just think
about the Socratic method what did Socrates do what was
his philosophical style it was interesting because the Socratic method
all it is is just asking questions the way that
Socrates would educate his students students of philosophy the way
he would do with philosophy himself is he would ask
you questions so you might come in there and say
well I believe such-and-such and you would say okay you
believe that well if that's true then that must also
imply this and then you would say no it doesn't
apply that then you said okay well then what you
said must be false or maybe you agree yes it
does imply that but it doesn't apply it in the
way that you thought and so now it implies something
slightly different and then that thing implies something slightly different
in something else and something else and so you have
this chain of implications from that original assumption or that
original belief and through this process you can go down
this chain of reasoning by asking question after question after
question posing hypothetical scenarios and you can really get pretty
deep into the truth of the matter and start to
really see what is making this idea tick so what
you got to be doing with your life is you
got to be doing that and if you're curious about
how do I actually build critical thinking skills how to
actually do that well you have to you have to
just start doing it you have to start asking yourself
questions instead of taking facts and information from the media
and from books just accepting this true start analyzing it
thinking it one example of this is when you're reading
a book if you're reading a nonfiction book I think
one of the signs that you're a critical reader is
that as you're reading it you put it down a
lot of times you can't just read a deep non-fiction
book cover-to-cover and not stop for me when I'm reading
I read the book I read a couple of pages
then I have to stop and think about what I
read and I have to ask myself questions is that
true does it really work like that if it is
true one of the implications for my life what are
the implications for all the other information that I've gathered
right see I start to ask myself those questions sometimes
I'll read just two pages and then I'll go off
on a tangent in my mind thinking going down this
chain of critical thinking that I've got going and I'll
spend 15 minutes thinking about it and then I'll I'll
realize that I was caught in that chain I'll be
like okay let's get back to the book finally I
get back to the book because I want to finish
the book too so a little bit of a trade-off
there but basically you go through and you read a
couple of pages than you think about it you don't
just read the book cover-to-cover and then throw it away
and then go on to the next one that's just
you sucking in information and then who knows what effect
that's going to have on you see the problem right
now in society is that we have a lot of
people throwing information at you and a lot of that
information is is motivated by commercial interests commercial purposes there
are literally billion dollar marketing departments across the country across
the world that are looking at how to trap you
into buying their product they might not even think the
product is good it'll still figure out a way to
trap you into it they'll figure out a way to
make you believe whatever is convenient for them whatever produces
the most money for them and that's a very powerful
dangerous force and you have to be able to unplug
yourself from that when you start to think critically you
start to think independently for yourself powerful things start to
happen this is why particularly is so critical when you
have that ability then what you're going to create for
yourself is a son a sense of self direction and
self reliance because right now if you're not a critical
thinker then you do not have your own direction in
life you do not have a sense of reliance on
yourself you're relying on the media on culture on your
friends on people around you on your college professors on
whatever to get you the information that you need and
what they're doing is they're providing you quite frankly with
horseshit garbage negative information that is flat-out false highly distorted
or leading you down the path that you do not
want to be going down when you unplug yourself from
that it's crazy I think the best analogy I can
give is it's almost like there's a herd of cattle
and they're all running they're all running like in a
stampede towards a canyon far off in the distance this
just giant herd of cattle all walking or running even
towards this canyon and you're part of that herd and
you don't even realize that what's going to happen is
that a little soon enough the canyons not that close
right now but soon enough that canyons going to come
and when that whole her gets there they're gonna fall
off the cliff and you're going to come along for
the ride that's that's what society basically is that's what
mainstream society is is that and everyone who's who's plugged
into that is going to fall off the cliff it's
that dead serious this what's happening with your health it's
what's happening with the entertainment that you're watching so what's
happening with your lack of exercise this what's happening with
the crappy career that you're in this is what's happening
with how you understand relationships and sex and religion and
morality all this stuff has just been handed to you
and you just take it you just accept it you
don't think about it whatsoever you don't discover the truths
for yourself when you start to discover these truths for
yourself and think very critically independently rely on yourself as
the primary source and leave all the other sources as
secondary sources when you are the primary source you're going
to realize that a lot of the ideas out there
are just flat-out wrong for you are not going to
work are extremely unhealthy flat-out false greatly distorted and what
you're going to do is you're going to be that
one cow that sees what's happening in a step and
you're going to stop and you're going to go in
the opposite direction you're going to say damn I'm so
glad that I broke out of that herd because if
I kept going down that path I would have surely
fallen off the cliff and all those cows that are
going down that direction they're going to have a miserable
and horrible life but me because I've got my own
sense of direction I'm going to go and I'm going
to chart my own path through life and my path
is going to be an independent path a critical path
the path that can have strength and value and that
can generate something new for Humanity that can create powerful
ideas can start powerful projects can help people in powerful
ways and can can deeply deeply fulfill me so this
is the bottom line of why critical thinking and important
and how it should be working so practically how do
we actually implement this well I'm telling you stop getting
information mindlessly from the environment so that means stop books
stop internet stop television stop magazines stop getting your information
for people and family and religion and from history and
philosophy and just from gurus out there including myself and
professors and teachers stop relying on those people to just
force-feed you golden nuggets you can use all that as
a way to prime the pump but then you got
to do the work you got to put that stuff
into your mill look at your mind is it's like
a a mill that's going to grind through this material
that you're putting into it so you put the material
in then you actually have to do the grinding that's
not what you've been doing so far to actually do
that you have to start asking questions ask questions about
your religion don't be afraid ask questions about history question
it be skeptical be a total skeptic be a cynic
at least for a while go through that phase be
very skeptical be very critical be very analytical about what
people are telling you people's opinions and value your own
opinions above the opinions of others and actually try to
derive this stuff derive it derive the truths ask yourself
what is true what is real what is valuable to
me what is important in life answer those yourself don't
just get that from your parents don't just get that
from your church don't get that from a book don't
even get that from me everything I'm telling you should
be analyzing very very critically and seeing what works what's
true and what's not so it's true for me and
what I believe to be true is not necessarily what's
true it's not necessarily what's going to work for you
you have to figure that out think don't be lazy
think all right the two factors for critical thinking are
what are they curiosity and open-mindedness if you're curious and
you're fascinated by ideas and understanding things that's going to
help you a long way it's gonna that's going to
move you a long way forward along this track to
becoming a good critical thinker and if you're open minded
to ideas it's going to be so so important to
to make it down this path as well because if
you're closed-minded then you're basically you're not going to be
able to analyze ideas properly and really find the truth
because your blinders are on and you're looking as one
direction for truth but truth might be over here except
you're looking always over here because people told you to
always be looking over here so you will never find
what's really true being open-minded means that you're willing to
do this you're willing to go and look into every
direction every nook and cranny doesn't matter who tells you
what and if someone tells you not to look somewhere
that's probably someplace that you should actually go and look
right because why would they tell you not to look
there probably because they're afraid of what you're going to
find out so look in every nook and cranny that's
what you got to do be curious and be open-minded
all right so that's what I have to say about
critical thinking be an independent thinker be a critical thinker
the more you do this the more you practice it
the more is just going to build and snowball and
snowball and snowball and soon enough you're going to realize
that you are an amazing critical thinker independent thinker and
your life is going to take that trajectory you're going
to break off from that that herd that's going down
the cliff and you're going to walk in a positive
new direction all right so this is it for critical
thinking I am signing off go ahead post me some

how to think critically so if you want to develop
critical thinking listen to what I'm telling you because I'm
