[Music] thank you [Music] where the left goes wrong part
two we're continuing off right where we left off in
part one so go watch part one if you haven't
we ended part one emphasizing that one of the biggest
blind spots of leftists is that they don't appreciate how
attached people are especially conservatives who are the majority of
people how attached they are to to their culture to
their national identity and so forth and to basically the
traditional way of living life this is what we might
call culture uh and now this brings us to the
next point which is lgbtq plus issues uh the left
goes wrong by pushing this too far now of course
there's a legitimate Essence behind lgbtq plus which is that
we want to be much more tolerant and Kinder towards
people who are nonsense let's say who are gay who
are trans who are whatever other kind of um you
know non-standard identifications that's all well and good however this
can be taken too far and what the left doesn't
understand about this issue is How Deeply it freaks out
people on the right and just not even people on
the right but moderates as well it's not just extreme
right-wingers who are homophobes and transphobes and anti-lgbtq plus a
lot of just moderate Democrats and Republicans are weirded out
by this issue and leftists don't seem to understand this
again because leftists tend to be so open-minded that they
don't have a good understanding that most of mankind is
extremely closed-minded and that's not because they're inherently hateful people
and they just hate trans people or hate gay people
is because they don't understand they don't understand how it's
possible that this can be a legitimate way of living
or structuring our culture and people in general just very
attached to traditions and Norms of the past and these
are new issues you know trans people didn't really exist
50 years ago I mean you could say they existed
but it's almost as though they didn't exist this is
a new phenomenon in our culture and you have to
come to grips with it and for a lot of
people living in rural parts of the country who are
not in Elite universities and very Progressive University college campuses
and so forth they've never met a trans person they've
never met a gay person they've never been a bi
person now maybe some they've met some who were closeted
and so forth but for the most part you got
to understand this stuff has been suppressed for hundreds of
years by our culture so now by kind of opening
everything up and opening panzers box this starts to freak
people out so even though of course there's no problem
being gay or bi or trans or whatever the problem
that you have to be sensitive to is how this
is going to impact culture at large and if it
makes people uncomfortable or fearful or weirded out this is
going to influence their politics now of course if you're
a leftist you're going to say well Leo but that's
that's their problem you know if they're weirded out or
creeped out or grossed out by lgbtq you know that's
just their bigotry talking again I want to caution you
about this sort of justification for your position it's actually
something uh deeper than just bigotry that's going on here
um you can be uncomfortable with these things that doesn't
necessarily make you a bigot it's just because you haven't
really been exposed to it yet right like think of
it about it this way there was sometime in your
life when you didn't know what trans was you didn't
know what homosexuality was you had to be exposed to
it for the first time and that first time you
were exposed to it it kind of like screwed with
your mind a bit because you know you're just used
to like boys and girls men and women and now
they tell you that there's non-binary genders third kinds of
genders or you could switch from one gender to another
gender this is it's confusing it's legitimately confusing it takes
time to wrap your mind around it now if you
grew up in that kind of like very Progressive leftist
culture that's sort of like UC Berkeley culture then from
a young age you were just exposed to that and
it's kind of normal to you but for older people
who were not raised that way like most of our
parents and in fact most people around the whole country
and around the world they were not raised with this
acceptance of lgbtq they didn't even know what this was
10 years ago this term didn't even exist 10 years
ago some people believe it or not this is this
is as basic As It Gets some people are just
weirded out just by that label lgbtq plus because they
don't even know what it means or they think it's
some sort of you know hippie construct hippie social construct
that isn't grounded in biology or in Practical reality right
this is how people think you may think this is
backwards but again look if we're building a society and
we're trying to evolve our society to Greater Heights of
development which is what we're talking about here ultimately you
have to be sensitive that we have to bring everyone
along in this developmental process and of course many of
these people are going to be scared and stubborn it's
almost like dragging a stubborn old mule up a up
a mountain it doesn't want to go it's resisting so
you have to find ways of enticing this mule to
come along and not freaking it out and leftists sometimes
they make the problem worse because again they lack the
understanding and the perspective and the compassion necessary to understand
that a large percentage of the population is freaked out
by these things and they need a more subtle approach
a more subtle introduction you know of course leftists might
say well Leo we've tried that approach of subtlety but
these people are such bigots and such transphobes and such
homophobes that it doesn't work they're like aggressively ignorant and
stubborn about their resistance to this they're not open-minded so
it doesn't work look I agree with you there is
a certain percentage of the population who are just literally
bigots and racists and sexists and misogynists and homophobes and
transphobes and no amount of gradual approach is going to
really work on them but still I would say that's
the minority the majority who really is what we're talking
about here when we're talking about developing and evolving our
politics and our society we're not talking about we can't
bring everybody along with us there's always going to be
people who are very underdeveloped very stubborn and they're just
going to stick to their guns and the only way
we're going to move Beyond them is just through the
Next Generation being born and the old generation dying of
natural causes there's always going to be some degree of
that but mostly when we're talking about shaping political opinion
and moving Overton windows and so forth we're talking about
the people in the middle let's say we have a
bell curve most people are in the middle let's say
60 percent of people are in the middle of that
bell curve and then we have extremes to both sides
so when shaping public opinion it's important that we keep
our attention focused on that middle 60 percent shaping their
minds rather than the extreme far right which you're never
going to change and that's okay and you don't need
to change them because if you can capture this 60
in the middle and shift them a little bit towards
the left that's enough to evolve society and to win
elections and everything right you're never winning an election with
even 80 percent of the vote so that's fine um
but when you start going extreme with lgbtq issues and
non-binary genders and gender fluidity and people identifying as animals
uh and other sorts of weird things like when you
start to get into sort of like magical um highly
unpragmatic um attitude towards sexuality and gender roles and so
forth with with dozens and and 50 different pronouns and
this sorts of stuff and then you start to get
very um attached to those and then you start demanding
people call you by those pronouns and they you start
to expect culture to accommodate you the majority to accommodate
these very Fringe identifications you start to lose that middle
60 percent because to them it just seems like wacky
it seems impractical it seems entitled it seems narcissistic that
we should carve out special categories for you because you've
come up with your own personal gender category that you
invented with your friends and you have your own pronouns
you know and now we have to change all of
our language and all of our customs and all the
ways we do business to accommodate you do you see
how that comes off as narcissistic it comes off as
childish it comes off as immature that's just how it
comes off because the reality is this if you lived
in some other part of the world some third world
country where survival was really really difficult not at a
democracy not in a wealthy place not in some um
stage green suburb or urban area of America or Europe
then this coming up with your own gender pronouns and
gender identifications and categories and even the notion of being
gay or trans these are luxuries that do not exist
in those kinds of cultures yeah of course you might
say well Leo even in those cultures there's gay people
yeah there's there's gay people and they're still in the
closet and so forth of course there's some degree of
that but for the most part survival in these kinds
of cultures is so difficult that these issues don't even
rise to the level of being issues for most people
in these kinds of cultures it's only when a culture
becomes very wealthy and affluent and you have most of
your basic needs taken care of that then you start
to play around with pronouns and you start to get
all fancy with lgbtq stuff now this might come off
as offensive to those of you who are part of
the lgbtq community you might say no Leo you know
lgbtq this is not a luxury this is something very
core and fundamental to who I am this is not
some sort of luxury don't treat it as luxury but
the reality is just look at the history the history
of societies is that this stuff is a luxury these
issues have only really come about uh to the Forefront
in the last 50 years precisely because Society has evolved
to the point where these luxuries can be afforded if
you're living in Saudi Arabia you don't have this kind
of luxury you have to worry about much more fundamental
survival issues and this is something that left us in
progress progressives don't really appreciate deeply enough it is kind
of a sense of entitlement actually that you have that
you're able to do all sorts of political activism on
behalf of lgbtq in uh in Pratt in previous generations
of society survival was so difficult that you didn't have
this kind of privilege you just had to pick a
gender the one you were born with Go With It
Go with the norms have a family raise a traditional
family do the traditional stuff this is how Humanity has
survived for the majority of human civilization now that's not
an excuse it doesn't mean we have to always be
like that forever but also you have to as a
leftist understand that these are new fairly radical ideas that
is it's going to take time for them to disseminate
through our culture and there's going to be resistance to
it and fear and discomfort with it there's also some
other problems with lgbtq uh one of the problems is
that as you're creating space for these alternative modes of
identifying an alternative sexualities this does encroach and undermine some
of the traditional forms of sexuality and masculine feminine polarity
that has been the engine that dropped that drove human
civilization and uh you know family structures for thousands of
years it is the case that in modern times men
and women are not taught very well how to be
masculine how to be feminine it's almost like these are
being neglected for the sake uh I mean they're just
being neglected and sort of the hot button popular issues
are lgbtq issues when really the majority of mankind identifies
as man or woman masculine or feminine and that's what
they're most comfortable with so maybe 95 percent fall into
that category maybe if you want to be very generous
in the lgbtq folk you could say 90 percent fall
into the traditional masculine feminine polarity category so that's 90
of your population right there that's what you should be
most concerned about that's not a mistake to be concerned
mostly about that and I would say that in the
last 50 years as a society as a culture we've
done a bad job of teaching men how to be
masculine and teaching women how to be feminine uh and
there is some truth the fact that with the rise
of feminism well feminism has many good qualities to it
um part of the problem with feminism is that the
equalization of men and women that has happened in the
last 50 years has has led to problems with men
learning how to be masculine and women how to be
feminine it creates sort of a confusion there and it
creates a sort of a blurring of the lines now
you might say well Leo these lines were artificial to
begin with they were social constructs to a certain degree
they were artificial but to an important degree they were
not merely artificial there are legitimate and important biological differences
between men and women between their bodies between how hormones
affect them between their physical strength between things that men
are good at and weak at and then what women
are good at and weak at it's not that men
or women are better one or the other it's that
there are trade-offs and there are pros and cons to
being a man into being a woman or to being
masculine to being feminine and lately these trade-offs have been
denied in certain parts of progressive circles and leftist circles
uh have been questioned and this has created confusion uh
which contributes to the sort of epidemic we have nowadays
of you know a lot of men these days struggle
to get laid the whole insult phenomena um a lot
of men struggle to find their masculine core and a
lot of women also struggle with femininity as well and
then you know women are hurt by this too because
most women are attracted to masculine men so when there's
a shortage of masculine men then women suffer from this
then women are not getting the best mates and partners
that they could be getting as well and they're not
satisfied either so um while of course the traditional masculine
feminine gender roles should not be exclusive there needs to
be room for lgbtq stuff and for Alternatives you know
in the end your sexuality you choose your own sexuality
however you want but also when we're talking about politics
we're talking about how to construct Society for the benefit
of the majority of people the majority of people when
it comes to gender and sexuality are heterosexual and traditional
in this respect and so not appreciating this creates problems
when you let when you leave men behind and you
leave women behind and they're not able to learn how
to be proper men and women in the way that
they want right it's not that we're forcing them it's
that they want it the problem is is that we're
not teaching them how to do it very effectively these
days and so um because in the past there were
stronger role models and today there's more of like leeway
it's like you can be gay you can be bi
you can be trans you can be Q you can
be something else this does create confusion for people and
I don't think that saying that makes you a transphobe
or a homophobe this is again one of those areas
where leftists go too far in straw Manning and demonizing
anybody who is Raising any questions on this issue I
want you as a leftist to admit that it is
possible to have legitimate opposition and criticisms of the lgbtq
community now granted there are illegitimate criticisms there is legitimate
bigotry and hatred and just pure ignorance especially on behalf
of many far right Wingers that does exist but just
because that exists do not make the mistake of thinking
that that is that all criticism and opposition to lgbtq
stuff and all concerns raised about it fall into that
category for example not all opposition to trans issues is
transphobia I talked about this a little bit in part
one where we talked about the Joe Rogan example and
how Joe Rogan is often labeled as a transphobe by
leftists and progressives when in fact I think that an
objective analysis of his position is not that he's a
trans vote he's not afraid of trans people he doesn't
hate trans people it's that he has certain positions when
it comes to trans people in sports and those are
some legitimate issues you can have legitimate concerns about inequality
in sports when it comes to you know trans men
and women and so forth and uh that doesn't negate
trans rights that doesn't negate your right to be trans
or that doesn't mean that it's wrong to be trans
it just means you you know there's nuances here this
is a nuanced issue there's also I think uh legitimate
concerns about how we treat the transitioning of kids and
teens uh as a culture this is also something that
Joe Rogan gets hung up on a lot and a
lot of right-wingers but not right Wingers but even a
lot of moderates I think get hung up on this
when you start talking about taking a a 12 year
old kid or a 14 year old kid or a
16 year old kid and putting them on puberty blockers
hormones testosterone estrogen or you know in the most extreme
cases when you start talking about doing surgery now granted
that a lot of right Wingers will over exaggerate some
of the dangers of this uh the reality is that
surgery like genital surgery is not done almost ever on
kids that are that young um but even so even
putting somebody that young on on hormones or puberty blockers
this can create problems and it's okay to be concerned
about that and to raise concerns about whether that's right
or whether that's wrong or asking questions about like at
what age is it appropriate it's also okay to to
worry about what this will do um you know to
kids because there's a factor let's call it social Contagion
that I think many leftists um don't take seriously enough
by the way I have an episode called um is
gender a social construct where I talk about how gender
is a social construct in many ways however just because
gender is a social construct does not mean that you
can willy-nilly invent whatever whatever other kind of social construct
you want to replace it and that things will go
great gender is in a sense of social construct however
it's been a social construct that has also aligned with
our biology and also it has stood the test of
time for thousands of years it's worked so you should
think twice about going in there and screwing around with
this kind of stuff and just inventing your own social
constructs right just because something is a social construct does
not make it good does not make it healthy does
not mean you're going to be happy with it there
are a lot of toxic social constructs and then there's
also healthy and workable practical social constructs so I could
start to identify myself as a unicorn I could do
that and in a certain sense you know what's the
difference between identifying as a unicorn versus identifying as a
Russian I could identify as a Russian because I'm Russian
um uh they're both social constructs being Russian is a
social construct being an American is a social construct America
itself is a social construct right but not all social
constructs are created equal some are more practical and realistic
than others so while I could identify as a unicorn
it's also kind of silly and frivolous for me to
identify myself as a unicorn um take that into account
many of the social constructs that we have come to
us through a long chain of evolutionary processes and trial
and error and nobody just sat down and invented them
on the couch they were invented gradually slowly over hundreds
and thousands of years because that's what worked and so
when you start to Tinker with that you might create
something awful and so this is a concern with trans
stuff now studies show that for the majority of trans
people when they do hormone blockers and so forth and
they do the transition that they're happy with the end
result studies seem to show that however the research on
this is still pretty young we don't have a good
track record of lots of people transitioning and there's different
ways you can go about it and so you have
to worry about people who do go through the transition
process and then end up regretting it later some percentage
that will happen to now I don't know what that
percentage is is it five percent ten percent twenty percent
fifty percent I don't know studies seem to show that
like over 80 percent are satisfied but still that might
leave 10 or 20 percent that are not satisfied or
that regretted and that is a problem and it's legitimate
to be concerned about that it's one thing for somebody
to transition when they're 30 years old it's another thing
for them to transition when they're 14 years old at
14 years old the average 14 year old is a
[ __ ] idiot who is just doing what all
their friends are doing easily brainwashed with groupthink with propaganda
with ideology within their Progressive bubble that they're growing up
in and so this is what I was saying by
the this notion of social Contagion there is some element
you have to admit as a leftist I want you
to admit that there is some element to the lgbtq
phenomenon that is pure group think and social contagion now
what percentage I don't know this would require some serious
research that I don't think has really been done yet
so what I'm saying here is that let's say that
80 percent of all lgbtq folk who identify that way
and our that sexual orientation are that way because that's
legitimately what what is right for them it feels good
for them it's appropriate for them and that's great there's
no problem there but then what I'm saying is that
there's maybe 20 let's say who are doing it because
they're getting sucked into it because others around them are
doing it and because it's considered unique it makes you
feel unique it gives you a unique sense of worth
and identity it makes you feel special it makes you
feel part of some community these are all very powerful
attractors that influence the human psyche you might say well
Leo but why would anybody go out of their way
to join lgbtq plus when in fact they're not that
way and they're just straight or whatever why would they
why would they do that because after all you know
historically lgbtq plus people have been bullied and insulted and
hated and even killed and physically abused and raped and
all the sorts of awful stuff why would anybody choose
to do that but you see it's much more subtle
than that what you have to understand is that even
though all that might be true um first of all
that's rapidly changing that's rapidly improving it's not as bad
as it used to be so the stigma around lgbtq
plus has been largely removed these days and that's precisely
part of the problem because when you remove all the
stigma of it then see now it's like you're joining
this special community that makes you feel unique and gives
you a sense of purpose and camaraderie and maybe a
bunch of your friends are part of that Community you
want to be part of that Community too at that
age you're not thinking clearly most people aren't thinking clearly
even at 30 years old let alone at 14. you
know at 14 your friend gets a piercing or a
tattoo you want a piercing or a tattoo and you're
gonna act like you really like that piercing and tattoo
after you get it even though that was wrong for
you it didn't authentically come from you it came from
the group think that you were a part of the
cultural bubble the subculture bubble that you're growing up in
see so don't be so naive as to think that
this is not possible and that this does not exist
within lgbtq plus it does exist the only question is
to what percentage you might say it's one percent or
ten percent or thirty percent I don't know what it
is but whatever percent it is it is valid to
ask what percent is it it's valid to do science
and research into that because we don't know and it
would be valuable for us to know because if it's
30 that's a significant problem that means 30 are just
doing this out of Conformity and not true to their
authentic selves and then they're going to regret it later
or it's going to screw up uh their capacity to
be happy or to have a marriage or to have
the intimate relationship that they want or they're going to
suffer from depression or other kinds of mental disorders and
dysfunctions simply because uh their mind becomes very confused about
what to do what's right what's going to give them
acceptance and love in certain subcultures a kid or a
teen might feel like they're going to get more love
if they join lgbtq plus than if they don't the
human mind loves to feel special there's also a certain
appeal to playing a victim role so even though you
might say well but lgbtq folk they get victimized more
so who would want to deliberately become a victim well
if you think that you don't understand the trickeries of
the human psyche the human psyche loves to play victim
because it makes it feel special and unique and it
gives it all sorts of excuses uh for not growing
up and not maturing and not taking on difficult challenges
and responsibilities so there is a sort of appeal to
being a victim now am I saying that the majority
of LGBT btq folk are that way because they just
like being victims no of course not that's silly I'm
not saying that so I'm making some nuanced points here
and just be careful because even the fact that I'm
making these points might already in some circles cast me
as a transphobe or as a homophobe or as a
right winger or as a bigot but that's not that's
obviously not what I'm suggesting here I'm trying to raise
uh legitimate concerns now we can argue to what degree
these these concerns are legitimate and how prevalent they are
but uh but asking these questions you should not attack
people or demonize people for asking these questions these are
legitimate questions and issues to be asking and so we
need to allow space for that in our political discourse
and so leftists the most extreme leftists go wrong here
and they make this mistake where they demonize anybody who
then starts to question this kind of stuff and the
reason they do that is because actually it's threatening to
their identities of course see because we when we start
asking deep questions about lgbtq plus Folk um you know
their lives are difficult enough as it is if you're
if you're a genuine honest trans person or gay person
I get it your life is more difficult than it
is for the average guy or girl your life is
already difficult and then when we start asking these philosophical
questions about like well are you authentically gay or were
you or is it some sort of social contagion or
are you authentically trans or did you just do it
because your friends were doing it or whatever like when
we start asking these questions it can come off as
insulting to you it's like Leo you're adding insult on
top of injury when when you do this when you
allow for all this kind of questioning because I can
then I can never settle into my identity right because
these people they suffer from not having a concrete identity
their identity is too fluid and this leads to depression
all sorts of you know suicidal thoughts and so forth
because fundamentally you don't know who you are that's confusing
but hey look I mean you've sort of taken that
burden on yourself when you're talking about gender fluidity and
you're opening yourself up to just not being a man
or a woman or just being straight then you're opening
yourself up to all sorts of weird variations and yes
this is going to cause more confusion within you it's
also going to come cause more confusion within your community
and society and culture and if you're gonna open that
can of worms then that's going to open all sorts
of interesting and perhaps threatening philosophical questions and political questions
like how do we what do we do about bathrooms
um what do we do about um Sports competitions what
do we do about dressing rooms what do we do
about other things like this like these are questions that
now if we're going to open that can worms fine
but then we have to all as a society have
a conversation about what we're going to do and what's
appropriate what's not appropriate what's comfortable what's uncomfortable what's weird
what's not weird and I feel to in a certain
sense we have not had this conversation in a certain
sense these trans issues have kind of been thrust upon
the majority of culture and Society after they've kind of
already been deliberated in Elite universities it's like the folks
and academics and universities have sort of like thought through
some of this stuff they've come to their conclusions and
now that they've reached their conclusions they just want to
push all those conclusions onto the rest of society but
the rest of society has not gone through that it's
really a philosophical process of asking what is a man
what is a woman these are not obvious questions and
for the majority of people their notion of what is
a man and what is a woman and what is
sex these are just handed down through tradition through culture
they don't think deeply about these questions no child has
ever deeply wondered what does it mean to be a
boy or a girl no and we as a society
have really not addressed these issues everyone seems to have
their own opinion about it but then there needs to
be a dialogue where we come to some kind of
consensus that hasn't really happened what we had is we've
had sort of like culture wars which is not the
same thing as dialogue so that was all the point
of lgbtq stuff let's move on the next point where
leftists go wrong is not appreciating that minorities and immigrants
from third world countries are actually fairly conservative Hispanics and
blacks you might think they're very liberal actually they tend
to be fairly conservative why is that because their cultures
tend to be fairly conservative they tend to be rather
religious traditional cultures Black Culture in the south is pretty
conservative and very religious that's where tradition it comes from
when uh Spanish-speaking people come up from the south into
America to cross the border you know whether they're from
Mexico or Guatemala or Honduras or wherever um you know
many of these sort of like refugees people that are
fleeing gang violence and um drug Warlords and gangs and
stuff like that um they come from like traditional catholic
cultures they're not pro-abortion they're not pro-socialist or Marxist they
don't have very Progressive ideas about gender roles they're not
lgbtq open uh they're pretty conservative this is why for
example in the 2020 uh primary democratic election uh Bernie
Sanders did not win the presidency you know the nomination
the Democratic nomination for presidency and Joe Biden beat him
substantially because for a while it seemed like Bernie Sanders
would win because the first few primaries held in the
North in the Northeast in the Boston area those first
few primaries New Hampshire and so forth uh Bernie Sanders
does really well over there because it's mostly like very
Progressive white liberals uh but then and you know Bernie
Sanders did really well in Nevada my state he did
the best in Nevada actually um because it's sort of
a West Coast very liberal white liberal State as well
um although we have we have quite a few minorities
here as well but anyways but then when it came
to the South when it came to the Carolinas and
to the um and to all of the South Joe
Biden beat him handily and many progressives were shocked by
this how is this possible but this should not be
shocking because actually black voters in the South are going
to vote for relatively conservative Democrats not for socialists and
marxists and this is an oversight that I see many
on the left have and then they they even go
so far as to blame the DNC or Hillary Clinton
or Joe Biden for stealing it from from Bernie Sanders
no in 2020 nobody stole it from Bernie Sanders Bernie
Sanders lost simply because there are not that many progressives
and far right leftists in this country the majority of
Democrats are rather moderate and conservative Democrats and this is
not acknowledged by many progressives they're in denial about this
progressives want to paint the picture that the majority of
the country is Progressive this is absolutely false we've touched
upon this I actually explained um I've explained why that's
wrong in part one remember where I was talking about
how they progressives misuse opinion polls and policy polls to
portray most of the country as Progressive but when you're
talking about whether most the country is Progressive or conservative
what you have to take into account is not the
policy it doesn't matter what the policies are you take
a look at their spiral stage of development and you
take a look at their culture and their values what
culture do they subscribe to the culture issues that's what
really matters people vote on culture not on policy people
vote based on spiral stage and Vibe not on policy
so by those metrics the majority of the country is
fairly conservative either outright right wing or sort of like
Centrist Democrat or even conservative Democrat the sort of um
Joe manchin Democrat now progressives love to demonize people like
Joe manchin as if he shouldn't exist and as if
all democrats should just be like AOC this is preposterous
completely Preposterous Joe manchin is in a deeply conservative state
he's in West Virginia which is a very red State
the fact that we even have a Democrat from a
Democratic senator from a red state that can win elections
consistently as he has a godsend because you could imagine
that really uh the senator from West Virginia should be
very conservative Republican not a Democrat at all and the
idea that that a progressive can win in West Virginia
is preposterous this has actually been tried and it failed
it doesn't work but progressives have fooled themselves into thinking
that a progressive can win in West Virginia the problem
isn't that um uh you know Joe manchin is not
conservative enough the problem is that we need someone to
replace him who's way more Progressive and then Joe uh
you know West Virginians will go for that and vote
for him no that's not going to happen and this
is not just true in West Virginia but many purple
States in purple States progressives like AOC cannot win this
is something that progressives are in denial about and you
have to be careful as the progressive assuming that you
have the Latino Vote or the black vote locked in
that's not the case at all and in fact if
you look at the polling for Trump he got a
lot of success with Latinos why is that because a
lot of them are coming from very traditional cultures this
is actually a mistake that uh right Wingers make is
Right Wingers tend to assume that you know if Hispanics
are coming over the Border all these Hispanics are going
to vote Democrat that's actually not true a lot of
these Hispanics are very traditionally minded they're anti-socialist they're anti-marxist
they're anti-lgbtq and they're gonna vote for conservatives in many
cases as long as you don't offend them by calling
them rapists and other sorts of you know racist um
things like that as long as the the right-wing party
is not overly racist and bigoted towards Hispanics Hispanics will
gladly vote for conservatives which brings us to the next
problem with leftists this is a very huge problem perhaps
one of the biggest problems that I see is that
leftists love to demonize neo-liberals and centrists they love to
demonize anybody who's moderate and to cast them as right
Wingers in the progressives mind the way they see politics
is like there's the progressives who are the good guys
and then there's the the radical right-winger Mega people who
are the you know the evil guys and then there's
the people in the middle like the mainstream news um
the CNN and MSNBC anchors and uh and and the
Never Trumper um Republicans and conservatives in the like the
Joe manchin types and all of these they're just helping
the right Wingers they're just enabling the right Wingers and
that they are really as bad as the right Wingers
are this creates a sort of a polarization where in
the progressives mind either you're a progressive or you're a
bad guy because you're enabling bad guys this is uh
this is way overly simplistic and it's not the reality
of the situation the reality of the situation is that
the majority of the population is moderate and progressivism this
is a fringe movement now there are a lot of
good ideas within progressivism but you have to understand that
it's going to take time it's going to take decades
for those ideas to defuse themselves into the larger culture
and that's going to take a culture War that you're
gonna have to fight and that moderates are not the
bad guys moderates are actually the the people who prevent
Society from breaking out into a total culture War and
even a Civil War what prevents that is moderates and
the trick that extremists on both sides play both the
right extremists and the left extremists is that when you're
an extremist part of what it means to be an
extremist is that you believe that anyone who's a moderate
is an enemy this is what makes your extremism extra
extreme you're not just an extremist and you say well
yeah then there's the moderates and we can make peace
with the moderates and live heavily happily ever after it's
like no the extremist believes that the moderates are actually
being extreme in their moderation and that they for therefore
they're even more dangerous than the extremists that's how an
extremist thinks whether on the left or the right um
this is a problem because the the thing that keeps
Society stable is the moderates in the middle the 60
of moderates and if all we had were just the
extremist progressives society would spiral out of control this is
something that leftists don't like to admit to themselves because
they feel so justified in their extremism now look don't
get me wrong I am not saying that everything needs
to be split down the middle and that we need
to have moderation for the sake of moderation I'm not
saying that that's a mistake so it is not the
case that when a right-winger argues against climate change and
a progressive argues for climate change that we just need
to take that and cut that issue down the middle
and just do the moderate Middle Road solution no that's
not what I'm saying that would be a mistake nevertheless
there is wisdom in moderation this wisdom is lost on
many leftists I want you to acknowledge that if you're
a leftist a lot of leftists Levy strong criticism against
the moderates and centrists in fact even stronger criticisms than
they do against the right which is rather perverse some
progressives love to criticize centrists more than they do Maga
this is very problematic because it then prevents are political
discourse from being calm and civil it's like it it
Riles everybody up it polarizes everything you see and in
this polarized environment you cannot build a consensus and you
actually cannot pass legislation and govern anything the problem with
extremists on both sides that they refuse to compromise and
they refuse to understand the importance of compromise in forming
any kind of government you're never going to get everything
you want when running a government that is governing 300
million people you're never going to get everything you want
it's never going to be ideal it's never going to
be Progressive enough for you it's never going to be
compassionate enough for you it's never going to be conscious
enough for you you're always going to have to compromise
with traditionally minded people yes even with racists and bigots
you have to compromise with them you're gonna have to
compromise with homophobes and transphobes you're going to have to
compromise with people who live in rural areas you're gonna
have to compromise with uh with poor people and with
rich people that's the challenge of government and extremists get
into their mind that compromise is bad because compromise is
selling out to the devil to the enemy you know
why should we compromise with terrorists and evil people and
progressives of course tend to tend to demonize uh the
extreme right wing to the point where they see them
as evil of course the right wing does the same
thing to the to the far left but in this
situation you can't get anything done because both sides have
demonized each other both sides think they're evil and really
the only ones at that point who can get stuff
done are the moderates but the extremists now demonize the
moderates such that the moderates can't even get anything done
right so the role that extremists play is that they
they polarize the rest of the moderates towards their side
that's what they're trying to do the extreme right wing
is trying to pull people from the moderate sixty percent
into their camp and the extreme left wing is trying
to do the same thing and the more that happens
the left there's left of the moderates the more extremists
you have on both sides and then you turn you
create a civil war in the worst case scenario that's
what's been happening over the last 10 years now the
leftists will say well Leo but the right Wingers are
worse at this you're making it sound like we're both
extremists in the same way but actually the right Wingers
are more extreme and their extremism is more dangerous than
our extremism uh that's a debatable point as to you
know who uh which extremism is more dangerous now personally
I think that the right-wing extremism is more dangerous than
left-wing extremism um but still that doesn't mean that you're
completely innocent and that doesn't mean that you don't have
a responsibility for the polarization that is happening see because
the leftist extremists justify extremists their extremism to themselves by
saying that well but the right wing has been going
completely crazy in the last 10 years they've just become
way way way extreme they've been trying to shift the
Overton window to the right now and they've been successful
at it so we need to counterbalance that and compensate
by becoming even more extreme in our leftism in order
to shift the Overton window to the left and it
turns into this tug of war what I want to
suggest to you is that there's a mistake that's going
on here you can see this situation from a higher
elevation perspective and here is really something that is that
is sneaky that left us to a very sneaky mistake
that I want to call out which is that since
leftists love to demonize moderates and centrists as soon as
somebody comes along that tries to communicate to a leftist
there are blind spots and the problems with their radicalism
and extremism and um tries to show them a tier
two a spiral Dynamics tier two way of looking at
politics something like conscious politics or stage yellow politics they
they start to hear that and say ah okay I
know I know what this is this is just another
Centrist another moderate talking to me Leo is just a
moderate he's just like the guys on CNN he just
wants to take both sides and split it down the
middle that's all that Leo's trying to do with these
episodes so there's nothing new here you're wrong I am
not communicating with you as a Centrist does on CNN
it might seem that way to you because I'm calling
you out for being too extreme so in your mind
as a leftist you'll say well if he's calling me
out for being too extreme that means the only alternative
is that I have to become a Centrist and a
moderate like on CNN and I don't like that therefore
uh Leo is just trying to to turn me into
a Centrist like him no I'd like you to open
your mind to a third possibility there is a possibility
that very few people in politics have actualized which is
being able to see politics from a tier two spiral
Dynamic stage yellow perspective I don't have time to elaborate
upon what that means exactly go watch my spiral Dynamic
stage yellow episode for more on that also go watch
my four-part series called conscious politics part one two three
four where I explain that kind of perspective but if
you watch that series on conscious politics you'll see that
What I Call Conscious politics is not centrism it does
not mean you have to be a moderate Democrat it
does not mean you have to give up your most
important Progressive ideals and it is not the kind of
stuff that's happening on CNN it's a totally new way
of looking at politics I call it conscious politics it's
a non-ideological non-partisan way of looking at politics but it's
also not just your standard CNN type of centrism which
is afraid to call out the extreme right I have
no problem calling out the far right for its stupidities
and its it's dangerous and I've done that in the
past so clearly I'm not just trying to be moderate
here I've used actually very extreme language in criticizing the
Maga movement and conservatives and so forth but what I
want you to see is that you can reach such
a high level of cognitive moral and Spiritual Development the
development of your psyche that you literally transcend this notion
of right versus left versus Center this whole Spectrum with
all the Overton windows and all this the whole the
entire gamut of political discourse that happens on YouTube and
throughout mainstream and non-mainstream media which includes the far right
which includes the moderate right which includes the moderate left
and includes the far left that this whole Spectrum there's
something beyond all that you can go meta to all
of that I think the problem though is that when
I try to introduce this idea to many progressives and
and far leftists uh they dismissed the idea by saying
oh well Leo's just yeah Leo is saying that but
actually what he's really trying to trick me into doing
is just becoming a moderate and a Centrist and I
don't like that but that's not what I'm suggesting you
do I'm suggesting a totally new way of looking at
politics and government a much more intelligent more nuanced more
complex way a much less biased way of going about
it but that would require that you recognize that progressivism
you're far left [Music] um politics is actually group think
and ideology you're not immune to ideology ideology exists on
the right it also exists on the left now it's
worse on the right but it's still pretty bad on
the left so you're not immune to that really the
enemy here is not the right our enemy here is
unconsciousness our enemy here is lack of development and our
enemy here is ideology if it's ideology it's going to
create problems whether it's right ideology or left ideology so
make sure that you don't dismiss what I'm saying here
as just more neoliberalism or what's called triangulation or Third
Way politics so you might say oh well Leo you're
just talking about Third Way politics and triangulation from the
Clinton era no that's not what I'm talking about you
might say I'm talking about a fourth way if the
Clinton if Clinton's politics were Third Way then there's a
fourth way just open your mind to a completely different
political paradigm that's neither left nor right nor Centrist something
totally new so anyways um I think that leftists air
when they over demonize mainstream media like CNN and MSNBC
I see a lot of this on Progressive YouTube Progressive
YouTubers love to [ __ ] on CNN and MSNBC
uh they think they're being intelligent and wise when they
do this they're actually not they're being foolish now does
this mean that I endorse all of CNN and MSNBC
no of course not there's problems with CNN and MSNBC
but progressives tend to not understand what the problems are
and where the problems come from the problems with CNN
and MSNBC come from Simply the fact that these channels
have to appeal to the widest possible audiences and to
the lowest possible common denominator which means that they can't
take strong Progressive positions not because they're corrupt or whatever
else it's simply because their whole business model and their
project is to present news to the majority of Americans
that's their business model and when you're doing that you
can't come off as extremely Progressive because you're going to
alienate half the country now you might as a progressor
you might say well that's wrong but then again if
CNN and MSNBC did become very Progressive as you want
them to be who would deliver just factual news who's
going to do that see the problem with progressives is
that progressives want CNN and MSNBC to be very activist
they don't want them to just to report factual news
they want CNN MSNBC to actually take positions Progressive positions
now I totally understand why you want CNN and MSNBC
to take strong Progressive positions but that's not the business
they're in they're in the business of delivering factual news
they're in the business of reporting you know if a
bomb blows up they're in the business of reporting that
if a war starts they're in the business of reporting
that in an objective way now you might say well
but they're not objective well look no one is ever
objective do you think the progressives are objective progressives are
not objective in fact uh alternative media is less objective
than mainstream media just because mainstream media does not cater
to your biases does not mean that they're less objective
when it comes to factual reporting CNN and MSNBC are
about as objective as you can get do they make
mistakes sometimes sure do they have biases of course there
are capitalistic biases there are biases of the stage of
development that CNN administrators managers and hosts are at the
majority of people working at CNN and MSNBC are spironamic
stage orange slash green that's going to be their bias
because that's that's their world view you can't avoid that
your bias will always be the stage of development that
you're at because you don't know any better they don't
know any better also they're running you know multi-billion dollar
businesses so they're influenced by Wall Street they're influenced by
considerations of their stock price their influenced by advertisers of
course but you know what your mainstream your alternative um
your alternative sort of stream YouTube Progressive pundits and commentators
are also they're not objective they're also biased um they're
also influenced by advertising and sponsorships and other things like
that so be careful when the Pod is cutting the
calling the kettle black you have to be extremely careful
when you're calling somebody out for being biased within politics
because the majority of the time when that is happening
actually you're just projecting your own bias onto them what
you really mean when you say somebody is biased in
politics is you mean they don't have my biases that's
what you're criticizing them for you don't really care if
they're objective or not as a progressive you don't care
about objectivity what you care about is Progressive bias that's
what you care about there's also demonization of people like
Jordan Peterson Sam Harris Joe Rogan and others of this
ilk who get demonized by progressives as being far right
Wingers when in fact they're not they're actually pretty moderate
some of their positions can be a bit wacky some
of their positions can be right wing but for the
most part if you think Jordan Peterson Sam Harris and
Joe Rogan and like Brett Weinstein and others like this
these intellectual dark web people that they are far right
wing or even fascists or islamophobes or homophobes you're not
understanding these people these are sophisticated thinkers they're pretty open-minded
they can hold a pretty decent intellectual conversation they're generally
intellectually honest people now do they have positions that I
personally disagree with of course there are many positions that
Jordan Peterson holds that I find silly and absurd and
even abhorrent uh but as far as the right wing
goes Jordan Peterson is actually one of the right Wingers
who is most intellectually honest you can actually have an
intellectually honest conversation with him that doesn't mean he's going
to agree with you or you're going to agree with
him but he's one of the more decent conservatives even
though there's a lot of stuff with him that I
disagree on likewise with Sam Harris Sam Harris is even
better than Jordan Peterson um he's he's very reasonable he's
very open-minded you can have some really good conversations with
Sam Harris um now does he have some silly ideas
of course he does almost everybody in this field has
some silly ideas same with Joe Rogan uh lately Joe
Rogan has been going more right wing and there's a
lot of stuff he says that I disagree with but
for the most part you can have a decent intellectual
conversation with Joe Rogan he's going to be pretty open-minded
you can present arguments to him and he's going to
listen to you that's what we ultimately want from our
political discussions it's just people we can have honest dialogue
with who do not resort to name calling and smearing
you and um character assassinating you and just being rapidly
ideological I don't consider any of these people to be
rapidly ideological now is their mind infected with certain ideologies
yes of course as pretty much as everybody else in
this field but these are not these sort of like
moronic Maga people that you can't have a reasonable conversation
with right these people are willing to look at evidence
these people are are willing to look at research they're
willing to change their mind and that's good stuff so
don't demonize these people there's a whole cottage industry of
progressive YouTube where um all they do is they just
[ __ ] on Jordan Peterson Sam Harris Joe Rogan
Brett Weinstein and others like that I think that this
is where the left and progressives are the weakest when
they do this first of all they don't accurately represent
the true positions of Peter of people like Jordan Peterson
Sam Harris and Joe Rogan they present straw man positions
and this does a disservice to the left it makes
the left intellectually dishonest and stupid you want to be
open to genuinely considering the perspectives of people like Jordan
Peterson Sam Harris Joe Rogan and others if you want
to really evolve Beyond stage green which is what we're
trying to do here and a lot of the characteristics
that these people exhibit such as Jordan Peterson Sam Harris
Joe Rogan they do exhibit a lot of staged yellow
qualities they're not strict partisans does that mean they're solid
stage yellow of course not they have a lot of
regressive elements and Shadow elements that keep them stuck in
stage orange stage blue but they're showing signs of yellow
and you should take notice of that and don't demonize
them for that see the the key mistake that stage
green makes is it demonizes stage yellow because stage yellow
can remind stage green too much of stage Orange I've
talked about that in my spiral Dynamics series go check
that out another mistake that left a snake is not
acknowledging that many Republicans and conservatives are actually moderate and
reasonable I've noticed this trend especially in the last four
years progressives act as though all Republicans have lost their
minds as though all Republicans are Mega Republicans this is
not true there are plenty of good decent reasonable moderate
Republicans a lot of them are found on CNN and
MSNBC I'm talking about people like David from Joe Scarborough
Joe Walsh Liz Cheney now these are conservative people and
a lot of their positions and policies I disagree with
however I am able to distinguish between them these so-called
never trumpers uh like these are actually the true conservatives
versus the Maga people the Maga people are completely Shameless
they have no integrity they have no interest in facts
or reason or truth whereas these moderate Republicans and conservatives
they do they do have integrity and I give them
a lot of credit for that because it's not easy
to have that kind of Integrity when the majority of
your party has lost its mind and gone down the
road of Maga and other sorts of conspiracy theories and
far-right extremism and Fascism and racism and so forth these
people didn't do that and they don't get enough credit
for it from progressives in fact progressives love to demonize
these people by saying that well Leo you know yeah
it seems like they're very different from the right-wing mag
of people but actually you know if you know if
if we elected a more moderate Republican president like a
let's say somebody who's not as crazy as as Donald
Trump let's say we we elect a uh Ron DeSantis
type or a uh you know Marco Rubio or something
like that you know we like one of these people
who's a bit more moderate it's like they would still
pass all the same policies As Trump therefore they're as
bad as Trump like if Liz Cheney was president Liz
Cheney even though she opposes Maga and Trump and she
wants to see him like impeached and stuff like that
and kicked out of office if Liz Cheney was President
she voted 90 percent of her voting record is identical
to Trump's so she supports most of Trump's policies therefore
what's the difference between Trump and Liz Cheney it's just
a matter of like uh surface level you know decorum
and so progressives will criticize these moderate Republicans as as
just kind of like putting on the decorum of being
kind of like nice and not as vile as Donald
Trump but the reality is that their policies are as
bad as Trump's now there's some truth to that however
you're not appreciating the importance of what what you dismiss
as decorum it's not merely decorum it's a lot more
than just decorum it's Integrity it's character it's truth it's
honesty it's factuality it's being aware of One's Own biases
and calling them out it's um it's being able to
call out your side when it goes too extreme that's
not merely decorum that's extremely necessary to have healthy politics
now progressors will say well Leo even if there are
a few of these people who are supposedly the good
Republicans um there's so few of them that it's pointless
to even talk about them because there's like one percent
of them and the other 99 are Maga no you're
wrong there's actually a lot more of these moderate conservative
Republicans these decent Republicans with integrity the key there is
integrity you want a conservative with Integrity I can respect
a conservative with Integrity what I can't respect is conservative
without Integrity which is what Maga has become but um
there are far more than just one or two or
even five or ten percent of conservatives with Integrity there
are a lot more and I think one of the
biggest um not talked about failures in media that has
happened over the last five or six years since Trump
came to power is the under emphasis of how many
conservatives and Republicans there are who are moderate and reasonable
it's just that they don't get the same press you
see when Trump is out there saying ridiculous obnoxious things
and so are his followers that sucks up all the
oxygen in the room all the attention goes on The
Crazies this creates a sort of a reality Distortion field
where you start to think that the entire Republican party
has lost its [ __ ] mind that's actually not
true a lot of decent moderate Republicans are voting for
Trump not because they like Trump not because they don't
see the problems with Trump it's because they're just too
afraid of extremist leftism they're too afraid of Marxism and
weird trans issues that creeped them out they're too afraid
with that stuff uh so they've and they're also just
fiscally conservative you know they want tax cuts and so
forth that they just vote Republican now you might say
well Leo if they do that then they have no
integrity uh not quite you know it's real it's a
relative matter if you see because what happens is that
you have to understand is that especially in the last
five years the stuff that comes into mainstream Consciousness and
makes the news is all the most radical sensationalist dramatic
stuff it's the it's the terrorism activity it's the bomb
explosions all that but it's also the most extreme and
wacky crazy right-wing ideas and it's also the most extreme
crazy wacky left-wing ideas both get characterized and demonized and
turn into straw man right so on the right it's
this idea of fascism and so forth that gets turned
up to 11 as the ultimate threat and on the
left uh what becomes the threat is this sort of
like um hair brained Marxist Revolution stuff it's like we're
gonna ditch capitalism and just go pure Marxism many moderates
when they hear a demonized version of leftism what they
see is Soviet communism Soviet Marxism and of course they
don't want that so they vote for someone like Trump
the right-wing ecosystem like Fox News oan and Alex Jones
and other alternative right-wing news they have done such a
good job at demonizing the far left that it has
scared the bejesus out of many in the center and
there are so many in the center who are just
quiet who don't create a lot of drama who aren't
very passionate and who are not willing to Slit anyone's
throat over their political ideas and because of that they
don't make the news and because of that you don't
hear their voices and because of that all you hear
are the loudest voices on the far right and the
loudest voices on the far left and then you get
a distorted picture of our political situation I think that
despite all the polarization that we've had over the last
five years in our politics the majority of Americans are
still relatively moderate and reasonable and they are not as
polarized as we think when we look at the news
the news accentuates the drama because that's what creates clicks
and Views and that's not just done by CNN and
MSNBC that's also done by the most Progressive of progressives
and of course by the far right so all sides
are responsible for this it's a huge problem it creates
this very distorted picture of what's really going on in
our politics so yes there are good decent Integris moderate
Republicans and conservatives and in fact we need to emphasize
this a lot more because if we don't that leaves
no space for sane conservatives if you're a leftist in
a progressive understand this that when you demonize moderate Republicans
and you say that oh there are none of them
and that none of them will ever be in power
again and that all of them have been taken over
by Maga you're creating a self-fulfilling prophecy do you see
that you're leaving conservatives no other choice but to go
Maga because you're not going to convert a conservative to
become a progressive conservativism is a deep structure of the
psyche you don't just change that with a few debates
here or there or a few good arguments or if
you you know um policy proposals a conservative is going
to be conservative for Life half the country is conservative
you're not going to get rid of conservatives anytime soon
they're not going away so the question isn't whether we
have conservatives or not the question is do we have
a healthy form of conservativism or an unhealthy toxic form
represents a toxic form if we want a healthy democracy
that's not going to happen by turning everyone Progressive it's
not going to happen you're you're in Fantasyland to have
a healthy democracy what we need is we need a
robust and healthy conservative wing of American politics that's the
reality you don't like that I might not like that
either but that's the reality and if you say no
to that the only other alternative is not that oh
all of a sudden we're gonna get a bunch of
progressives no the other Alternatives you're gonna get a bunch
of [ __ ] fascists and Naga people that's the
alternative so which would you rather have would you rather
have more Joe Scarborough's or would you rather have more
Alex Jones's that's the that's the real choice because you
ain't gonna get Joe Scarborough to become some bleeding heart
Progressive Marxist that's not gonna happen ever and you know
what look at Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough is a really
interesting example first of all he has he has decent
amount of Integrity he started criticizing Trump very early on
into Trump's presidency he broke ranks with him he did
a really good job about that I respect him for
that but also if you just take a look at
the kind of Common Sense arguments that he makes now
is he the most Progressive of course not but he
makes some very common sense arguments that I think that
the majority of the country would agree with that's the
reality that you left us and progressives are uh fooling
yourself over you're in denial about this you have to
come to accept that Society will not evolve as fast
as you want it to evolve it's not going to
happen you have your Progressive ideals I totally understand that
I have those ideals as well the difference between me
and you is that uh I understand the realities of
human development a little bit better and I understand that
just because I'm gonna go out there and and scream
at the top of my lungs my ideals that doesn't
mean it's going to happen that's not how we're going
to build the next stage of society so I want
you to admit to yourself that there's plenty of reasonable
conservatives and if you think there aren't that's how you
know you're fooling yourself you're stuck in an echo chamber
you're also being fooled by some of the drama that
necessarily is accentuated on mainstream media alternative media and social
media I also noticed that there's a failure to praise
moderates and healthy conservatives when they stand up against extremists
example this is Liz Cheney personally I give huge props
to Liz Cheney for standing up against Donald Trump extremely
difficult she sacrificed her whole political career basically for this
a lot of progressives however love to demonize Liz Cheney
because they just hate Dick Cheney so much they're so
biased on that front and also because they point out
that you know she has a very conservative voting record
in the senate or in the in the Congress and
um you know because of this she doesn't deserve any
any praise no you have to be able to praise
your opponents when they act with integrity that's the key
Integrity is hugely important as soon as we sacrifice integrity
to achieve our political Ambitions that's when politics goes toxic
and wrong so I give huge credit to any conservative
in the last five years who has stood up and
denounced Maga people like Liz Cheney David from Joe Scarborough
Joe Walsh and others there's plenty of others well you
have to be very careful against is this idea that
there is no such thing as a good conservative any
conservative is a bad conservative this idea this is a
very toxic and dangerous idea it's also not true I
mean of course the right wing is even more guilty
of this the way that the right wing demonizes the
left and progressives is completely unethical completely out of Integrity
completely dishonest and it's created a huge mess out of
our whole political system let's move on to another point
another point where leftists go wrong is they tend to
want to use government too much to coddle and safety
proof survival it's almost like progressives want to create a
society where you can't harm yourself by making bad decisions
no matter what kind of decision you make if you
make bad decisions government will come and save you because
you're going to get free health care free education free
money free welfare free social security free disability if you
get disabled free uh you know free anything you know
you shoot a heroin you're gonna get a free therapy
free rehab if you um you know if you hit
your head you're going to get free um uh you
know workers comp or uh free insurance if you smoke
your whole life you're going to get free uh you
know um free cancer treatment this kind of stuff and
you might say well Leo yeah that isn't that right
that that sounds like a very Humane Society yes in
a certain sense that's good some degree of that is
nice we need a certain social safety net that prevents
you from um suffering the consequences of the most catastrophic
consequences of your worst decisions and just bad luck you
know sometimes you just get bad luck um we need
that but also be careful what you wish for because
when government does too much for you and it's safety
proves everything for you people start to get soft people
stop taking responsibility people stopped treating life and survival seriously
the way that they should life and survival is a
serious game it's a very serious game with the most
serious of consequences and really children and young adults need
to be raised in an environment where this is a
reality for them otherwise they get too spoiled and life
becomes too easy and in a sense we have been
suffering from that in the last 50 years now as
a progressor you might say well Leo life isn't too
easy it's harder than ever to survive you know like
the Baby Boomers had it easy now the Millennials and
the Zoomers is harder than ever to buy a house
it's harder to ever to afford stuff it's harder than
ever to go to college because of the student loans
and the burn that presents is harder than ever to
afford health care and so forth there is some truth
to that in a certain sense it's harder but in
another sense life today is easier than it's ever been
in human history especially in America and I think we're
suffering from the spoilage that comes from that today's kids
are extremely spoiled the things they whine about and complain
about our ancestors would be embarrassed that their grandchildren have
been so spoiled by us with all of the video
games and social media and Twitter and Facebook and pornography
and the cheap food that we have and um you
know the junk food um easy access to travel you
can travel around the world on the cheap these days
instant cheap free communication all around the world you can
literally Skype somebody in Africa from America for free we
start to take all these things for granted you know
clothing is cheaper than ever if we're not talking about
some sort of expensive branded ridiculous clothing you know Basic
clothing is as cheap as ever basic food is as
cheap as ever the basics of survival are as easy
to procure as ever technology is as cheap as ever
it's easier than ever to become complacent with life and
to just smoke weed sit on the couch watch your
Netflix for ten dollars a month you know it's it's
hilarious to me that every couple of years Netflix you
know raises their prices for their monthly subscription and then
people start whining and bitching and complaining about they almost
start to boycott Netflix why because Netflix raises their monthly
price from 12 a month to 15 a month and
people are are freaking out over this this is the
level of spoilage this is the perfect example of spoilage
that I'm talking about you know you're so ungrateful that
you're complaining and bitching and moaning that you have to
pay 15 a month to get access to like hundreds
of thousands of pieces of content amazing content movies shows
documentaries educational stuff that you can find on Netflix you
know your parents generation were satisfied with just three TV
channels three TV channels and now you're you're pissed off
that you have to pay an extra three dollars a
month to get access to Netflix this is preposterous and
this kind of thing is going on all around Society
in a certain sense it is true what conservatives say
is that you know uh successful decadent society makes people
weak that's very true it does lead to spoilage and
we are experiencing that right now and while that's true
at the same time there are problems with late stage
capitalism that has made survival extra challenging for Zoomers and
Millennials when it comes to owning a house when it
comes to getting health care when it comes to going
to college that's all still true as well both are
true at the same time so be careful what you
wish for when you wish for this kind of socialist
Utopia where life is so easy and everything is taken
care of for you you think this is going to
make for better human beings but actually it might make
for something like Idiocracy the human psyche needs serious Challenge
and suffering to grow develop and mature when you take
away the challenges and the need for growth people will
stop growing that's not guaranteed so don't get me wrong
I'm not saying that without external pressure and challenge that
it's impossible to grow it is possible to get yourself
to grow but when we're talking about a large Collective
level with hundreds of millions of people generally the trend
is going to be when you take away all the
challenges of life people are just going to turn into
pot smoking Netflix watching Pizza eating mouth-breathing morons that's what's
been happening over the last 50 years in our society
people are gonna be sitting around and bitching and whining
about a three dollar hike increase for Netflix they're gonna
be bitching and moaning about that on Twitter all day
that's what they're going to be doing rather than actually
going to work doing something productive doing something healthy building
a family building a business going to school and actually
learning something difficult the thing that has become of our
education system our education system is just training spoiled [
__ ] brats these days nobody is going and getting
a proper education anymore and on top of that is
it's they're getting out of that they're they're spoiled [
__ ] brats and they're also a hundred thousand dollars
a hundred thousand dollars in debt on top of that
it's the worst of Both Worlds one of the things
that I respect the most about conservativism is that the
conservative world view is all about in a sense at
its best at its healthiest it's about reminding us of
the old school values that generates success values like hard
work Integrity family sacrifice for your community um being disciplined
not being frivolous being conservative with how you spend your
money saving your money being intelligent and wise about your
Investments not wasting your time on stupid social distractions like
social media and celebrity gossip and porn and all this
kind of stuff not getting addicted to weed and other
kinds of drugs this is conservativism at its best now
what we see of conservativism today on the on the
news with Maga and so forth has no resemblance to
this that's because it's been perverted conservativism has been perverted
more than ever what we need are old school conservatives
who embodied this healthy old school stage Blues by Dynamic
stage blue conservative values because that serves an important function
in society without that Society becomes spoiled and soft people
become these stage green utopian idealistic pot smoking hippies who
talk a lot about love and equality and diversity but
in reality these people cannot run a business cannot sustain
a family are not disciplined enough to do the difficult
[ __ ] that's necessary to build a healthy civilization
I'll have a whole episode in the future where I
just talk about these conservative values some more it really
is worth repeating and going into some length but um
it's a bit of a tangent for this episode so
moving on to the next point leftism goes wrong with
what's happening on University campuses these days the activism and
identity politics found on most universities and the extreme group
think that comes along with that is very problematic I
wouldn't go so far as to say that the kind
of criticisms that Jordan Peterson has of University culture are
completely correct but if you don't think there's a kernel
of Truth to the things he's calling out you're fooling
yourself there is an important kernel of Truth there now
is he exaggerating it yes is he fear-mongering about it
yes but there is some concerning developments at universities which
is really just stage green stage green group think running
amok remember spirodynamic stage green is a fairly collectivist oriented
stage stage orange is more individualistic green is collectivist yellow
is individualistic remember that pendulum swings back and forth so
one of the problems with every collectivist spiral stage whether
it's green or blue or purple is the extreme group
think that can happen and spiral out of control so
with Stage blue the extreme group think is religious fundamentalism
with Stage green the extreme group think is the kind
of stuff we see on University campuses this you know
going over the top with um talking about racism and
lgbtq issues identity politics uh really our universities are getting
spoiled by this political activism now political activism is important
however here's the problem is that people between the ages
of 18 and let's say 23 which are mostly University
kids uh these people are very immature they know almost
nothing about how reality Works how psychology works how politics
Works they know they mo they know almost nothing they're
basically morons um and yet these people go to university
and they become very politically active this is putting the
cart before the horse and Jordan Peterson is right about
this it's not that you can't do both at the
same time you can you can develop yourself and build
your own career and also you can do political activity
it's fine you don't need to perfectly put your house
in order to do political activity however there is truth
in that if you can't even pay your own [
__ ] rent what business do you have being politically
active don't put the cart before the horse when you
go to university your primary objective should be to study
your ass off and to get a really good education
get your money's worth and set yourself up for the
rest of your life in terms of your career in
terms of your relationships in terms of your personal development
in terms of your health in terms of your finances
get all the basics of survival handled that's really what
university should be about don't worry so much about racism
and lgbtq issues and socialism this is a distraction from
getting that handled fix yourself first before you fix the
world why is that important because nobody can fix you
but you there are other people who are in a
position to fix the world people who are wealthy people
who have already established themselves people who are healthy if
you don't have those things in place who are you
to fix the world now I understand that it's tempting
to want to go out there and fix the world
when you don't have to when you have it fixed
yourself yet but that does become a trap don't you
see because there are plenty of people who can fix
the world for you but there's nobody who can fix
you for you so in practice what ends up happening
is that these Young University kids you know they they
talk a big game about Utopia and anti-racism and lgbtq
and Marxism but in reality these people can't pay their
rent they can't afford to buy a house they can't
pay off their student loans they don't have health care
and they just work as a barista at Starbucks how
is that going to create a great society it won't
really your first 10 years of adulthood basically from age
18 to let's say 30. like 12 years that is
all of that should be focused on developing yourself first
and foremost get your [ __ ] together don't worry
about politics that's going to become a huge waste of
energy the problem is that when you're doing your politics
your politics turns into such a giant waste of mental
energy for the most part your political activity is doing
nothing it turns into culture wars arguments debates hate watching
people twittering this kind of [ __ ] this actually
it doesn't actually change anything about government it doesn't construct
anything good you know yelling at somebody that they're a
homophobe or a racist on Twitter doesn't really accomplish anything
you could put that energy and time towards um developing
a business or a career or something more productive and
then think about this then once you do develop a
business or career something productive then you're actually going to
have power and money to make meaningful political change you're
also going to be much more intelligent about how you
use your time and money because you're going to value
your time and money more than you do as a
as a kid without any of it um you'll be
able to be much more smart and strategic about how
you go influencing politics you know sitting around in your
college dorm with your roommates smoking weed eating pizza and
talking about Marxism this is not this is not improve
Society you see this is a waste of time this
is foolishness and all the political activity that's going on
at some of these universities this is creating a distraction
it's distracting students from sitting down and just sticking their
face into their textbooks that's what students should be doing
at University your your face should be so glued to
your calculus textbook and your physics textbook and your biology
and psychology textbooks that you don't have time to listen
to the latest theories about Marxism or who's identifying as
a as a man or a woman or as a
unicorn or as a whatever the [ __ ] you
shouldn't give a [ __ ] you're too focused learning
calculus the fact that you even have time to care
about who is identifying as what gender or race or
whatever the [ __ ] already tells you how privileged
and spoiled you are because if you grow up in
China in China they would be [ __ ] beating
you with a ruler to learn calculus you wouldn't have
time to worry about lgbtq [ __ ] in China
it's more old school over there and that's why they're
kicking our ass right now in terms of Education pumping
out Engineers programmers you know serious people and in general
when you're going to University pick a [ __ ]
serious major pick a major that actually matters that's going
to make a difference to the world we don't need
10 million people doing gender studies [ __ ] which
is not to say you can't have some gender studies
fine you can have some of it but people are
going overboard with this stuff pick practical majors you're getting
way too spoiled and too entitled another problem with leftists
is in general they don't appreciate the importance of hierarchies
stage green wants to level all hierarchies and they think
that this will be sustainable and it'll work sometimes it
can work but a lot of times it can't work
there's reasons that there's a lot of hierarchies in society
it's because that's how [ __ ] gets done in
the military there's a hierarchy why you can't have a
military that's a democracy if we had that your country
would be dead this logic applies to many other areas
of life besides just military it also applies to corporations
businesses basically all kinds of organizations government itself and so
on so demonizing hierarchies is a problem you should not
do it you should see the value that hierarchies have
but of course we are recognizing that some hierarchies are
toxic and corrupt and need to be reformed and changed
and sometimes it's good to level a hierarchy but before
you go leveling a hierarchy first understand why it's there
in the first place the problem with Stage green it
tends to want to level hierarchies without understanding their utility
and why they exist there in the first place so
you end up shooting yourself in the foot um there's
a criticism that hierarchies are not merit-based this is a
interesting point I would say this on this matter is
that for the most part in America most of the
hierarchies we have are actually merit-based like the military for
example I would say the majority of the military hierarchy
is merit-based however not 100 of it so you can
criticize those parts of the hierarchy that are not merit-based
and we should change that because ideally we want to
work towards a hierarchy if one exists at all where
it is 100 merit-based that's obviously not the case but
progressives and liberals and leftists sometimes go overboard with this
in their criticism of hierarchies and they basically portray it
out to be as meritocracy is a complete myth it
doesn't exist at all and that all hierarchies are just
systems of Oppression and Corruption and capitalism and special privilege
and uh and it's not a meritocracy at all that's
not true the next point is that leftists tend to
go overboard with calling everything and holding everything as relative
and socially constructed this is part of the post-modernist Legacy
post-modernism as opposed to modernism post-modernism was all about recognizing
the relativity in the socially constructed nature of many of
the things that modernism considered to be just natural truths
so it's true that a lot of stuff that we
think of as natural truths is socially concerned for example
science is a social construction scientific truths are relative truths
this is true however you have to be very careful
about this because progressives can then go too far with
this and they can say well Leo if social you
know if science is a social construction and let you
know Leo you have a whole episode that says that
science is a myth deconstructing myth of science um you
know if you watch that series of mine you can
say well Leo got my God so science is all
full of relative truths and social constructions and therefore all
science is wrong or [ __ ] and therefore we
can just make up whatever we want right biology doesn't
exist I can be a man or a woman or
a unicorn I can be anything I want to be
no you can't genetics still determines you biology still runs
you physiology still runs you chemistry still runs you physics
still runs you even though those are all social constructions
gravity is a social construction but that does not mean
that you get to jump out of an airplane without
a parachute and survive so stage green tends to go
overboard and make the mistake of thinking that ah well
if if gravity is socially constructed that means I can
just jump out of an airplane no you're just being
stupid furthermore there's this now prevalent notion that truth doesn't
exist because everything is relative and everything is a social
construction there's no such thing as absolute truth absolute truth
is a quaint idea that cannot survive in the post-modern
era this is wrong absolute truth absolutely exists but wait
a minute Leo how's that possible if everything is relative
and socially constructed How can there be absolute truth well
that's way too deep of a topic to answer here
if you want to know more about that go check
out my episode called relative versus absolute truth another episode
I have is called what is truth go check those
out there's also a tendency with this kind of relativism
excessive relativism to consider all cultures and all value systems
as equal this is not true all cultures and all
value systems are not equal all ethnicities and races are
not equal men and women are not equal now does
this mean that we should treat men better than women
no does that mean we should treat whites better than
black snow does that mean that we should hold American
culture as better than Chinese culture no cultures are very
complex systems with many trade-offs and pros and cons to
them they are strengths and weaknesses to every culture there
are certain things that the Chinese culture is better at
than American culture and vice versa it's not so easy
to figure out which parts are better at what things
that takes a lot of empirical investigation testing and research
and it's true that there's a lot of alternative ways
to do the same thing or as they say you
know um there's many ways to skin a cat so
there's not just one way to run an economy there's
not just one best form of government there's not just
one best education system there's not just one best way
to do business there are many there's a diversity of
different ways with various kinds of pros and cons and
trade-offs stage green can go overboard in trying to equalize
all of these because stage green is so big on
equality everything has to be equalized stage green is bad
at dealing with asymmetries you have to be able to
balance asymmetries not to equalize everything across the board men
and women are different they're asymmetrical but they can be
balanced between themselves so be careful about that another problem
with Stage green and leftism is leftists don't take seriously
the problem of the loosening and coarse coarsening of moral
standards leftists tend to treat moral standards as some sort
of quaint hokey leftover from you know our religious traditions
which are mostly just superstitions and um outdated traditions but
actually there is deep wisdom in our ancient religious traditions
uh and I don't I don't even mean any kind
of metaphysical sense I just mean very practically all the
ancient religions give rules of conduct ethical standards Norms taboos
expectations certain values and habits that human beings are expected
to follow in order to achieve greatness and the quote
unquote good life so the question is how do you
how do you achieve the good life and then religion
says well if you do x y z you will
achieve a good life and if you don't do these
things if you do ABC then you're going to fall
into hell and there's practical truth in this over the
last 50 years especially in American society as we've been
shifting away from religion into secularism and rationalism and materialism
things have been lost our culture and our moral standards
have degraded with things like weed easy access to drugs
the use of profanity and vulgarity the prevalence of porn
uh violent rap music and these kinds of things this
does lead to a coarsening of our culture our children
are becoming more spoiled with access to video games in
unlimited quantities with Netflix with junk food with television with
the internet with social media with Twitter with Facebook with
Instagram this is making people soft complacent lazy and spoiled
and it is also contributing to the disintegration of the
family unit the traditional family unit is getting rotted out
as well these are not just quaint hokey fundamentalist concerns
this should concern everybody if you're secular if you're rational
if you're scientific this should still all concern you because
these are practical matters of how your children are being
raised and how you're being raised and how culture is
influencing you there are healthy cultures and unhealthy cultures on
how I mean healthy cultures over time who are not
careful they degrade into vulgarity and unhealthy cultures you know
it's amazing just go and look at an interview like
a news interview from 30 or 40 years ago and
compare it to a news interview of today and it's
kind of shocking I was watching this video of an
interview with um with Bruce Lee the famous martial artist
Bruce Lee and it was amazing it's like a 40
year old interview there was nothing anything especially profound about
it but it was just amazing the the tone with
which he spoke the the sort of decorum he had
the kind of respect that he had towards the interviewer
an interviewer had towards them there was a sort of
like I don't know something something in our culture has
just gotten so debased these days people just drop f-bombs
and hey you know I'm totally guilty of this um
but people just drop f-bombs everything has become so vulgar
and profane and just our whole culture is kind of
like lost its dignity it's like um everything is being
geared towards the lowest common denominator and the things that
Bruce Lee was saying in this interview were so he
came off as so intelligent I also watched another interview
of of Tom Cruise um this was an old interview
of Tom Cruise when he did like when he did
the first Top Gun movie this was like 30 years
ago or so um maybe 40 years ago a long
time ago um the first Top Gun but yeah it
was a short interview but again he came up just
the words he was using his diction his tone he
came off as just like so intelligent it's amazing to
watch them as some of these interviews um you can
clearly see how our culture has degraded our media has
degraded in many ways now in many ways we've become
more real we've become let we've become less like proper
and that propriety was like more like of a front
you could say but still there was like dignity in
that propriety that we've lost and that's hurting us as
a as a country so conservatives are very concerned about
this they talk a lot about how you know rap
music is degrading the culture now in a certain sense
you hear that you're like oh well come on get
get [ __ ] real you know rap music is
is is debasing the culture like come on get the
stick out of your ass you might say that or
conservatives might say oh you know weed weed is is
debasing the culture and you might say oh come on
you know stop being a square man and just smoke
smoke a bit of weed you'll be fine it's okay
we never killed anybody in a certain sense that's all
true from the left-wing point of view but also there's
truth from the right wing point of view it is
true that weed does debase our culture it's also true
that rap debases our culture rap is like a stage
red form of music when people are singing about getting
rich and stealing cars and wearing pinky diamond rings and
getting tattoos and piercings and shooting others and drive-bys and
how much you know how much money they have when
they roll into the club on in with their Mercedes
G-Wagon and you know how many [ __ ] are
grinding on their [ __ ] and how wet their
[ __ ] are and uh the kind of expensive
champagne that they're drinking and the money that they're making
rain this does get into people's minds this becomes our
value system the value system is no longer about truth
and integrity and God and being a good human being
and and um raising a good family and all this
kind of it's about [ __ ] [ __ ]
and making money this is a problem because young kids
grow up with this attitude of [ __ ] [
__ ] and making money and then you get stuff
like um you know the Tai Lopez phenomena the Andrew
Tate phenomena uh the the you know these slick entrepreneurs
who are showing off their [ __ ] Lambo in
their garage kind of [ __ ] this this is
this is what our culture has become people actually see
some dude in his [ __ ] garage with a
couple of Ferraris and Lambos and a few hot [
__ ] and you know a gold chain around his
neck and then they think that this is what they
should aspire to that this is what human life is
about is about following that idiot this is a problem
widespread use of weed psychedelics Drugs porn video games alcohol
does destabilize society and lead to disease and dysfunction you
have to admit this as a leftist if you don't
admit this you're fooling yourself now does this mean that
we should lock people in jail for smoking some weed
and of course not does this mean psychedelics should not
be legalized and never used of course not they need
to be used in a proper setting responsibly using proper
protocols for proper purposes not just for getting high does
this mean we should abolish all porn no of course
not but our relationship to porn right now is quite
toxic for many people same thing with video games does
this mean that video games cause violence as right-wingers like
to say and that we should get rid of video
games no of course not but you have also have
to admit that what has happened with video games lately
children are [ __ ] video game addicts why don't
guys know how to get laid because they spent 20
years of their childhood playing [ __ ] video games
and never talking to a single girl it's not feminism
that's preventing you from getting laid it's all the [
__ ] video games not to mention what video games
do to your career and your ability to do business
a lot of guys can't even have a decent career
because they wasted 20 years of their life which they
should have spent developing some kind of skill marketable skills
that could form the foundation of a career like drawing
programming engineering mathematics physics chemistry these would be skills you
can develop but instead where they do they play [
__ ] World of Warcraft for a thousand hours every
year this is rotting our society traditional social structures have
value to them they've been field tested to work because
they've evolved over hundreds of years this needs to be
respected leftists do not respect this nearly enough your utopian
and idealistic ideas about how to change these social structures
these traditions won't necessarily outperform the traditions because you're not
as smart as hundreds of years of evolution and trial
and error Society is very complex and any kind of
social structure that is successful and effective needs to have
gone through many iterations of trial and error and they've
had many unintended consequences so when you as a leftist
think that you could just come up with some sort
of utopian public policy proposal there's no guarantee that it's
going to work in fact it could backfire and create
something way worse you think Marxism is going to replace
capitalism and be better and eliminate poverty that's your theory
but in practice it might be the opposite of that
in practice when you implement your Marxism it might create
more poverty than capitalism that's something you need to acknowledge
that requires humility so there is a sort of arrogance
that comes with Stage green and leftism where you think
you can just socially engineer your way out of all
these problems for example you might think that in stating
democracy in the workplace the way that Richard Wolff wants
to do you know turning corporations into cooperatives you think
that this will create for better fairer work environments that's
your theory but in practice you have to wonder what
happens if you take all these big corporations and you
turn them into cooperatives will this actually work will you
actually be able to be competitive with all the other
corporations in the world who are not collaboratives or will
you not be competitive and your Co-op will become spoiled
and lazy and rotten lacking vision and Direction and ultimately
go bankrupt and then all those employees will be out
of a job which will be worse than what they
had under capitalism now I'm not using this as an
argument to say that we should not experiment with workplace
democracy I think we should I think it's a good
idea I generally agree with Richard wolf that wolf workplace
democracy is uh is probably the best implementation of Socialism
or Marxism however I'm not at all convinced that removing
all the hierarchy from our most competitive organizations and corporations
and turning them into just these flat Democratic systems is
going to produce the same kind of productivity and competitiveness
and innovation that they have now and that such cooperatives
and corporations will be able to survive and compete with
everyone else in the world maybe it'll work but we
can't know that we have to be humble and we
have to understand that it needs to be tested that's
an empirical question the next point for leftists is this
recognize that not all religion and spirituality is fundamentalist stupid
and corrupt there does exist something Beyond secularism sometimes stage
green gets the idea that secularism is the ultimate thing
and that religion and spirituality that's just some Fundamentalist you
know leftovers that we have already transcended and then if
you're an intellectual then you just got to be secular
and rational and that's the end of the story but
that's not the end of the story that's only half
the story the story continues beyond your secularism Beyond secularism
uh you realize that fundamentally atheism secularism and rationalism are
all fundamentally wrong fundamentally Marx's materialism is also wrong Marx
took his materialism actually from Hegel so you know in
Marxism there's something called uh dialectical materialism which Marx was
inspired by Hegel because Hegel Hegel was actually a much
more intelligent guy than Marx um but Hegel was a
lot harder to understand than Marx a lot less practical
than Marx so Hegel was an idealist not a materialist
Marx red Hagel took his dialectical ideas um you know
the thesis antithesis he took those kinds of ideas from
Hegel but then he didn't like the idealism he threw
away the idealism and he turned into materialism and he
thought that he was making an improvement on Hegel by
turning Hegel into materialism and then this materialist metaphysics has
crept its way into modern times and this is supposedly
an advantage to Marxist economics is that it's materialistic no
this is a disadvantage in fact Hegel was right reality
isn't is not materialistic it's idealistic materialism is wrong um
you can verify this for yourself by doing some spiritual
work um and so ultimately Marx's whole metaphysics is wrong
the entire metaphysics of Marx's economics is wrong so just
keep that in mind you marxists who think you know
everything about Marx you might know everything about Marx but
you don't know the fundamental metaphysics is wrong for more
on that see my other episodes about materialism and God
and spirituality and so forth I can't explain all that
here let's have this problem of making overly idealistic unrealistic
plans some of these plans might be like Banning the
sale of all gas cars that's been happening in California
lately in certain other places I think in Canada they've
actually set a time timeline for the ban of the
sale of all gas cars in California and in Canada
to like 20 35 I don't know what it is
something like that or for example banning all oil drilling
stuff like this um these kinds of plans come from
a good place they come from a place of compassion
environmental concern these are all valuable impulses and motivations however
they can be very unrealistic you have to be careful
with that idiot compassion that I talked about in part
one idiot compassion is when you want to like save
the whole world but you're doing it in such a
way that it's not actually going to work so while
you might care about the environment if you ban the
sale of all gas cars um you might actually create
more problems for the environment in the long term because
the reality is is that if you're not able to
actually get everyone onto an electric car and then you
ban the sale of all gas cars this is going
to create such a a problem in our economy and
for society that this will create more problems than just
having gas cars see there's many kinds of examples like
this that leftists can fall into next point the Banning
of guns in America will not stop school shootings this
is a silly idea there are so many guns in
America that you're not going to be able to ban
them also the Banning of assault rifles is not going
to prevent mass murders because they're still going to be
handguns so unless you're talking about banning all handguns which
you could talk about that but first of all that
would be grossly unconstitutional uh it would piss a lot
of people off it would not be politically popular acceptable
so it's basically a debt issue but if you don't
ban all handguns then there's no way you're going to
stop these school shootings just because assault rifles are the
most popular gun that is used for school shootings and
so forth does not mean that once you ban them
that people won't switch to handguns or shotguns they will
of course they will this is just obvious so this
this sort of like rabid desire to ban assault rifles
this sounds good in theory but in practice it's not
going to work also progressives are wrong this is something
that I was wrong about as a progressive until recently
I realized that I was and I changed my mind
on this is that guns can be legitimately used to
Stave off government tyranny I my thinking on this used
to be that you know well the government has nukes
and they have tanks they have helicopters and they have
Marines and Army and missiles so how is the populace
ever going to stand up to the government just with
you know some handguns and some rifles and some M16s
um but the reality is is that it can be
done um the military is actually surprisingly not that powerful
um and effective when it comes to Urban Warfare and
so if worse came to worse if the American citizenry
actually wanted to challenge the government because the government becomes
so corrupt or so tyrannical it actually would be capable
of doing this just through Small Arms um not that
this is a realistic scenario or that I think it
would ever really be necessary but just on this point
um conservatives are right you could do it just look
at Afghanistan you know look at how effectively uh insurgents
and the Taliban in Afghanistan was just mostly small arms
were able to resist the US military which had much
much stronger Firepower so it's not about the Firepower it's
about the it's really about the the resolve who has
more Resolve um who has the home field advantage so
to speak which of course is always the insurgents um
who can fight using dirty tricks you know shooting from
Windows and stuff like that which is of course always
the insurgents because they have no Rules of Engagement and
um and in the end it's just the size of
the population you know you have 300 million people the
Army is not that big it's only a million at
most uh let's talk about pacifism so this is where
the left goes wrong as well sometimes the left goes
into the sort of naive pacifism where they advocate for
no military at all or defunding the military or scaling
back the military budget by 90 or the complete pull
out of American forces from geopolitics all around the world
you know stop being the world's policeman sort of logic
uh sort of isolationist logic and all of this is
all this is wrong leftists tend to not appreciate the
complexities of geopolitics and the necessity and importance of conflict
and war and violence the only reason you can have
a country is because you have a military and because
you're prepared to use that military and force and conflict
to defend yourself now ideally we're going to evolve to
a place in a thousand years where none of that
will be necessary but today the world we live in
it's necessary so pacifism doesn't work today now I'm all
for minimizing war and conflict and we should especially avoid
unnecessary Wars frivolous Wars pointless Wars like the war in
Iraq or the war in Ukraine and so forth the
Vietnam War these were largely unnecessary Wars on the other
hand there are legitimate Wars and there are legitimate reasons
to fund the military and furthermore not just that but
there are legitimate reasons for geopolitical positioning and it's very
important what countries you Ally yourself with and the kind
of alliances you create the kind of blocks you create
because this has impact on the economy on trade and
on the possibility of future War so geopolitical positioning this
is uh a lot of this is about preventing War
from breaking out now of course it can all be
badly abused and it has been badly abused by America
and other countries but it's just unrealistic to expect that
all of this stops or to pull yourself out of
this America should not pull itself out of international geopolitics
this would not be a good idea because in reality
what's going to happen is that somebody else would fill
the vacuum the vacuum would be filled either by Russia
or by China or by Brazil or somebody else and
the reality is that those countries are less developed than
America so they would be more brutal and things would
be worse off generally speaking leftists don't really understand that
not all war and violence is bad violence serves a
legitimate function the military holds a legitimate function and I
mean serves a legitimate function and also military spending has
a special importance that leftists don't recognize a leftist will
say well you know how come when it comes to
funding some new war all of a sudden we have
the money for it but when it comes to funding
some education program or some prison program we don't have
the money for it but if you think about this
for a minute you should realize that the military serves
a very special function it's the most fundamental function of
a government is its military because without the military there
is no government so actually yes when it comes to
military funding that has a higher priority and therefore we
find the money because it's a matter of life and
death or at least it is in theory now is
it always a matter of life and death no is
the U.S government a military budget grossly over inflated probably
uh but also maybe not so much because remember we
do serve as the world's policeman which means we serve
as the world's Peacekeeper because if we don't do it
who's gonna do it otherwise you have Global Anarchy and
you have countries with lower stages of development serving as
the as the policeman or worse as a bully see
if the U.S pulls out of being the world's policeman
Russia may take its place do you want Russia to
be the world's policeman have you seen the police in
Russia how [ __ ] corrupt they are think twice
about that if you let Putin he'll become the world's
mob boss so to prevent that from happening yeah the
U.S spends a lot of money on military appreciate what
that gets you that gets you a lot of economic
goodies that you benefit from cheaper oil cheaper food cheaper
clothing and many other such things in your own family's
budgets there's priorities for example you might not have enough
money to go to a nice restaurant or even to
buy a textbook for your child you just may not
have enough money but when it comes to something like
paying your rent all of a sudden you find the
money why is that because paying your rent is more
important than food is more important than your child's textbook
why is that because if you don't pay the rent
they kick you out and then you're living on the
street it's kind of like that when it comes to
finding money for the military so leftists don't quite understand
this because leftists have a bias against conflict and violence
and War they tend to think of all of it
as bad because they're just such a bleeding heart Care
Bears and hippies they just want to avoid violence at
all costs but see here's the problem is that when
you avoid violence at all costs this leaves you open
to bullying from others um and counter-intuitively it could actually
create more damage and More Death how so because if
you put up a a tough front and you have
a strong military most people won't want to [ __
] with you if you just dismantle your military and
you become weak and soft you become a Target and
then actually more people want to start war with you
so you as a leftist you know think about this
your pacifism might end up backfiring on you because reality
is much more complicated than you think just because you're
going to be a pacifist does not mean that all
the low spirally developed countries around you are going to
honor that or respect that they're going to abuse that
Putin is going to abuse your pacifism think about that
another problem for the left is excessive political correctness and
cancel culture I do believe there is some value in
canceling some extremely toxic people for example I agree with
the cancellation of Alex Jones the kind of ridiculous things
he was saying were so toxic and so misinforming that
he needed to be canceled but the left can go
way too far with this the left tends to become
all too easily offended and triggered by things that are
not very significant you know minor insults jokes vulgarity and
crude things like this um people should not be canceled
for this so it's a problem when you're canceling people
for making jokes sexist jokes racist jokes rape jokes yeah
I get that this is insensitive it's insensitive to make
a rape joke or a racist joke I get that
it hurts you but that doesn't mean that somebody's entire
career should be ended over this if you think it
should just think about that again uh why are you
so sensitive we need people to be tougher it's not
so much about making others nicer it's about you becoming
tougher become so tough that a rape joke doesn't offend
you become so tough that a gay joke doesn't offend
you becomes so tough that a racist joke doesn't offend
you if it does look at how weak you are
you're so weak that words are violence to you if
words are your definition of violence you really don't appreciate
what violence is and in this case the right Wingers
are right in calling you a snowflake in a certain
sense leftists are snowflakes then again a lot of the
right wing are extreme snowflakes too they're extremely offended easily
offended and triggered it's so easy to offend and trigger
a right winger that they shouldn't be calling anyone a
snowflake the problem is that left-wingers are also easily offended
and triggered another problem that I see with the left
is in canceling others they apply today's woke moral standards
to figures of the past you know this is silly
our culture is evolving quite rapidly and you know 20
years ago it was acceptable to make a a gay
joke today it's not does that mean that if we
find somebody who made a gay joke 20 years ago
he should be canceled no you have to understand that
standards have changed 40 years ago wearing blackface was more
or less acceptable today it's not does that mean somebody
should be canceled for wearing blackface 40 years ago no
is it wrong and insensitive and ugly to wear blackface
yes obviously but you have to acknowledge the culture has
changed a lot in the last 40 years also if
you see someone wearing blackface don't [ __ ] get
offended by it now I know that sounds like Leo
who are you to say that you you know you're
not black you're not allowed to say that but the
reality is this look if somebody wearing some black [
__ ] face paint gets you all riled up that's
more of your problem than it is anybody else's problem
why are you allowing your mind to be so weakest
to be offended by that now you might say Leo
you're just gaslighting black people here no um I I
fully recognize the evils of racism and the problems with
that and the work that needs to happen on eliminating
systemic racism totally agree with you on that let's work
on that but also just on a sort of a
human cultural level stop being so [ __ ] sensitive
to little insults and offenses this is not even like
I'm not saying this for my sake I'm saying this
for your sake right you want to be the kind
of human who has the kind of mind that like
it should take a lot to offend you it should
take a lot to rile you up like something serious
like if someone rapes your daughter okay get offended get
riled up if someone rapes your daughter if someone calls
you a bad name or makes a crude joke about
you rise above that [ __ ] the way you
conquer that is by Rising above it not by engaging
in some Twitter battle over who's the bigger victim this
is a this is a problem that leftists tend to
fall into right Wingers also didn't fall into this so
I'm not just picky on the left here uh next
point leftists tend to overcompensate which resulted in a lack
of due process against rape and abuse allegations for men
which leads to mob outrage and MOB Justice rape is
a serious issue and crime and abuse sexual abuse and
physical abuse these are serious issues and and crimes and
women need to be heard when they make these accusations
and those need to be taken seriously however uh the
pendulum can swing too much to the other direction where
allegations of rape or sexual abuse are made against some
man and then there's mob outrage he get canceled he
gets canceled over there's no trial there's no due process
and it's just a form of mob Justice this mob
Justice that we see on the left this is problematic
mob Justice is not Justice so just be aware of
that excess that can happen speaking of excess stage green
can become excessively Environmental you become so concerned over the
environment and protecting the environment that you forget the human
suffering that comes with being overly concerned about the environment
you can be so protectionist over some environmental issue that
you fail to see the human suffering that is caused
by not allowing business and man to just exhaust that
environment I guess you could say it doesn't sound very
nice but ultimately like you know when it comes to
the Amazon rainforest yeah it's nice to preserve the Amazon
rainforest but also you have to wonder when it comes
to preserving the Amazon rainforest what's happening there is that
the situation in Brazil is so dire that people can
barely feed themselves so when they're logging that Forest they're
creating space for for Farming for example cattle and other
sorts of Agriculture um that actually feeds people so while
it's not nice to see the rain forest in Brazil
getting cleared you also have to kind of like look
at the other side of the issue it's like but
the clearing of the rainforest actually helps feed millions of
children who otherwise would be hungry how do you balance
those two out now I'm not saying one is better
than the other but you have to you have to
start to see both sides of that uh environmental regulation
does raise prices on food on gas on various Commodities
and services and hey I'm all for environmental regulation I
think it's very important I think climate change is a
serious issue um green energy is important all this kind
of stuff is important but also you have to understand
that it's not just evil businesses that are reaping profits
and destroying the environment it's a little bit more complicated
than that it's that businesses are exploiting the environment in
order to allow many millions of humans to survive easier
by providing them cheaper food cheaper gas and other Technologies
now is there also excessive corporate profits and greed in
there too yes of course there is of course there's
always corruption in any system but you have to be
careful that you're compassion for the environment doesn't make it
such that actually you're causing the suffering of millions of
of people on the other side those need to be
balanced out so it's mostly just a matter of balance
another issue with leftists is you have to be careful
about having excessive regulation red tape and bureaucracy there needs
to be some kind of mechanism for reducing laws and
excessive regulations it can't just be that we're always adding
new regulations every year on top of more regulations every
year forever with no mechanism for removing old ones that
no longer make sense because then we just get bogged
down and let's red tape leftists also need to be
careful with affirmative action programs I think there's some room
for affirmative action programs but they can also get excessive
and you have to be careful in how it pisses
people off the more affirmative actions programs you do basically
with affirmative action programs what you're doing is you're saying
we have a situation that's unequal now we want to
help to equalize that situation and we're going to do
that by passing some sort of program that kind of
helps the unequal side rise to parity with the equal
side um that's if essentially what affirmative action is doing
but um but the problem is that in order to
correct this imbalance you're actually creating an imbalance to corrected
imbalance but that imbalance you're creating that is an imbalance
so you'd have to keep that in mind because in
the end what you want is balance not imbalance so
the question is when do your affirmative action programs go
too far or when do they need to be turned
off once the correct balance has been struck that's a
very uh nuanced issue there's no easy answer there another
Chris criticism I would have of the left is uh
on the abortion issue completely unrestricted abortion very late term
abortion this presents a problem the majority of people are
not going to agree with you on that you can
make all the fine arguments you want about when is
a life really alive when is a baby really a
baby or a human when should it have rights when
does it suffer all this kind of stuff you can
argue that till the till the cows come home but
ultimately when we're talking about very late term abortions this
is going to be repugnant morally repugnant to the majority
of mankind now I know that you can make all
sorts of scientific and medical arguments like well you know
Leo nobody just does a late term abortion just for
the you know just because they don't want the baby
it's usually because there's complications because the mother's life is
at risk and all that fine you can make all
those little nuanced distinctions But ultimately you're not going to
win morally on this issue of late-term abortions and you're
kidding yourself You Think You Are it would be better
to come to a compromise on this issue really Roe
versus Wade struck a pretty good compromise uh but still
um I don't think leftists should push this too far
I think leftists should be happy to compromise with conservatives
on this issue of abortion and just say something like
look first two trimesters abortion is legal third trimester it's
illegal unless there's extenuating circumstances unless uh serious threat to
the mother's life or serious you know genetic defects are
found in the baby uh in the fetus in which
case maybe the abortion's okay but otherwise no late term
abortions this would be I think a reasonable compromise that
would leave most people happy and I think leftists make
a mistake when they just want completely unrestricted abortions uh
it's just a bad image it's a bad PR image
even if you can justify it by saying that oh
the very late term abortions are only going to be
the ones that are medically necessary because the majority of
abortions are done like in the first trimester it's still
a bad image politically I think of course the left
goes wrong anytime it commits violence violent protests violent riots
antifa the kind of stuff that antifa does this is
all a detriment to the left it makes the left
look bad and it just empowers the right so that
should be pretty obvious to most leftists um another problem
with the left is this is I I heard this
actually from somebody from Scandinavia I was talking to him
about you know how does he like living in Scandinavia
I forget which Scandinavian country he was from but I
was kind of asking about his um the sort of
I'm like oh you guys are supposed to have good
uh welfare systems and a good social safety net and
free healthcare how do you like it and he said
overall I like it but the one thing I don't
like about it is that there's a sort of a
culture of cutting down the tallest flowers anybody basically like
in the Scandinavian school system who tries to be a
little bit too ambitious um who tries to exert their
power and tries to rise above and be unique and
be special and be extraordinary they get cut down because
culturally it's like it's looked down upon it's like don't
don't draw too much attention to yourself don't try to
be too different don't try to you know be too
competitive uh don't try to be too creative just kind
of do what the herd is doing when I heard
this this concerned me um and so I think that
is a legitimate concern with these sort of more socialistically
inclined Scandinavian countries their culture is basically that um you
know you shouldn't be too competitive and if you achieve
a level of success beyond the norm they're just going
to cut you down at the knees this is called
cutting cutting down the tallest flowers so um you left
us should be careful about that that kind of attitude
creeping into your organizations and the economy and Society at
large it would that I think that would be um
a problem another mistake that leftists make is trying to
bring stage green values into places like Iraq or Afghanistan
or other parts of the world that are not developed
enough to sustain it for more on this you can
see my episodes on spiral Dynamics where I talk about
the problems with trying to impose one value system on
another value system that is not ready for it but
basically uh the only countries in the world that are
really ready for stage green are going to be stage
orange countries you can't take a country like Saudi Arabia
which is staged red and blue and try to impose
stage green values on it this is the problem of
like you know for example when leftists criticize Saudi Arabia
or the Middle East for forcing their women to wear
headscarves and hijabs from a staged green value system it
seems like this is barbaric what's happening in Saudi Arabia
um but that's just how it looks from the green
value system you have to recognize that from their value
system stage blue and red it's a whole different world
and you should not try to impose your value system
onto a country that is so far removed from it
that it's going to take them hundreds of years to
evolve to Stage green and this is part of the
reason why democracy failed for example in Iraq and in
Afghanistan and why after the U.S pulled out from Afghanistan
the Taliban immediately took over like the US was never
even there and forced all the women out of school
and forced all the women to wear head scarves and
hijabs and stuff because Afghanistan is spironamic stage purple and
red what do you expect of them their green value
system and then and then you know like stage green
valued feminists in America and in Europe are like in
shock about this like oh my God what about the
little girls in Afghanistan dude the way that those kind
of cultures treat women they treat women as property that's
how women are treated in that culture in that value
system you can't just go in there and impose your
value system on them it's not going to work there
is no feminism in Afghanistan forget about feminism it doesn't
exist at that stage of development a lot of liberals
and progressives don't understand this another minor criticism that I
have of the left is that they sometimes criticize and
dismiss the importance of space exploration they'll make the argument
that like you know we have so many people suffering
on this planet that why are we wasting money exploring
space when we could put all that money into feeding
the hungry and the poor I understand that criticism but
I think that also there's an important function to space
exploration it's not purely frivolous mankind needs some sort of
higher aspiration Beyond merely the petty human [ __ ]
that is happening on this planet and I think space
exploration fills that void very nicely space exploration is almost
like one of those things that we can all kind
of agree on in the sense that it's like a
it's almost like our highest aspiration as a species is
to grow Beyond planet Earth and it's just one of
those aspirational things that make you feel good about Mankind
you know when you're reading articles about some new space
launch or some new Space Telescope or some new planet
that's been discovered or um pictures of of some distant
Galaxy this fills you with awe with almost a sense
of Divine Purpose it's almost like the most religious that
our secular society gets is when we get pictures of
space it puts us into a larger pers you know
context and perspective all the wars and petty [ __
] that we deal with here all of that loses
its importance next to a photograph of the Milky Way
galaxy or something like that and so I think that
that's valuable and the amount of money we spend on
our on it is relatively trivial for what we get
back culturally not to mention the technology that also um
gets invented from pushing ourselves into space the next criticism
I have of the left is just the constant complaining
criticizing and whining of the left comes very grating and
annoying after a certain point this in gratitude fundamentally is
what it is nothing is ever good enough for the
left even even when we pass a tax increase even
when um there's a new stimulus package even when we
pull out of some War like Afghanistan even when something
you know good is done for the for the hungry
for the poor even when um we pass stricter gas
regulations and stuff like that like it's never good enough
for progressives never never this is a bad attitude it's
a kind of a demoralizing ungrateful it's just not a
good way to go through life you're never going to
be happy do you understand this as a progressive you're
basically never ever going to be happy in your whole
life you're going to be bitching moaning and whining the
society is not good enough for your whole life until
you're dead now ask yourself is that a good way
to live life maybe the problem isn't that Society isn't
Advanced enough for you maybe the problem is that you
expect Society to be more advanced than it really should
be maybe that's the problem maybe the problem isn't Society
maybe the problem is you has that crazy idea ever
crossed your mind maybe you want something of society that
it can never give you this can lead to a
sort of culture of victimhood and weakness look in the
end at the era we're living in we're living in
the Dark Ages basically the 21st century will be known
as the dark ages of mankind thousands of years from
now yes it's barbaric it's brutal it's cruel it's unfair
it's got racism and homophobia in it and transphobia and
it's got genocide and it's got all sorts of ugly
stuff and in a certain sense your job is to
accept that and to be tough enough to deal with
all that and to not be a crybaby about it
now does that mean you capitulate and you don't stand
up against bullies and you don't fight against slavery and
racism when they exist and you don't speak up against
rape and uh abuse of homosexuals now of course you
do you fight these things you go to The Ballot
Box you vote on the right issues right you can
do all those things but just don't get sucked into
this kind of mindset and this culture of just this
perpetual victimhood and this kind of weakness and just uh
being so sensitive about everything so ungrateful about everything and
just whining constantly about everything this is not good for
you and this is not a resourceful attitude from which
to build the kind of great society that we want
to build to remember that society and people can only
develop so fast and if you're a progressive they're never
going to develop as fast as you want them to
but you have to be mature about that because it's
almost like you have a child who's a little bit
mentally [ __ ] and this child is going to
school and going through his classes and so forth and
you as the parent you're never satisfied because in your
mind you always expected that you would have like a
genius child with an IQ of 140 but actually you
in reality you happen to have a child who has
an IQ of like 90. he's a little on the
slow side so he struggles with figuring out his schoolwork
and every time he comes home you yell at him
and you berate him and criticize him for not getting
good enough grades and not being smart enough is that
a wise attitude no at some point you have to
accept that your child is a little bit slow slower
than the other kids and that this is just the
nature of the Beast and you not accepting this is
not going to help the situation you constantly complaining to
your child about his slowness is not going to make
him fast in fact it's going to make him hate
you and resent you and it's going to just make
the whole thing worse in a sense that's what's happening
with progressives and Society our society is mentally [ __
] and you have to accept that that's difficult to
accept that we live in the dark ages in a
mentally [ __ ] Society with a bunch of morons
but that's the case and you have to live with
these morons you can't kill these morons so you might
as well make peace with it but at the same
time you don't accept all the stupid stuff they tell
you you encourage them and you do the best to
help them move forward and just to see the light
but also you don't um lose your [ __ ]
over it either you see it's it's a delicate Balancing
Act there I want you to acknowledge that the right
wing has valid concerns when it comes to immigration taxation
abortion and the debasement of culture now does the right
wing exaggerate all these things yes of course it does
but I want you to recognize that there's there's some
validity there now we're getting into some very general final
points about the left final mistakes that they make um
like for example overly demonizing stage blue and Stage Orange
that's just a very fundamental mistake that the left makes
because that's a very fundamental mistake that stage green makes
another mistake they make very generally is not fully embodying
and exploring the lower stages of the Spiral stage green
tends to get locked into itself and demonizes the lower
stages and not really embody them even in your own
personal life which leads to misunderstanding and confusion and problems
it leads to a lopsided development you should appreciate that
most humans have a lot of work to do to
integrate just the values of stage blue and orange most
Americans are struggling to develop healthy stages stages blue and
orange never mind green they're not yet ready for green
and I would go even further to say that if
you were at think you are on stage green if
you're a progressive leftist socialist Marxist and so forth I
guarantee you that you have not fully embodied stage blue
and orange and that it would be in your best
interest to do so there are important developmental lessons that
you're missing from blue and orange I also want to
caution you to be very careful about straw Manning conservatives
I see this so often with progressives just straw man
after straw man after straw man of conservatives try to
steal man conservatives try to really understand their worldview and
where they're coming from and try to find the signal
in all their noise conservatives create a lot of [
__ ] noise but there is signal there that you're
missing and I also want you to take responsibility for
your contribution to the political polarization that's happening right now
it's not merely the right Wingers who are creating this
crazy polarization in American politics it's also the extreme left
wing acknowledge that and my final criticism of stage green
is that stage green creates a shadow out of capitalism
greed ethnocentrism racism War violence religion nationalism corporations guns traditional
morality uh exploitation of the environment and masculinity you've likely
created shadows out of these and this is a problem
you need to integrate these Shadows so that you can
develop to your Highest Potential all right so those are
all the points now some final remarks to sum all
this up now obviously not all leftists suffer from all
the problems that I listed above I listed a lot
of problems that's a long list um there's a wide
range of maturity and level of development among leftists some
leftists are very immature and childish other leftists are very
mature so we can't paint them all with one brush
if you take a big picture meta view a systems
View you'll recognize that obviously the right wing cannot be
100 wrong if the right wing was 100 wrong they
wouldn't exist they exist because there's some kernel of Truth
to their worldview there is value in the right wing
worldview so you have to ask yourself what are the
legitimate functions of the right wing if you say to
yourself there are no functions that are legitimate then that's
how you know you're fooling yourself the right wing has
legitimate functions even though a lot of times the right
wing goes crazy overboard to the point where you might
think that it's completely detached from reality and has no
value whatsoever now despite all the limitations of the left
wing that I've mentioned here in this series the left
is still more developed and more reasonable generally speaking than
the right the extreme right is more toxic and more
dangerous than the extreme left at this point in human
history now maybe in the future this will change but
right now that is my assessment if you think I'm
biased well that's your opinion but I think I'm being
objective when I say that now you might say Leo
but why should we listen to you on all this
aren't you just biased aren't all these just your biases
uh in reality I'm not loyal to any side or
ideology that's one thing you can count on from me
is that I never have a loyalty to any one
group I don't have a loyalty to any country to
any race to not even to humanity itself I just
I've never had loyalties to any kind of group I'm
very allergic to any kind of group affiliation or identity
what I care about is pure understanding and perspective so
really I'm just offering you more perspective than you've had
as a leftist I'm one of the most open-minded people
that you'll find on this planet I think open-mindedness is
a superpower and I can teach you this superpower and
that's part of why I was able to create this
episode this series of episodes is because I am so
open-minded that I'm able to see beyond my own biases
and my own political uh inclinations I do have very
Progressive political inclinations but that doesn't mean I'm blinded by
the to the point where I can't see beyond them
there's a lot of value of looking beyond your own
political inclinations I want you to understand that both the
left and the right are not that developed they both
make a lot of mistakes they're both very biased and
they both fail to appreciate how complex and challenging government
is figuring out the right government is so so difficult
most people have no idea it's important that leftists and
progressives have an accurate understanding of the conservative worldview and
not just straw mans why because the wrong understanding is
guaranteed to create problems think of it like this like
you have a a bad relationship with your spouse so
you two go into marriage counseling what's the first thing
that's going to happen in marriage counseling the most fundamental
solution is to get both of you to sit down
and to listen to each other's points of view in
good faith because if you go in there and you
say oh my wife she's a [ __ ] she's
a [ __ ] and she cheats on me and
she's always wrong and she's evil and she's stealing money
and all this kind of stuff if that's how you
go in there and then your wife goes in there
and says the exact kind of same things about you
there's no way that can be healed that's a divide
that cannot be healed you need to be able to
go in there and listen to your wife's grievances about
you as difficult as that is listen to her grievances
in good faith that means when she's telling you all
the things she doesn't like about what you're doing or
that offends her or disturbs her you're not sitting there
demonizing her in your mind you're actually taking her seriously
and then she has to do the same thing for
you and then there's a possibility of healing this marriage
well you know a marriage isn't even as bad as
our political situation because in a marriage there's always the
option to just get a divorce people go their separate
ways and life is happily ever after right things are
fine you can find happiness after divorce but there can't
be a divorce in America so it's a more strict
situation we're forced to figure out how to live together
we can't kick out half the country we can't kill
half the country and if we separate the country the
two countries then both will be very weak and they
will be conquered by external enemies in the future I'm
going to have two new episodes one that's going to
focus on understanding the conservative mind and one that's going
to focus on understanding the liberal mind those are gonna
be powerful episodes so stick tuned for those and make
sure you go watch my four-part series called conscious politics
if you want an explanation of what you know I
said Fourth Way politics stage yellow politics metapolitics politics beyond
the Left Right spectrum and Beyond centrism what does that
look like go check out my series search for it
on YouTube it's called conscious politics all right that's it
I'm done here please come check out actualize.org that's my
website down below there's a link you will find resources
on the website you'll find my blog you'll find my
book list you'll find political books on my book list
you'll find my life purpose course you'll find the actualized
Forum and other resources are available for you there if
you'd like you can support me at patreon.com actualize with
some donations I thank you for those and here's the
final thing that I'll leave you with it's this the
reason I talk about politics is because unbiased tier 2
discussions of politics are so rare this channel is one
of the few sources on the internet where you will
hear tier 2 political discussion so I feel it's my
duty to offer that because it's so rare I'm one
of the few people who can do it now there's
a few others but it's pretty rare also one of
my missions is to get people to stop being ideological
to get out of group think to stop demonizing others
and to do politics Frontier two and to see radical
points of view that's my bias that's why I teach
this stuff the way that I do also understand that
my work is so Advanced and takes so much open-mindedness
that it really cannot exist in a closed-minded political system
when people are arguing with each other demonizing each other
fighting with each other being overly partisan my work cannot
work my spiritual work cannot work so I sort of
need to help to carve out a space for this
kind of work to be possible at all and also
the ability to see radically different perspectives than your own
is core to my work that's why politics is so
interesting to me because politics presents a real world practical
application of all the kind of open-mindedness and multi-perspectivalism that
I teach in my epistemic episodes well politics allows you
to kind of really test how good are you at
seeing radically different perspectives than your own this is the
real test I'm one of the few people on this
planet who can teach you how to see radically different
perspectives than your own because that's just something that's a
core value of mine that I'm very passionate about I
break and rack my mind around how to see radically
different perspectives than my own and I can help you
to do the same but only if you have the
desire to do so which I hope that you do
and if you do then you found exactly the right
channel subscribe and stick around for more where we will
cover many other tools and ways of thinking about reality
that will show you crazy radical New Perspectives
