hey it's Leo for actualised org and I'm outside today
it's a beautiful day in Las Vegas and today I
wanted to talk to you about life coaching and really
I'm trying I've been you know you know and that
I'm a life coach and I work with people on
self-development issues and one of the things that is curious
for me as I was going through coaching training I
did about oh like 200 to 300 hours of coaching
training through Ipek and just my own study and that's
on top of all the self-development stuff that I study
so I've been doing that and then I did about
another ninety to a hundred hours now of one-on-one live
coaching with with friends and and various colleagues and clients
and so you know as I was doing that I
was it was curious to me I was going through
that whole process as to you know whether coaching even
works because I was skeptical and I first started like
what is this coaching stuff does it really work can
it really help you just can talk in with somebody
really help and this whole idea of just asking questions
because one of the one of the distinctions between being
a coach we're working with a coach and working with
let's say a therapist or a consultant or a mentor
is that the coach really takes a different approach to
how to how he helps you get results so the
way coaching is supposed to work is that coaches are
not supposed to give you advice coaches are supposed to
just ask you questions and so at first this idea
seems a little bit fishy especially to a skeptic like
myself I started thinking like you know well there's so
much value in getting you know specific advice like you
know if you go and you talk to a consultant
or a mentor the consultant mentor will tell you exactly
what you need to do to get some part of
your life handled or to get some sort of success
in some area or domain that you want to get
it in so if let's say you want to start
a business and you're looking for some help with that
well you can go to a two you know business
consultant that will tell you how to get your finances
set up how to get your corporation set up and
all this other stuff how to be successful specifically in
your type of niche if you find that kind of
consultant so so their consulting can be great also you
know a mentor mentor is usually someone who's gone through
the same kind of stuff that you've gone through so
he has a lot of experience and learning from that
experience makes a lot of right if someone has experience
has been successful in some part of their life then
modeling that person or getting direct advice from them what
seem like it would be very useful and and all
that is true you know from what I found that
can be really good and then with therapy you know
therapy is more about working with with dysfunctional people or
people that have you know more serious mental issues whereas
coaching is more about taking someone who's already functional and
taking them to an optimal level but I think the
biggest difference between coaching and all those others other fields
is that coaching is about asking a lot of questions
and not giving any advice and just relying and trusting
that the client or you whoever's being coached has the
resources within themselves to kind of figure it out and
so as I was going through this whole process I
was just you know curious for myself you know how
does coaching really generate that value for people especially because
you know coaches can charge quite a bit and that
needs to be justified with a return on investment it's
not just about mental masturbation at least I didn't want
to become a coach unless I thought that there was
a real value that I could add to people's lives
and so if I'm asking people questions I want to
know you know how is that asking a simple question
can give a big return on investment and you know
as I was being coach because I've gone through maybe
50 hours of coaching myself where I was being coached
by somebody else by another coach I've been coached by
professional coaches I've been coached by people going through the
program with me it's been a great experience and I'm
you know some of those sessions have been awesome some
of them have been still good but not given the
same results so different sessions can give you different results
of different coaches are at different levels of efficiency and
how they coach and you know as I was being
coached and as I was coaching others I started looking
at the different results so here's some of the findings
that I came up with at least for myself and
I'm still trying to figure this out because it's really
fascinating to me and there's more to learn basically the
way I see it is that coaching really makes you
think so and it what's the power in that you
would tell me that well I can think on my
own I don't need a coach to help me with
that and you know I'd be the first to say
that because I love to think I think I spend
more time introspecting than most people do I'm tend to
be a naturally introspective kind of guy so if you're
if you're that way you might be thinking like well
I already have that part handled here's the difference though
a couple of differences number one is that simply a
lot of times you're just caught in your own story
you're caught in your own you're caught in your own
ways of thinking you're caught in your own belief systems
in the way you were raised up in your experience
you're caught in the experience of your friends your society
everything that's around you keeps feeding you with the same
information you just kind of get stuck or you start
going down the same path the same Road you just
keep going down the same Road and sometimes that's good
sometimes if you feel like you're stuck and you want
to do a you know a change in your life
or if you feel that the roads are down going
down is not the healthiest or most fulfilling for you
then sometimes it helps to get some external external forces
to kind of nudge you off nod you off into
a different direction so that's what coaching can be good
for it's a little bit more objective the problem is
that a lot of times you're just so caught in
your own story the way that you're interpreting events and
you don't even realize it consciously until you have someone
else come in there and give you a good kick
in the ass and send you in a different direction
or just get you to start to think about a
situation in a different way that you haven't thought about
before because otherwise you'll just be stuck and you'll think
that that's the way it is and that's usually what
keeps you stuck is it's not that just that you're
stuck but then you start to really think like oh
well there could be no other way this is how
it has to be for reasons abcdefg and you're really
good at coming up with reasons we all are as
to why you can't change the situation why it has
to suck why you're a victim etc etc etc why
you can't make changes but a good coach can help
you see stuff from a different angle and that can
be really really powerful sometimes it just takes one shift
one question that will send you thinking about something that
you would have never really thought about on your own
and so that challenging aspect is really important and is
a great is a great function of coaching and it
can happen really fast you don't need a bunch of
sessions to get it sometimes it might take many sessions
sometimes it can happen within five minutes in session it
just kind of all depends on what the issue is
we're coming from and how much blockage you have around
it so that's one thing I found I've definitely found
that happening on myself I found myself being able to
make those kind of changes with the people that I've
coached with clients another reason that I think coaching works
well is that it really starts to make you think
and process more consciously and more deliberately a lot of
times we get lazy with our thinking we introspect but
what happens is while you're introspecting you're not very rigorous
about it so you're not very deliberate about setting up
your goals you're not very deliberate about telling yourself what
you want and what you don't want and so you're
not deliberate about thinking through strategies and so what happens
is that a lot there's a lot of assumptions in
your thinking whenever you're approaching something and again most of
stuff is unconscious so you don't even realize it until
later when you get coached and then something suddenly sparks
or triggers in you and you're like oh oh my
god I have this assumption the whole time and that
assumption was actually limiting me in the following ways and
once you start to realize it a little bit of
awareness around it it becomes easier to start making changes
you know one of the most difficult things for me
as a coach starting coaching was not to give advice
because you know I've let I've read a lot of
self-help the literature I'm kind of follow the industry I
follow the field I kind of a experiment the stuff
on myself so it's easy to for me to come
at a lot of people's issues with my own base
of experience and knowledge so someone comes to me with
like a fitness goal or you know they don't like
their career something like that they want changes it's easy
for me to start spouting advice at them or stuff
that I would do or stuff that I know that
other people have done but see the trick is this
is that what keeps you blocked is not the fact
that you don't have enough knowledge or awareness of how
to do stuff it's usually just simply the fact that
you have that you have your own like inner issues
that are there so you have beliefs you have experiences
that I've all led you up to the point where
you're at right now and have led you to the
way that you think and they've created some some pros
in your life so they've opened up opportunities for you
the ways that you're thinking but the ways that you
think you have also have some some some negatives to
them and also some limitations and a lot of times
you don't you don't realize what those are until you
start to kind of work through them and the thing
is that if I just give you a piece of
advice and tell you oh you got to start going
to the gym if you want to lose weight that
might be great for some people who's you know whose
inner mind is able to wrap around that for other
people it's not it's not going to really have an
effect because what they really need usually when someone is
overweight and they're not going to the gym it's not
because they don't know that they need to go to
the gym is because they don't have the motivation to
do it so that means that somewhere in their mind
they're not getting triggered and getting excited about the idea
of going to the gym whereas someone like a bodybuilder
for example doesn't have that problem a bodybuilders go to
the gym and he's excited all the time so now
the question is what is the difference in thinking between
a bodybuilder and then someone who is overweight who wants
to start going to the gym well it's how they
think about the gym it's all the beliefs that they
have so maybe the reason the overweight person is not
going to the gym and this might be different for
every single individual it might be something like well the
fact that they think that by going to the gym
and they've never gone before and they're 50 pounds overweight
then they start thinking like well I go to the
gym and I'm going to start working out and then
people are going to start looking at me I'm going
to be I'm going to where am i doing my
gym my gym shorts and my gym shirt and I'm
be fat and overweight and I'm going to look horrible
and I'm not going to be doing any heavy lifting
for months because I have to build up to it
I'm going to be running really slow on the treadmill
so basically I have to start at Ground Zero and
I'm gonna look like a fool whereas all these other
ripped guys going to be walking around me working out
and laughing in my face so maybe like that's the
kind of picture they have of the gym so if
they have that kind of picture you know of course
of course they're not going to want to go to
the gym there's a lot of resistance from that so
in that case we got to find out what that
resistance is and then work with it and that's going
to be very specific to that individual for somebody else
it might be totally different you know somebody else that
does want to go to the gym might be thinking
about the long commute that they need to make to
the gym and the fact that they don't have time
that that's time that they need to spend with their
family and their kids that you know how selfish of
them is it too to worry about their own weight
and their own and their own looks which in the
end are so vain right like caring about your looks
and your health is so kind of vain in some
on some level versus for example you know driving your
kids to soccer practice and picking them up from school
and spending time with them at dinner so if someone
is very family-oriented they're gonna have a problem going to
the gym because that's just time that's being taken away
from their family so that's a totally different block and
again all this is in your head not to say
that there aren't real challenges out there I mean sure
you have a limited time that's that's that's real but
the fact is that there's also ways to work around
it and in all those cases there's ways to get
yourself to go to the gym it's just a matter
of wanting it and then working through it so in
that case you know we would start working with that
person's particular problems and start looking at okay so the
blocks are you know family time how could you make
family time and gym time maybe how could you combine
the two what are some possibilities there so we start
working with that you know is it really true that
you need to sacrifice family time is it really true
that going to the gym is vain how are you
actually helping your family by going to the gym maybe
if you go to the gym you get fit and
you lose 50 pounds you stop being a fat ass
and stop being lazy and lethargic and sleepy maybe you'll
have more energy with the kids your kids will have
more fun with you you'll be more engaged and you'll
actually gain gain more than you lose so it'll be
a win-win so that's like ways of how to turn
that kind of stuff around and this applies this applies
everywhere it's not just the gym that's just like an
easy example to use this can be with your business
that can be with your relationships can be with how
you're eating you know how you're approaching almost any aspect
of your life any kind of negative habits that you
have any kind of blocks that you have so coaching
is really good about that and that's also really why
coaching is is a good addition to kind of traditional
self-development which is usually done through like self-help books so
if you read Tony Robbins that kind of stuff you
might be wondering well you know I've already read Tony
Robbins I'd some that stuff I listened to some CD
programs I'd listen somebody I watch them seminars maybe I
went to a workshop or two I've read some articles
online you know maybe I have my favorite newsletter self-development
newsletter that I've signed up to so why do I
need some sort of code you know some sort of
coach to help me with my with my issues well
all that stuff is great I think it gives you
a very solid foundation I encourage you to do all
of that as much as you can I do it
myself I love it the only issue is that sometimes
you need a little bit more you know and sometimes
your problems are personal and that more generic advice that's
geared towards the mainstream so you know if Tony Robbins
is giving you some weight loss advice it just might
be you know something that will apply to everybody but
it might not address your specific little quirk or hang-up
and it's not going to really deal with your specific
inner game might give you some general inner game advice
but not very specific in your game advice and especially
if it's stuff that you've been trying for a long
time and you haven't been able to get through on
your own or with the help of books and CDs
and stuff like that like maybe you've been trying to
lose weight for a long time and you really struggle
with it you keep losing a few pounds then you
keep putting it all back on and you just can't
lock it and make it sustainable well that's the kind
of change that may be a coach you'd want to
coach to help you with because you know you've already
done the studying but it's still not enough you're still
not really motivated engaged to do what you want to
do you're having trouble locking it in so there's some
sort of block that you have and you can either
try to figure out on your own or you can
help figure it out with the help of a coach
save yourself some time and some struggle in the long
run it might be a really good investment for you
so that's that's another way that coaching is great is
that it really deals with your specific inner game it's
very tailored to you know to every individual client like
few other few other products or services can be let
me think you know what what other what other coaching
benefits are there generally I think that when I'm coaching
somebody I always have a tendency to give a little
bit of advice or to ask leading questions so questions
that start to get the the person thinking along the
lines that I want them thinking along and that's easy
for me to do and it's very tempting because like
I said I do have that background of self development
so I tend to know generally you know what direction
someone needs to go and if they want to improve
their relationship or they want to see more success in
business or that kind of stuff but I actually find
that the most powerful way to help people is to
ask them questions that make them pause so and I
actually look for this in my coaching sessions now because
I'm always evaluating the questions that I'm asking some of
my questions are kind of a boilerplate but some of
the best questions is like when I ask something of
a client and that client has to pause and then
you hear a silence on the phone on the other
end and they're just like whom they're just pondering it
and maybe they struggle to answer it or maybe what
they say is they say something like oh I don't
know I don't have the answer to that and then
I'll ask something like oh really well why is it
so hard for you to answer that and then they
start with they really start to think about it they
start to to think down directions they've never thought down
before because usually when you're thinking your mind can only
focus on one thing at a time and you start
to go down this this branching tree so you're thinking
and then you have a few choices so you go
down one choice then you choose another choice another choice
other choice another choice so there's a lot of the
tree that gets left unexplored of decisions and thought patterns
which can lead you to totally different conclusions and in
totally different directions so when I get a client going
down a branch that he or she has never gone
down before and to really get the gears turning in
the head you can almost feel it and I mean
I'm just coaching over the phone so I don't even
see the client but I can I can feel it
in my body when they start the cogs start turning
so they're going out of kind of automatic mode and
they're getting really conscious and aware and kind of deliberate
about what they're planning so maybe it's something like asking
them what they really want out of their relationship and
maybe you know they haven't really thought about it and
just forcing them to start defining what they really want
out of their relationship and when you start doing that
they start really think and start coming up with answers
that lead to two results and lead to revelations and
breakthroughs sometimes they might give a laundry list of answers
and then one of those will seize on one of
those and it's like oh what about this and it's
like oh yeah that's actually a huge factor of the
whole equation that I've never even considered before it just
it never stood out to me before until you know
a coach has a has kind of highlighted it and
brought it forward so that's kind of how coaching can
help without needing to give specific advice because a lot
of times at least I kind of tend to think
this way when a coach when people told me that
like coaching just assumes that you have all the answers
within yourself I'm like well on that you know it's
good to have external knowledge it's good to have feedback
and advice but I see that coaching now is a
bigger piece of the pot it's just one piece of
the larger puzzle of your life so it's definitely not
a cure-all by any means and you should use other
things in addition to it but what it can do
is it can start jogging your memory and start getting
you to think along as you've never thought about and
dealing with inner blocks in a way where you know
I don't need to tell you exactly what to do
and it's good for me because that means I don't
have to put the burden of responsibility on myself in
terms as a coach in terms of know knowing everything
I need to know so if you come to me
and ask for coaching advice about business I don't need
to be a business expert even though I you know
I happen to have started my own businesses and I
know a bit about that but I don't need to
be like an expert in whatever business it is that
you're doing to help coach you on it because usually
the blocks are more general they're more psychological and they're
more human than they are related to some specific business
you know obviously if you have a problem with your
business that you need various detailed help on you can
get a consultant for that but also that consultant might
just help you with that one specific problem whereas your
bigger problem is going to be the way that you're
thinking about your business and sure can someone to help
you with there as well but you might not even
realize that that's the problem until you talk to a
coach and so it's good for a coach to not
have to have that kind of level of specialization where
we have to know your business we have to know
you know I know stuff about fitness and weight loss
and nutrition but you know I'm not a nutritionist I
still feel qualified to coach you on that stuff because
it's more about getting you engaged getting you motivated and
removing your inner blocks that's what I'm coaching you on
I'm not coaching you on the details of how to
have a proper diet that's something that you would go
to a book for that's something that you would go
to a nutritionist for so I think I'm going to
wrap up with that that was a really good I
think I got all the points that I wanted out
of there on in terms of you know how I
see coaching as being valuable because to me it's really
important that what I'm doing is valuable and it's not
just a bunch of mental masturbation all right this is
