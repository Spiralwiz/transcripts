[Music] i've reached a new level of consciousness a very
advanced level of consciousness a very radical level of consciousness
that i want to tell you about and as i
will be talking about it we're going to build up
to it it's going to take a little while to
build up to it here so hold your horses i
also want to in the process draw some distinctions that
i'm making between awakening and god realization and non-duality so
basically my point is that these are not the same
thing and so i will be distinguishing these for you
and helping you to make sense of of why that
is a lot of the things that i'll be saying
here uh are going to be right at the edge
of my ability to communicate like this is good this
is going to be one of my most advanced communications
that i've ever done up to this point and it's
going to be difficult to communicate what i want to
communicate but i'll try my best it's good practice for
me and i think you'll get a lot out of
it if you keep an open mind i will be
saying some things here which contradict almost everything you hear
from spiritual teachers in other places so just be aware
of that be aware of your closed mindedness in terms
of that all right so let's get started so uh
i i know i i'm sure you're you're you're tired
of it already but you know i keep coming back
and telling you that i've reached uh new levels of
of consciousness or awakening beyond everything prior and well i
i have um i'm just reporting to you what it's
like right i'm not making this [ __ ] up
um so i'm just going to report it how it
happened and then whether you believe it or not that's
up to you um you see the problem is that
like some of you guys expect awakening just to be
this simple thing where it's like you get it and
then you're done no there's nothing simple about this and
then you you tell yourself but if it's not this
simple then it's ego no it's not ego it's just
not simple there are absolutely no limits to consciousness consciousness
can keep growing and understanding itself at ever deeper layers
and levels and there is no contradiction between saying that
you had a total awakening before and now you have
another one that's even more total see consciousness does not
subscribe or fit into your simple little human definitions and
logic it might seem logical to you like well leo
if your previous one was total then this one can't
be total like this one's also total but you're saying
it's more total that means you're full of [ __
] you were lying about the previous one and the
one half before that no it's just that your little
mind can't contain what is being communicated here it's a
paradox it's a very paradoxical thing they always feel total
but then there's higher degrees of totality that's the that's
the very paradoxical thing about infinity it's not a bug
it's a feature it's not a mistake and this is
what you will encounter if you really seriously do this
work rather than just sitting back and criticizing from from
sort of an armchair position you got to actually get
your feet in the water get wet go to the
deep end of the pool and then you'll discover how
deep it gets it's not like in your little kiddie
pool so where do i even begin um i guess
let's begin here let's make a distinction between the sort
of classical awakenings and enlightenments that most spiritual traditions talk
about and what i will be talking about is god
realization so i want you to imagine and i'm still
working out this model it's a little model i i
developed uh here uh just i mean it's just it's
a you gotta understand these are just very loose approximations
this is not literally how it is but look imagine
we have an axis that goes up and down like
the y-axis on a math chart and so this axis
represents sort of like what your consciousness is up to
consciousness can take an infinite number of different states you're
in a certain state of consciousness now and what you
do through meditation practice and traditional teachings and practices such
as zen or buddhism or maybe a divida or neo
advaita perhaps yoga is that you're you're basically shutting what's
the technique the technique is you're shutting down your mind
they call it the monkey mind this is actually a
very problematic framing but they frame it as the monkey
mind anything basically is framed as the monkey mind and
sort of the objective is to get to a state
of no mind and so the mind is quieted down
quieted down quieted down through just emptying the mind or
through concentration on a single object or something and so
it just kind of watching your breath whatever and you're
quieting down your mind and then your objective is to
reach a sort of a peaceful um empty like no
mind state and then from there you can have either
spontaneous insights or recognition of your true nature you could
have a satori an awakening enlightenment whatever you want to
call it and basically this is how you get to
that sort of classical buddhist recognition of the truth of
no self because the ego in a certain sense is
the mind at work thinking thoughts and so if you
can shut off all of that you can get to
sort of a sort of emptiness and then you can
realize no self you can realize that oh the self
was itself you know just a function and a rising
of the mind and then and then maybe you can
even go deeper than that and you can realize nothingness
which is also maybe everythingness as well and you know
emptiness the buddha's talking about emptiness and shunyata and shiva
and these sorts of things and you can even have
like what they call a cessation which might even be
an emptiness that is so deep that even the visual
field collapses the entire sensory field collapses into just like
a pure void now what newbies misunderstand about this is
that they think that when i'm talking about nothingness or
when when buddhists are talking about nothingness what they mean
is that everything has to disappear it's like literally a
void or we could call it a cessation thing of
course that is nothingness if you can achieve that state
um but nothing else is not exclusive to that state
nothingness is always the case this right here right now
my words are nothingness just as nothing as that void
the void is not more nothing than this nothing here
they're both nothing but there's just different qualities of nothing
you can have sort of a full nothing and an
empty nothing again the language is limiting us here right
so um that's all good and this would be sort
of considered the classical neoadvising enlightenment but now let's distinguish
that and so so what what that is is again
look you're moving downwards on this axis and then you
hit a sort of a rock bottom which would be
like i mean the most absolute rock bottom if you're
going in this direction of consciousness is just a state
of pure cessation where you don't even experience colors sounds
or body sensations literally nothing imagine like if you were
blind in every sensory modality you were blind you were
deaf you couldn't even feel your body you couldn't think
thoughts anymore and then like literally nothing but you still
exist the nothingness exists not the human you the human
you is gone because the human you is just comprised
of nothing other than these let's say five modalities of
sight hearing feeling smell touch taste thought that's really like
all you're made out of that's what you the human
you is made out of so if all that disappears
what's left you might say well nothing is left on
dead no you're not dead because death is also something
you're thinking you're not dead you're this void and that
void exists you might think the void doesn't exist no
it exists um so that's going all the way down
to the absolute bottom and then when you reach that
you could say well what what what more can there
be you can't get lower or more empty than that
and so in this sense this trajectory of awakening if
you want to call that awakening this this form of
it leads you to a sort of a natural rock
bottom which is this cessation or you can have less
less of a deep one where it's not a total
cessation of all your perceptions your perceptions are all here
still here but you recognize all this as being the
void itself too and so that's also you can kind
of call that rock bottom maybe not the absolute rock
bottom but it's pretty low and so this version of
the path seems to have this rock bottom to it
and and that's that's fine but now i want to
introduce you to the upwards movement of consciousness the upwards
movement of consciousness unlike the downwards is not about shutting
off the mind in fact it makes no difference whether
your mind is active or not and in fact an
active mind in this situation is not necessarily a bad
thing in fact not only is it not necessarily a
bad thing it's actually a good thing so imagine that
consciousness your consciousness is like a knob that we can
spin infinitely in both directions we can spin the knob
to zero and that's sort of its natural limit it
doesn't go into the negatives or you can spin it
the other direction and as you spin it that way
it spins forever and it just keeps increasing to infinity
and then even there you can have multiple orders of
infinity because there are multiple orders of infinity not just
one there are infinity of infinities that's the nature of
absolute infinity so yeah you keep spinning it this way
and after you spin it you know past let's say
10 let's let's say normally your conscious is like at
a one or two you spin it to a 10.
that's sort of the limits of ordinary human existence once
you start spinning it beyond that you're beyond being human
at this point um and what's happening when this knob
is being spun upwards is that you're moving up the
y-axis here and your mind is going from a finite
human mind into a what i would call a super
mind and then ultimately into an infinite mind which is
the same as god mind universal mind we could call
it that as well so you're you're you're in a
sense when this is happening it feels very different than
just sitting and meditating peacefully when you're sitting and meditating
peacefully you're sort of stripping reality of all of the
human egoic projections like there's usually chairs and tables and
cats and dogs running around in trees and the sun
light is shining and that's all human projection but when
you are meditating you quiet down your mind and it
strips all of those things of those projections and labels
and categories and then you see like you might look
at a chair or a table and you might not
even recognize what it is you're looking at it you
see its color and its shape but like it doesn't
even appear to you as a chair or a table
per se because that's just a category you were projecting
upon it right and so um everything becomes sort of
meaningless valueless one thing is not better or more beautiful
than another thing this is sort of what happens and
you start to experience this sort of maybe expansiveness or
sense of spaciousness to your consciousness that's going downwards now
going upwards is difficult to communicate what that really feels
like and what that's really about separate from how people
portray perhaps it as the ego mind so what i'm
talking about here is not ego mind i'm talking about
supermind and infinite mind what is that because i think
a lot of people dismiss these higher minds as just
ego and what i'm telling you is that that's a
mistake so uh consciousness has the capacity for understanding that's
something it can inherently do now what exactly understanding is
is a very mysterious and difficult thing to articulate i
don't even know how to articulate it yet that's something
i've been working on for a couple of years now
is just articulating what consciousness is i mean what understanding
is so understanding is a capacity of consciousness we might
say and notice that understanding is different from knowledge it's
different from information it's different from memory it's different from
belief or ideology of any kind what i'm talking about
is that you try to connect with this in your
direct experience you have a capacity to understand at the
very least parts of reality if not the whole thing
for example you have the capacity to understand a door
whereas an animal might not be under not might not
be able to understand what a door is and how
it works like if you take a rat and you
show him a door he's not going to understand what
a door is but you as a human could and
at one point in your life you didn't understand what
doors were and then now you do understand and now
be careful here because i'm not just talking about egoic
projections onto the door of course we can say that
the the door that's a label that's an abstract category
that the ego projects on it and then what functions
the door has we could say well isn't that just
a goick you know isn't that part of survival that
we use doors and and for us they have a
certain function but really that function is not baked into
the door it's mostly just a projection yes of course
but i'm saying that still in an absolute sense you
can understand things in the world and that's not just
an illusion that's something your conscious can do it can
also misunderstand things so it's tricky course self-deception is rampant
and it's always operative if you're not careful so what
i want to suggest to you is that consciousness does
not merely have the ability to take different states from
high to low from all this sort of content to
a dmt experience if you're going very high you know
lots of visual content and dmt experience normally or you
can go very low and it's sort of like cessation
yes conscious can take all these states yes consciousness can
just be expansive again it can just sort of be
being it can just is but that's not all conscious
can do consciousness can grasp itself in a synthetic holistic
interconnected way so i want you to start to understand
or think about understanding as let's just for now let's
let's use this image of imagine a bunch of dots
and they're becoming more interconnected each dot is reaching out
to every other dot and drawing connections and lines between
them into this complex web and the more connections are
drawn between them the more the dots each dot if
you imagine they were like separate little islands and you
know we're building bridges between all these separate islands now
each dot you know the people who live on that
island they can travel across the bridge and they can
intermingle and they can start to understand each other they
can experience each other's cultures and whatever was happening on
that island right and so as this you know chain
of violence is getting all interconnected it's becoming unified in
a holistic manner where before it was all segregated and
you could say that it is understanding itself as it's
doing that to greater degrees as another example here imagine
that we have a coffee table and we put a
monopoly board on it and we lay it all out
all the pieces the money the the tokens the the
characters and the houses and little you know hotels you
can buy and all this stuff and so we set
up the entire monopoly board now if we get a
child like a three-year-old child to walk in to that
room and look at the board and let's say he's
not familiar with board games at all he's never seen
one in his life this is his first time he
looks at it and he doesn't know what he's looking
at what the hell is this thing it looks very
complicated it's got a bunch of pieces to it they're
arranged in a very deliberate order it's not just a
you know a random mess of stuff he he would
probably look at it he'd be very puzzled by what
this thing is maybe he would pick up the pieces
and move them around but he doesn't know how to
make sense of it he doesn't know what the game
it is about he doesn't even know yet that it's
a game he doesn't know where it came from who
invented it nothing unless we start to teach him about
that so in that sense we might say that's sort
of like what it looks like for a meditator when
he looks at the board with his mind shut off
he just sees it the way a child would see
it and that's good that's valuable but there's something else
that's possible which a lot of meditators overlook which is
that you can as an adult with you know benefit
of experience so forth you can actually look at that
board and you can actually become conscious and understand what
it's about why it exists as it exists in that
form why it was arranged that way now i'm not
saying your understanding at that point is absolute you don't
understand everything about the board but you understand some degree
like you understand it's a game you understand how the
pieces should move what the pieces are for why they
were designed this way right because the board has a
certain design to it a certain intention and a deliberate
purpose behind some of the ways that things move and
why the colors are the way they are the shapes
the properties the little hotels what they're for and so
on now we might say your understanding is still extremely
limited at that level but also notice what's happening is
that you are sort of interconnecting dots as you're developing
this understanding you're sort of grasping it holistically when you
look at it but it's it's very far from a
truly full understanding of it because like you probably don't
know who invented the board what factory it was manufactured
in what the uh you know what color dies were
used what brand of paint was used on the board
how it was printed what kind of printers were used
and where the wood came from for little houses or
the plastic that little pieces are made you don't know
where what kind of plastic it is so there's a
lot you don't know in fact there's like a million
times more that you don't know about the board than
that you do and you can keep getting very very
detailed about this but imagine that you were like this
monopoly board connoisseur and you just studied about boards about
this board and you traced literally like the entire chain
of causation for the where this board came from you
actually went to the factory and you talked to the
people who made that specific board that's in your house
and you you discovered their first and last names and
then you discovered the names of their children like you
went really deep on this right and you can see
it it's like the tentacles of this thing they just
keep sort of branching out into infinity because there's so
much complexity like imagine you you discovered the names of
the children of the guy who made the board and
then you actually went to you know the factory worker
i mean not the designer but the factory worker because
the designers long dead but the factory worker and then
you went to like his his his children's like school
recitals and you actually sat there and you learn about
their chil his children and you you develop a deep
relationship with the children and you you found out how
the lives of the children affected the parent who works
at this factory who created your board and you might
say well that's ridiculous what's the point of this well
imagine for a moment that all you cared about is
just pure understanding you wanted just to understand as much
as humanly possible or really even beyond humanly see the
problem is that your mind would run out of capacity
you literally wouldn't have enough memory to hold all of
the data and details and of course it would also
take up all of your time so that you you
couldn't even live a life anymore because your whole life
would just be devoted to tracking down all of these
different leads to understand your little monopoly board and this
just gets you to start to appreciate just how complex
even one little piece of reality is let alone the
entire planet or the entire solar system or galaxy or
something so anyways but if you did do this what
would happen is that you would develop a deeper and
deeper and richer understanding of the board more and more
of the dots would be interconnected and just imagine hypothetically
that if we cranked your consciousness up beyond superhuman levels
and we focused all of that on the board at
some point you would be able to have an infinite
understanding of the board you would know everything about the
board you would track down every lead and you would
be able to hold it all simultaneously in your consciousness
not as a human anymore but as something superhuman supermind
can you see that that might be a profound thing
just to understand a monopoly board infinitely that in itself
might be very profound it might change your life it
might change your attitude towards life certainly at the very
least to the board you might appreciate the board a
lot more if you had an infinite understanding of it
but that's just the board now imagine that we took
that and we didn't apply to a board or to
a cat or to a dog or to a human
or to a tree or to the planet but we
applied it to the entire universe all of existence reality
with a capital r and we started to crank up
that consciousness knob but with a focus on all of
reality the most inclusive focus the most expansive such that
there could not be a more expansive more inclusive focus
right so we're not limiting ourselves to any one feature
of reality or object of reality and we're being completely
unbiased here we're not we're not biasing our consciences towards
anything which we were doing in the case of the
monopoly board because after all why focus on the monopoly
board over your cat or your dog or a tree
or whatever else so anyways what i'm trying to communicate
is that if you do that what's happening is that
you're moving up this axis the y-axis to what i
would call god realization and then when you fully achieve
an infinite fully interconnected understanding of reality that is what
i'm calling god realization and that's the particular kind of
awakening or experience that i'm going to be you know
sharing with you today um my deepest one yet so
basically what's been happening with me over the last five
years or so is that as i was releasing more
and more of this content um it's not only something
i do for money you see this is also something
that helps my own mind interconnect a lot of dots
i release videos to release a video i have to
do research for it i have to contemplate it think
about it and even in the process of communicating it
live like right now i'm also you know i'm saying
things but i'm also sort of processing it at the
same time there's sort of a self-reflection going on and
then of course once i release it i also think
about how people react to it i read the comments
i take in the feedback i sort all the feedback
in my mind that makes me think even deeper um
one of the reasons i read so much feedback so
many comments and even post so many replies to comments
you might think that's just a waste of time isn't
that an egotistical thing you're only doing it for the
validation or something no actually the reason i do it
is because it helps my own thought process it helps
me to see how other people are viewing basically every
piece of feedback is like a perspective an extra perspective
i get on reality and on myself and i can
integrate more and more of those and it helps me
to interconnect more things in my mind and so i've
been i've been doing that for the last well really
since the beginning of of actualize.org and as i've been
having more and more awakenings over a hundred awakenings at
this point and sharing them and thinking about them and
contemplating them and questioning them and finding little errors in
here and little misconceptions i've made here and there and
how i interpreted things as i'm doing that i'm interconnecting
more and more stuff stuff is getting deeper for me
it's not that anything is really being contradicted you might
think like well leo this new awakening contradicts your old
one no it doesn't contradict it just it deepens it
it deepens it it reveals additional facets that perhaps weren't
emphasized in the previous one and it it interconnects previous
facets that perhaps were isolated fragments that it integrates them
together into a deeper and richer understanding of what's going
on and this understanding is not just an egoic thing
open your mind to such a possibility that it's not
ego that is doing this now it could be ego
but it could also not be ego and that's a
difficult distinction to make but we're going to try to
make it and also what i've been doing over the
last few years is i've been doing detox protocols to
detox my brain the physical brain from heavy metals and
other toxins and i've done quite a few rounds of
these detox protocols i'll share them with you in the
future i don't have time here to go into the
details of that but basically i've discovered these powerful detox
protocols that have significantly cleared up the sharpness of how
my mind works like it's very very significant is what
i'll tell you and it does actually affect one's baseline
level of consciousness it affects one's mood basically what happens
is that when you detox heavy metals from your brain
your mood improves your concentration improves your brain fog lifts
um you become more conscious as a baseline you become
more calm and stable your mind is not as agitated
and in monkey mind mode and also what's really powerful
is that due to this added clarity of mind um
it almost feels like a fog is lifted from from
your from your mind and um and also it significantly
improves one's psychedelic experiences it it purifies them it removes
because your mind is more stable it's almost like you
might imagine if you have a dirty brain and a
dirty mind in the sense that it's chaotic you're thinking
all sorts of fearful thoughts and anxious thoughts and you
can't focus for even five seconds and and you're just
jumping around you're lost in monkey mind if that's your
kind of mind and then you take a psychedelic that
mind gets amplified and all of those disturbances and impurities
create turbulence in the flow of consciousness so as you
you know imagine a sort of a laminar flow of
fluid through a sort of like a a wind turbine
or you know some of those sort of like fluid
simulations that physicists do to to look at you know
flow dynamics and turbulence yeah you've probably seen some of
those on youtube hopefully so yeah so imagine that like
you're running this experiment but that that flow represents your
mind and most people's minds are pretty turbulent but then
what happens when we crank up the volume and the
velocity of the flow the turbulence becomes chaotic and it
starts to completely you know it just turns into a
complete mess that's what psychedelics do to you when you
have a unstable mind if you have mental illness or
paranoia or whatever they will feed into that and make
it much worse and from here you can get your
really bad trips but imagine if you purified your mind
you really cleaned it out not only at the psychological
level you know you integrated your traumas you healed those
you've addressed certain fears and paranoia you have you set
those back you've let go of various kinds of attachments
for sex and for money and for food and and
for approval and so you've done a lot of this
kind of basic self-help work and you just have a
nice clean healthy human mind and also though you've worked
on it at the physical level of doing detox and
removing all the toxins that were slowing your mind down
and now your mind is really clear and now when
you take a psychedelic you've got this the rate is
increased everything is flowing and just flows beautifully and perfectly
there's no turbulence and so that's something that's been happening
to me over the last two years is that as
i've cleaned up my physical brain the experiences i've had
with psychedelics have taken on a whole new level of
clarity what you get is clarity and what you get
is understanding and interconnectedness and holism deeper and deeper levels
of that again i will share the detox protocols with
you in the future that requires a separate specific episode
it's a little bit technical so um this just the
reason i'm explaining all this is so you kind of
see where i'm coming from and why maybe the awakenings
are getting deeper so anyways how to explain this um
what happened to me was that i experienced a a
new level of god realization uh that was more holistic
than any other before and i mean i've had god
realizations in the past so that itself is nothing new
to me but uh i was just i was blown
away by just the the clarity and holism of this
specific god realization that i had i'll describe it to
you here in a moment but basically what happens is
that once that knob is cranked to a sort of
a high level there's a very distinct point in your
consciousness that is reached where you shift from human consciousness
into god realization which means that like right now you're
sitting here and you feel like a human you feel
like you have a past you have a future you
have parents you were born you're living on a planet
earth in a certain country in a certain city you
believe all these things and you think that that's reality
but then when the knob is cranked high enough what
happens is that your understanding of what this moment is
becomes so deeply interconnected with itself and you become conscious
of the entirety of your own mind the human mind
and how it works so basically what's happening is that
your consciousness sort of almost like it's like it's like
pulling back it's not a visual thing but it's sort
of like you're conscious able to pull back and go
so meta to be able to transcend everything occurring within
the human mind even things you thought were not part
of the human mind such as like most people don't
think that your birth is part of the human mind
they think that's a part of reality they don't think
that their parents are part of their human mind do
they think their parents are separate objects that are real
and that exists they think that their memories are not
just part of the human mind those are things that
actually happened they think that the planet earth is not
just a part of human mind it's something i'm sitting
on right now but that's because planet earth your parents
your cat your dog your memories the future of the
past the idea of your death all of these you're
not going sufficiently meta on you you don't actually you're
not able to transcend it with your own consciousness because
your consciousness is too limited it's in too limited of
a state you're stuck in a limited state but once
the state expands you can zoom out of all that
so to speak go meta on all of that and
then there it there's a very distinct threshold that consciousness
crosses where you look at the room and this present
moment and what your hands and your body at what
is happening here and you realize very distinctly aha this
is god what i'm referring to by god realization is
that threshold that is crossed it's a very distinct threshold
those of you who do psychedelics and have a lot
of experience with you might understand what i'm talking about
maybe you experienced it although it's not guaranteed that you've
experienced this a lot of people do psychedelics and they
never experience this for a variety of reasons they're doing
them wrong the dose is wrong they're not deconstructing their
mind enough whatever many different reasons they're too scared the
ego is still too attached see the problem is that
you do have to in order to reach this this
point you have to have a ridiculously already interconnected understanding
of reality you can't just come into this fresh like
a newbie with some sort of scientific materialist paradigm and
think that you're going to be able to cro cross
this boundary the cost of crossing this boundary is like
you have to really i mean you're going to be
losing your ego here you're going to be facing your
death here so if you're not comfortable with doing that
you're going to be resisting so see i've i've i've
had over 100 of these awakenings so by this point
i have no resistance to this whatsoever so for me
it's completely effortless but for the average person there's gonna
be a lot of effort and it wasn't effortless for
me from the beginning i went through a lot of
effort to reach this point right so this is a
this is years and years of work really a decade
of work to get to this point and it's not
just about the psychedelics it's even more so it's how
how deeply do you really want to want to understand
how much of your normal sober life do you devote
to actually thinking about these things and interconnecting the dots
because if you don't like if you spend your sober
life doing stupid [ __ ] not caring about anything
then you take a psychedelic well the psychedelic is just
gonna it's not gonna it's not gonna really make you
understand very much in fact it might make you more
confused and the problem is that these many of these
spiritual teachers and traditions they de-emphasize understanding in fact they
demonize it and they treat it as though it's the
ego mind and they tell you that stop understanding anything
just sit down shut up and just meditate or self-inquire
and they think that this is sufficient it's not sufficient
is what i'm telling you so anyways you cross this
distinct point of god realization but it doesn't stop there
that's just the beginning you've just entered god realization now
there are many degrees of god realization and really what's
characteristic about god realization is that you are you are
not don't get me wrong here this is very important
to distinguish you're not having a merely a mystical experience
you're not merely coming face to face with jesus or
with the buddha you're not experiencing angels or ufos or
dmt entities or some sort of mother ayahuasca spirit that
will show you something beautiful or important about your life
no all of that is horseshit what i'm talking about
here is the pinnacle of consciousness in the god realization
a true proper god realization is none of that stuff
it's completely you you take complete full ownership of yourself
as the creator of this experience there is no other
present that's what distinguishes this from and makes it higher
than any of those other lesser what i would call
lesser mystical or occult type of spiritual experiences those can
all be valuable experiences you know you might see like
if you take some ayahuasca you might see a serpent
snake appear before you and start talking to you and
telling you things about your life and how to be
more loving that's all good but that is not what
i'm talking about what i'm talking about is becoming so
conscious that you're too conscious for some snake to appear
before you you're too conscious for mother ayahuasca you're too
conscious for science you're too conscious for this idea that
oh well this is all just chemicals in the brain
you're even too conscious now for the idea that you
took a psychedelic at all you're too conscious you're so
conscious now that you take complete ownership of yourself as
the creator of reality this is extremely radical you're no
longer in a state of consciousness per se you are
literally god you're in full god mode and when you
move your hands you you are completely conscious of how
you are literally creating your hand and its motion with
your will and your infinite creative capacity and not just
your hands but this entire bubble of consciousness that you're
in you become fully conscious of the illusion of reality
you become fully conscious of the dream how you're constructing
the dream and why you're constructing the dream you become
conscious of how you imagined your parents and why you
imagined your parents you become conscious of how you imagined
your dog and why you imagined your dog you're able
to penetrate with consciousness into your own psyche and mind
in such a deep fashion that you're able to even
see through the imaginary nature of for example physical reality
or science atoms molecules these things you realize were just
imaginary specific instantiations of things you could have imagined otherwise
like you could have imagined for example that um instead
of your car being made up out of little atoms
that it was made up of cats and dogs little
little cats and dogs for example and so you kind
of zoom out and you start to understand the imaginary
nature of what you're doing to yourself and it's just
it's so ridiculously radical that we're just getting started explaining
how radical this is for example what happened with me
uh several things happened with me but one thing that
happened with me was i sort of i started to
zoom in onto this kind of notion of time when
it's time and of course i zoomed out so far
and went so meta on the notion of time that
of course my past and my future completely collapsed into
the present moment such that those things were just they
were so imaginary the idea of having been born as
a human or even having gone to school or even
having taken a psychedelic uh ever in my life all
of these things were just pure imagination they never happened
but i zoomed out even further from that and what
i saw is like the entire possibility space of everything
that could be imagined as time like normally we think
of time as flowing in one direction from past through
present to future and we think well that's how time
is right just a physical fact no it's not a
physical fact that's how you imagine it to be i
was able to imagine time flowing in opposite directions and
not just that but to see that time could be
multi-dimensional not just a single axis back and forth future
and past but imagine that there are multiple dimensions to
time orthogonal directions that humans ordinarily are not even conscious
of and then imagine millions of different timelines that could
be imagined you know you could imagine yourself having been
a human who was born in the roman times or
in ancient egypt or in during world war ii or
anything on on mars in the future you can imagine
all these different timelines of human lives so you become
conscious of all of that and that really what happened
was that you are pulling right now this present moment
that you're experiencing as a human in this particular timeline
that you are sort of living in that's just one
little thread out of an infinite ball of possible timelines
that you just selected for yourself to be here as
god you consciously selected this particular timeline but then you
zoom out of that even further and you realize that
time itself this entire ball of time of all the
possible timelines this is just pure fantasy it's pure imagination
and you just discard that entire ball and you're completely
free of time and even the idea that you were
ever constrained by time or that you're even living in
in a particular strand of of of that ball of
time and then you do the same thing with space
too you transcend space and then you do it with
your memories you realize that all of your memories were
just narratives and stories that you were concocting for yourself
in order to construct this illusion of a human life
and you you zoom out of memory and memory itself
is like this uh infinite fractal of all the possible
memories that could ever be had like imagine all the
memories that your brother has your sister has your mother
has your father has your friends have imagine all the
memories they could possibly have imagine having access to all
of their memories imagine having access to all the memories
of every human on the entire planet that has ever
lived and every creature that will ever exist in the
universe imagine the entire possibility space of all memories ever
that could ever be thought up by consciousness so you
access that also sort of like like a ball of
of yarn very giant complex ball of yarn and you
can pick memories out of there and you selected memories
from there to construct this particular memory complex that you
call yourself and then you discard that whole thing because
you realize the whole thing is just a figment of
god's imagination your imagination and so you transcend memory of
course you transcend physicality because all of science you realize
is just also every physical scientific law that you know
atoms molecules evolution all of this you also realize that
was also just a ball of scientific you know stories
that you could pull from you transcend that whole thing
when you do that you're no longer sitting on planet
earth planet earth disappears atoms and molecules disappear like fictions
like santa claus you realize that an atom is no
realer than santa claus or than a unicorn the earth
is no more real than a unicorn at this point
and um you transcend that and then you transcend a
people you realize that every person that you've ever interacted
with was just one little figment pulled from an infinite
possibility space of all people that could ever be imagined
of course this includes animals as well aliens it doesn't
matter what it is uh if you're thinking about you
know mother ayahuasca if you're thinking about the snake you
saw during some dmt trip if you if if you're
thinking about dmt entities all of those those are just
being pulled from another ball of you know mystical deities
you can you can pull from that ball all you
want there's an infinite number of deities you could imagine
ganesha vishnu shiva whatever it is your ideas of jesus
and buddha all of those you realize those were pure
pure fiction there's no such thing as a jesus or
a buddha pure fiction your guru your favorite guru who
taught you you know you've been you've been listening to
some guru for the last 10 years pure fiction there
never was a guru you just invented it you pulled
it from a ball of infinite gurus your parents your
friends your teachers everybody of course that includes me and
so that's very radical because you're very deep attachment to
people it's very shocking to realize how people are being
constructed so what i'm talking about here is really omniscience
you literally have the omniscience of god and your omniscience
is so high that you're completely conscious of how this
present experience whatever it is is being constructed by you
consciously so when you think of your mod of your
mother whereas before as a human when you think of
your mother it's like oh yeah that's my mom i'll
go you know i'll go meet with her on mother's
day i'll talk with her on the phone and you
know she's a real person she gave birth to me
that's like your normal human orientation to that fantasy but
in this omniscient mode that i'm talking about as soon
as the thought of your mother arises the memory of
your mother arises the the desire to speak to your
mother rises you're so freaking conscious and you've so transcended
this that you're completely conscious of how you're literally constructing
your mother from scratch and it's freaky because then you're
like well wait a minute but what about my real
mother i mean yeah i'm imagining my mother now but
what about the real one and then you realize oh
[ __ ] the real one that's just something i
imagined right now and you're like no no but but
the real mother that gave birth to me and then
you realize oh wait a minute someone giving birth to
me that's also something i'm imagining and you're like [
__ ] but then where did i come from and
then you you realize where did i come from that's
also something i'm imagining where and coming from these are
all [ __ ] imaginary so basically what happens is
that it's such a radical omniscience that you completely transcend
every single attachment of your mind that was grounding your
reality and by these attachments what i mean is that
your reality is anchored by things like memories ideas of
planet earth science religion your father your mother what you're
going to be doing tomorrow your boss the work you
have the career you have whether you're a male or
a female your dog's name your name all of these
things every single one of these anchors is seen to
be imaginary and when this happens literally your entire sense
of physical reality disappears past and future disappear so radically
that they can't even be imagined to exist anymore you're
so conscious you cannot fool yourself anymore at all you
are god consciousness and in this moment you realize what
reality really is what life is you realize that it's
nothing other than a trick that you're playing on yourself
this is the core you've finally broken through the spell
not by entering some emptiness state that buddhists talk about
no no this is much more radical than that here
you're so freaking conscious that you literally have infinite power
to construct any kind of reality you want and you
enter a mode of not just total omniscience but omnipotence
infinite power infinite will this means your will instantly materializes
into any physical object that you want that means that
if you want a billion dollars in your bank account
you can create it instantly just by thinking about it
now it's not as simple as you think though because
you see at this level of consciousness there is no
ego the ego is long gone the idea that you
even have a bank account is gone see you're thinking
you materialists and atheists and scientists who are who are
listening to this and trying to debunk me like oh
leo i got you now i got you now how
show us your bank account where's your billion dollars you're
full of [ __ ] you're being so stupid you
have to listen to what i'm saying because what i'm
saying is very nuanced it's extremely radical at the level
of consciousness that i'm talking about where you literally are
able to physically materialize anything you want the reason you're
able to do it is because you are so conscious
you understand that everything is imaginary that means that when
you're thinking of your bank account like right now as
a materialist as a debunker sitting there trying to debunk
me you are under the spell of believing that you
actually have a bank account you you genuinely believe that
you have a bank account a physical bank account that
exists somewhere in the universe on some computer server somewhere
and it and then it has a certain amount of
money in it already what i'm telling you is that
when you're infinitely conscious you're so conscious that you realize
that your bank account is imaginary you've been imagining your
bank account the entire time you've been imagining the amount
of dollars in your bank account down to the penny
the entire time in fact there is no time you're
imagining it right now so when you understand that you're
literally creating your bank account your bank didn't create your
bank account your bank is imaginary you imagined your bank
creating your bank account that's how you created the bank
account you said no leo i went to the bank
five years ago and i remember i was sitting in
the bank and i opened my bank account i signed
the documents and i put money in there i put
cash in there and now my money is there and
i got a little card you just imagined that that
didn't happen you just imagined that but you're not conscious
of it you're not conscious of what you're doing that's
the whole problem and this is how you're creating reality
you're getting stuck in it you're always imagining stuff and
then you're just buying into whatever you're imagining without questioning
it but in this omnipotent state of consciousness you're so
conscious that literally anything you want to construct you can
construct you can imagine any number of dollars in your
bank account you can imagine having sex with anyone you
want for as long as you want you can imagine
eating any kind of food you want as much of
it as you want without getting fat and without even
getting full you're literally now in heaven this is what
heaven is heaven is being so powerful that you can
literally construct your own personal paradise of pleasure and it
lasts for eternity whatever you want you can have there's
no limits whatsoever unconscious but there's a cost you might
say leo what's the catch what's the catch you don't
have a billion dollars what's the catch leo are you
saying that i could imagine a billion dollars and that
it would just i would imagine just for me or
it would also exist for other people too in the
sort of objective world leah which one are you saying
you don't mean it it affects the objective world do
you like i'm not actually going to be able to
go and like buy a yacht with this building now
this is just some imaginary it's just a vision it's
just a vision of money right again you're not realizing
how radical this is at this level of consciousness there
is no objective world there is no such thing as
consensus reality there is no such thing as other people
who will take your money or deny your money or
care about your money you are completely sovereign as god
so really it's up to you if you imagine that
other people can see the money in your bank account
then they can and if you imagine that it's only
for you like a private hallucination for you because you're
on a psychedelic you can and by the way by
this point you've completely transcended the idea of psychedelics there
are no psychedelics they never existed they were purely imaginary
psychedelics were just something you invented in order to trick
yourself into thinking that you weren't infinitely conscious and infinitely
powerful so it's it's the it's the ultimate strange loop
here's the cost and here's i i came up with
a little analogy to help you materialists and atheists and
rationalists and debunkers make sense of of why there's this
important trade-off and why it's not so easy as just
imagining a billion dollars in your bank account because look
when you're that conscious and you're able to construct whatever
you want for yourself it's an infinite fantasy the problem
though is that if you have no limits whatsoever upon
what you can materialize and create then it loses all
meaning and purpose and value that's the trade-off and this
trade-off is absolutely unavoidable what you don't recognize as a
materialist is that you're so used to living under the
constraints of human life that you've just taken all these
constraints for granted you've taken for granted that for example
you can't imagine a million dollars in your bank account
and just appears tomorrow you've taken for granted that it
can't happen that doesn't mean there's anything physical or scientific
preventing it from happening all it means is that you're
just you're literally constructing that and that's the kind of
life you're living why you might say leo but why
why would i construct this shitty limited reality where i
can't imagine all the sex i want all the food
i want why does the food make me fat why
do why do why are there car crashes why little
babies starve and all sorts of things like this and
now you finally understand once you enter this level of
omnipotence you understand what you understand is think of it
like this look i used to be a video game
designer uh 10 years ago or so even [Music] further
in the past i would um you know i would
sit there in a video game editor and just like
edit games i would i made mods for oblivion for
elder scrolls um that's kind of where i started but
anyways in when you're designing a game in in the
game editor you're like it's the level editor you're setting
up the game you're placing where the loot is where
the objects are where the buildings are and where the
characters are you're placing all this but then there's and
then you could enter the game you can play it
you can place the stuff when you're placing stuff you
can play stuff anywhere you can place objects you can
give infinite amount of you know npcs however much power
you you can like just increase their power you can
increase their damage you can decrease their health whatever you
want you can make a male female you can change
their face anything you're in god mode as a designer
then when you enter the game you know you plus
run you press the run button you enter the game
now you're playing now you're constrained by all the rules
of the game you can't jump too high you can't
run too fast you have limited health limited lives limited
weapons limited attack powers you're vulnerable you can die you
can't walk through walls you can't walk through the earth
and so forth and you might say well but that
sucks why why do the designers do it this way
why doesn't someone give me a game where i have
infinite power i'm not tired of of all these [
__ ] limited games where i can't walk through walls
i have to stay on the earth i can't jump
infinitely high i can't have infinite money and all these
sorts of things and see it might seem like that's
what you want but that's not what you really want
because if you got that there would be no more
game it would lose all meaning for you the point
of the game is the challenge that's what makes the
game hard it's the limits what a game is is
a set of artificially self-imposed limits that you place on
yourself for the purposes of seeing how you tackle those
limits and obstacles in interesting ways in dramatic ways in
entertaining ways and then you have fun and you get
immersed in that because if you literally are in full
god mode and there actually was in oblivion in the
elder scrolls editor there actually is a console command called
god mode on or something along those lines where you
literally put yourself into god mode and allows you to
have infinite health infinite ammo infinite weapon damage you can
walk through walls you can fly around you're not affected
by gravity you can do anything it's like a debug
mode it's very helpful when you're trying to build your
levels and you know when you're building them you get
stuck in the walls and things like that so it's
very helpful for a designer to have this god mode
i think most game editors have a god mode um
but the problem is that you don't actually you can't
enjoy the game from god vote the god mode is
for building the game to enjoy the game you got
to disable the god mode well consider the possibility that
the universe itself reality itself has a god mode in
this god mode you can literally design entire [ __
] planets from scratch using your will and they instantly
magically appear because there's absolutely no limits of consciousness that's
what you realize in this god mode and if you
want you can create an entire planet from scratch down
to the to the atomic level and it costs you
nothing it costs you no money no energy no resources
nothing it costs you nothing it's free completely free what's
the problem the problem is that it's completely meaningless and
pointless see you as a human are sitting here and
thinking like no oh my god leo that would be
so amazing if what you're saying is true it would
be so amazing it's so amazing from your point of
view because you're so stuck in limited reality so for
you as a human imagining that you can just dream
up a planet it appears or dream up some sexy
model to to have sex with and she appears before
you for you that seems like a dream come true
but just really think about it very realistically and practically
we're not in fairy tale land here we're actually being
very practical if you could just dream up women to
have sex with and new planets how quickly would you
lose interest in life would there be any value see
what you don't realize is that the only reason you
value sex so much is because you get so little
of it and it's so hard to get and the
more of it you get the less you value it
those of you who've been in pickup and have had
a lot of sex during parts of your life you
can you know what i'm talking about but even those
of you who have not been in pickup let's say
you just find you know a girl or a boy
that you really um fall in love with and then
you know for that honeymoon period you're having sex all
the time you're having sex every day maybe twice a
day and you do that for a week after a
week of sex twice a day you're exhausted you're sick
of it you're bored of it you don't even want
it anymore you just want to go play some video
games now why because the value of things is their
rarity the more common a thing is in your life
the less you value it and if it's so common
that it's ever present you just completely ignore it and
stop even caring about it for example oxygen how much
time you spend thinking about oxygen you need oxygen to
breathe oxygen is like the most basic of survival needs
well actually without oxygen you'll be dead in five minutes
do you think about it do you care about it
no because you just assume that it's here it's constant
it's ever present would you pay a thousand dollars for
oxygen no of course not why if someone tried to
charge you a thousand dollars of oxygen you would think
they're ripping you off why only because it's everywhere but
if you were stuck on mars or on the moon
you might pay a thousand dollars for oxygen you see
so have you ever like if you're a serious gamer
have you ever been looking forward to a great game
that comes out the game comes out and then maybe
your friend comes to you and says oh look i
got the cheat codes for this game let's let's play
this game and let's just give ourselves infinite lives infinite
continues infinite health infinite power and you look at him
and you're like what's wrong with you this is a
game i want to enjoy i've been waiting for this
game for the last year this is a great you
know rpg i'm going to immerse myself this kind of
aaa rpg comes out maybe once every five years so
like i really want to play this thing in fact
i'm going to set it on hard difficulty i don't
want to play this on easy easy is for idiots
i want to play it on hard i don't want
any cheat codes that's going to spoil my experience if
you're a serious gamer this is how you play your
games you want your games hard not easy you don't
want to be hand held through the game that defeats
the entire purpose of the game and maybe sometimes you
know actually games have been so dumbed down today compared
to how they used to be in the past they
used to be much more hardcore you know today they
even have modes and games that are like it's called
like a journalist mode it's it's like it's so easy
that you can't even die it's just designed for journalists
to literally just like walk through the game like an
amusement park and just look around for the purposes of
writing an article about it or something does that give
the journalist a true experience of the game no because
for a true gamer the point of the game is
the challenge of the game and this journalist mode if
you're a hardcore gamer you look down upon this journalist
mode you think that's that's [ __ ] stupid that's
how it works how about a game like dark souls
some of you guys play this like one of the
most difficult games it's known for the brutality of how
difficult it is it's deliberately designed to be unfair and
[ __ ] difficult to the point of wanting to
tear your hair out um people love this game precisely
because it's so difficult imagine if you're a dark souls
fan imagine this imagine if you enter dark souls the
next dark souls that you're looking forward to coming out
imagine you enter dark souls and you have infinite health
you have infinite lives if you walk off a cliff
nothing happens to you you can travel anywhere you can
go to the end of the game immediately you can
go to the final boss right now and all you
have to do is you just have to look at
him and he's dead what's the point of that [
__ ] game there's no point the beauty of a
game when it's really well designed and this is very
difficult to do such games are rare is to have
the perfect balance between your abilities and all the obstacles
and limitations in the game that's the duality of the
game that's what creates the drama the fun the excitement
the ups the downs if it's too difficult if it's
so unfair that it's just ridiculous you get frustrated you
quit if it's too easy you get bored and you
quit it has to be right in the middle the
sweet spot that's the perfect game well likewise for life
and so what you finally become conscious of in this
god mode is you realize that even though right now
in this mode you're in you're in heaven you can
literally imagine and do anything you want and as this
is happening to you you realize that you don't even
need any of those material things see this is another
problem is that humans have this material attachment you think
that oh leo if i just got a bunch of
money and i just got a bunch of sex that
would make me so happy i would just if i
had those powers i would be god and i would
just keep you know giving myself blow jobs for the
rest of my life but what you don't realize is
that all of that is a puny form of pleasure
compared to the metaphysical infinite love that you will break
through to in this god mode because of course as
you'll realize god is love and so you don't even
want the sex and the money and the fame [Music]
and the yacht and the fast car and all of
this [ __ ] because what you have is you
literally have unlimited consciousness unlimited power and you're in heaven
forever it's purely formless and it's purely metaphysical it's not
a physical heaven it's not like the christians imagine where
you you go into the in the clouds they feed
you grapes and suck your dick every day and you
know wave at you with a palm frond to keep
you cool these are shallow material petty forms of of
heaven true heaven is absolutely formless infinite metaphysical love forever
that's real heaven this love is so deep it breaks
your heart this love is so deep it makes your
entire body convulse and writhe on the floor in agony
and ecstasy as you're being pummeled by this infinite love
it's like falling into an ocean of infinite love that's
bottomless and endless and the deeper you go the more
ecstatic and and blissful it gets until the bliss becomes
so high that it it literally turns into pain it
pains you how how good it is you can't believe
how good it is and no matter how good you
think it is it gets better and it gets better
and just keeps infinitely getting better forever because why not
there's no limits see when you realize that consciousness has
no limits literally that means you can imagine a heaven
that keeps going and going and going forever and getting
better and better and better and better forever for eternity
but what's the cost what's the trade-off the trade-off is
that there's nothing to do there there's no struggle there's
no drama there's no limits there's not even form because
you don't need form all forms are limited any form
you imagine is going to be a limited version of
heaven if your version of heaven is having sex with
a supermodel or a million supermodels you're stupid because you
don't realize that if you were just pure infinite love
without any supermodels you would be happier the supermodels are
just a substitution and a lack of understanding of what
true love is true love is unlimited if you limit
your love to just supermodels you have an inferior form
of love and you have a lesser heaven so because
you're so conscious you you select the highest heaven you
don't settle for any lower heavens you select the highest
one and in this highest one nothing happens it's just
literally pure a singularity of pure orgasmic bliss and love
forever so what there's nothing to do there and then
you realize why you have this limited life in the
first place you were in that heaven for eternity and
then you got bored with it and you just wanted
to entertain yourself and to experience a limited version of
yourself and so what you did is that you literally
took away your own power imagined yourself to be powerless
little baby that was born on a planet somewhere in
the solar system in the universe with people around you
who have problems who are dysfunctional with a lack of
money with a lack of sex and all these things
because really what you're doing is you're constructing a cosmic
drama see the materialists think that reality is a mechanical
machine like a clockwork i want you to start to
think of reality as a dramatic play that god is
playing with itself that consciousness is playing with itself imagine
if you were all powerful imagine if you could create
anything in in the universe including the universe itself imagine
that you can structure the universe however you want you
can impose any limits you want how would you structure
the universe but think about this very carefully be careful
how you structure it because you might structure it in
a bad way you might say well leo if i
had that power i would i would never have babies
in africa starving i would not have aids exist i
would remove capitalism and uh and murderers and i would
not allow hitler to be born and all these sorts
of things but you have to understand this is this
is a stupid thinking from your little human vantage point
your mind has been so corrupted by all of the
suffering you've gone through that now your that suffering is
corrupting how you actually want to structure reality you want
to structure reality in a way that makes you comfortable
as a human but that's stupid if you were infinitely
powerful the way you would structure reality is that you
would actually place intelligent limits in such a way that
there would be a perfect balance between your capacities limited
capacities as a creature who incarnates into it and the
limitations and obstacles that exist such that there would be
such a perfect balance that you're always on edge it's
always dramatic it's always interesting and fun stuff is happening
and the stakes are real it's not just a fantasy
in the sense that it's like anything goes you could
walk through a wall that's not fun that's not dramatic
you feed off the drama of life is what i
want you to understand and you would say oh leo
i would get rid of pain well then you're stupid
because if you got rid of pain there's actually a
disorder this is a real disorder that people are born
with it's a rare genetic disorder that people are born
with an abnormality in the you know in their wiring
that they can't feel pain these people usually die by
the age of 15 or 20. why because they cut
off their finger and they don't feel it and you
would say well leo that's that's horrible if i didn't
experience pain i wouldn't cut off my fingers but you
only say that because of all the lessons of pain
you got you learn those lessons and now you you
won't do it but if you never had pain to
begin with and you cut off your finger how would
you even know that's a bad thing the only reason
you know that cutting off your finger is a bad
thing is because of the pain that you imagine you'll
feel pain is literally what you use to know what
is bad that is the definition of bad if you
had no pain bad would not exist i want you
to understand that um but anyways so you realize that
you're putting all of these limits in place upon yourself
to construct an interesting life and i know that's going
to be difficult for for many of you to believe
for some of you who've lived a very difficult life
with so much trauma and pain and abuse i know
that what i'm saying to you now is going to
sound preposterous you might say leo maybe you've lived a
good life and therefore you can believe this kind of
nonsense but you know i've lived a very hard difficult
life i've experienced death and suicide in my family and
drug addiction and suffering and depression like you wouldn't imagine
and i will never believe you'll never get me to
believe that um that god would imagine such a thing
for me or that i would construct this sort of
thing for myself i understand where you're coming from but
recognize that that's bias you're not actually being truthful there
all you're doing when you say that to me as
an argument is that you're saying i've experienced so much
suffering and pain that um i would never wish this
thing upon myself but suffering and pain have nothing to
do with truth or with consciousness yeah suffering and pain
don't feel very good but that's just part of the
illusion it's just part of the illusion and um you
can awaken awaken from that it'll probably be difficult for
you the more trauma you've had the more difficult this
will be for you precisely because you're in denial about
it see are you really willing to accept that all
of the trauma that you carry all of the hatred
and anger all the bitterness all of the bad memories
that all of these are just pure fantasy are you
willing to admit that no of course not you carry
you attach to your pain and you carry that with
you you have a chip on your shoulder you have
an axe to grind you have people to hate you
have people to judge and you're not willing to surrender
these things and also it would like it would make
you look like a total fool when you realize that
all the people who hurt you are just a fiction
of your own mind when you realize that you're gonna
feel like such a [ __ ] idiot so finally
what you realize when you interconnect all the dots is
you realize how and why god is constructing this reality
this life this limited human existence it's it's the ultimate
trick it's an infinite trick that you are playing on
yourself you literally need to fool yourself so thoroughly with
science with religion with your birth with memories with fear
of death with pain you have to fool yourself so
totally that you can't even remember that you were ever
god and the reason it has to be this way
is because it's precisely because you are god see if
you are infinitely conscious just think about this think about
the problem that god has here's god's design problem is
that god is infinitely conscious of everything at all times
forever so if you have that power how can you
ever surprise yourself how can you ever experience yourself as
anything less than that you can't you're stuck so god's
design challenge is to take all of its infinite power
and intelligence and to put it towards its own self-deception
god literally has to put itself asleep but the trick
is that notice how difficult it is to put god
to sleep what it takes you can't god can't put
himself to sleep with a sort of a matrix simulation
because it won't be convincing enough the illusion literally has
to be infinitely intelligent to be able to trick god
into believing in it so this is the paradox of
omnipotence and the paradox of it infinite consciousness and the
paradox of infinity is that here's a question for you
if god is infinitely powerful does god have the power
to take its own power away from itself that's the
strange loop paradox of this situation see if you say
no god is not powerful enough to take away his
own power and to deceive himself then you come into
an absurdity because then that means god is not all
powerful that means god is not infinite but if you
recognize that god is infinite then you have to also
recognize that if god is infinite that means god must
even have the power to make itself finite that's the
closing of the strange loop and so that's exactly what
happens is the reason you're finite and limited is precisely
because you're unlimited and infinite and that's the collapse and
the reconciliation of that duality that set of duality and
so what happens is you you basically can't stay in
this god mode forever you wouldn't want to anyways it's
not as fun as you think it is i mean
yeah there's a lot of love there it feels great
but it's not really it's not really sort of the
human fun that you're used to and so what happens
is that you fall back your consciousness lowers back down
your state goes back to basically what it was when
you were an ordinary human and then you're back you're
back in the normal world so to speak and you've
got all these limits and you might say well leo
then what's the point it was just a hallucination no
you calling it a hallucination is the trick that you
play on yourself to keep yourself limited so life consists
of really only two things life consists of a bunch
of stuff that is designed with infinite intelligence to put
you to sleep and it consists of a bunch of
other stuff which are clues and breadcrumbs that you left
behind for yourself to help you to reawaken what you
become conscious of is that all of the people in
your life all of the games you've been playing all
the money chasing all the sex you've been having all
the drugs you've been doing all this sort of stuff
that all of these things are nothing other than they're
not just random things they were deliberately designed by yourself
in order to make you fall asleep to buy into
the illusion and then to leave that breadcrumb trail so
you can break free and sometimes these objects and people
are simultaneously both for example the function that i might
serve in your life is that i might be helping
you to fall asleep and to buy into the illusion
deeper how so well you listen to me and then
maybe you start thinking i'm a cult leader and you
start hating me and you start hate watching my content
and you start telling yourself how stupid leo is and
how all this stuff he talks about is just lunacy
and idiocy and he's lost his mind and you keep
doing that and in that sense you're you're developing you're
you're you're taking your illusion and you're drawing yourself deeper
and deeper and mesmerizing yourself into it and this strengthens
your sense of physical reality or conversely you could listen
to me and you can maybe intuit that what i'm
saying is correct in some way and you can start
doing the work and start discovering these things for yourself
doing the practices and then you could actually see use
my words as breadcrumbs to help yourself to awaken it's
both depending on how you take it and so it
is with with everyone in your life and everything in
your life something bad happens to you you can take
it as a as something that will push you more
to sleep or it'll awaken you for example someone dies
in your family how are you going to respond to
that well you can start freaking out over it and
get depressed over it and become bitter and angry over
this for the rest of your life that puts you
deeper to sleep you get drawn deeper into your ego
into all of your fears and hatreds or you could
you can grieve for that person you can heal your
wounds over that the death of that person you can
get over it and you can use that to make
you stronger to make you more loving to make you
more forgiving of yourself and them and and the the
conflicts you've had together and it can make you better
in your future relationships it can make me you are
more compassionate empathetic person in the future it can make
me you rethink the way that you didn't treat people
as good as you wanted to and that in the
future you're going to treat people better right and eventually
even it could lead you to start to think about
what is death why am i afraid of death is
death even a bad thing and then you think about
that and then eventually you could awaken if you go
down that road you could also kill yourself i don't
recommend that one i recommend awakening instead of suicide um
so so you see and that it's that way for
everything that's happening in your life but it takes a
very deep consciousness and a wisdom and intelligence to see
that because normally you're just kind of sleepwalking through life
and stuff is happening to you and you just think
it's just material stuff like someone crashed into me my
dog died yesterday and you know they ran out of
food at the grocery store and all these problems that
i'm dealing with i got to answer an email i
got to do this gotta do that well like yeah
this this this all sucks you in that's what reality
is it's an illusion but it's an illusion that is
virtually indistinguishable from reality because there's nothing else to compare
it to there's no alternative there's only the illusion when
all you have is illusion the illusion is reality but
the illusion is flexible is fluid you can break the
illusion if you want to just how much do you
want to are you sure you want to do you
understand what will happen if you break the illusion you
might think oh that's so great yeah i want to
break the illusion are you sure you want to break
it what you'll realize if you completely break it is
that actually you want it back it's just like life
you don't realize the value of what you have until
you lose it sometimes in life you spend years and
years trying to move away from something and then finally
you do and you realize [ __ ] i want
it back i didn't realize how how important it was
to me like maybe maybe you're a teenager and you're
living with your parents and it's a struggle you don't
get along with them and all you can do is
you just you can't wait to turn 21 or 18
or just move out you're just dreaming of of the
day that happens and then it happens and on the
day it happens like let's say you you're 21 and
you finally move out get your own job get your
own place and then finally you're sitting there all alone
in your new condo with your new fancy job and
your new fancy car and you're sitting there and there's
nothing to do and you're bored and you get sad
and you get depressed and you start thinking about oh
but you know when i was a kid with my
parents you know during christmas time we would have a
party and share food and share stories and have laughs
and and that was so beautiful and now here i
am all alone sitting in my condo late at night
with my fast car with my great job with a
bunch of money bank account and i'm more miserable than
i was when i had no money no fast car
no separate house my parents were nagging me sometimes and
so forth but at least i had the love and
the connection from my family and maybe now you start
to fantasize about [ __ ] how do i move
back with my to my family that's how it is
at the cosmic scale so when you get all the
consciousness in the world you realize what's it good for
it's boring you want drama you want action you want
material form you want entertainment and so boom here you
are incarnated as a human imagining a past imagining a
future imagining in all directions see what's happening with your
life your life is not something that was born one
day and then started to unroll that never happened you're
just imagining that what's really happening is that you've existed
forever right here this this this emptiness right here this
consciousness pure awareness has existed forever for eternity and then
what it has done to fool itself is it starting
to imagine time space birth death mom dad friend teacher
colleague business money sex i want this i want that
i'm gonna have this in the future i'm gonna have
that in the future this happened to me back then
i went to school back then and you're imagining in
all directions the same with science you're saying all science
there's human history there's charles darwin there's rene descartes there's
leibniz there's newton there's gravity there's atoms and molecules and
all these things there's microscopes you can prove all this
if leo is all provable yeah you're imagining this all
around the present moment see you say no leo but
i read it i read a i read a science
book about the nature of the universe from stephen hawking
no you didn't you just imagined it no leo i
really did i really really did i can remember it
yeah you just imagined that but no leo i went
to school and my teachers taught me a bunch of
science yeah you just imagined that you never went to
school you were never even born no leo you're crazy
that's impossible yeah you just imagine that it's crazy and
impossible no but leo but but leo what about you
aren't you real i mean after all leo why would
you be teaching me this if you weren't real you
must at least you must be real you're my guru
you're gonna help me understand these things no you just
imagined that but leo surely leo i'm experiencing this here
and you're experiencing your own bubble of consciousness right surely
otherwise why would you be teaching me why would you
be talking to this camera you don't get it you
don't get it it's just you i'm you i'm you
talking to you i will keep talking to you until
you realize that you're me and that i'm you i
don't have my own consciousness i'm you i'm a fragment
of your consciousness you imagine that i have my own
consciousness for the purpose of fooling yourself into thinking that
you're not alone that you're not god no leo that's
ridiculous i'm not doing that leo that's solipsism that's what
you're imagining leo no i'm not there you go again
you see since you're god you have an infinite capacity
to deny what you're doing and in fact that's your
prerogative and imperative because that's how you've constructed your reality
you can't have a reality unless you're denying these things
when are you gonna recognize that when is this gonna
click in your mind everything you're doing is constructing what
you would call your life from the physical level upwards
you don't really want to realize what i'm telling you
is what i'm telling you because it's going to be
hard to accept you're going to have to face nihilism
you're gonna have to face loss you're gonna have to
face surrendering attachments you're gonna have to face the fact
that you've been fooling yourself you're gonna have to face
that i don't exist you're gonna have to face it
you're all alone you're gonna have to face that you're
constructing everything you have to face that science is an
illusion you have to face that all of your religious
gurus and spiritual teachers are illusions you're going to have
to face that you are constructing everything anything you think
you're not constructing whatever that is bring it to mind
right now notice that you're constructing it everything as god
you have absolute consciousness what you are experiencing and seeing
right now is the entire universe it's all that exists
there's nothing more whether you think i'm real or not
is up to you if you imagine that i'm real
then i am because you imagine it if you imagine
that i'm not that i'm not because that's what you're
imagining there's nothing wrong with imagining stuff either you can
interact with me as though i'm imaginary that's how you
have been interacting with me for what you call your
whole life now you say leo if this was true
then you wouldn't be sitting here talking to me because
who are you talking to i'm talking to myself i'm
talking to you but you are me and i am
you i understand that but you don't understand that yet
but leo if you're doing it for me that means
that must me that must mean that you have your
own you know world going on and i must have
my own world going on otherwise you wouldn't be doing
this well how would you do this why would you
invest so much time creating these videos for nobody that's
insane but think of it this way what else am
i supposed to do i've got infinite power infinite time
you have a better thing to do what what what's
more worthwhile to do i'm bored i gotta entertain myself
i've existed for eternity what do you want me to
do you want me like a dance little dance a
little jig for you sing a song for you like
what do you want you want me to shower you
with money and sex like what what do you expect
me to do do you think i should be out
there chasing money and sex myself and a bunch of
other stupid [ __ ] why i would only be
chasing those things if i was [ __ ] delusional
there's nothing else to do the only thing there is
to do in the universe is to well i mean
actually there is the only thing there is to do
in the universe is to fool yourself into falling asleep
and then to help yourself to reawaken that's all there
is to do there's nothing else so i mean by
all means if you want to go chase sex and
money and all these things and i mean i i
chased some of that myself both in the past then
still to some degree but like um it's just recognized
it's just entertainment you're just entertaining yourself in various ways
and if you ever become to be uh you ever
desire to become like an enlightened teacher or something and
you wonder why do it uh the answer is there's
no reason there's zero reason to do it because once
your god realized that's it it's done there's no more
there's nobody else to awaken the idea there are other
people who need to be awoken or who need your
help this is one of the deepest fantasies that you
have which keeps you from realizing yourself as god in
fact i think that a lot of spiritual teachers neo-inviting
teachers buddhist teachers and so forth meditation teachers you know
this whole body saatva vow that these buddhists take to
sort of withhold their own awakening until everybody else is
awoken or to help reduce the suffering of all the
you know creatures on in the universe devote their life
to that this is all just a fantasy they're cosplaying
they're cosplaying they don't realize that they're god and they
don't realize that there's nobody to save nobody to help
there's just them they are basically they have some degree
of awakening but not a very high degree they're not
god realized and um they don't understand how they're constructing
reality they couldn't tell you if you asked them they
would just uh you know tell you to shut your
mind off and uh and and therefore they're still playing
games they're playing spiritual games mystical games new agers are
part of this group they're all playing mystical games they're
not god realized because if you truly were god realized
this is one of the most this is one of
the most painful and most difficult things i've had to
integrate through all of my awakenings you know there's been
painful stuff to integrate but one of the most painful
ones i'll tell you what what i think it is
for most people it'll be other people this solipsism thing
that you can't get over this will be one of
the most biggest obstacles still phase um and one of
the most painful things for me to integrate was the
idea that there's nobody for me to help to teach
or to awaken this whole thing that i've constructed with
actualize.org to help others to awaken really what it was
it was it was just a trick that i played
on myself to draw myself deeper into the illusion of
life it was a way that i was keeping myself
asleep [ __ ] twisted as [ __ ] it's
it's it's ingeniously [ __ ] self-deceptive i mean it's
a it's an illusion of absolute genius it's an infinite
illusion everything you think is there to help you awaken
is actually a trick to help you to fall asleep
this is why so few people awaken and really even
fewer reach god realization it's just so ridiculously self-deceptive even
when you think you found the best guru in the
world to guide you and even when you think you've
read all the best books in the world and even
when you think you've done your meditation and even when
you think you've attained cessation and nirvana you're still fooling
yourself you're not god realized and you might say oh
leo but this is just this is pure egotism now
pure egotism you're trying to place yourself on a pedestal
above all the other gurus and this and that i
could be doing that that's not what i'm doing the
reason i'm making these distinctions and talking about these things
is because originally when i came into this work i
bought into certain illusions that most spiritual people buy into
when they start to awaken i bought into certain illusions
such as that all pads lead to the same destination
all the spiritual teachers are talking about the same thing
nobody's better than anybody else if you call yourself enlightened
that means you're a narcissist and an ego um nothing
this is the ultimate goal buddhism is the highest spiritual
tradition it's the purest it's the least corrupt the the
ultimate attainment is no mind shut off the mind i've
succumbed to all those self-deceptions and then the more awakenings
i had the more i started to realize how wrong
all that was and just how much i underappreciated the
trickiness and the level of the depth of self-deception that's
going on and of course it had to be that
way in order to maintain my sense of reality you
see because if the if the self-deception was easy to
unravel then everybody would have their realities unravel and by
everybody i mean you because there's nobody but you so
see by definition for you to be a human you
have to be completely self-deceived otherwise you literally could not
be a human and that explains why all the humans
in the world practically are just batshit self-deceived also the
self-deception being so strong and so deep is actually what
makes it so beautiful and so enjoyable to crack again
it's just like playing with a video game see if
the deception was weak if there was only a few
layers to the deception if all you had to do
to break the deception of of reality was to meditate
like a buddhist and to follow the buddhist dogma or
to do some neo-advaita self-inquiry go to a few workshops
and then you're done if that's all you had to
do it would be lame it wouldn't be interesting what
makes it interesting is that there's a layer upon layer
upon layer of deception such that even when you think
you've finally broken out of all the deception and finally
you're on the right path that itself is now the
deception and only when you crack all of that do
you really experience the full satisfaction of understanding what you
are as god that's what makes it so satisfying is
it's like playing dark souls and defeating the most difficult
boss by avoiding every single obstacle every single move he
makes every like the more harder he is and you
just dodge and dodge and dodge and dodge and hit
and and you're just you're perfect with your timing and
your dodgers and your jumping jumps and your swings and
you just get everything perfect and then you defeat that
boss and it's just like you're in heaven you're in
heaven because you've mastered the game and that's what it
takes to reach god realization that you have to you
have to completely understand how the illusion is constructed from
scratch nothing can fool you anymore and as long as
something can fool you then you're going to be shy
of that god realization now you say but leo isn't
love also just an illusion no love is what remains
after you realize that everything is an illusion love is
infinitely meta and love is not a form if you
think love is a form or a feeling or a
sensation you have not reached the realization of metaphysical infinite
love or god for that matter because god is love
deeper you go into yourself and into god you will
discover just deeper love and so anyways to me this
is the difference between moving upwards in your spiritual journey
versus moving downwards now when you're moving upwards you have
to be careful because there's going to be offshoots right
i talked about the straight up direction there's tangents and
offshoots and branches as you're moving upwards these can go
into the occult these can go into the mystical realms
these can go into sort of the ayahuasca territory these
can go into the spirits realms they can go into
astral projection and this source of weird stuff it can
go into lucid dreaming it can go and veer off
into magical chasing after magical powers it can veer off
into some sort of vision of jesus who then you
take on as your lord and savior or it can
veer off into the direction of dmt entities where you
smoke a bunch of dmt experience some alien whatever and
then you start to pray to this alien worship this
alien this alien starts to channel material to you and
insights and all those things are valid in their own
limited way but they are not god realization because all
those things introduce subtle elements of otherness that dmt alien
you still think he's other than you and you still
kind of hold him as being this being who's above
you and you are like a human below him and
you have this kind of relationship or mother ayahuasca you
think she's above you she's more intelligent than you she's
she's giving you wisdom you don't deserve the wisdom you're
grateful like this whole dynamic this is a dualistic dynamic
so what i'm talking about with god realization is i'm
actually not talking about non-duality anymore i'm talking about going
deeper than nonduality now a lot of people will disagree
with me about this and say that's not possible that's
delusional leo you're narcissistic and all this sort of stuff
you're free to think that but also recognize that maybe
you're deceiving yourself after all how can you know that
what i'm saying is false unless you've tried to seriously
verify it for yourself and that's what i'm suggesting i'm
not suggesting you believe me i'm suggesting you just have
an open mind and experiment and question question all the
dogmas of advaita of vedanta of neo and vida of
eccartole of rupert spira all this stuff quite a question
at all try out both directions try hitting cessation try
realizing no self try realizing nothingness and then i mean
you'll still have plenty of time left you can also
move upwards and try this other thing that i'm talking
about god realization uh again people misunderstand me here and
then that they think that i'm trying to somehow narcissistically
egotistically put myself above other teachers that's not what i
care about what i care about and the reason i'm
talking about this stuff in such detail is because i
feel like i've reached very high levels of god realization
that i don't feel are sufficiently or properly discussed and
students are not properly guided to this and what i
know what i've concluded for myself after a lot of
deep contemplation and and careful analysis is that unless i
communicate what i just communicated virtually nobody will reach god
realization it just won't happen you can say oh leo
but but meditation i can do it through meditation and
this that why are you being why are you being
you know such a dick why are you being so
negative about meditation and self-inquiry and all these things aren't
you just like limiting us uh well what i've realized
through a lot of experimentation and a lot of experience
talking to spiritual people you see this is not something
i'm just doing by myself it's also like i've been
part of spiritual communities i've listened to dozens maybe a
hundred different teachers masters i've gone to their retreats and
workshops i've meditated with them i've talked to their students
i've carefully analyzed their students comprehension of what they know
and what they're conscious of i've come in contact with
buddhists and neo-advice and new age people and christians and
the net result of all of that experience tells me
that if you're following a standard buddhist path or a
neo-dividend path you are not going to become god realized
if you follow the meditative path or the self-inquiry path
you will not become god-realized you can achieve some great
insight and you can you can even collapse the ego
but what i'm talking about with god realization is not
merely a collapsing of the ego is something much more
profound than that and if you tell yourself that that's
[ __ ] and doesn't exist and that you're maximally
awake okay if you say so i won't argue with
you but now my work gets a little bit more
radical and now i'm more focused on those of you
who really want to reach god realization and my passion
and going forward my teachings are going to be geared
towards those people if you want your standard buddhist path
go go there's there's a hundred buddhists on youtube follow
the standard buddhist but go meditate if you want to
do neo advaita go go um do self inquiry i
got no problem with these things and it could be
helpful um to get you to a certain point but
realize that what got you here doesn't necessarily get you
to the highest level question this idea that all pads
lead to the same places maybe they don't maybe some
pads leave the lead higher up the mountain than others
maybe there's more than one mountain maybe it's more like
a mountain range than a single mountain maybe consciousness is
much more complex than you ever realized maybe spirituality and
mysticism is is much more than what you read in
the books and seen in a few videos after all
how would you know if you were truly humble you
would be open to what i'm telling you a few
of you will be open to it and a very
few of you will eventually realize what i've been pointing
to god realization a few of you will realize truly
what god is what is god what is god what
is god that's the question that should be searing in
your mind if you really want to go all the
way what is god do not stop until you have
a complete understanding of what is god and god is
not simply emptiness although of course it is but it's
more than that now does this mean you can't get
realized in any other method but through psychedelics no you
have to be careful here because look when i teach
i don't teach to the one percent of exceptionally spiritually
gifted people i'm teaching to to the other 99 so
when you start criticizing me those of you who are
very spiritually advanced and you say oh yeah leo oh
yeah i reached god realization all i did was i
meditated for a week look if you did fine i'm
happy for you but just because you did that you're
like one in the [ __ ] 20 million i'm
not gonna be gearing my teachings towards that if i'm
talking about traveling from los angeles to new york as
a responsible travel guide just because you are this hardcore
hiker who has hiked on foot from los angeles to
new york and you did it and it took you
a month to do and it cost you a bunch
of money and time and effort just because you did
it doesn't mean that that's what that's what i'm going
to teach what i'm going to teach is get on
a plane that's the proper way to get from la
to new york it is not to walk 3 000
miles across dangerous terrain making things needlessly difficult on yourself
so when you say that i'm the arrogant and egotistical
one for trying to make this path efficient for people
because you prefer to walk from la to new york
actually consider the possibility that it's you who's the arrogant
and the egotistical one because really if there's an efficient
simple direct method to go from la to new york
in a few hours why the [ __ ] would
i not teach that why would i teach the walking
method and why would you insist on the walking method
unless that was something done out of ego there can
be multiple methods but not all all methods are equally
effective equally efficient see so from my experience what i
found is that psychedelics are the most effective method for
reaching god realization and if that wasn't true i wouldn't
teach it and if i didn't teach it i wouldn't
be authentic to my own experiences and discoveries so if
you disagree with me on that fine but i still
have to stick to what is true for me in
my experience does this mean it works for everybody no
i don't think it works for everybody it works for
me and i know it works for a lot of
other people i know that meditation certainly doesn't work for
everybody nothing works for everybody so by all means find
your way if my way you try it it doesn't
work for you then stop doing it now you might
be wondering well leo so this was uh you're talking
about five emo dmt is that what you're talking about
that led to this awakening and the answer is no
was it dmt no what was it it was something
you've never heard of it was something virtually nobody has
ever heard of it was a chemical and i want
to share this chemical because nobody i know of has
ever talked about this chemical and its power so basically
i've discovered a chemical that's now i'm very clear is
more powerful at least for me than five in the
odmt now that doesn't mean it's going to be more
powerful for you you see we're on the cutting edge
of human understanding here and human science and technology you
know new chemicals are being discovered every year and with
unknown properties and unknown effects it's a wild west really
and this will keep happening probably for the next hundred
years at least and maybe beyond that so i do
research on things i discover new things that's what my
function is but of course the danger with new things
is that you don't know how other people react to
it so again i'm only talking about the effect this
chemical has on me i can't promise that it's going
to be more powerful than five meow dmd for you
i can't promise it's gonna be more powerful than normal
dmt for you it may not be for some of
you it may not work at all for others of
you it may cause nausea and nothing but vomiting i
don't i don't know i have no idea i'm just
one guy experimenting with stuff making my own discoveries and
there's no there's no scientific backing for these things we're
way beyond the edge of consensus science here this is
this is the science that will be done 100 years
from now when your grandkids are doing science so it's
just the nature of cutting edge research and work that
it's mysterious it's unknown it's confusing it's baffling it may
be risky you don't that's the nature of exploration of
nature how many explorers have died exploring the new world
before we settled it and made it safe for everybody
thousands maybe millions i don't know now i'm not saying
that this chemical is dangerous per se in some sort
of you know physically harmful way um but then again
you know i don't know there's not there's not a
lot of research on this stuff but anyways i want
to share the i want to share the name of
the chemical and to make it popular or at least
well-known um but i'm not going to do it in
this episode and i know you guys want me to
and um i know you're impatient uh but i want
to do it in a responsible way and i want
to do it to at a pace that i'm comfortable
at so in the end i'm going by what what
i'm comfortable with so don't pester me i don't know
when i'm going to release the name i want to
uh soon but i don't know when uh if you
stick around then you'll hear me talk about it and
release it and until then i won't say anything about
more about it so don't don't guess don't ask me
questions i'm not going to respond to your guesses and
to your questions and again remember i give no warranties
whatsoever if you decide to use this chemical or any
psychedelics for that matter it's all on you i promise
nothing you could kill yourself and i will not feel
guilty for it because i told you repeatedly many times
that these are their inherent risks that come with these
substances and you must use them very carefully and responsibly
and i don't know what your situation is i don't
know what your genetics is i don't know what your
health is i don't know your mental health situation or
mental illness or not i don't know any of these
things so it's all on you as far as that
goes and of course you have to follow all the
safety protocols that i've talked about in the past when
it comes to psychedelic use and um and i can't
promise you that it'll be any better than mushrooms or
lsd for you i don't know it may not be
because people are different people react to psychedelics very differently
um i can just tell you how it was for
me and uh i suspect that it'll it'll be that
way for a fair number of people so i think
it's it's a good uh there's a good chance that
it'll work for you but i can't promise that and
it's up to you to figure that out and that's
how research goes right if you want the safe well-known
methods then by all means go go go use those
methods but then you're not going to be getting the
cutting edge methods so decide what you want the more
cutting edge it is the more unknown it is the
more variable variability there is there the less it's been
mapped out the more confusing it'll be the more risky
it'll be because it takes time to take a thing
and to make it safe for idiots this is not
foolproof my teachings are not designed to be foolproof they
require a lot of intelligence and care in how you
apply these things and what you understand even the way
you interpret what i say and construe or misconstrue what
i say the projections you make upon the things the
assumptions you have about what i say all of these
things can be dangerous if you don't do them carefully
and properly so that is that and then hopefully what
this enables ultimately my my intention and what i really
want here with this is that i want to help
to to guide you towards the ultimate realization i want
to help you to reach a point where you will
realize that you're me and why you created me to
help yourself to awaken and even more than that i
want you to then realize my love for you see
i don't want to express my love to you through
words or even through my videos or through my interactions
with you on the forum or in the comment section
or by being a nice person or a good samaritan
or by helping you to earn money or have sex
or even to realize no self i want to give
you the highest love and the highest love is not
those things the highest love i want to give you
is i want you to realize that you're god and
that god is love and that you created me and
that my love for you is your love for yourself
and so when you finally reach this point of this
ultimate realization of love that's when you and i will
connect and when you will realize my love for you
and i will realize your love for me and then
together we will realize that we're identical and we will
merge into this infinite singularity of love together as one
forever that's to me the pinnacle of this work and
if you're intelligent about how you go about this and
you're very careful with these teachings perhaps one day you'll
understand what i talked about today you
