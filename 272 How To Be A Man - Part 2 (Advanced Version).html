            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/PYRg1fQYyzY' target='_blank'>How To Be A Man - Part 2 (Advanced Version)</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding masculinity counterintuitively</b>: In order to be more of a man, Leo suggests embracing your feminine side. This concept is counterintuitive as most men aspire to become the stereotypical alpha male, which actually turns out to be an unrealistic caricature of masculinity. Leo argues that this persona only appears attractive at a surface level but is not a genuine expression of an individual's self.
</li><li><b>The Alpha Stereotype</b>: According to Leo, society, particularly in the West, has propagated a specific image of the alpha male - muscular, tall, handsome, extroverted, confident, popular, well-dressed, and irresistible to women. Most men are tempted to conform to this image, believing that it will make them more desirable, and neglect to question its authenticity. 
</li><li><b>Questioning the Cultural Norm</b>: The lecturer encourages the viewers to examine this deeply embedded societal norm of the macho male and develop their own authentic self-identity, one that aligns better with their true nature. Leo emphasizes that being a man means being comfortable with your own self, not striving to be someone else's constructed ideal.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of one's self</b>: Most men are not the archetypical macho men portrayed in the media, and Leo insists that it's fine to accept that. He encourages men to value themselves and their unique traits rather than feeling inferior in the presence of macho men.
</li><li><b>Embracing femininity</b>: In order to be an authentic man, Leo suggests embracing and accentuating one's feminine qualities. This is not a sign of weakness but rather courage to accept your authentic self. He notes that conforming to the hyper-masculine stereotype due to societal pressures is actually a sign of fear and insecurity. 
</li><li><b>Personal growth through authenticity</b>: The lecturer posits that achieving authentic masculinity requires growth and courage. This is achieved by deeply accepting and embodying one's innate characteristics, including those often labeled as feminine. By doubting and moving beyond cultural norms, individuals may access a deeper, authentic sense of self.
</li><li><b>Cultural Norms and Authenticity</b>: Leo asserts that masculine stereotypes, such as not showing emotions or appearing too caring, are often harmful. He advocates for men to express all emotions wholeheartedly and to embrace qualities deemed feminine, like being nice, gentle, and compassionate, this in turn leads to being more fully human. He emphasizes the importance of being true to oneself instead of trying to emulate societal expectations of masculinity.
</li><li><b>Transforming Masculinity with Femininity</b>: Leo encourages men to partake in activities typically considered feminine like yoga or Pilates, to test their comfort and authenticity with their own masculinity. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Holistic Behavior</b>: He highlights the advantages of expressing oneself without fear of appearing weak or unmasculine, even in front of women. Leo notes that masculinity should not be threatened by expressing emotions or being romantic. 
</li><li><b>Attractiveness and Authenticity</b>: Leo explains that women are attracted to authenticity and genuine self-expression, regardless of whether it aligns with traditional views of masculinity. He advises men to experiment with their inherent femininity without shame or embarrassment to find a comfortable middle ground between masculinity and femininity. 
</li><li><b>Neediness and Inauthenticity</b>: Leo highlights that neediness is a universal deterrent for women as it often springs from deep inauthenticity. He recommends either expressing neediness or attempting to conceal it, while working towards finding and resolving the root cause of inauthentic behavior. 
</li><li><b>Rejecting Societal Masculinity</b>: Leo upholds that a strong form of masculinity involves rejecting societal norms about masculinity and expressing oneself honestly and passionately. This process involves experimenting with traditionally feminine traits and dismantling the false, constructed identity.
</li><li><b>Addressing neediness in relationships</b>: Leo Gura suggests two ways to manage neediness in interactions with women while working on becoming more authentic. One way is to own the neediness and expose it, which may risk the woman losing interest. The other option is to hide the neediness, a strategy that often results in the needy behavior leaking out in more negative ways. 
</li><li><b>Learning from personal experiences</b>: Leo encourages men to experience the consequences of showing neediness, in order to learn and grow. He shares that being authentic in a relationship, even when it results in the woman leaving due to neediness, can bring valuable lessons and growth. Realizing that a relationship was lost because of neediness can lead to self-exploration and motivate change towards a more authentic self.
</li><li><b>Rejecting macho stereotypes and promoting authenticity</b>: Defining manliness should not rely on stereotypical 'macho' traits but on personal authenticity. Leo advises that being a man means disregarding societal definitions, doing what you want, and remaining true to yourself, not changing for anyone. The goal is to distinguish between the external signs of macho behavior and the genuine internal core of masculinity.
</li><li><b>Importance of integrating masculinity into traditionally feminine activities</b>: Leo cites the example of the Italian Prime Minister cooking (a traditionally female activity) and responding to criticism by saying that whatever he does is "man's stuff". He encourages men to bring masculinity to everything they do  their actions should not determine their masculinity, but rather their masculinity should imbue their actions. 
</li><li><b>Appeal of authenticity</b>: Authentic actions and expressions are attractive not only to women but to everyone. Authentic men bring an energizing charisma into the things they do in life, regardless of societal expectations. Leo encourages viewing reactions from others  whether positive, negative, or indifferent  with acceptance.
</li><li><b>Purpose of Actualized.org's newsletter</b>: Leo highlights the value of his newsletter, promising that it will provide readers with techniques, distinctions, and concepts for self-actualization. The newsletter is designed to guide individuals as they embark on their personal development journey, helping them align their actions with their values and interests, leading to a fulfilling life.
