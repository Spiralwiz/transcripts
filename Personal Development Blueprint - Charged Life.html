hey this is Leo for actualised org and we're continuing
along this is this video is part of my blueprint
series which is over 100 of the greatest personal development
concepts of all time and the concept that we're covering
here is called charged life so what is the charged
life why is it important and was the nuts and
bolts of creating a charged life basically I got this
idea from Brendon Burchard and what he talks about is
he talks about the distinction between having a caged life
a comfortable life and a charged life and really what
this concept is about is the idea that you want
to commit to having and living a charged life whatever
it takes and a charged life by definition is one
where you're on your edge you're out there and you're
pushing yourself you're taking risks you're out of your comfort
zone you're growing you're learning you're doing exciting things and
you're not just taking life for granted you're not sitting
on your ass you're not being lazy so that's what
this concept is and the whole idea the action plan
behind it is simply just to understand that this distinction
exists this three-part distinction between these different types of lives
and then the fact that you got to really commit
to it this is something you have to commit to
and recommit to on a daily on a weekly basis
and check in with yourself and say am i living
a charged life or am i getting complacent alright so
why is this concept important we talked about what it
is let's talk about why it's important I think this
is important because if you're bought into what actualize dot
org is about it really is about creating a charged
life that's what I want for you that's what my
message is I think ultimately is I want people to
be living big lives I want to challenge you to
do that because I think it's very easy in modern-day
society where if you're living in a first world country
you're pretty comfortable most of us are pretty comfortable if
you're middle-class or above and it's very easy to get
so comfortable that you become complacent and you stop seeing
the amazing opportunities are out there you stop chasing after
your own potential you stop learning you stop challenging yourself
and so what happens you just kind of sit there
on your couch watching TV and you get in a
comfortable relationship it turns into a rut and you get
comfortable at work and that turns into a rut and
basically your whole life turns into a rut and then
you start to feel dissatisfied with yourself even though you
have all the basics of your life taken care of
maybe you've got enough money to pay the bills and
make the ends meet and maybe you've got enough you
know you've got a relationship so you've got enough life
and love in your life and you've got some decent
friends you've got a decent family life everything is just
kind of decent and moderate and also mediocre and then
after a while you start to ask yourself is there
more is this what life could really be and you
know that your greatest self sees that there's more you
know you can't really deny the fact that there are
people out there whether you interact with them a lot
or not but there are people out there that are
really living amazing lives living a life on their edge
they're living a charged life where they're having some sort
of amazing impact in the world or they're really contributing
something special to relationships and then their interactions with people
or they're getting just an unusual amount of adventure from
their lives you know we read about these people these
are people that are featured in magazines and news stories
and on TV and they inspire us to want to
go out there and be more and so that's why
this concept is important I think that if you want
to really lift your full potential you have to commit
to living a charged life and what does that mean
committing to living a charged life means that you're also
committing to work because living a charged life is not
the easy route of the three options here and we
haven't even covered the the the caged life so much
and I want to go into that in a little
bit because you might even be living a caged life
right now but let's say I'm assuming that you're probably
living a comfortable but then there's also this charged life
so you need to commit to living a charged life
and living that charged life is going to take more
work than living a comfortable life or living a caged
life work in the sense that you have to push
yourself out of your comfort zone and that's going to
mean that there's a certain level of discomfort there right
just by definition because if you're gonna if you're going
to go out there and you're gonna start a new
business or you're gonna go out there and you're gonna
risk yourself to try to create a better relationship you're
going to go out there and maybe you're gonna share
your story and you're going to do public speaking or
interact with the world in some unique way where you're
on your edge that's challenging right that's a risk that
you're taking you have to be pushing yourself to grow
you have to be doing something new almost by definition
and this idea of challenge is a really important one
and I want to give Brendon Burchard credit for this
because he really says that to live a charged life
you got it you got to design challenges for yourself
right this is not going to come about naturally the
trick is that you have to create the challenges and
ideally you want to create the kind of challenges that
you want to tackle because the difference between someone who's
living at charged life and someone who's living let's say
a caged life the person with the caged life also
has a lot of challenges except they're the challenges kind
of come about spontaneously they're almost thrust upon him or
her and therefore that person may be even dealing with
more challenges than the person who's living the charge life
on their edge but the difference is that the person
who's living a charged life he consciously chose those challenges
right so it's kind of like the difference between challenging
yourself to learn to play the piano really well that
would be someone let's say who's living the charged life
and someone who is challenged because they can't make ends
meet and their boss is mad at them because they're
not showing up to work on time you know both
are challenges I don't even know which one is more
challenging I would say that the cage life here is
more challenging because you're not even getting the fulfillment from
it what's nice about the charged life is that yes
there is challenge but that's undercut by the fact that
you're getting so much reward from it you're making a
conscious decision that yes you're going to be putting in
this work you're gonna be putting this effort but you're
gonna get a higher higher sense of return on your
investment so to speak right and that return on investment
is going to come from these higher feelings that you're
gonna get you're gonna get feelings potentially like a sense
of creative contribution more love more joy higher consciousness you're
gonna give a sense of pride in what you're doing
you're gonna give a sense of achievement and accomplishment a
sense of excellence you know you can be pursuing these
higher values whereas when you're living a cage life you're
really pursuing the very bare minimum you're just kind of
struggling to survive and if you're in the comfortable life
then you're not struggling to survive you have survived and
you're comfortable surviving as you are but you're also probably
bored with life you're seeing that it could be more
and you're still dissatisfied you're dissatisfied because you're kind of
in between on the one hand you can't be too
too satisfied because you've got all your basics handled but
under the hand you can't be too excited either because
well there's all this cool stuff here but you're not
pursuing it you're not taking any action on it so
you're dissatisfied all right let me talk a little bit
more about the caged life because that might actually be
a condition that some of you are in caged life
basically means that you're living in constant reaction to the
environment that means that you're you're struggling to survive you're
struggling to even meet some of your basic needs right
if we talk about Maslow's hierarchy of needs well there
he talks about the most basic stuff just common sense
is that you need you need food you need water
you need shelter you need clothing you need a relatively
comfortable environment just to feel a very basic level of
satisfaction then once you've got those then you're going to
want things like sex you're going to want things like
relationships with other people then continuing kind of up going
up that list is you start to want to get
a sense of community a sense of belonging to something
that's larger than yourself and then you can go higher
and higher and higher into things like self-esteem and sense
of pride and then you can go even into higher
just ultimately self-actualization so when you're living that cage life
what that's about is just struggling to meet the very
bottom of that pyramid right if you're living in cage
life then you probably think that the world is really
hard that it's difficult to make money that love is
hard to find you're probably thinking that friendship is is
rare and it's fine hard to find good friends maybe
it's hard to get your family situation taken care of
so that you're not fighting all the time you're not
angry all the time you're not frustrated all the time
and not stressed out all the time and that is
kind of the caged life right and when you're living
in the cage life a lot of what you're doing
is you're reacting to things that are being thrown upon
you by an external environment so maybe you've got bills
due that you're scrambling to pay maybe you've got fights
that you're always getting into with your spouse or your
family members or your friends and you're in that cycle
all the time so it's a lot of like negativity
and pain also another I'd say feature of the the
cage kind of life is that you tend to probably
have addictions you've got negative addictions so things that you
might be addicted to either drugs alcohol television food other
things more kind of a more abstract addictions such as
negative thinking you might be very hooked on negative thinking
you might be hooked on worrying all the time you
might be hooked on various limiting beliefs that you have
so all of these addictions you might be caught in
a cycle of going through those and those can be
really frustrating because on the one hand what you're doing
is you're getting a short term hit of pleasure from
engaging that addictive behavior but in the long run what
you're doing is you're sacrificing your potential in your future
right that's what happens when you do drugs alcohol when
you're sitting watching TV all the time you're addicted to
negative thinking that's basically what you're doing or food food
is a big one I had that problem that I
had to work my way out of that's living caged
life and the reason that it's really called a caged
life is because you are hemmed in by all these
circumstances and it's hard to see that you even have
a way out you're just so immersed in that you're
just so struggling it's like being caught in quicksand you're
you're struggling against like the forces of nature and you
feel like everything is against you it isn't the world
and life is set up against you and a lot
of times what you're doing is you're living to please
other people you're living to meet goals of other people
maybe you're living and you're struggling to meet the approval
of your parents or the approval of a loved one
or spouse or to be accepted by your friends to
be accepted by the community it's always about externals right
is struggling to to live someone else's life really either
society is life life that you think you should be
living and not really expressing yourself authentically not really honoring
your values so if you're living that cage kind of
life then you have to really start to get your
way out of it by looking at what you really
want and then start kind of working your way up
and it can be painful and then transition into the
comfortable and then from the comfortable into eventually hopefully the
charged so that's the transition that's possible for you but
ultimately with this concept I want you to see the
big picture the ideal the vision of living that charged
life living to your full potential and everything that could
be you know who could you be if you were
living to your full potential every single day and if
you were doing that consistently for let's say 10 years
where would you be at how much money would you
have in your bank account then how much satisfaction would
you get from your job how much satisfaction would you
get from your family life and your relationships and your
hobbies when you're challenging yourself and you're going out there
and you doing new stuff and you're traveling the world
these are the people that travel the world these are
the people that engage in new businesses these are the
people that are always building new relationships right they're learning
new things they're improving their health they're basically improving their
life every day by a little bit in every way
and that ends up adding up and then after a
while they have really awesome lives and we if we're
living in the comfortable in the caged life then we
kind of wonder like well how do they get there
that's because they're always taking action on it and that's
why I'm such a big proponent of personal development and
doing this stuff very actively doing it as a hobbyist
person really pursuing it is because I think that that's
the vehicle that you use to get yourself from a
caged and a comfortable life into that charged kind of
life right so the idea is that you really just
want to commit to it commit to this idea and
be willing to accept the cost too because it's not
that it's just like oh sure I'll live a charged
life if it was that easy everyone would do it
it's that you got to recognize what are the challenges
there you know starting a new business isn't easy trying
to go out there and improving your social life isn't
easy going out there and traveling all the time and
going to strange places and doing new things that's not
easy and learning new things also challenging you have to
understand that that's going to be there but you're pushing
for it and you have to understand is that your
reward is the higher pleasure so there there's going to
be a sense of delayed gratification here initially you're gonna
be putting in and you're gonna be uncomfortable but later
on after you do all that and you take your
risk and you do uncomfortable things and you maybe fail
and you slip up and you go through the frustration
of that you got to see that there's a bigger
picture after a while you do that for some months
some years and you start seeing the dividends payoff to
you in those higher-quality feelings like you're gonna feel a
more high consciousness and you're gonna feel a greater ease
in the world more tranquility more confidence more self-esteem more
sense of creative contribution more love all these awesome things
that many people just miss out on life right and
of course excitement having an exciting life to me that's
that's really a compelling vision to to make me do
the hard work that it takes right because you know
going to the gym and staying in shape that takes
hard work and going to your job everyday and not
just doing a mundane job but going out there and
like really pushing it and trying to do better every
day and trying to learn at your job and really
making it a life calling that takes a lot of
work right and if you have a creative job then
expressing yourself creatively taking all the creative risks and all
the emotional labor involved with with being really creatively expressive
you know that's really challenging so all these things are
challenging but they're also rewarding and what I want to
have you really decide right now once and forever what
kind of life do you want to live is it
gonna be a cage buy a comfortable life or charged
life and realize that if you don't make a choice
you've still made a choice and I can guarantee you
that if you don't make the choice then you're probably
almost impossible for you to live that charge kind of
life you're gonna by default fall into a cage life
or a comfortable life and is that what you really
want I mean if it is fine I'm not gonna
sit here and browbeat you to live a charged life
but I think that when you force yourself to ask
this conscious choice because most of us are never asked
this choice we don't even know that this choice exists
we just kind of fall into the cage to the
comfortable life so ask yourself right now what do you
want what kind of life do you want and are
you willing to pay the cost and do you see
the potential do you see the rewards and how awesome
the rewards can be I think you do I think
we all have that intuition and that even if you're
in a very tough spot in your life right now
or you're just struggling to make ends meet and to
get things just to a kind of a baseline level
that's okay you have to work through that it's gonna
take you longer it's gonna it's going to require you
to first work your way into a comfortable life and
then work your way into a charged life but still
commit still commit to the fact that if you're in
a cage life right now that you're going to break
free and then you're gonna move yourself into a comfortable
place and then once you get comfortable this is the
trick is that you're not gonna stay there you might
stay there for a little bit but you're not going
to stay that for the rest of your life you're
gonna then look to something higher something greater and you're
gonna move on and I think that actually if you're
in a caged position you actually have an advantage over
the people that have been in a comfortable life for
a very long time because once you get very complacent
and comfortable to me that's like death it's really hard
to then get yourself motivated you were married you're very
much in a rut in life whereas if you're in
a caged life it just might mean that you started
out with harder condition initial conditions than the rest of
us did and you have to work through that and
you can actually learn a lot from those challenges and
you can really slingshot yourself with some of those lessons
because you're gonna be so motivated to break out of
that it's gonna be like your slingshot slingshotting yourself out
and you're gonna have that momentum after you break out
of your cage you're gonna have that momentum to just
power through the comfort and go straight into the charge
of life and a lot of examples of people when
you read their biographies some of the greatest people out
there you know that are accomplishing amazing things today and
that are living those exciting lives if you read where
they came from they're usually a lot of them came
from very bad conditions they had drug addictions they were
battling depression or mental illness or they were having family
problems or they were abused when they were younger or
whatever they were very poor you know and then what
they did is they use that as motivation they actually
learned a lot from those from their greatest challenges and
they used that to slingshot themselves forward into something that
now they can use to inspire others and that's what
I want for you is if you're in that caged
position you're really struggling right now is that don't think
that you have to work harder than the rest of
us think that you actually might have an advantage in
a certain sense then the people they're living the comfortable
kind of lives and if you are living a comfortable
life then my advice to you is to get off
your ass because you are discounting how short life is
your life is gonna be over like that and you
are going to be regretting that you're not living this
awesome life here plus why would you not want this
why would you not want to have all the riches
that Life offers especially modern society you can really be
out there killing it doing anything you want to do
experiencing so much you're skipping all that out to do
what watch TV really is that a good bargain are
you making a smart choice there no you're not making
a smart choice you're making an unconscious choice make the
conscious choice to live a charged kind of life all
right so this is it I'm gonna be signing off
it's basically the concept of living a charged life I
think it's a really important one thanks to Brendan Burchard
for for sticking it into my mind and now I'm
sharing it with you along with some other thoughts so
go ahead leave some comments tell me about what you
think about this what kind of life have you been
living and how can you get yourself to be living
more of a charged life than you have already so
share your thoughts with me and also share this video
if you found it useful maybe you have a friend
that needs a kick in the ass who's sitting on
the couch and watching too much TV or maybe you
have someone who's struggling and they need some motivation and
they need a vision and they need to see why
their condition is actually an advantage to them that they
can really use that to inspire the rest of us
with the massive transformation that they're going to make so
go ahead and share and spread the love like it
