hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I want to talk about the rider elephant analogy
okay so what is the rider elephant analogy how does
this work and why are we talking about it well
this analogy comes from an amazing book called the happiness
hypothesis by jonathan hate he also wrote the righteous mind
two really great books about really understanding yourself understanding human
psychology so the analogy he makes there AC says that
you and your mind is like a rider on an
elephant now what does this mean what he's talking about
is that you and your mind are really we tend
to think intuitively or naively that there is just like
one of us right there's one you but really there's
different fragments of your mind and this is a model
that explains why we have difficulty accomplishing certain things in
our lives right this for example explains why sometimes you're
sitting on the couch watching TV and you know that
your alarm rings to go to the gym and you
don't want to go to the gym because you're comfortable
you don't want to get up and then on the
one hand part of your mind is saying alright you're
really need to get to the gym to work off
all these potato chips that you've eaten and to stay
in shape and to keep on top of your new
year's resolution right and then the other part of your
mind says but I'm so comfortable I just want to
sit here a little bit more how about five more
minutes or or I can go to the gym tomorrow
starts coming up with excuses right and maybe there's even
a third part so there's various parts in your mind
that are kind of exerting influence over each other and
then ultimately you don't really know which one is gonna
win out sometimes one part of the bond wins out
sometimes the other part maybe you're gonna sit there on
the couch all day and veg out remember you gonna
decide you know what no we're gonna cut that off
and we're gonna go to the gym who knows but
that's a very human thing right is that inner struggle
that inner conflict that we always face and that conflict
we face it not with just with small things like
going up and getting up and going to the gym
but we face it at work we face it when
we want - really embark on something new in our
lives we face it when we want to start a
new project if you want to write a book if
you want to start a new business if you want
to raise a good family if you want to enter
a new relationship you're always facing these these inner tensions
and with Jonathan hate came up with this brilliant analogy
of writer and elephant is what he's saying is that
your mind and these are some ancient analogies that came
about really back from the Greek and the Hindu days
back in classical antiquity is that they compared your mind
to being like an animal that you have to cultivate
that you have to domesticate right and that the point
in this analogy is that and then even a domesticated
animal is not fully domesticated so your mind with this
elephant rider analogy is like you have the logical part
of your mind which is the rider which is sitting
on top of the elephant and it's directing right it's
holding the reins and it's telling the elephant where to
go and that's like your logical conscious mind but then
you have the subconscious mind and that's the mind that's
really responsible for a lot of the results that you're
getting in your life except you probably don't realize that
unless you've studied this idea and unless you've really thought
about it and you've really closely observed your own behavior
in action because in that example of sitting on the
couch eating potato chips and then not wanting it to
go to the gym what's happening is that your logical
mind the rider on this elephant is saying okay elephant
let's turn to the right we need to turn to
the right now there's a cliff up ahead let's turn
to the right but the elephant is behaving the way
it wants to behave and it's not really obedient and
the elephant is much bigger than the writer and the
writer is sitting on top of the elephant so wherever
the elephant goes the rider ends up going along with
them and so what ends up happening is that the
elephant is saying no I don't want to turn right
I want to keep going straight which in your case
sitting on the couch you continue to sit on the
couch right and your rider knows that's not the smartest
thing to be doing right now because you need to
go and work on your fitness and watch your nutrition
and you don't want to be vegging out all day
but elephant it has kind of a mind of its
own and when it sets its mind on something there's
nothing the rider can do about it that's what's powerful
about this analogy is that these are not equal parts
and the reason this is is because your brain evolved
over time over millions of years basically your brain evolved
so that it can handle things automatically you have a
really powerful subconscious mind and one of the most effective
personal development techniques out there is getting your subconscious mind
aligned with your conscious mind because when your goals when
you're conscious goals are aligned their subconscious mind it's like
having an elephant and a rider that are both on
the same page and it's like having a writer that
knows how to control the elephant it's having an elephant
that's obedient to the rider and then what happens then
is you get a good performance then the elephant goes
where it needs to go and then you can get
from point A to point B it can do a
nice long trip no problems but now think about the
case where the rider is totally inept totally unskilled doesn't
understand the elephant and then the elephant is like a
wild elephant that hasn't been tamed and doesn't have any
obedience to the rider think about how that scenario is
gonna play out what if I want to travel a
thousand miles go on a thousand mile trip using that
combination of rider and elephant do you think I'll get
very far do you think that's gonna be a struggle
you think that's gonna be painful yes and for most
of us we know that situation very intimately in fact
maybe you're in that situation right now is that there
are certain things that you want to be doing that
you know you should be doing but you're just not
able to do no matter how hard you try because
your elephant is going to other direction and it's not
listening to you your rider well this is a brilliant
analogy and this analogy has been made like I said
since antiquity and really a lot of times people don't
realize that this is the case and that really the
trick is that your mind evolved to prioritize the elephant
because the elephant is your subconscious mind and it's taking
care of a lot of things for you right now
right now your subconscious mind is taking care of beating
your heart and it's taking care of your breathing it's
taking care of blinking your eyes it's care of some
of the underlying thought processes that are going through because
you're not totally in control of which thoughts are coming
up next for you a lot of times that's on
autopilot and your unconscious mind is also responsible for all
the routines that you're running throughout your life that you
don't even realize that you're running you know it's it's
helping you walk down the street it's helping you chew
your food it's helping you move your eyes to focus
on the things that are important in your in your
environment it's helping you protect you from threats like cars
that are that are whizzing by you when you're crossing
the street it's helping you drive your car it's helping
you do all these things and it's helping you do
your work - even the conscious stuff that you're doing
on some level you're you're delegating most of stuff from
your conscious mind into your subconscious mind and only then
is it getting executed right you're not thinking about every
word that you're saying you're not thinking about every hand
gesture that you're making when you're talking these things are
handled automatically for you by the elephant and so the
trick and the point of personal development really is to
get your Rider and your elephant to come into better
alignment with each other so I think this is a
really good analogy to get you to start thinking and
observing yourself so what I really want you to take
away from this is start observing how your rider is
working and how your elephant is working and the interaction
between the two how is your rider communicating with your
elephant what kind of words is he saying what kind
of things is he thinking about the elephant and observe
what kind of mind the elephant has you know what
are the preferences of the elephant what does the elephant
want to be doing that maybe the rider doesn't want
to be doing so this is a really good exercise
to do and to continue to do and this builds
awareness for developing self-control because ultimately when you're successful in
life it is about having your psychology dialed in and
what that means is it's having a rider that understands
the elephant and an elephant understands the rider and what
you really need to be doing to get amazing results
for personal development is not just educating the rider I
find that this is a huge problem and especially for
me I tend to be an analytical Tonica type of
guy and I like to accumulated a lot of knowledge
and wisdom and sometimes what that turns into is a
lot of mental masturbation where what I'm doing is I'm
educating my conscious mind I'm educating the rider and the
rider becomes this super smart pompous guy who's sitting on
top this elephant and this rider thinks that he's perfect
he knows everything but the problem is he knows everything
except how to control the elephant and how good do
you think that is how good do you think of
a result he's gonna get not a very good result
because even though he knows exactly where he needs to
go he knows the layout of the terrain he knows
everything that the elephant should be doing he doesn't actually
have very good coordination of the reins on the elephant
and he doesn't have really a good understanding of how
to manipulate the elephant in the right ways so the
lesson here is that when you're taking in information and
don't take in too much theory you have to really
what you got to focus on is going to focus
on the training of the elephant so smart rider knows
this a smart rider understands that after a certain while
accumulating more self-help theories techniques and strategies is not going
to do it reading more books is not going to
do it's not going to really create a substantial change
in your life it's not going to give you the
real results if you want real results what you got
to do is you got to undertake a process of
training the elephant just like they would in a circus
right if you take a wild elephant you got to
train that thing before you can get a performance out
of it and the same thing here is that every
technique that you're looking for them in a book every
tip that you're getting from me every principle that I'm
sharing with you you got to ask yourself how do
I train my elephant now that technique is in my
riders brain how do I train the elephant to understand
it as well and that's really the work and self
development is what you got to do is you got
to find ways to habitual eyes this stuff to actually
practice it to make it routine and the best way
to do that is to do it on a consistent
and daily basis so you take one principle one thing
and then you work on it every day for a
period of a month or two to get your elephant
trained up and then only when your elephant is trained
up only then do you really see the result only
then do you really feel it which means that if
you get some tip in a book about how to
make more or how to kind of think more positively
or how to improve your relationship or how to how
to improve your fitness then that's all well and good
but you got to realize that's right now in the
riders mind that's not part of the elephant rider combination
yet and so a smart rider will then create habits
to train the elephant and then once the elephant understands
then you've got a really powerful combination because what you've
done is you've aligned your subconscious with your conscious the
two are now together they make a perfect combo they
can work like a team to get you to where
you want to go all right so that's the elephant
rider combination I'm going to end it there share your
comments let me know how the elephant rider has worked
for you how it's played out in your life where
has it really hurt you and where hasn't really helped
you tell me about a time where the two were
aligned and tell me about a time where they were
not alright pizza
