            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/BdrmdMhf_sY' target='_blank'>How To Discover What's True - A Deep Inquiry</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding the concept of truth</b>: The video begins with Leo Gura emphasizing an exploration and investigation of what truth is, as opposed to simply delivering statements about reality. Rather the focus is on the reasoning process, existential inquiry, and deep philosophical investigation, derived from individual consideration and contemplation.
</li><li><b>Why bother seeking truth</b>: The quest begins with an intuitive sense that there must be some ultimate way reality is, which could also be the absence of any specific state. A search for understanding why and how reality exists requires truth, as one would be dissatisfied with a false model or understanding of the world.
</li><li><b>Dynamics of truth in history</b>: History has shown that individuals and societies have held varied, and sometimes false, models of the world, which were often debunked by subsequent scientific discoveries. New revelations about reality have continuously challenged old beliefs. However, even current understandings of reality, despite being underpinned by science, could potentially be refuted in the future.
</li><li><b>Facing the complexity of truth discovery</b>: Leo considers the multitude of questions one might face when pondering the nature of reality, including whether reality is objective or dependent on the mind, and how different religious and philosophical systems present conflicting interpretations of truth. 
</li><li><b>Importance of unbiased inquiry</b>: Leo clarifies that accepting any assumption without thorough investigation, like automatically endorsing all scientific findings, can lead to false conclusions. The process of distinguishing truth requires authenticity, a readiness to challenge one's beliefs and confront any discrepancies between personal biases and the actual state of reality. 
</li><li><b>The complexity of science</b>: Leo explains that science, although often seen as the ultimate method for determining truth, has its complexities. It comprises diverse views and theories, many of which are eventually disproven. The discovery of truth may demand a careful selection of trustworthy scientists and theories, demanding thorough analysis and dissection at individual levels, beyond relying solely on external scientific authorities. 
</li><li><b>The process of existential inquiry</b>: Leo enforces the importance of utilizing common sense, curiosity, and self-motivated exploration to initiate the existential inquiry process. The value lies in the journey itself rather than in the destination, often leading to profound insights or "golden nuggets" of understanding about the ultimate nature of reality.
</li><li><b>Objective Inquiry</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of an unbiased and neutral approach to existential inquiry. He advises against predetermining outcomes or attempting to conform findings to existing worldviews. 
</li><li><b>Denial of External Authority in Truth-seeking</b>: Gura states that reliance on external authority for truth must be eschewed in this investigation. Authority figures or institutions (such as a university or a guru) should not be unquestioningly believed. Ultimately, the responsibility of pursuing and acknowledging truth lies with the individual.
</li><li><b>Use of Various Methods in Truth Discovery</b>: Gura suggests that different methods, such as logical reason, intuition, and direct experience, may be applied in finding truth. Yet, the validity of these methods is uncertain at the start of the inquiry.
</li><li><b>Ongoing Skeptical Inquiry</b>: He emphasizes that dismissal of certain approaches, such as witchcraft or voodoo, based on personal or cultural biases is premature. Objective investigation of all beliefs and practices is essential to reach the truth.
</li><li><b>Role of Cultural Conditioning</b>: Gura explains that personal biases may stem from cultural upbringing. For example, a person raised in a Christian family is likely to align more with Christian beliefs. However, this cultural background isn't a guarantor of truth.
</li><li><b>Psychological Component in Truth Inquiry</b>: Leo points out that emotional weaknesses, biases, and personal inclinations can heavily influence an individual's inquiry into truth. This is because research isn't just a mechanistic endeavor; it is performed by humans who bring their psychological complexities into it.
</li><li><b>Influence of Different Sectors on Truth Perception</b>: Gura acknowledges how different domains like cults, religions, sciences, businesses, and even medicine, have shown instances of mass delusions, indoctrinated beliefs and concealed truths due to vested interests. This makes the process of discovering truth more challenging. 
</li><li><b>Truth Investigation Challenges</b>: Gura concludes by highlighting the complexities and challenges involved in searching for truth. He underscores the importance of being aware of prevalent personal biases, societal influences, and the active role of vested interests in shaping perceptions of reality.
</li><li><b>Importance of Conscious Introspection</b>: Leo discusses the challenge of seeking truth due to human psychological weaknesses, emotional system, and biases. He emphasizes the need of introspection and self-honesty to conduct an unbiased investigation. 
</li><li><b>Pre-existing Beliefs and Theories</b>: The inquiry doesn't start with a clean slate, but is influenced by pre-existing worldview, theories, and beliefs. These existing biases can skew the investigation process. 
</li><li><b>Choosing the Starting Point for Investigation</b>: With countless philosophies, deciding which one to start investigating first is a significant challenge itself. One's preference can lean towards starting with a philosophy believed to be 'most likely to be true,' which can also be a result of cultural conditioning. 
</li><li><b>Assumptions and Truth Investigation</b>: Assumptions are required to start the investigation process but must be critically evaluated for their validity. Early wrong assumptions can cause the inquiry to diverge in the wrong direction. 
</li><li><b>Questioning the Reliability of Reason</b>: Leo questions the conventional understanding that reason leads to truth, emphasizing that such an idea could be a cultural influence rather than a self-derived truth.
</li><li><b>Influence of External Sources</b>: Humans live in societies where they are influenced by many external sources, including media and education, complicating the truth-seeking process. These influences can shape our beliefs and assumptions, many of which have been proven incorrect throughout history. 
</li><li><b>Challenge of the Inquiry Process</b>: Leo acknowledges the complexities and challenges of this process due to societal influences, existing beliefs, and the vast array of philosophies and worldviews to investigate. He emphasizes, however, the continued passion and determination to pursue the truth.
</li><li><b>Admittance of ignorance</b>: In the process of discovering truth, the initial step involves an actual recognition that we don't know. Leo cautions against shallowly admitting ignorance while still holding onto preconceived notions or biases. 
</li><li><b>Objectivity and impartiality</b>: When one truly admits that they don't know, they must adopt an approach of complete objectivity, impartiality and openness, welcoming even the seemingly far-fetched possibilities.
</li><li><b>The functionality of reason</b>: Leo raises doubts about the reliability of reason as a path to truth. He argues that reasoning can often lead to delusions and falsehoods, drawing attention to numerous instances of such 'foolish reasoning' in human history. 
</li><li><b>The problem of distinguishing correct reasoning from foolish reasoning</b>: The difficulty here leads us back to the initial problem of discovering what is true. Without a guaranteed method to distinguish correct reasoning from foolish reasoning, we are in a circular predicament.
</li><li><b>Problematic external influences</b>: External influences, whether from science, religion, or cultural assumptions, could potentially hinder the pursuit for truth. Leo warns against blindly accepting 'truths' handed down from generation to generation, emphasizing the danger of giving away "authority for discovering truth to some other human".
</li><li><b>Cultural influences and biases</b>: Leo stresses the need for skepticism of cultural tradition and knowledge. It's necessary to question everything passed on to us from our cultural upbringing and not take it for granted.
</li><li><b>The importance of radically open-minded approach</b>: This is crucial for existential investigation. True open-mindedness involves a humble recognition of our own ignorance and the possibility that virtually anything could be true. Leo cautions against prematurely dismissing ideas simply because they seem far-fetched or improbable based on common or personal beliefs.
</li><li><b>Cannot Assign probabilities</b>: By assigning probabilities to what the truth might be essentially suggests a level of knowledge or prediction that we don't possess. Being truly open-minded means considering all possibilities equally, without assigning any degree of likelihood.
</li><li><b>Existential inquiry requires open-mindedness</b>: Leo Gura elaborates that the process of seeking truth requires a high degree of open-mindedness and a willingness to explore even seemingly absurd concepts. He warns against prejudging or dismissing possibilities before the inquiry process, urging viewers to carry out the investigation and resist making assumptions. 
</li><li><b>The effort in truth-seeking is challenging but necessary</b>: The sheer effort and time one may need to invest in the probing process can be daunting, but Leo emphasizes that it's essential for truth-seeking. Despite the potential challenges and obstacles, the commitment to seeking the truth is crucial, even when faced with the possibility of not finding any truth.
</li><li><b>The possibility of not discovering any truth is a truth in itself</b>: Leo brings forth the idea that even the chance of not finding any absolute truth still signifies a truth in itself. Truth-seekers need to embark on exhaustive inquiries, potentially spanning years or even centuries. The truth they might discover after these endeavors could radically alter their lives or perceptions.
</li><li><b>Truth is an individual discovery</b>: Leo urges that truth cannot be inherited or learnt from others or authority figures  it has to be discovered individually. Even if a person claims to have found the truth, it does not suffice for another persons quest for truth. Each person must undertake their journey of exploration, reasoning, and discovery.
</li><li><b>Distinguishing between beliefs requires knowledge of the truth</b>: Leo concludes by pointing out the problem of distinguishing between differing beliefs, perspectives, and worldviews without having first discovered the truth. He states that this differentiation, which many people do, is fundamentally flawed, due to it being primarily based on false assumptions. The process of truth-seeking, therefore, must always commence from a position of 'I don't know,' acknowledging our ignorance.
</li><li><b>Existential Inquiry Vs Conformity</b>: Leo describes the difference between most people who conform to belief systems and worldviews of their culture and those who engage in existential inquiry, which is a unique process of individually seeking truth. This distinction emphasizes that the vast majority of people, including intellectuals and scientists, align their beliefs with their cultural upbringing. In contrast, only a small percentage of people think for themselves and engage in existential inquiry.
</li><li><b>Methods for Discovering Truth</b>: Leo presents potential methods for discovering truth, such as reason, history, reading books, intuition, science, observation, and direct experience. Each method has its complexities and limitations, which need to be deeply understood to evaluate its usefulness. It is pointed out that verifying the reliability of these methods is challenging, as views can vary based on who is being asked.
</li><li><b>Direct Experience</b>: He highlights direct experience as the most fundamental and unquestionable proof of one's existence. It's suggested that one's sense of being alive could be considered as reality itself and everything else as just specifics occurring within that frame.
</li><li><b>Perceptions</b>: Leo also questions the reliability of our perceptions, suggesting that they might be transient, dependent on our state of consciousness, and not necessarily indicative of external reality. He raises doubts whether there's anything beyond one's life, creating a pervasive sense of uncertainty and existential intrigue.
</li><li><b>Questioning Memory</b>: Leo goes on to question the reliability of our memories and whether they represent past reality or are just present imaginations. This prompts further questions about the nature of reality, the concept of time, and our understanding of subjective experiences.
</li><li><b>On the reliability of direct experience and perception</b>: Leo explores the role of direct experience and perception in our understanding of science, reason, and religion, noting that there's no space for faith or speculation in the direct experience. He points out that all of these systems depend on our perceptual experiences to exist. However, he also brings up classic philosophical doubts about the reliability of our perceptions and how they might be distorted by various factors, including physical states or environmental conditions. This makes it challenging to confidently state that colors, feelings, sensations, or even the sense of being alive are the most fundamental truths we have.
</li><li><b>On the inherent bias in the process of finding truth</b>: Leo Gura elaborates on the difficulties of finding an unbiased avenue to determine truth, explaining that the dilemma exists because any criterion one might use to discern between different claims of truth versus falsehood would itself need further justification. So, asking oneself, consulting an external authority, or resorting to perception or reason to determine what's true or false may not be reliable as they all present aspects of bias.
</li><li><b>Skepticism and the questioning of 'being alive'</b>: Leo delves into the depths of skepticism, discussing the possibility of questioning even basic facets of existence like the sense of 'being alive', suggesting that it could be an illusion or a trick of the mind. However, he also acknowledges the challenges that come with such deep skepticism. He shares that his personal philosophical journey has resonated most with skepticism, making him question everything, including scientific and mathematical beliefs, which led to becoming almost pathologically skeptical, questioning even the most common-sense notions. 
</li><li><b>Challenges of objective validation during the process of inquiry</b>: Leo discusses the circularity of reasoning and the inherent bias in the questioning process. He emphasizes the contradiction in both trusting or mistrusting reasoning, perception, religion, or science. Whereby trust confirms their validity and mistrust, through reasoning, confirms they are invalid. Both approaches are self-reinforcing and do not provide an objective validation of truth.
</li><li><b>The struggle with skepticism</b>: Leo goes on to share his personal journey of skepticism and how it led him to question every belief system, even those he was emotionally and educationally invested in. He highlights that skepticism left him in a state of not fully adopting the label of skeptic as he had questioned the validity of skepticism itself. As a result, he cautions the viewers about the implicitness of skepticism in questioning. 
</li><li><b>Skepticism and its implications</b>: In the pursuit of truth, Leo Gura discusses navigating skepticism and its potential to lead away from the truth when over-indulged. He conveys the importance of questioning even skepticism itself. Through this process, one ends up in a "no-man's land" where they neither fully identify as skeptic nor its opposite, but exist in a space of continuous inquiry, always open to possibilities.
</li><li><b>Existential contemplation and sense of truth</b>: Gura elaborates on how reasoning and common sense can guide this existential questioning process. He suggests that engaging deeply in this process results in glimpses of truth that grow more frequent over time. The process is like looking down an infinite corridor and catching glimpses of an elusive truth represented metaphorically by a mysterious animal's tail.
</li><li><b>Interaction between the logical conscious mind and intuitive faculty</b>: Pointing out the duality of our mental states, Gura differentiates between our foreground logical mind and the background intuitive faculty. He alludes to the intuitive faculty's role in connecting the dots and creating a bigger picture of the existential contemplation happening in our conscious mind. There is a lingering doubt about whether the intuitive or logical mind is more trustworthy.
</li><li><b>Existential reality and our perception of it</b>: Gura emphasizes distinguishing between our beliefs about reality and how reality actually is. He contends that our models, theories, and ideas about reality are oversimplified abstractions of the truth, representing not the objective reality itself, but our subjective perception of it.
</li><li><b>Existentialist Inquiry and Self-Reflection</b>: In this section, Leo emphasizes the importance of constantly questioning and challenging preconceived notions of 'truth' through existential inquiry. It reflects a process of self-reflection and brutal honesty where one aligns thoughts, actions, and beliefs with reality. He suggests that the way we live our lives reveals our real philosophy, often hidden under "fluff" or superficial beliefs. Self-deceit and misconceptions are to be met with introspection, and acknowledged beliefs must coincide with actions.
</li><li><b>Emotional Toil and Emotional Honesty</b>: Navigating existential inquiry can be emotionally disturbing, unsettling, and may lead to mental discomfort, depression, or feelings of detachment. But such emotional toil, Leo asserts, is essential to dissolve one's conditioning, to evacuate deeply ingrained ideologies, and reach the truth. 
</li><li><b>Epistemology in Everyday Life</b>: Epistemology, the study of knowledge, is flagged as a broadly neglected yet fundamentally vital process for individuals. Leo criticizes organizations such as schools, universities, and religions for not teaching epistemology. He asserts the importance of epistemology in everyday life and its potential to impact our understanding and navigation of existence. 
</li><li><b>Epistemology as Active Engagement</b>: Understanding epistemology requires active engagement, similar to how one would approach a mathematical proof, appreciating the logic behind each step. Leo notes a type of "faith" necessary to engage in this epistemological journey - faith that, regardless of the final truth or whether it will be discovered, engaging in this process will prove beneficial. Avoidance of this process equates to conforming to blind faith, risking the adoption of discriminatory ideologies and acceptance of societal conditioning.
</li><li><b>Encouragement for Persistent Inquiry</b>: Leo encourages persistent questioning, introspection, and self-discovery. He asserts that avoiding inquiry is just as risky as engaging in it. A strong emphasis is made on questioning self, authority, culture, religion, and science, as an uninquisitive life equates to the life of a conformist. He stresses that one must seek truth individually and avoid blind adherence to conventional beliefs or practices. 
</li><li><b>Aligning Philosophy with Actions</b>: Leo emphasizes aligning one's philosophy with actions. A difference between claimed beliefs and true beliefs is indicated by actions. In a truly authentic pursuit of truth, actions, feelings, and emotions should be congruent with the philosophy one claims to hold.
</li><li><b>Understanding Existence</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of understanding existence, our only known reality, instead of focusing narrowly on personal pleasures and concerns. He suggests that broader existential concerns might impact daily decisions, relationships, and mental health.
</li><li><b>Direct Involvement</b>: Gura encourages viewers to engage directly in the search for truth by questioning, introspecting, and investigating for themselves rather than relying solely on external sources. He views this as a fulfilling use of one's life and asserts that the process could yield valuable insights.
</li><li><b>Potential Connection Between Understanding Existence and Daily Concerns</b>: Leo speculates that understanding existence could be linked with alleviating issues such as depression, anxiety, and indecisiveness. He encourages curiosity about the nature of existence, suggesting it could better equip individuals to handle life's challenges.
</li><li><b>Personal Responsibility</b>: Leo emphasizes personal responsibility in investigating existence, cautioning against over-relying on already existing information from books or other sources. He emphasizes the need for individuals to actively engage in the process of learning and understanding.
</li><li><b>Understanding Mental Tricks</b>: Gura accentuates the practical value of understanding the tricks one's mind can play in daily situations like business, thus empowering individuals to make more informed decisions. He notes that it can enable clarity in perception and improved ability to detect falsehoods.
</li><li><b>Emphasizing the Importance of Truth</b>: Gura asserts that truth, defined as understanding reality as it is, is all there is. Not seeking the truth, he suggests, could lead to a dysfunctional life based on perceptions that do not truly exist.
</li><li><b>Value of Philosophy and Introspection</b>: Leo underscores the importance of philosophy in unveiling the trickeries of the mind and improving decision-making in life. Genuine philosophy is presented as an active, transformative process of questioning and introspection, rather than mere idle speculation.
</li><li><b>Providing Further Resources for Exploration</b>: Leo Gura promotes his resources for those interested in further exploring the topics of truth and existence. These include his blog, book list, life purpose course, forum, and Patreon page, reinforcing the importance of further investigation beyond the video content.
