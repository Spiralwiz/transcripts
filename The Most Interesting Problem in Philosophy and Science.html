hey this is Leo for actualised org and today I
wanted to talk about phenomenology and the importance of first-person
experience in personal development and in your own growth and
to maximize your own growth the importance of observing yourself
from the inside and really paying a lot of heed
to the experiences that you have going on inside your
head day to day so what I think about is
so interesting about phenomenology and phenomenology is is a branch
of philosophy that deals with first-person experiences so phenomenology is
all about describing and studying first-person experiences from the first
person so this contrasts to most - most of the
ways that science or psychology or even philosophy approaches sort
of problems that deal with the mind is that usually
what happens is that we look at them and we
observe them from the outside in and then we try
to to make connections so a psychologist might take a
subject and run a bunch of experiments on them and
then from that make deduction spell what what that person
is thinking well phenomenology kind of turns that whole process
inside out so instead of observing subjects or running experiments
on them or cutting someone's brain open and studying it
from that from that perspective what phenomenology does is it
studies it from inside so what you're doing is you're
actually going inside your own head and experiencing and then
trying to study and actually figure out consistent properties within
your own experiences within your own thoughts and then draw
draw certain conclusions out of it so there's a whole
whole history of it there's a rich history about 150
years of phenomenological work and that ties in with philosophy
of mind so what's interesting there and I think this
is so fascinating is is the idea that first-person experiences
are actually a lot of times they're thought of as
subjective and kind of flaky and not very important it's
it it's like science is is objective science it deals
with the with the external world and that that is
that is the important stuff I think there's also a
lot of importance in the inner world especially when it
comes to self development work so one of the most
fascinating questions and topics I think that I've ever come
across from studying a lot of philosophy and psychology and
self-development is the idea of qualia what are qualia well
qualia are all the subjective properties that you experience in
your day-to-day life so an example of quality would be
colors it could also be sounds the actual perceptions of
them so not the color as it is in the
external world but the color as it is perceived by
you in your consciousness so we're really talking about here
is consciousness and various aspects of it so all the
different qualities of consciousness those are what we would call
qualia what's interesting about them is that they're completely personal
and subjective so they only happen to you and there's
no really good way to even talk about them with
the standard scientific models so I think one of the
most fascinating in fact problems left for science is figuring
out a way to reconcile and to really explain what
qualia are because on the one hand it seems like
qualia are the things that are most real because they
are what we commonly know from our experience there are
the things that we know most intimately on the other
hand there's really no way to even compare experiences of
one person to the other person just to see if
they even match up and how do you even start
describing quality it's so personal just the very fact that
that I have a certain color shirt on right now
and that I'm experiencing it in my consciousness as red
is is very particular to me and you might also
experience it red but that feeling of redness that you're
getting that you're sensing there's no good scientific way to
talk about it or to describe it you can talk
about the wavelengths of red you can say everything there
is to know about the science of red but that
whole description you can you can read a whole textbook
on it but that description of red will never actually
get you the feeling of red and the experience of
red the quality of red so it's a very interesting
topic I think that science is gonna have to come
to grips with because it's on the one hand right
now what kind of mainstream science does is it it
almost discounts the importance of qualia or the fact that
they exist saying that while all this mental phenomenon can
be boiled down to neurological activity in the brain and
while that's well that seems like to be likely to
be the case from all the developments in neuroscience is
it seems like it is in fact the case that
the neurons in your brain and the activity that's going
on there the electrical impulses that are firing off all
of that stuff is ultimately giving rise to your consciousness
and to your feelings and your experiences but the question
still remains if we take the brain and let's say
we just kind of magnify it up and then we
walk around on the inside of it and to look
around the analogy is like if we take an old
sawmill and we go and we go inside the old
sawmill we look around if the brain is the sawmill
and we look around and we walk around it we
can do a thorough inspection and we'll never ever find
the quality of red inside the sawmill so no matter
how good neuroscience gets you're never going to find the
quality of red in the brain at least not in
that same way that we're talking about you can try
to reduce it and boil it down to some physical
phenomenon but in the end it's very hard to deny
because we all experience it firsthand that there's something to
this consciousness thing so I think that's really interesting just
like an interesting fascinating topic and it's a great lead-in
in to what I want to really talk about which
is the importance of observing yourself observing yourself from the
first person as you as you try to grow yourself
because I think that's a larger aspect of self-discovery and
I think it's also the foundation of it a few
more points on phenomenology and kind of some of the
some of the quirkiness of experience and consciousness one interesting
case that I'm going to bring to you is called
the mala no problem and the mala no problem came
about in nineteen in know in 1688 this was a
long time ago in 1688 and Irish scientists and politician
by the name of Peter Mullan Oh William Molyneux introduced
this idea to John Locke he basically sent him a
letter and he posed this little thought experiment it was
a philosophical type of thought experiment what would happen if
a man was born blind and grew up blind and
then all of a sudden he gained his vision back
now the question is would that man be able to
distinguish by looking at a sphere right next to a
cube so let's say you have a spherical object next
to a cubical object just by sight alone would that
man be able to distinguish which one of them is
spherical in which one of them is cubical so this
has to do with how our perception and vision connects
with our sense of touch so presumably what would happen
there is that the band would grow up blind but
he would be touching objects so he'd have a good
sense of sharpness and roundness of objects so if you
felt spherical objects and he felt cubical objects he would
presumably have a lot of experience with how that felt
what roundness felt like and what what sharpness and sharp
edges felt like so once he has that but then
he never attached the sense of vision to it so
he doesn't really know what a sphere looks like he
doesn't really know what a cube would look like when
he does have that ability all the sudden turned on
let's say is he going to be aware of which
one is the round thing and which one is the
square thing so what do you think what how would
you answer that question would you say that that he
could or that he couldn't well this was a long-standing
philosophical debate which Molineux introduced to lock and then lock
talked about it and then really philosopher talked about it
for four centuries and they try to do experiments on
it but it's actually really hard to do this kind
of experiment because it's it's very rare the cases where
someone is born blind and then all of a sudden
gains their vision back is very rare let alone after
that at that precise moment when the vision is gained
back to have some philosopher scientists then run that kind
of experiment on them so the results were mixed and
it was hard to figure that out now what's interesting
to me is that I always I always assumed that
the answer would be no that the blind man would
not be able to automatically distinguish roundness from-from squareness because
that's something that you have to build up through experience
at least that was kind of my my intuition about
it but it's kind of freaky to think that that
it would actually be that way right if squareness and
roundness are really quite distinct from our our feeling of
them is very distinct from our seeing them because it
tends to we tend to assume I think the common
notion is to assume that the two go hand in
hand and that if something feels round it looks round
and the two are very very coupled so it's actually
interesting is that in 2003 there was a study done
in India where there were five patients that actually had
this rare condition where they were born blind and then
at around the age in adolescence like aged 15 to
18 they were treated for blindness using modern modern technologies
and medicines and they suddenly got their their vision back
and so this was a perfect opportunity to run the
test and that would actually what happened is that they
did run the tests and what they and what they
discovered was that indeed the like the the ability of
the subject who used to be blind and now could
see to distinguish between a sphere and a cube was
slightly above 50% so it was almost like they were
guessing they did slightly better than guessing so what that
basically says is that indeed the two are decoupled and
that your sense of being able to distinguish roundness from
squareness visually is different from your ability to distinguish it
tactically so to me that kind of confirmed my own
hypothesis but it's interesting that that it is that way
right it's a little bit freaky I think the relevance
of this thing beat of this experiment in this whole
Molineux problem besides the fact that it's just kind of
freaky and interesting and fascinating is the fact that what
we think and what we really attribute to being very
real or part of our construct of reality and the
way that we experience it firsthand phenomenologically is really a
lot of construct a lot of a lot of us
a lot of stuff it's not like we're just passively
picking up everything that's coming at us a lot of
a lot of our understanding of reality and really our
whole conception of reality is us projecting a lot of
ourselves onto it so I think that's that has a
lot of deep deep kind of roots and just guess
you to start thinking about kind of what else in
your life are you really just kind of projecting out
there and what are you taking for granted in your
perceptions what are you taking for granted in how you
think the world works what are you taking you know
what what parts of reality that you think are just
really solid and really real are actually just habits habits
that you have so interesting interesting example another interesting example
I'm going to throw out to you is the reverse
spectrum problem also classical philosophical problem kind of along the
same lines as the Molineux problem and this basically just
says that how do we know that two observers experience
qualia in the same way specifically we're talking about color
here so how do we know for example that like
we all agree that this shirt right here that I
have on is red the question is how do we
know that my perception of this color red is exactly
the same as your perception of it well this is
an interesting problem because even though we can take you
know we can take a microscope and we can analyze
the we can analyze the fabric and we can look
at the the light waves bouncing off of it and
we completely understand the whole mechanics of light and optics
and how its picked up in the brain how it's
picked up in the eye and all of that the
fact is that that's not really what the question is
is is concerning the question is more concerning the first
person experience that qualia that we talked about right so
the question is how do we know that my qualia
are the same as your qualia it could very be
the que very well be the case at least hypothetically
speaking that what I'm perceiving as red and what I'm
calling red is what you're actually perceiving as blue but
calling red and we can still completely agree on everything
and our language would work in the real world everything
that we talked about we'd still be able to make
sense of it but we would just have different experiences
and because those experiences are completely first-person completely subjective and
inner and never accessible to either one of us they're
only accessible to the person that's experiencing them then we
would never be able to really compare side-by-side and ever
to be able to to say which which quality whether
there is a difference or there's not even though we're
calling it the same red so what happens is if
all the Reds in your in your reality in your
mind were actually the kind of what what I would
see is Blues in your reality but I would see
them as Blues in my reality but we just we'd
agree on labels so this is an interesting example and
it just demonstrates kind of the trickiness and the slipperiness
of what qualia are and what and I think it
lends some interesting weight to first-person experiences because really the
defining property of them is that they can only be
know on by by the observer so there they're always
private we can only guess that other people know what
we're talking about when we say red you can't ever
be completely sure so that's also interesting in the sense
that it also kind of uh pulls the blanket back
right pulls the curtain back and lets us unless us
think that if that is a possibility then again how
much how much of reality are we really projecting out
there ourselves what if the way that I experience the
world is my world is completely colored differently than yours
it's kind of freaky to think about that like I'm
walking around and looking around and I'm seeing colors and
you're walking around and you're seeing the exact inverse of
those colors and yet we can still communicate and everything
still works just fine and in fact maybe that is
exactly the case yet we assume that everyone around us
sees exactly what we see yet we have no real
proof of that and the the even weirder thing is
that it's not even clear how we get we would
get proof of that the only way to do that
would be to somehow be able to meld like meld
my mind with your mind and do some sort of
inner conscious comparing but there's no way we don't even
know if that's possible or how that would be done
if it were possible so very interesting very interesting examples
that kind of start getting you to really think about
some of the magical properties of consciousness and what it
really is also demonstrates that a lot of the stuff
is not as simple as reducing it down to two
physical two physical things that we would normally consider physical
in the real world and I'm not saying that your
consciousness is some magical woooo thing or a ghost or
whatever but it also is very clear that you can't
just discount qualia completely because there's something that's but that's
quite real and quite important to us especially when we're
talking about first-person experiences so you know what does all
this mean what does this always have to do with
self-development well I think the bedrock of self development as
I've discovered is really self observation is self understanding and
it's easy to discount that because it seems so fundamental
and so basic but on the other hand I think
it's also critical to get it right I think the
trick is that most of us deceive ourselves as to
how well we really know ourselves how conscious we really
are of ourselves we assume that we are but actually
a lot of times where we're quite shocked when we
discover that what we thought we knew was not actually
what we really knew and I think in self-development this
is really important is when you're starting to try to
work on yourself and you're working through your own issues
you're working through your own reactions and your own views
and interpretations of the world and your own beliefs you
start to see like you start to almost see these
fissures in the matrix so you start to see that
your world and how you construct it is really like
living in a matrix and you start to see certain
places where it kind of starts to break down it's
like you start to see these little cracks you start
to see the cracks and you start to see that
really when I'm when I'm what I thought was out
there is actually in here and I'm projecting a lot
of the stuff out onto the world and when you
start to realize that a lot of possibilities open up
for you first of all Youth you start to take
a lot more responsibility on yourself for managing how you
feel for managing your own thoughts your own beliefs and
then you also start to wonder and you start to
really get that very freaky matrix like feeling like you
constructus to get a control and a sense of a
sense of agency over this stuff so stuff that you
thought that was triggering you outside you start to see
like hah that's actually what's actually happening there is that
sure I'm getting provoked from the outside by a certain
stimulus but then the reaction is happening within me and
that reaction is something that you've actually learned to control
and it you know if you like the reaction you
can keep it if you don't like it you can
certainly learn to to kind of override override it and
change the mechanisms to the point where you're having the
same the same sting relation but then the reaction that
you're having is totally different or it doesn't affect you
at all so it can give you almost those kind
of matrix like properties where if you believe it enough
then you start to be able to do crazy stuff
like jump from buildings to buildings and fly and do
this kind of crazy stuff the thing is that it's
hard to even even see that this is possible unless
you start to to really get a lot of inner
awareness and inner development I think that's critical to do
successful self development because you really need to start to
develop a deep understanding of the forces that are driving
you on the inside so that first person that that
first person experience I think that's discounted a lot in
in our society and also in in literature and books
and that kind of stuff because everyone talked about the
external stuff third-person the stuff that's kind of objective and
few people talk about really the subjective experiences which are
still very important you know what are the subjective experiences
that you have of achieving any of the goals that
you want so whether it's earning more money or getting
getting fit eating healthier getting a better relationships you know
what are like the pains and the struggles that you're
experiencing and on also what are the good things and
then getting a better understanding of that getting an understanding
of what exactly you want in all those situations and
what you don't want is is critical and I think
it's very highly discounted in fact there's an interesting an
interesting development here that I want to introduce which is
that a man by the name of Peter Spence key
back in the early nineteen in the early 1900s worked
with another guy who was kind of a European mystic
and his name was go Jeff so Girja finesse Penske
they did some writings and they did a lot of
study on how to how to do personal improvement and
how to do kind of evolution and get personal evolution
personal growth and they did some lecture they did some
but they wrote they wrote some books on this and
one of the books is called I have it here
it's been skis the psychology of man's possible evolution and
really this is a very interesting very interesting text to
go to because it really talks about what it takes
to to evolve yourself as human being and it talks
about some of the nuances of it and some of
the core fundamental problems so I want to what I
want to do here is I really want to read
you some excerpts from it because I think it's it's
really powerful and starts to to frame to frame all
self development because it's not just about going in there
I think the problem with self development and hewed as
just behavior change or going in there and trying to
get you know a quick little fix like losing five
pounds here or getting some more money in your bank
account there I think that's not it can work sometimes
I don't think it leads the best long-term results I
think if you want to look at self development long
term as something they can really transform your life you
have to look at it on that long-term basis and
you have to look at it as something that you
do throughout your life is just you try to better
understand yourself and you try to gain mastery over yourself
which is something that I call self mastery and you
know what is the process of self mastery how does
it work if you're interested in it how do you
go about it so these are all fascinating questions and
then of course what are the challenges of self mastery
so let me read you a little bit of who
Spence Keats thoughts on this matter and if you're really
interested in it you can pick this up and kind
of take it off from there and I'll I'll show
you some of my thoughts about it as well so
here's we dispense key says in psychology of man's possible
evolution in order to become different man must want it
very much and for a very long time a passing
desire or a vague desire based on dissatisfaction with external
conditions will not create sufficient impulse the evolution of man
depends on his understanding of what he may get and
what he must give for it if man does not
want it or if he does not want strongly enough
and does not make the necessary efforts he will never
develop in becoming a different being man acquires many new
qualities and powers which he does not possess now but
before acquiring any new faculties or powers which man does
not now possess he must acquire faculties and powers he
also does not possess but which he ascribes to himself
now this is an important point he clarifies this that
is man thinks that he knows that he has these
powers and that he can use and control them but
in fact he can't man must acquire qualities which he
thinks he already possesses but about which he deceives himself
so this is where it gets interesting the chief and
then there are he starts going through and talking about
some of the ways in which we deceive ourselves and
so I'm not going to go through all of them
because that would take quite a bit of time but
here's here's probably the biggest point so there's a very
important fact and the most important fact in which you
deceive yourself as quote Ouspensky says man does not know
himself he does not know his own limitations and his
own possibilities he does not even know how great an
extent - how great an extent he doesn't know himself
I think this is a really good analogy right here
man has invented many machines and he knows that a
complicated machine needs sometimes years of careful study before man
can use or control it the man does not apply
this knowledge to himself although he himself is a much
more complicated machine than any machine that has ever been
invented so what does all that mean well I think
goose Penske is brilliant Garifuna Spence key what I really
took from them is the importance that if you're going
to be doing self development is the importance of starting
to really observe yourself and what you're doing and why
what you're doing is causing problems for you and the
problems of behavior changes that come about so how does
this really apply to to our everyday lives well it
really means that the powers that you think you have
the willpower do you think you have the consciousness that
you think you possess is actually quite deceptive in fact
what he argues for is that most of us are
walking around in a sleeping days and now we think
that we are conscious but most of the times you
are not actually conscious you are not self conscious as
it might be said so you're going through your day
you're doing routines you're rubbing you're running through habits and
you're acting very robotic like you're acting almost like a
machine even though you would never admit it but the
fact of the matter is that next time you're running
through your day stop just randomly stop throughout the day
and observe the thoughts are going through your head observe
what it is that you're doing kind of observe yourself
and your start to see that oh my god I
was just running through this whole spiel this whole routine
and just now that I stopped I suddenly notice what
I was doing so it starts to get you to
see that your body and that your mind and you
as an organism is really that you are a very
complex machine with a lot of subroutines and a lot
of components that run on autopilot right so you have
an unconscious mind you have a conscious mind but a
lot of times the stuff that you're doing throughout your
day is very habitual very route very routine and so
this this is important to understand when we start talking
about wanting to change behaviors because if you're talking about
losing some weight or you're talking about running your business
differently or you're talking about leaving your job and starting
your own business or you're talking about switching careers well
that starts to involve behavior change and all the forces
that come into play there I think the biggest problem
is that when we start to want some of these
things we don't realize and don't really understand from a
first-person experience what these forces are we haven't identified them
we haven't labeled them we have very little experiencing changing
experiences changing them so then when we do because of
that ignorant it's like a fog that that leads most
people to just kind of grasp around in the dark
try this or that randomly and then leads to failure
just because we're not equipped with the challenges that are
there just even appreciating the challenges is very important so
you know next time you're doing something that you told
yourself that you wouldn't do anymore like let's say you
are on a diet and you're trying to lose some
weight and you tell yourself that you going to be
eating clean and then you run off to the pantry
and you grab a bag of chips and you start
stuffing your face with chips look at yourself doing that
because chances are when you're doing that you're acting you're
acting on autopilot and you're acting and you're driven by
forces that you don't even realize are quite there that
you haven't really inspected so inspect what's really going on
there and you'll see something interesting is that if you're
lucky to be conscious to catch yourself in that moment
you're going to be grabbing that chip out of the
bag and you're going to be putting it up to
your mouth and then you can kind of pause and
just kind of do a little self reflective activity and
just see oh my god what's happening here I have
this chip that's I'm about to put in my mouth
I told myself I wouldn't do this but yet I'm
doing it and I'm driven by by these forces and
then just kind of observe yourself doing it right it's
like the automatic part of you that that is still
running on one of those routines is doing this stuff
and then yet your conscious mind is looking at it
it's seeing it in that case if you are lucky
enough and you kind of summon the fortitude to be
conscious there and yet a lot of times it's still
powerless to do it to do anything about it it's
still powerless to change it and so that's kind of
how its arts is you have to start to see
yourself engaging in these behaviors engaging in these activities and
you have to start to and really appreciate the forces
there because your willpower is limited and your consciousness is
limited you're not always in a high conscious State a
lot of times you're in low consciousness mode or you're
completely unconscious and you're totally on autopilot and yet that's
how most of our lives are lived so to do
effective behavior change to do effective personal growth starting to
see that starting to learn that and then you have
to become clever and tricky with it and really outsmart
your own self outsmart your own biology outsmart your own
thinking patterns because to make an effective change in your
life a lot of times what's required is thinking in
a roundabout way how to achieve your results so instead
of saying that well you know what I'm going to
do I'm going to I'm going to force myself not
to eat any chips ever again and then you're running
on willpower do you think that's gonna that's gonna be
great you think that's the strategy you're going to take
to lose weight and then what happens is you last
out one day you last out two days everything's good
then three days four days five days and then ten
days later on the tenth day well what happens you
start focusing on something else you focus on the on
the problems that you're having at work you focus on
your relationship you focus on something else in your life
and then all of a sudden you find yourself walking
towards the pantry to grab a bag of chips right
because your willpower is starting to is starting to to
drain or you quite simply just start to lose focus
and start to even forget about the original intentions that
you set for yourself so starting to realize that these
are real forces in your own head that you're dealing
with that you're grappling with I think it's very important
to do effective personal change and so the foundation of
it all there's no easy answers here what does all
this mean it just means that you have to become
a lot more observant about your own patterns you have
to start becoming more observant about what you're doing in
your life and really putting a lot more importance in
the kind of feelings that you have kind of beliefs
that you have the kind of thoughts that you have
like a good exercise for example is to just randomly
a few times throughout the day stop and just monitor
your own thoughts drop everything you're doing in your day
and just stop and monitor your own thoughts and then
see what am I thinking right now what have I
been thinking for the last five minutes has it been
a bunch of worry has it been a bunch of
anxious nonsense was I thinking about the fight I had
with my boss was I thinking about the vacation that's
coming up two weeks from now and I was caught
up in that was I having an imaginary argument with
somebody in my head was I thinking a bunch of
negative thoughts about how everything's gonna go horribly wrong tomorrow
at this dinner party that I'm going to so those

finding ways and using techniques to work on that stuff
