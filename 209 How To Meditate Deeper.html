            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/FRUeG9wOaCs' target='_blank'>How To Meditate Deeper</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Beginning stages of meditation</b>: Leo Gura discusses the beginning stages of meditation, advising viewers to simply observe their thoughts, feelings, and emotions without trying to control any of it. This stage, labeled "simple observation," involves letting the mind wander while maintaining consciousness of its trajectory. Any thought or emotion surfacing during this period should not be taken seriously. Regular practice of this stage trains the mind's discipline.
</li><li><b>Intermediate stage of meditation - Active Detachment</b>: In the next stage called "active detachment," the practitioner actively tries to release thoughts that come up during meditation. This involves acknowledging a thought and then letting it go, and repeating this process even if the thought keeps coming up. Patience and perseverance are key in this stage, and it's crucial to remain calm and avoid panic or frustration. 
</li><li><b>Advisory on committing mistakes during meditation</b>: Leo Gura advises viewers not to berate themselves for frequently failing to completely release their thought, as it's normal for it to creep back up. Frustration indicates that the practitioner is taking the thoughts too seriously, opposing the purpose of meditation. He emphasizes avoiding being over-serious about achieving perfect meditation as it can backfire. 
</li><li><b>Importance of regular practice in meditation</b>: Gura stresses the requirement for regular and daily practice of meditation for at least 20 minutes per session, setting aside a quiet place to meditate. Progression into more advanced stages only occurs once one becomes proficient in the current stage. 
</li><li><b>Realization of inability to control thoughts</b>: During meditation, the individuals realize that they cannot control their thoughts. This aspect might lead to initial frustration and annoyance, however, accepting and observing this lack of control is essential to the growth in meditation.
</li><li><b>The optimal time to meditate</b>: The best time to meditate is when mental clarity is at its peak. Gura stresses the importance of accepting all experiences during meditation, including discomfort or distractions as they are a part of the meditative journey. 
</li><li><b>Common pitfalls of meditation</b>: Some common pitfalls in meditation include fighting with oneself, getting caught in thoughts, and becoming overly anxious about doing the procedure perfectly. Taking note of these pitfalls and actively working to avoid them can contribute to a more fruitful meditation practice. 
</li><li><b>Three stages approach to meditation</b>: The three stages of meditation comprise simple observation, active detachment, and 'to be determined'. Each stage lasts for 30 consecutive days and practitioners should move to next stage only once proficiency is achieved in the previous one. This approach prevents the meditation habit from becoming stale and helps gain insights into different ways the mind works.
</li><li><b>Sticky nature of thoughts</b>: Thoughts can often be persistent, surfacing repeatedly even after being acknowledged and released. It's essential not to resist or hinder these thoughts, but rather to acknowledge and then let them go, repeating the process as needed.
</li><li><b>Problem with suppression of thoughts</b>: Suppressing thoughts from arising often leads to frustration and panic. The act of trying to actively prevent thoughts from emerging may also feel manipulative and be counterproductive to the meditation process.
</li><li><b>Understanding awareness</b>: In the advanced stage called awareness focus, the aim is to understand and focus on the phenomenon of awareness itself. A practitioner should recognize that all experiences, feelings, or content arise within the field of awareness, and awareness is separate from the content.
</li><li><b>Sustaining awareness focus</b>: This stage requires maintaining focus on being aware and avoiding being absorbed into the content. When the mind wanders off, which often occurs when one starts practicing this stage, it should be gently brought back to the task of observing awareness.
</li><li><b>Mistakes in meditation</b>: Several mistakes often occur during the meditation process. These include panic and frustration when realizing a lack of control over thoughts, using a smartphone as a timer due to its potential distractions, resisting thoughts that arise, and confusing meditation with daydreaming. 
</li><li><b>Avoiding meditation when tired</b>: Meditating in a tired state is likely to hinder the process as it can compromise mental clarity. Therefore, it's advisable to meditate when in a state of high mental alertness.
</li><li><b>Meditation during optimal mental clarity</b>: Leo Gura notes that the best time to meditate is when one has the highest mental clarity, which could be different for everyone. It could be post-meals, in the morning, or later in the day, depending on one's personal rhythms.
</li><li><b>Accepting everything that happens in meditation</b>: Gura advises viewers to practice acceptance while meditating. Acceptance implies being open to everything, including discomfort or distractions. This may feel counterintuitive, but it's crucial for deepening one's meditation practice.
</li><li><b>Avoiding goal-setting in meditation</b>: Gura emphasizes that while it's essential to have long-term aspirations for meditation, like achieving enlightenment or more peace of mind, one must avoid setting goals for specific meditation sessions. These goals become additional thoughts that prevent the achievement of those very goals.
</li><li><b>Preparing for bad days in Meditation</b>: Not all days are equal; Gura acknowledges there will be days when meditation might feel challenging or not as successful. It's crucial to accept these bad days as part of the journey and not as a reflection of one's capability to meditate. 
</li><li><b>Following a strict schedule for stages of meditation</b>: Gura recommends a strict schedule for practicing meditation. According to him, each stage of meditation should be practiced for 30 consecutive days, with careful adherence to the instructions for each stage. 
</li><li><b>Advantage of trying various techniques</b>: Practicing different meditation techniques is beneficial as it enhances one's understanding of one's mind. Comparing it to trying on different pairs of shoes to find the most comfortable one, Gura maintains that investing a full month in each technique or stage helps determine what works best for the individual.
</li><li><b>Month-long goals for maintaining interest in meditation</b>: Gura proposes setting month-long goals for each meditation stage to keep the practice exciting and prevent it from becoming stagnant. This strategy also facilitates a deeper understanding of one's mind from multiple perspectives.
</li><li><b>Gura's future plans and the power of mastering the mind</b>: In closing, Gura encourages viewers to sign up for the Actualized.org newsletter to access more material on meditation and self-actualization. He anticipates releasing more content in the future and believes that mastering the mind, through practices like meditation, is the key to creating an exciting life.
