            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/xuiCHMVFY_A' target='_blank'>How to Delegate to Your Subconscious Mind</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding subconscious mind</b>: Leo Gura discusses the concept of the subconscious mind and the importance of transmitting tasks from our conscious mind into the subconscious for mastery and stress reduction. He contends that majority of our actions are not consciously directed but are derived from our subconscious, which has been conditioned over time through repetition and experience.
</li><li><b>Reiteration and mastering skills</b>: Gura uses his experience in improving public speaking as an example. He discusses how he is consciously working on elements such as vocal tonality and eliminating filler words. He explains that by repeatedly focusing on these aspects, they start to become instinctual and easy, signifying the shift from his conscious mind to his subconscious. This, Gura suggests, is the process for mastering any skill.
</li><li><b>The illusion of control</b>: Homework, Leo expresses that many of us may operate under the illusion of control where we believe that everything we do is consciously driven. He brings attention to the reality that a considerable chunk of our actions is in fact unconscious and come from our subconscious mind. 
</li><li><b>Conscious intentions and goals</b>: According to Leo, conscious intentions and goals are crucial despite having many of our behaviors controlled by the subconscious mind. He underscores the point that it is essential not to be overwhelmed by maintaining everything consciously. Instead, he urges viewers to trust the process of letting ideas bubble down into the subconscious through repetition.
</li><li><b>Importance of repetition</b>: Furthermore, he emphasizes the power of repetition as the means through which something moves from being conscious to becoming subconscious. Whether it's a task we want to become good at, data we want to memorize, or a skill we want to master, it's all about repetition.
</li><li><b>Delegating tasks to subconscious</b>: In conclusion, he stresses that it's okay, and in fact necessary, to delegate tasks to our subconscious. This lessens the pressure on our conscious mind, leading to improved performance and reduced stress. The key, he reiterates, is consistent repetition, which eventually leads to the desired behaviors becoming instinctual and automatic.
</li><li><b>Repetition and Mastery</b>: Repetition is key to mastering any skill as it helps to instill the skills into your subconscious mind, making them automatic and effortless. Regardless of whether the skill is public speaking, confidence, socializing, coaching, activities related to business, or video-making, regularly repeating it ensures improvement.
</li><li><b>The Role of Repetition in Athletic Success</b>: Observing world-class athletes illustrates this principle effectively. Their incredible abilities result from consistent and intense repetitive practices, drilling skills into their subconscious until they become automatic and instinctual. This allows them to perform effortlessly and optimally, especially when they are 'in the flow', a state where they are completely in the moment and not thinking consciously about their actions.
</li><li><b>Application to Ordinary Life</b>: This principle of repetition and drilling for mastery is not confined to athletics, and can be applied to ordinary life. Skills we are working on, for instance, public speaking, can be improved dramatically by this repetitive practice and by delegating to our subconscious minds. Most of the functions and behaviors in our bodies are handled for us subconsciously, an intriguing yet somewhat unsettling realization regarding the extent of our control.
</li><li><b>Focus of Conscious Awareness</b>: Much of our lives are controlled by our subconscious, freeing our conscious minds to focus on what we deem truly important. The key to success in life lies in choosing where to put that conscious focus, whether it's on unproductive worry, fear, and negativity, or on creativity, improvements in various aspects of our lives, and feeding our minds with valuable information. This deliberate focus combined with consistent repetition will help skills to become part of the subconscious, resulting in effortless competence. 
</li><li><b>Benefits of Subconscious Mastery</b>: When skills are ingrained in the subconscious, performance improves, nerves dissipate, and the act of performing becomes more enjoyable. This kind of mastery cannot be taken away and allows for consistently impressive results. Mastery is achieved by consistently practicing and drilling the desired skill into the subconscious mind using repetition, trusting in the process all the while.
