Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this video,
I'm going to tell you how to stop being jealous.
Jealousy is a very tricky, emotion. Very, very tricky. I'm
pretty emotionally self aware guy, I have a pretty high
emotional intelligence. But jealousy gets me. Not that I'm jealous
that much. But the thing that kind of scares me
about jealousy so much is that it's such a subtle
emotion. And it's so deceptive and tricky and hidden in
the way that it acts that it can act on
you for years, and you don't even realize what's going
on here. So in this video, we're going to talk
about the root causes of jealousy, and also some root
solutions, how to cure jealousy permanently, I have some really
powerful ideas that are going to go to the root
of this problem. So we can really tackle this head
on. And by jealousy, what do we mean, let's get
a little bit specific. So let's throw a couple of
specific examples out here so that we know what we're
talking about. And we're grounding this discussion. It's not too
abstract. So what we mean is, of course, there's sexual
jealousy and relationship jealousy. This means that you are jealous
of your partner, potentially cheating on you or liking somebody
else, or flirting with somebody else, that kind of stuff.
So that's a really common one. Another type of jealousy
is you can be jealous of the status that somebody
else has. So maybe there's a celebrity out there, or
someone in your industry or someone in your business, a
boss, a business partner and employee, a co worker who
has something that you don't have, maybe they've got a
certain charm, certain charisma, certain amount of money, a certain
car, that they drive, whatever, so you could be jealous
about that. You could be jealous about the position they
have the status they have. You could be jealous about
the personality characteristics that they have, maybe you feel like
this person is very attractive, or this person is very
handsome, and you want to be like that. Or he's
very confident and you want to you wish you could
be that way. Or like very funny and you wish
you could be that funny yourself. So there's a whole
slew of different things that you could be jealous about.
And you could also be envious. The word jealousy and
envy. You could split hairs and talk about them as
though they're separate things. And maybe I'll do that in
the future. Right now, I'm just going to be kind
of glossing it all over and saying that there's kind
of one thing, you can be jealous and you can
meet enemies. And the thing with jealousy is that a
lot of times it masquerades as some other type of
emotion. It might masquerade as frustration, or anger or hatred.
It might masquerade as sadness, potentially loneliness. It can also
masquerade as criticism directed at that person or that thing
or that situation that you're jealous of. And it can
come out as demonization. So when you're demonizing somebody else,
you could in fact, be jealous of that person. But
you don't admit to yourself that the reason you're demonizing
them is because you're jealous. And the same goes for
the criticism because really, demonization is just a stronger form
of criticism and judgment. Let's take a look at what
jealousy actually means. If you really look at what's going
on here, you're gonna notice that jealousy is an interesting
emotion, because it's so sneaky in the way that it
affects you. Usually, when you're affected by it, you don't
really know that it's the emotion that you're experiencing. It
might be obvious to other people, but to you, it's
not quite so obvious and may take you a while
to catch on to it. This is actually a really
cool thing, because we can use this against jealousy to
defeat it. And we'll show you how to do that
here in a second. But really, at the core of
it, what's going on when you're jealous of someone or
something is that your identity is feeling threatened. Identity another
word for it is ego. Another word for it is
self. You could also call it, me, me, right? The
person you think you are the thing, this entity that
you believe that you are, this is called ego. Or
this is your identity. You've got a self image in
your mind about what you think you look like, who
you think you are, as a human being whether you
think you're good or bad, what you're strong in what
you're weak at whether you think you're confident or funny
or sexy or handsome or attractive or whatever. You've got
these self beliefs. And it's under this level of the
self image that we really have to work and we
really have to work on your self image and we
have to work on your ego The fundamental thing here
is that you've got this sense of self, that you're
trying to protect this sense of self, it's really a
false sense. It's an illusion. But that's a deep topic
that I'm not going to get into here. I'll mention
it briefly at the end of the video as something
additionally, you can do if you really want to go
deep on this one. But let's just say that you've
got this sense of self. And this sense of self
is a concoction of all these ideas you have about
yourself, all these beliefs you have about yourself. And we
believe that this stuff is very real and solid and
tangible, but actually, it's not. And actually the sense of
self, you also believe that it's very important to your
success and well being in life. And that's also a
lie. This sense of self doesn't serve you in any
way. In fact, it creates a lot of suffering and
problems in your life, one of which is jealousy. So
the fundamental problem here is that you're not really happy
on the inside. And what you've got is you've got
this identity, that you're trying to glorify, and you're trying
to live up to it. But then you're failing to
do that in real life. So maybe you think of
yourself as this charming person. But then in real life,
in reality, you don't get that feedback of being a
charming person, because the people that you're talking to, don't
laugh at your jokes on at the right time that
you want them to. Or maybe you believe that you're
sexy and special. And then you feel threatened, because your
partner is flirting with somebody else. And you thought that
you this, you the self that you think you are,
you really believe that you're this special, sexy, handsome person.
And this person here, your partner is potentially flirting or
cheating on you. And so this makes you defensive. That's
what jealousy does is that always makes you defensive. And
there's various different ways in which this defense mechanism can
get triggered. So one way that it gets gets gets
put out there into the world is that you become
very critical. Or even if you don't say anything, you
could be just saying stuff in your mind. So be
careful about thinking that all well jealousy is only jealousy,
if it's actually getting broadcast into the world. If I
say something nasty or mean, that's jealousy. But if I
think something nasty and mean, that's not jealousy, well, it
still is jealousy, it doesn't matter if the dialogue is
going on, externally or internally. So you got to be
very careful about that. But basically, the reason that you're
that you're getting so bothered by this lack of proper
feedback from the environment, is because you believe that something
really valuable is getting taken away from you. Whether it's
a spouse, a girlfriend, a boyfriend, a car, a job,
a promotion, some status, or whatever you believe is getting
taken away from you. And then somehow, this is really
threatening you. Also, what it could be doing is that
it could be disturbing your self image of yourself. So
you've got this image where you think of yourself in
this particular light. And when you get some evidence that's
contrary to that, that disturbs you, that pains, you that
creates pain. And so what you want to do is
you want to look away, the whole thing you got
to understand about ego is that ego is all about
looking away. It's all about like self deception, the ego
is very self deceptive. And it never wants to really
acknowledge this giant, like ball of bullshit that's inside of
you that this ego is and so this is why
people are pretentious, sometimes they try to impress other people,
they try to appear a certain way, they're not able
to be themselves in authentic because they believe that if
they were really authentic, then people wouldn't accept them wouldn't
love them, or they wouldn't have the success that they
want. So they feel like they have to be always
living up to something extra. It's really a self esteem
issue here. And they don't believe that they can just
be happy on the inside. When you feel this sense
of loss, for example, your partner flirting with somebody else,
you might feel like, well, what if I lose my
partner, what if I lose my wife or my husband,
that's really going to hurt me that's going to damage
my life, that's going to make me feel really bad.
That's something that's very, very dangerous, but I have to
protect myself against. And the reason you believe that not
because that's true in reality, but because you haven't found
the happiness within you. So you're not grounded internally. And
so therefore for you, you are relying on that person
as a crusher, kind of like leaning on that person.
And when you lean on that person, and then there's
a threat that that person will get taken away. Of
course, you fear that you're gonna fall down flat on
your face. And maybe that will happen with you, because
you haven't found the happiest with it. So what's the
ultimate solution to dealing with jealousy? The solution is to
turn within. This is not a problem that gets solved
externally. You're not going to Within the jealousy game, by
going out there and actually defeating that person or that
thing, or getting, you know, one up on them, what
you need to do is you need to actually say,
wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, this
is an internal ego struggle that I'm dealing with. And
I just got to turn inward and look inside me
to see what's really going on with my self image,
my self esteem, my views on reality, my beliefs about
myself and other people. That's where the results happen. So
don't get tricked by your ego to thinking this is
an external problem, it's not an external problem at all.
You have to also convince yourself that jealousy is an
ego game. And that that's pretty much what's going on
here. It's not about the fact that you're actually threatened
in some serious way. It's an ego game. And this
is important to convince yourself because until you convince yourself
of this, then you're not gonna have the awareness, consciousness
and self honesty to look inside and do the work
that's necessary on the inside. To eradicate this jealousy. If
you are able to convince yourself that this is an
ego game, then you're going to start to think like
this. Oh, so it's, it's me, there's like elements within
me that are causing this, let me start to take
a look at my ego, let me start to take
a look inside and get really honest, get very observant.
Because there's some really fishy surreptitious activity going on inside
my psyche, I gotta examine that for myself, get a
deeper look at it, let's take a look at what's
going on. Let's take a look under the hood. And
that's the key once you can convince yourself that looking
under the hood is a good thing. And once you
start to see that all, working under the hood is
actually not as easy as I thought it was. It's
gonna take some real work, then you've got the foundation
set for doing some deep inner work on your jealousy.
And I'm gonna show you exactly how to do that
right now. The other thing I wanted you to convince
yourself of, if you're still not totally bought into this
idea that jealousy is an ego game, is that jealousy
is destructive to your life. It's going to prevent you
from self actualizing, it's going to prevent you from creating
an extraordinary life, it's going to prevent you from getting
that amazing career success that you want. It's gonna hold
you back from having an amazing marriage or relationship that
you want, it's gonna hold you back from being the
best that you can be as a human being. It's
going to make you small and petty, and selfish, rather
than selfless, and noble and large, which is who you
really want to be. There's like this small side of
you. And then there's this big, ambitious, idealistic side of
you, the small conservative side of you, is very petty,
very negative, it's always worried about protecting itself, it's very
selfish. This bigger side of you, is about being magnanimous,
be noble, being kind, being generous, you know, all those
nice things that they preach to you in church, that
kind of stuff. So you have to see that jealousy
is really on this end of the spectrum. And that,
just, you know, if you're living on this end of
the spectrum, what this is going to do is, it's
going to really keep you from living a beautiful passionate
life, you're not going to be able to be an
amazing leader and accompany you're not gonna be able to
accomplish great things in your life, you're not going to
be able to be in the kind of relationships and
interactions with people that you want, you're not going to
feel good inside, if you're always defensive, and on guard,
about somebody screwing you over somewhere, or not getting what
you're deserved, from a certain relationship, or a certain situation
at work, or whatever. So I want you to start
to convince yourself that this jealousy thing is just like,
yes, it's in me, maybe I don't even know how
to fix it yet. But I can see that this
is an important area in my life that I really
should put some attention to and take very seriously. Because
if I don't, then it's gonna stay with me. And
it's going to toxify the rest of my life in
all these different places. So this is just to get
you some leverage to want to do some of this
work that we're talking about. So the, the solution to
the jealousy problem, because jealousy is such a tricky and
hidden emotion, the solution to it is just to notice
it, just start to notice it, start to label it,
that already, you won't believe how much that right there
will already start to turn the tide in your favor.
start to notice every single instance where you actually aren't
jealous. Start to write them down if you want to
start to keeping a jealousy journal or a log. And
you start writing this down to start noticing. And I'm
gonna get into that a little bit more here in
a minute. But before I go there, let's also talk
about it Ah, your vision for yourself as a human
being and for your life, I hope that one of
the values you have is that you want to be
a good human being, you want to be a noble,
self actualized human being, you want to be a big
person, not a little person in life, being a little
person is really pathetic way to live life. Hope you
can see that. I hope you want to be big
person, even if you don't currently know how exactly you're
gonna get there. But you know, that drive is, is
the beginning, it's like that, see, that's gonna grow though.
The oak tree, you need that seed, you need to
plant that seed. And I really want you to ask
yourself, What are your life principles and life values? What
do you ultimately want out of life? What do you
actually like set as a standard for yourself? Because this
is very important. Maybe there's some situation at work or
in this relationship where you really wish you could get
something a little bit more than you're currently getting. But
let's get back to center and get you grounded within
yourself. What are your life principles? What are the principles
by which you're living your life? You know, kind of
stuff like honesty, integrity, excellence, justice, beauty, or whatever, you
know, whatever they are for you, for everyone's a little
different. And what are your top values in life? What
do you really value life? For me personally, I value
understanding I value truth, I value independence, I value excellence.
I value creativity, I love I value purpose and passion.
And value intimate relationships. Value health. So nowhere in my
top 10 values do I find the value of pettiness
or being small or thinking in a jealous way towards
people. And I hope that for you, if you really
get centered right now that you'll see that too, that
nowhere in your top 10 values or principles of life,
will you find this jealousy thing is playing a part.
In fact, you're probably gonna find that jealousy is running
against the grain of what your top noble values are.
And that's good. So the reason that you want this
is because now, when you ground yourself, at least, then
you can see oh, can this I'm a noble person,
I want to be a big person, not a small
person. So the next step is acknowledging that jealousy is
a petty behavior. And it's a behavior, whether it happens
externally or just internally, it's still a behavior. It's a
petty behavior, and then it's below you. It's below your
own standards. Acknowledge this to yourself right now, if you
believe it's true, acknowledge it to yourself. I want you
to also now picture whichever situation, you find yourself being
Jellison, I want you to actually picture now how you
see yourself winning, using the jealousy strategy. So usually, if
the jealousy strategy goes something like this, well, this person,
like, I really, I really hate that person, because then
you're gonna start to criticize and come up with all
sorts of reasons. And you're gonna take maybe some passive
aggressive behavior towards your boss, or towards a co worker,
towards a business partner, or towards some celebrity, or towards
your mate, your your marriage mate, or whatever. I want
you to see like, what are the ramifications of that
picture how it's gonna play out. So you're going to
take this passive aggressive behavior and stance to this person,
you're going to criticize them, you're gonna say how bad
they are, and how stupid they do things and how
they don't understand how you know how life is supposed
to work, whatever. And maybe you're gonna, like, go into
opposition against them, you can like, fight the good fight,
you're gonna stand up for yourself or something like that.
Maybe you have an argument with them, you're gonna yell
at them, or whatever, maybe we're gonna suddenly undermine what
they're doing. Maybe you're gonna sabotage their work, or maybe
you're gonna try to make them feel guilty in some
sort of way. You're gonna do something like that. But
then they'll carry that thought through what's gonna actually happen
as a result of that. What's gonna happen? What is
the objective here this jealousy, this jealousy is supposed to
improve your life, it's supposed to what make you happier,
somehow, it's supposed to give you more of something. So
that if I give you this thing, now all I'm
happy all the sudden, I'm fulfilled. And if I take
it away from you, you feel ah, I'm not happy.
I can't be happy without this thing. I need this
thing. Well, now picture, you're using this jealousy to acquire
this thing. It's going to make you happy. But is
that actually going to happen? What are you going to
acquire? And after you acquire it, is it actually going
to make you happy? How are you going to feel
about yourself using these tactics? What you think it's going
to do to you internally? We think it's going to
do to your psychological state. Is that going to be
able to produce a happy state for you? Or can
you see that it's going to have kind of toxify
everything. It's gonna make everything sour, even if you win,
using the jealousy strategy, you're going to lose. Because it's
going to sour everything. And it's going to go against
your life principles, and your highest values. So carry that
chain thinking through, and I want you to be very
specific, I don't know what your exact situation is, but
I want you to like, sit down and actually visualize
close your eyes and kind of visualize what's gonna, what's
gonna happen, what's the chain of events that you want
to accomplish here, be aware of how you're going to
do it. Because I want you to see that ultimately,
it's not going to get you to where you want
it to get you. Maybe you think that actually, it
will get you there. Maybe you think that well, if
I just you know, if I get my husband back
from from flirting, if I can stop him from flirting
with with all these girls, then that's going to be
me getting what I want. What's wrong with that? Leo,
I got what I want. I'm happy now. But see,
you know, you gotta you gotta carry the psychological reasoning
through. If that's what you're thinking, then you got to
understand that Wait a minute. Well, first of all, I'm
trying to control some person here, controlling a person ever
in life already a huge red flag, don't try to
control people, that's a recipe for disaster. But let's say
you control that person, you manipulate him into doing whatever
you want them to do, okay? But then you have
to keep that control constantly. So what's gonna do is
gonna put you into a fear state all the time,
you're gonna have to be like, in this protective bubble,
where you're trying to protect yourself, what happens if, two
years later, your husband is talking to some cute girl
again, maybe he's not even flirting with her. But immediately
in your mind, the radar is gonna trigger, you're gonna
have this alarm, like, Oh, is it gonna happen again.
And you're gonna have to get defensive and protective. Now,
this state of being constantly defensive and protective, and kind
of caught in fear, trying to protect this self image
that you've got, is that going to lead to happiness,
that's what I want you to really look at. So
if you need to pause the video right now, and
visualize through that process, and then come back here. Okay,
good. So I hope you did that, if that was
necessary for you. The next really important thing that you
got to understand is that you have to recognize that
external things really, truly do not have value to you.
And this is difficult to understand, I have a video
called What is happiness, you might want to check that
out. I'll link it below, which talks more about this.
I have other videos that talk more about this. But
basically, the idea is that no thing actually gives you
value. This is a trick. This is a trick of
the ego. To think that acquiring stuff, external stuff gets
to value. And by value here, we mean a very
important thing. So yes, you can get a car that's
worth $100,000. And you've got $100,000 of value technically in
that car. So that's true. I'm not denying that. But
you have to look at a deeper value here. And
the deeper value is not money, or social status, or
fame or whatever else. But it's happiness. What you really
want in your life is you want happiness, and you
want peace of mind, and you want fulfillment. Those are
not satisfied by external things, even though it seems like
they are sometimes this is beyond the scope of this
one video. So watch my other videos about this. I
also have a great video called How to be attractive,
which talks a lot about this. See, check that one
out, especially if you're dealing with the kind of a
sexual jealousy type of deal. But the idea here is
that actually, if you sit down and you really think
about it, you really study your psychology, and maybe watch
some videos, you'll start to understand that an external thing
doesn't make you happy. And therefore it has no real
value to you. So that thing you think that you're
jealous of this word, recognize that it's not going to
make you happy, even if you get it. If you're
jealous of someone's house or car, if you get that
house or car. That's your ideal scenario, right? Just give
me that house and car and I'll be happy. No,
you won't. If you're jealous of that girlfriend or boyfriend,
and you think well just give me that girlfriend and
boyfriend all to me, and I'm gonna be happy. No,
you won't. You're incapable of being happy. Happiness is on
the inside. That's why we turned inside. From the very
beginning when I said the solution is to turn inwards.
Well, we've turned inwards, which means that external objects are
not important to us right now. What's important to us
is the internal mindsets that we have and we need
to cultivate a happiness from within rather than proper selves
up on something for happiness from without. The other thing
you have to recognize is that other people also cannot
give you value. Now this sparks up a lot of
people's thinking this really goes against them. rate of what
people have been taught or what they think the school
is kind of against the grain of common sense. But
actually, it's also true, that no relationship can actually give
you true value. No human relationship can give you happiness.
It's a little hard to recognize this, watch my video
on how to be attractive for more about that. But
basically, once you start meditating a little bit, when you
start really thinking about how your psychology works, how in
the past, you've interacted with people, and things we should
recognize is that, yes, a human being can give you
some sex, they can give you some comfort, they can
give you some excitement, some fun, you can go to
an amusement park with your girlfriend, or boyfriend or whatever.
Or yes, they can even bear your children for you.
And yes, they can do tasks for you. And yes,
they can give you a job, and they can give
you money. But this goes back to the first point,
these external things these people give you. They're not real
value. And even the so called Love that people give
you. You might say, well, Leo, love, what about love,
I need love in my life. No, you don't need
love in your life. Love is a nice thing to
have, if you can get it on reasonable terms. But
it doesn't make you happy in and of itself. Unless
you're happy already on the inside. You have to be
happy on the inside first. And then the love is
nice. It just amplifies everything takes everything to a new
level. If you get love, but you're flawed on the
inside, you can't be happy on the inside. You've got
self esteem issues and stuff, then that love will just,
you know, improve your state a little bit. But it's,
it's not going to make you happy, you're going to
be miserable. Still, with just a layer of love on
top of it. Miserable love. This is very common. You've
probably experienced this many times and prior relationships. So this
is another thing that you have to like, really sit
down. For me. You know, I recognize this about a
year ago. And it was really not very kind of
contemplative, Zen like meditative state that I kind of recognize
that. Oh, shit. Like, no matter how much I build
up my business, no matter what kind of hot girl
I get in my life, no matter how nice people
are, to me, no matter how well recognized and rationalized
I'd work for matter how many subscribers I have, no
matter how much money I'm making every single month. Even
if I meet all my wildest dreams and all those
areas. I can just like visualize and picture myself, that's
not going to make me happy. It's all going to
be nice stuff. But on the inside, I have to,
I have to be happy on the inside, for me
to truly be happy. So that was a realization that
I had about a year ago, that was very important.
And that's actually something you can recognize, and then you
can lose track of, you can forget about it, it's
easy to forget this stuff, then you can recognize it
again. Six months later that forget about it again. So
you have to kind of like keep bringing yourself back,
that's kind of the point of what we're doing in
this video is we're kind of grounding you, right? And
I want you to be habitually grounding yourself in your
highest values. And to ground yourself in the highest values,
you have to understand that the lowest values are not
really that valuable. They're not going to produce happiness for
you. So how do you actually cure jealousy? Beyond all
this mindset stuff we talked about, really, it's about self
honesty, self honesty, and the practice of mindfulness, I have
a video called mindfulness, you might want to check that
out. I'll link it below, which tells you how to
use the technique of mindfulness. But I want to briefly
tell you how to use it here right now, specifically
for jealousy. So what is mindfulness? Mindfulness is the practice
of simply observing exactly what's happening in the present moment
without judgment. And this is the technique that you're going
to use to dissolve your jealousy. So what I want
you to start doing is I want you to start
noticing, in the moment that you're having your jealousy as
you're having I want you start noticing that you are
having it. I want you to start labeling it. So
the jealousy is happening. You tell us if that's jealousy
in your mind, oh, that's jealousy, right? Let me observe
how it plays out. And the trick here with the
mindfulness is that you don't want to judge yourself, you
don't wanna make yourself feel guilty or bad about the
jealousy that you're having. And you don't want to stop
your jealousy prematurely. What you want to do is you
want to kind of like a hunter observes his prey,
moving through the forest, you just want to watch that
jealousy, do its nasty business. And you just want to
like watch it objectively without trying to interfere. This is
what mindfulness is. It's a pretty simple process, but it's
also very difficult to do because you are so unconscious
when you are engaging in jealous behavior. or just thinking.
So you have to become very observant of this. For
example, keeping a jealousy law, like we talked about is
a great way to practice this. But I want you
to get better at seeing you being jealous in the
moment. Just that right there. If you keep practicing that
day after day after day, week, after week, month after
month, that will endure jealousy, eventually, that will autocorrect it.
But you have to actually stay consistent and be mindful.
You can't just forget about it. You can't just be
mindful once or twice, you got to keep the mindfulness
going. I want you also to start looking at what
are the repercussions and what's really going on here. So
when you're jealous, like I'm jealous that my boyfriend for
flirting with some cute girl, I want you to stand
there and look at what's actually going on. I'm jealous
of him. Why am I jealous of him? I'm jealous
of him. Because I believe that I'm going to lose
something I feel threatened. Now go into that feeling of
I feel threatened. Look into that. I feel from Why
do I feel threatened? Well, I feel threatened because maybe
she's more beautiful than me. Maybe I'm I'm unlovable. Maybe
I got less affection as a kid when I was
growing up, then my sister My brother did. And so
now I feel like I need more love. Maybe I
feel like if I don't get that love, then my
life is not going to turn out the way that
I want it to. Maybe I fear that this relationship
will crumble and I'll be lonely forever. So see, you
got to look deeper into what's going on there. And
you got to start to see that this is you
trying to protect a self image. And notice that the
self image, it's just a big bunch of ideas. It's
not as solid as it appears to be. You can
look through the self image, you can say, You know
what, why don't I just take my self image, my
ego, just set it aside just for a second, set
it aside. And just like be cool with the situation
you can do that just for a little bit, just
start trying it out like that and seeing what's going
on. And see how you feel. Notice how the self
is trying to protect, notice that when you see the
self protecting, and when you're actually looking at the activity,
you're not blind to it, then it starts to feel
very wrong. It starts to feel very petty, very small
of you. And it brings you back to your original
higher principles and values in life. And you tell yourself
something like well, you know, I don't want to be
the small person, I actually want to be like a
generous, magnanimous noble person. So if he's gonna cheat on
me or flirt with somebody, let them do it, I'll
take the higher ground. Because that makes me feel better,
I actually will feel better if I take the high
ground than if I take the lower ground and when.
So this mindfulness practices is the key. Another thing you
can try doing is I actually want you start thinking
favorably, and I want you to start thinking those people
around you that have more than you, or have the
things that you don't have things that you're jealous of.
So if your neighbor has that amazing car that you
want, and you're jealous of, I want you to look
at that car, look at our neighbor and tell yourself
wait a minute. I need to stop criticize this criticizing
this is small petty behavior. Let me stop criticizing him.
Let me just say, Oh, cool. I admire car dude,
electric car. Good job for you got this beautiful car.
Acknowledge that. You don't have to actually verbalize it to
him, you can just do it in your head. And
if you're seeing your man chatting up with some cute
girl who's younger than you, and you feel a little
insecure about it, then you can take a look and
say, Wait a minute, wait a minute, let me let
me stop being defensive for a second. Let me do
the exact opposite of what my ego wants me to
do. Instead of protecting myself, let me open myself up
and say, Oh, she's a really beautiful girl. Amazing, beautiful
girl. She's got a great personality. She's got the full
package, she's gonna find herself an amazing man. I hope
she finds herself an amazing man and gets married to
him or whatever. So this is the activity of actually
doing the opposite of criticism is that criticizing and judging
people you're actually giving them the benefit of the doubt
you're like, you know what, she's probably an awesome person.
Instead of thinking that she's a mean bitch to who's
gonna ruin this guy's life. Your man's life. You can
say oh, she's actually looks like a really wonderful person.
I wish her the best. If it's your boss, actually
Sophia. Well, my boss is doing great. I'm sure he's
going to you know advance in his career or whatever.
And kind of be honest honestly actually. Make yourself wish
that for him that he does well instead of doing
badly. This will go against the grain of what your
Eagle wants you to do. It will be an interesting
feeling. I've actually been trying this lately myself because up
one thing I noticed I was kind of jealous about
Have some of the YouTube subscriber numbers that some of
some of the other kinds of people on YouTube and
YouTube channels have. You know, some people have way more
subscribers than me and I kind of look at that
I'm like, Oh, damn, you know, this person, he's got
so many subscribers, but you know, his videos are so
stupid, and they're so like, pointless and unintelligent. And then
I looked at this person, I'm like, Oh, well, this
person has some other problem with him. He's got so
many subscribers, but he's got this other problem. And so
now, one of the things I'm kind of forcing myself
to do is every time I look at somebody who's
getting a lot of subscribers, is to be like, hey,
like, great, get more subscribers, I want you to get
more subscribers, not less subscribers. If you're doing good, like,
I want you to do good. And this can be
a little bit unnatural, but just kind of forcing yourself
to do this makes you feel so good. Because it
goes so much against the grain of this pettiness that
you're kind of automatically trying to execute. If you're unconscious
about this stuff. I want you to think like this.
I'm a big person. And I'm not a small person,
I'm a big person. So I actually have the resources
within me to allow other people to be successful around
me. It's okay, I'm not stuck in scarcity mindset, I've
got this abundance mindset, I kind of have faith in
myself, that if it's this career promotion, I don't get
it, somebody else gets it. Okay, fine. There's other career
promotions. There's not only one career promotion, and if there's
this, you know, this car, this house that I want
it and somebody else gets it, it's fine. There's other
houses and cars that I can get. And if it's
this girlfriend or boyfriend, who's potentially going to leave me
because they're gonna go with somebody else, we know what,
that's fine, too. I'm cool with that, because I know
that I'm attractive. And I know that I can get
other people, other guys or girls to, to want to
be with me. And I'm big enough to allow that
I don't need to be protective all the time, I
can just kind of like, open up. Rather than being
closed. Force yourself to open up even when it doesn't
feel natural, even when it feels like it's gonna threaten
your security and your sons of survival. Open it up,
because your ego is all about closing you up. Kind
of like a turtle sticking its head in its shell,
that's what your ego is always doing is protecting and
trying to keep you safe and secure and in survival
mode. But what tends to happen is that yes, survival
is important. But also it can become very petty, to
just be thinking about survival all the time, and affect
your survival after a certain point gets amplified by letting
go and sticking your head out of the shell. Because
if the turtle always has its head, and its legs,
and arms sucked up into the shell, then it's not
going anywhere in life, it's sitting still, and eventually, something's
going to come around and eat it. So it's gonna
die. So you can't be so protective all the time,
you have to open yourself up, open yourself up. Trust
that even if someone hurts you, it's okay, you can
deal with it, you're not fragile, you're strong. This goes
back to the issue of self esteem. So if you
have very serious low self esteem, then everything I'm telling
you here, it's gonna seem, it's gonna seem a little
too idealistic for you, it's gonna seem like all believe,
Oh, it's so easy for you to say that. But
for me, you know, I didn't get enough love as
a kid, or for me, you know, I had this
traumatic event or whatever, I don't think of myself in
a strong way. I don't believe that I'm strong. I
don't believe that I'm lovable. I don't believe that I'm
attractive. I don't believe that there's abundance in the world,
I believe that we're in a scarce world, I need
to protect myself. Well, that issue, you know, that's a
deep issue that we'll cover in other videos. So that's
not one we can just fix immediately. But still, the
best way to fix that is to start to open
yourself up. abundance mindset is built when you have a
scarcity mindset, but then you go against it. And you
say, You know what, fuck it, I'm just going to
try to be abundant, be a little bit more abundant.
And as you become more and more, kind of pushing
your abundance comfort zone, then your abundance kind of envelope
expands. So start doing that. I want to give you
a couple of other suggestions that you can use as
techniques to start to work on this. Jealousy stuff. So
we already talked about mindfulness is one key technique. And
I really hope you start learning about that and practicing
and implementing it. You can use mindfulness not just for
jealousy, but for many other things. But here's a couple
other things, which I have videos on, and I'll shoot
more videos on in the future, but I'm not going
to cover them in this video. So one is you
have to start to study ego, how does the ego
function and really this gets you into enlightenment work, enlightened
works really powerful, really deep work. It's the most advanced
personal element work that you can do, and I'll have
more videos about that. But this basically starts to tell
you that your ego is just a big ball of
bullshit. It's just a total illusion. When you start to
see that your self image and self esteem issues literally
dissolve. They go away completely and permanently. This is the
ultimate solution to all self esteem issues, and all self
image issues. You don't want to To build a stronger
self esteem necessarily, what you can do is you can
just literally eliminate the whole issue altogether. So that goes
to the very root of the problem. That's advanced work,
though, maybe you're not ready for that. So something that's
less advanced is just doing self esteem work, self esteem
work, I have a couple of different videos about self
esteem, I'll link them down below, and I'll be shooting
more. But basically, there's a whole slew of work you
can do, you know, therapy work, they can call they
call it shadow work, you can buy books about you
can do exercises, and you can buy self help products
and videos and stuff that will teach you how to
start to work on your self esteem. So check out
my video on that and start maybe doing some of
that self esteem work. affirmations and visualizations can be very
powerful techniques that you can use to counteract low self
esteem and jealousy. So, you might want to check out
my videos on that I've got videos on both positive
affirmations and visualizations that might help you. And lastly, meditation.
Meditation is a really powerful technique. It's a really powerful
habit you should be doing daily, I have a couple
of videos, I have a really powerful video on meditation
that you might want to watch that will help you
set up a daily meditation habit. And if you do
do that, then that will help you with your mindfulness
work throughout the day. Also, it will help you see
that happiness is on the inside, right? Remember that point
about happiness not being in external objects are people? Well,
meditation will help to teach you that it's a little
hard to convey that to you just in a video
just by talking to you logically, it's hard to logically
convince you that you have to, you have to actually
become aware of it as you're meditating. So try that
one out. That's a really powerful habit to build. Anyways,
we talked about so much stuff here, you've got a
lot of different places to start and work with if
you've got this jealousy issue. So there's really no excuse
for why your jealousy should continue. You understand how it
works now. You are not unconscious to it anymore. You're
getting better at identifying it. Now I want you to
start practicing this stuff, and commit to practicing some of
these techniques and get them really ingrained in your life.
Until your jealousy goes away. Stick with it and you'll
do great. Alright, display on signing off, go ahead, post
