[Music] what are hollands that will be the topic of
this first episode which is really the first in a
two-part series on holism and holistic thinking so we're going
to introduce this concept of whole lawns but that's not
really why we're talking about this stuff we're talking about
this stuff because i want to introduce you to holism
and the importance of holistic thinking and what it really
means the bulk of that material will be coming next
week in part two on holistic thinking there's so much
material there to cover make sure you stick around for
that but this here today is the preamble now there's
still going to be powerful and profound stuff here so
don't get me wrong it's all powerful stuff we're gonna
go pretty deep in this episode on the metaphysics and
so forth but uh the more practical stuff will come
in part two so make sure you stick around for
that i've been wanting to introduce this this concept of
holism and what it really means to define it and
to explain it for a long time now we've been
kind of uh beating around the bush and finally here
we are i'm excited really excited to to explain all
of it to you in part two all right so
let's build the foundation here we need some foundation so
this concept of holons this is a concept you want
to learn because i'm going to be using it a
lot in the future and it's going to help ground
your understanding of what holism is about and what holistic
thinking is about so this concept of hollandes was formed
or coined i guess by arthur costler who wrote a
book called the ghost in the machine it's a rather
sort of academic-y sciency type of book do you need
to read it i don't think so unless you really
want to and you want to kind of go deep
on the science and and the philosophy of these sorts
of things uh but if you're just sort of interested
in self-help then you don't need to read it it's
not it's not a self-help book so this concept of
a whole on what is a whole on well when
we look at reality and we ask ourselves what is
reality composed of objects things relationships interactions what atoms right
so we look at these things we look at different
objects in the world we ask ourselves what are sort
of the fundamental categories of which nature is made and
how it works and mankind all the way back to
the you know times of the the ancient greek philosophers
like aristotle and so forth you know they have been
trying to categorize and classify nature for a long time
and this has been a thorny philosophical issue for mankind
like what are the right categories it's not so obvious
what the right categories of thing are like what is
the most fundamental thing in the universe is it the
universe itself is it the atoms that make up the
universe is it something within the atoms is it energy
is it numbers is it mathematics what is it and
so there's been a lot of philosophical debate on this
issue but uh but relatively recently i mean this this
idea by arthur costler has really just it's only like
what 50 70 years old it's not it's not a
very old idea it's relatively new so he sort of
came up with the idea and then ken wilbur took
that idea of hollons and and and really ran with
it and they together basically came up with this notion
that really the fundamental building block of reality is hollands
so what is a hole on a whole on is
both a part and a hole simultaneously so the best
example would be the cells in your body the cells
in the human body or in any any animal body
they're very tiny things but they're still relatively large compared
to atoms so a cell is both a part and
a hole it's a whole on so it's a part
because it's a part of your whole body which your
body would be a whole and it's also um a
hole in itself a cell as a whole in itself
because if you studied a cell in biology class you
looked at those diagrams a cell is a very complicated
thing it's almost like a city it's it's quite amazing
and fascinating all the you've studied all the organelles within
cells if you took biology class you know the mitochondria
the ribosomes the nucleus the envelopes and the membranes and
all that stuff that i can hardly remember nowadays so
um so yeah so there are all those parts and
they're all moving there's a bunch of molecules coming in
and out there's osmosis and various proton pumps and weird
stuff going on in their dna and replication of dna
and every cell is a little bit different they're not
all the same like the cells in your face are
going to be different than the cells in your heart
different than the cells in your brain and so on
so these cells are hollons so what's interesting is that
usually we think of things being just parts or just
holes but not both simultaneously so that's the unique thing
about holons is that they're both simultaneously it's a sort
of a superposition which is uh kind of cool and
nifty as a concept it's both simultaneously it's sort of
a relativistic concept and all of reality turns out is
a nested hierarchy of these holons so my body sitting
here before you speaking to you this you usually would
think this is a hole like this is an individual
object called leo or a human it's sitting here you
would think well that's just that's a hole and that's
it that's where it ends but that's not where it
ends because yes my body is a whole but it's
also a part of a larger thing for example the
entire earth what is the earth usually when we say
the earth we think of just the rocky part of
the earth the earth that was there before there were
humans or animals and plant life but that's not really
the what the earth is the earth like if you
go off you know stand on the moon and look
down at the earth from outer space you're going to
see the entire planet including all the humans on it
all the vegetation all the oceans all the rocks and
i mean if you zoomed in if you had a
uh high power enough telescope you would actually be able
to resolve the people and stuff so really when you're
looking at the earth from outer space in a sense
you're seeing the people it's just the people are so
small that they're you don't see them because they're just
like microscopic little you know below the threshold of the
resolution of your vision but the people are there you're
looking at them so what we call the earth is
not something that's separate from humans humans make up the
earth and so as i'm sitting here before you i
am literally a part of a larger hole called the
earth and so are you if you're on the earth
listening to me if you're some alien in outer space
well then uh come check out earth it's a cool
place but also full of fools so yeah so this
is um so we see this all throughout nature that's
the key insight of arthur costler and ken wilbur is
that when you really start to look at all the
different parts of nature whether you're zooming in or you're
zooming all the way out you're seeing ons everywhere and
the earth itself is you might think well the earth
is is is a whole it's not a part but
it is a part the earth is a part of
the solar system and you might say well the solar
system then is a hole well yes the solar system
is a whole but it's also also a part because
it's part of the milky way galaxy and so you
see it goes up and down in this fashion all
the way up and all the way down so we
could say that every object in reality is actually not
a part and not a whole but a whole on
both simultaneously depending on which perspective you take and that's
what's so powerful about this concept is that it's a
sort of a perspectival relativistic concept and i like to
i like to think of it as as the russian
matroshka dolls that you might be familiar with they nest
inside each other and that's how every object is that's
how cells are that's how humans are and of course
what's interesting about these holons is that they don't nest
as neatly as these matrashka dolls it's a little bit
more complicated than that more messy and more interesting because
for example even though i said that me as as
a human here and you as a human sitting on
this earth were part of the whole lawn of the
earth but we're also part of other hollands so these
hollands are not mutually exclusive they sort of interpenetrate which
was where it gets really interesting so for example uh
i'm part of the whole and hold on of the
united states because i live in america i'm also part
of the whole lawn of my family i'm also part
of the whole lawn of what what else am i
of of let's say the species homo sapiens i'm also
part of the whole lawn of males the gender male
and so i'm part of many many hollands and so
are you and some of them are mutually exclusive and
other ones aren't and they interpenetrate and some of them
are larger whole on some of them are smaller holos
and so forth so let's uh give some more examples
of hold on so you really get a sense of
just how powerful this notion is these holons are not
just necessarily physical objects they can also include abstractions and
mental objects and categories which makes it even more interesting
so of course the most obvious hololens are things like
atoms proteins molecules cells organs the body your family a
car see a car is usually you think of it
as just a whole object but a car is a
is made up of thousands of components and parts and
subsystems within subsystems within subsystems like your car has a
tire or like a wheel let's say uh and then
the wheel has its own sub components it has tires
a tire on it it has the uh the the
bolts that are used to to bolt it to the
to the car to the axis to the axle and
then uh even it has those little caps uh that
that plug the little hole for the air those plastic
caps that you lose and then and probably other components
within that and but the wheel is a pretty simple
part and your car has other sub-systems that are very
complicated like the engine probably the most complicated part of
your car which has a thousand different sub components within
it and then those have more sub components and more
sub components and more sub components like a spark even
a spark plug will have multiple sub components in it
and so it's a very complicated thing but what's what's
uh and each of those that i was describing all
of those are holons even when you get down to
the most basic let's say just a screw or a
bolt in your car you might say well that's just
a part and that's it well but it's not of
course the screw is made up of molecules and atoms
and then those are made up of quarks and whatever
else down there in the subatomic realm you see and
a bunch of intermediate stuff too between the molecules and
the ultimate screw and so what's what's interesting is that
really good design of whether it's biological organic life or
of physical gadgets and objects and machinery machinery usually has
multiple layers of sub-components within it and this is very
handy because this allows sort of modularity to the design
such that if one component breaks the entire thing doesn't
break down so like maybe one part of your engine
breaks but that doesn't necessarily mean that the whole engine
is broken maybe it's just not operating at 100 because
one part broke like maybe one piston broke but your
engine has multiple pistons and then you can replace the
piston keep the rest of the engine and then it'll
be operational again see this kind of modularity is very
powerful you see this kind of design everywhere in phones
and computers any human device that is invented but you
also see it within life forms too you see this
kind of modularity uh i mean it's very apparent these
days with the human body you might think well the
human body is just this one thing it's not made
out of components but it is we do surgeries that
replace organs all the time you can do a face
transplant these days you can replace someone's heart or a
valve in the heart with an artificial valve you can
replace a hip you can even replace an amputated leg
you can sew parts of the body back on you
can lose a finger so a new finger on there
you can take organs from donors of people who who
died you can take their liver you can take their
kidneys and you can install them into your body and
it works it's pretty amazing that that's possible you think
that that wouldn't be possible but it almost works just
like a car or like a computer you just swap
parts around it's pretty amazing so this is this is
part of the power of this sort of hollandic design
of complex systems you see i want you to appreciate
how complex reality is especially in spiritual circles i see
spiritual people and spiritual teachers oversimplifying reality because they don't
like to think very deeply about reality because a lot
of spiritual traditions just tell you to shut up and
shut off your mind don't think about anything and then
in this in a sense that simplifies reality a lot
the more you think the more complex reality gets um
but uh but also like the truth is that reality
is ridiculously astronomically staggeringly mind-blowingly complex there's nothing simple about
anything in reality even the most simplest thing is ridiculously
complex and that's what makes it so challenging to understand
reality accurately and then to manipulate reality accurately because to
manipulate it accurately you have to understand it accurately but
how can you understand it accurately when it has all
these parts i mean just to understand how your car
engine works would take you like months of study to
understand all the parts so well that you can just
swap them out and manipulate however you want it's extremely
complex and a car engine is far from anywhere near
as complex as the human eye or some other biological
thing or even some more complex human invention like let's
say even uh a single cpu intel cpu processor chip
there's so much complexity going on there it's ridiculous how
complex these things are and then not to mention if
we take the complexity of the entire planet as a
whole on i mean the earth is just bafflingly when
you take into account that a single tornado will have
trillions and trillions of atoms in it just that one
tornado and think of how much atmosphere there is in
the entire earth and that's just the atmosphere it's not
counting the oceans it's not counting the brains of every
living being on the entire planet all billions of living
beings with brains human non-human alike i mean it's ridiculously
complex and that's just one little speck within the milky
way galaxy which is just one little speck within the
entire universe it's it's crazy so uh so this complexity
how do we deal with this complexity well well we
need to start to see that these different parts that
they interact with each other in in complicated ways and
the interactions are not all bottom up but also top
down and sideways as well and we'll talk a little
bit more about that as we keep going here let
me get continue the list of hold ons with examples
here so your computer is the whole long as you
know if you've ever built your own computer with all
the different sub-components you can swap them out things like
software programs like the windows operating system that's a whole
on there are so many complicated parts to any software
program that's why they developed object oriented programming which is
very hollow in its approach to how to design software
it's a powerful approach and you can see if you're
a computer nerd the difference between programming languages that are
object oriented and then the older languages that were not
object oriented and how much power you gained with an
object-oriented programming language which is basically showing you the power
of sort of hollandic thinking when it comes to designing
complex systems also something like a sports team is a
whole on think of all the complex interactions going on
within a sports team to make it effective at winning
the super bowl or the fifa world cup or whatever
a city is a hold on a political party is
a hold on a nation is a hold on a
fishery a fishery would be some part of the ocean
or lake or a river whatever where they're fishing certain
kinds of fish commercially and that fishery could be destroyed
by overfishing it or by polluting it entire species within
that fishery could die but there could be multiple different
fisheries you know there could be a fishery on the
east coast on the west coast whatever the economy is
a hold on and then you can have the economy
has sub-hollands within it there are economies within the global
economy there are sub-economies there's the american economy there's the
icelandic economy there's the japanese economy and so forth and
then even there you have sub-economies within that the economy
is a very interesting and complicated hold on to study
and to try to wrap your mind around how that
works of course individual companies corporations are hollands the coral
reef is a whole on and in fact what's interesting
with corals if you've ever studied i i actually used
to grow corals uh my brother grows corals as a
hobby and as a sort of a profession he sells
them too but yeah like saltwater aquarium corals a coral
is actually made up of little little like individual polyps
that gather together and then they grow so a coral
is a coral a single animal or is it many
animals together who's to say maybe there isn't one way
that a coral is and in fact it sort of
makes you wonder once you think about how a coral
works is it even proper to think of a human
as a single animal i mean we think of ourselves
as individual animals but that's sort of a selfish very
uh egotistical way to think of ourselves because really all
of our organ systems are quasi-independent like one of your
kidneys could fail but the other one would still be
alive and still work like one of your fingers could
die from frostbite and then the other fingers they would
still all work or cells within your body are dying
all the time you have millions of cells that are
dying every day in your body they're getting replenished and
replaced really it's better to think of your body as
a as a city than it is to think of
it as an individual physical object the way that we
usually think of it it's more like a city you
know within a city you can demolish one square block
of a city it really doesn't make much difference to
the existence of the city as a whole likewise we
can cut some cells off of your finger it wouldn't
make much difference to you as a whole pretty cool
huh the amazon rainforest is the whole lawn made up
of whole lawns of trees i mean how think of
how many trillions of trees there are in the amazon
rainforest and a tree is already a very complex hole
on each tree has a bunch of bugs crawling all
over it growing on it funguses and other plants and
things so even to take one tree within the amazon
rainforest is all ready to take a massively complex hold-on
and think of how many different trees there are an
island is a whole on a language as a whole
on think of the english language or the japanese language
or all languages all human languages you could even include
mathematics in there as a language perhaps you could include
programming languages in there as well if you wanted to
the entire whole lot of symbolic representation that humans are
so good at and that gets us into so much
trouble and then of course within the language you have
individual words which are hollands and even letters which are
hollows ideas can be hollows a species can be a
whole lot like the species of elephants a pirate ship
is the whole on you've got the ship you've got
the crew on the ship industries entire industries or hollands
like hollywood or the music industry the porn industry the
military industrial complex hold on it's a big pharma industry
the big oil industry silicon valley industry science of course
is a whole on which includes so many different sub
sciences within it biology chemistry physics astronomy the social sciences
psychology and then each of those have many sub sciences
within them just within physics you've got like quantum mechanics
you've got energy physics you've got classical physics you've got
general relativity and you've got astrophysics and blah blah blah
blah a website is a whole on like youtube and
then every video on youtube is its own hold on
even every pixel on your computer screen that is depicting
the video that you're looking at right now if you're
watching this each pixel that's making up my face right
now for you each of those are hollons making up
the larger hole on of the face that you're seeing
there because each pixel is made up of like three
little diodes of red green and blue and other kinds
of variations and combinations but then each of those pixels
itself will have sub components a pixel is not just
one thing it's got different wires in it and other
things that make up one of those diodes the solar
system is a whole on the galaxy is the whole
on of course and the universe as we know it
is a whole on and all of reality we might
say is the ultimate hold on that includes everything so
again this is just a a brief survey you should
contemplate this list and just familiarize yourself as you look
around you as you're driving around going to work and
doing your stuff just look around the room right now
and notice how many hold ons you can see it's
pretty amazing to start to look around the room that
way everything becomes a whole lot like whoa i've got
this new way of looking at that reality that i
didn't have before so let me read to you some
quotes about hollons and how they work there's some there's
some nuances to hold ons here in these quotes and
then we'll talk about them so many of these will
be from wikipedia on the page about holland's they've got
some great definitions and descriptions there so quote a hold
on is a system or phenomenon that is an evolving
self-organizing dissipative structure composed of other holons whose structures exist
at a balance point between chaos and order a whole
on is maintained by the throughput of matter energy and
information entropy connected to other holons and is simultaneously a
hole in itself and at the same time is nested
within another whole on and so it is part of
something much larger than itself holland's range in size from
the smallest subatomic particles and strings all the way up
to the multiverse comprising many universes end quote and then
there's a few quotes here from mark edwards from a
brief history of holland's he writes quote a holon as
costler devised the term is an identifiable part of a
system that has a unique identity yet it is made
up of subordinate parts and in turn is part of
a larger whole kosler noted that in every order of
existence from physical to chemical to biological and social systems
entirely self-supporting non-interacting entities did not exist unquote so it's
not merely that we have these static russian matrashka type
dolls that are nested within each other it's much more
interesting than that because imagine these dolls are interacting with
each other they're not just static and they're morphing and
they're changing all the time such that they're not just
these rigid wooden objects and that they're interacting at multiple
different levels of hierarchy not just in one way and
this gives you a little bit of an idea of
the complexity of what we're dealing with and also helps
to explain why science is so difficult science is difficult
because we're trying to wrap our minds around these ridiculously
complex interactions multiple interpenetrating causal chains going up and down
and sideways throughout these vast hierarchies and making sense of
all that is very difficult that's why science textbooks are
so thick and so dense and full of equations and
then that's just one science book and then you've got
hundreds of those and none of that comes even close
to describing the complexity of reality going on here's another
quote from wikipedia quote an individual hold on is discrete
self-contained and also demonstrates the quality of agency or self-directed
behavior hold ons are self-reliant units that possess a degree
of independence and can handle contingencies without asking higher authorities
for instructions that is they have a degree of autonomy
these holons are also simultaneously subject to control from one
or more of these higher authorities the first property ensures
that holons are stable forms that are able to withstand
disturbances while the latter property signifies that they are intermediate
forms providing a context for the proper functionality for the
larger whole end quote so this idea of autonomy and
community we're going to discuss this more after i read
the quotes to you uh because this is a super
important idea that many people misunderstand because they get trapped
into just valuing autonomy or just valuing community while denigrating
and demonizing the other we'll get back to that point
but for now just understand that a cell in your
body has a certain degree of autonomy and freedom and
individualism but also it's part of a larger collective and
community and it's in communion with all the other cells
and other parts of the body organs and and other
systems that comprise the ultimate whole of the body and
so there are delicate trade-offs between autonomy and community within
all the whole lawns especially within living objects and especially
within higher order hold ons such as cities sports teams
corporations any kind of social stuff what's also interesting about
these holons is that the holons get more complex and
more twisted and more creative as we go up the
chain of holons so a molecule is not that complex
and there's not that much stuff interesting creative stuff that
a molecule can do but a cell can do more
interesting creative stuff it has more degrees of freedom and
then an organ has even more degrees of freedom than
a cell and then a human has even more degrees
of freedom than an organ and then something like a
society or a city or an entire country has even
more degrees of freedom than a single human and then
the entire planet has even more degrees of freedom than
a city or country and so the complexity just grows
at a exponential rate as we go up the chain
of being here's another quote from wikipedia quote every holon
is created by the interaction of forces working upon it
both top down and bottom up since the whole lawn
is embedded in larger holes it is influenced by and
influences these larger holes and since a whole long also
contains subsystems or parts it is similarly influenced by and
influences these parts information flows bi-directionally between the smaller and
the larger systems when this bi-directionality of information flow and
understanding of role is compromised for whatever reason the system
begins to break down holes no longer recognize their dependence
on their subsidiary parts and parts no longer recognize the
organizing authority of the holes cancer may be understood as
such a breakdown in the biological realm end quote so
are you seeing the the trickiness here of how this
works there's a a bi-directional flow in these causal chains
and really it's more than bi-directional because it it goes
bottom up top down and also sideways as well and
in various sort of diagonal directions too in a very
complex system like a living animal organism you see and
it's very important to get all of the balance right
within that system otherwise it all breaks down and collapses
and turns into disease people don't appreciate just the exquisite
order and balance that needs to occur within the human
body just to keep you alive for one minute let
alone for 80 years it's remarkable that our bodies can
last for 80 years especially with how badly we abuse
them and the kind of food and toxins we put
inside of them and they still keep working it's it's
amazing and only when you start to get a little
bit of disease here and there something goes wrong in
your hormone system or some organ in your body starts
failing you start to realize just how delicate the balance
is or maybe you get a little bit of toxin
in you and you realize just how delicate your whole
life is and how exquisitely balanced it is i mean
think about the staggering complexity of of running your body
and the fact that every cell in your body right
now has to be doing something it has to be
doing respiration generating energy converting oxygen pumping out various kinds
of nutrients pumping in the right kinds of nutrients pumping
out toxins replicating handling dead cells sweeping those away i
mean your immune system is doing that recognizing foreign agents
discriminating between foreign bacteria foreign viruses and then the good
healthy bacteria that's supposed to be in your intestines they're
you know in the millions there's a there's there's more
healthy bacteria in your intestines than there are cells in
your entire body that's pretty amazing and there's a a
lot of cells in your body there's like something like
70 trillion cells in your body but there's more bacteria
and then there's good bacteria bad bacteria how do you
distinguish between the two well your body somehow is doing
it using various kinds of holons within whole lawns within
hollands which comprise your immune system then you have your
white cells you know your your t cells and whatever
b cells other kind of cells as part of your
immune system that are doing all this stuff it's it's
insane it's insane what's really going on just to have
you sitting here breathing looking around the room all that
stuff is going on and if just one or two
things goes a little bit wrong in that whole process
it all collapses and you die within a minute that's
pretty amazing so we can learn a lot from life
because as we mimic life in our engineering because we're
engineering mechanical objects gadgets but also more importantly even we're
engineering social systems we're engineering cities sports teams corporations entire
governments and nations stuff like the un where do we
get insights and inspiration how to engineer these things in
a way that is healthy and as stable and as
amazing as the human body see humans are still way
inferior to designing a city or designing a country or
a corporation or a sports team that comes anywhere near
the amazing feats of complexity and harmony and balance and
holism of the human body we're not even anywhere close
to that in our ability to design so there's a
lot for us to study there how did nature do
it the genius of nature is there if you don't
take it for granted you really look and see what
we're dealing with here and then here's another quote from
wikipedia this one is about holarchy the concept of holarchy
so what is that quote a holarchy is a hierarchy
of self-regulating holons that function first as autonomous holes in
supraordination with their parts secondly as dependent parts in subordination
to controls on higher levels and thirdly in coordination with
their local environments end quote so holarchy is basically a
open ended hierarchy made up of hollands so the difference
between a hierarchy and a hollar key is that a
hierarchy is a more simple concept which includes a fixed
bottom and a fixed top it's sort of like a
pyramid it's closed-ended there are units at the very bottom
and there there's like one or two units or whatever
much fewer units at the very top but a holar
key is a hierarchy with no bottom and no top
which means it's infinite so a hierarchy is finite a
hollar key is infinite that's an important point if you've
studied my other episodes about infinity and the significance of
infinity then you understand how the concept of hierarchies is
a is too rigid and limited of a concept when
we're talking about all of reality and we're talking about
infinity and uh different orders and gradations of infinity check
out my episodes understanding infinity part one part two and
other episodes in which i talk about infinity and then
merge this concept of hall our key with that infinity
and then you start to get a little bit deeper
of an understanding and then here's one more quote this
one is from fr capra from the systems view of
life he says quote the web of life consists of
networks within networks at each scale under closer scrutiny the
nodes of the network reveal themselves as smaller networks we
tend to arrange these systems all nesting within larger systems
in a hierarchical scheme by placing the larger systems above
the smaller ones in pyramid fashion but this is a
human projection in nature there is no above or below
there are no hierarchies there are only networks nesting within
other networks end quote so this moves us away from
the rigidity of the concept of hierarchies to the more
open-ended infinite notion of holarchies which sort of frees up
our mind to think about reality in more sophisticated and
complex ways than we were able to think of before
when we were thinking about hierarchies and see when your
mind only thinks of reality in terms of hierarchies and
not holarchies this creates problems because then we create our
organizations like our our corporations and our governments as these
pyramidal hierarchical structures would in fact maybe it would be
healthier and better for the whole if we created them
more holarchically more open-endedly and we viewed them in a
less rigid way such that it wasn't just about the
ceo at the top or the king or the monarch
at the top but a more distributed way of thinking
about things because you see in your body the most
amazing thing about your body is that there's no one
ceo or king that manages your body now of course
you could say maybe the ego is that ceo or
king that would be you but again that's really not
you that's sort of an illusion and that ego by
the way creates all the problems in your life um
but but really your body does a lot of stuff
that you have no awareness or control of that's what's
so amazing about your body you can't control directly with
your will your heartbeat or the temperature of your body
no i mean some advanced yogis develop certain certain abilities
but still the majority of your of your body's functions
are done automatically that means they have more control than
you do as an ego so you might think that
the ego is this king sitting at the top top
of the hierarchy of the body but in many ways
no certain things the ego can do like the ego
can certainly throw the body off a cliff and kill
it so in that sense the the ego has the
ultimate control over the body but at the same time
your body could decide to stop pumping your heart and
you would die just as fast so who controls whom
if you think of only these simplistic hierarchies then that
gives you a sort of a false impression of control
going from the top to the bottom like in a
dictatorship but your body is not a dictatorship and in
fact these dictatorships they're not able to produce the kind
of highly creative adaptable and innovative and robust and well-balanced
systems such as even an ant you couldn't control an
ant through a dictatorial hierarchical scheme or the ant colony
that he's a part of because an ant can't live
by himself he's part of a colony and even though
colony has a queen the queen is not controlling all
the ants so it's this sort of distributed decentralized highly
non-linear very tangled messy system which is an ant colony
and that's what all the most interesting systems are like
and in fact the ais that we're developing now with
these machine learning algorithms and neural networks and so forth
that are mirroring the structure of our brains um they
are these these very complicated tangled black boxes within which
all sorts of interesting not hierarchical but hall article stuff
is going on which we're still trying to wrap our
minds around so here's some key points about hole loans
parts and holes what is a part and what is
a hole this is not automatically baked into the structure
of the universe you might think that somewhere in the
universe it is written that the hand is a part
of the body or that a human is a part
of a city this is not written anywhere it all
depends on your perspective and this is all relative it
depends on how you look at things it's sort of
like you're given a watermelon a giant watermelon and then
you're given a knife and you can slice that watermelon
in an infinite number of different ways you can slice
it down the middle sideways vertically you know depth wise
you can cut different shapes out of it and so
forth and depending on how you slice it and how
you cut it you're going to see different cross sections
different shapes and different aspects and facets of the totality
of that watermelon and so your mind plays an important
role here in how you're seeing hold-ons and sometimes your
mind will focus on the wrong whole or the wrong
part and this leads to wrong thinking and various sorts
of problems within design problems about how to deal with
society and so forth uh just as one example of
this if you're living in a country where the cultural
zeitgeist and how it thinks about reality and human nature
and society is such that they believe that the country
is the most important thing and everybody else all the
individual humans must subordinate themselves to the country and do
what is best for the country at all times and
sacrifice themselves this can become extremely problematic and dysfunctional and
cancerous and toxic and self-destructive as we've seen for example
in nazi germany or as we're seeing today in the
sort of uh authoritarian communist regime in china they seem
to be swinging their pendulum too far towards the community
away from individuality such that they spy on their individual
citizens they abuse them and in a certain sense the
individual citizens of china tolerate that because they have a
different mindset than here in you know in europe and
in the west in america they have different mindset where
they sort of buy into that cultural idea that yeah
we should be sacrificing ourselves for the greater good of
the country but of course the problem with that is
that it can create a lot of dysfunction there's no
freedom of the press you can't criticize the government you
can't criticize the communist party this leads to all sorts
of devilry and evil and abuses and who knows whether
china will be able to sustain that almost certainly they
won't be able to because as china develops and their
level of income rises and luxury rises people are going
to want to demand democracy almost certainly it's just a
question of how how long will it take maybe it
takes 100 years 200 years to get to that point
but after a certain while that system probably will begin
to collapse and it'll need to change because it won't
be sustainable it might be sustainable for the next 20
30 years but then maybe not beyond that and then
they'll have to change and the pendulum will probably swing
in the opposite direction more towards autonomy and individuality where
the individuals will start to value the parts rather than
the hole a little bit more um but of course
we have the opposite problem here in america we have
the problem of libertarianism which is a toxic pathological political
philosophy which is which is sort of the polar opposite
of what they got going on in communism which is
the idea that every individual human is just every citizen
is just an individual and you know don't put any
responsibilities on me i'll just do whatever i want i'll
behave however i want damn the consequences to the collective
it doesn't matter you know i'll own as many guns
as i want i'll park my car wherever i want
i'll not pay my taxes if i don't want and
this sort of stuff and then when you have people
behaving like this it's impossible to create any kind of
higher well-coordinated collective now the libertarian might say well i
don't want to be part of a collective yeah but
you are part of a collective you couldn't be living
and breathing unless you were part of this collective this
collective gives you all of your freedoms laws property rights
these things don't exist without this collective it defends you
against attack from invaders and outsiders the police forces protect
you from theft and rape and other horrible things that
would destroy you and provide you with supply chains of
electricity and food and water and internet and all these
sorts of things none of these things would be possible
without government and so this sort of toxic idea that
has developed in right-wing circles and amongst libertarians in america
especially but in other parts of the world as well
is this sort of toxic idea that you know big
government is bad and small government is good but that's
not the right question the right question is how do
we balance between the different hold ons between autonomy and
community in a healthy way such that we create higher
holes without oppressing the lower you see it's all about
exquisite balance if you take an extremist dogmatic position on
either autonomy or on community whether libertarians or the communists
whatever the chinese communists then it's going to be unsustainable
and we see problems with sustainability both in communist china
and also here in america there are many systems and
and ways in which america is operating which is unsustainable
because it's too libertarian and this could ultimately lead to
the destruction of america that's what the libertarians don't understand
if you want to know more about that then check
out my my deep series called the nonsense why libertarianism
is nonsense where i i talk about that a lot
but see this just shows you that when your mind
is thinking too simplistically and is not understanding this sort
of organic dynamic harmonic essence of what life is the
holonic essence of what life is that it leads to
all sorts of problems especially when you're designing things and
society is something we're designing that's what we don't realize
we're most of us are just living in this society
in this country or as part of the human species
or as as the city that we're living in and
we don't think about the fact that we're designing this
stuff but we are we're either designing it consciously or
unconsciously mostly we're doing it unconsciously which then gets us
bad results it gets us school shootings it gets us
pollution it gets us criminality it gets us drug abuse
it gets us war it gets genocide it gets racism
all this sort of stuff this is all stuff we're
designing usually unconsciously and that's why it's so ugly most
of the time so one thing you should notice is
that the more holistic the design the more it takes
into account the harmony between the holes and the parts
the more it sees the interconnections the more it balances
the different levels of causal chains and interactions the up
and down um causal changes sideways diagonals and all these
and then it interconnects them in a in a harmonious
way the more amazing of a device or machine you
can create and sustain like the human body some more
key points about hololens so there is coordination and unified
action and it's not just every man for himself it's
not just every part for himself but in order to
get this coordination and unified action there need to be
sacrifices made by the individual hold ons so a part
has to sacrifice some part of its autonomy it can't
just do whatever it wants the little cell right here
in my pinky can't just do whatever it wants it
has to follow all the other cells when my brain
sends a signal through the nervous system here to move
the pinky you know left or right up and down
it has to obey those rules it also has to
sort of obey the laws of physics it can't just
do whatever it wants is to follow the laws of
physics in order to to to create this unified thing
called a hand right every muscle has to obey a
muscle in my body can't just do whatever it wants
whenever it wants if it did i would have muscle
spasms and we would call that some kind of disease
and it would inhibit the functioning of my body you
see how this works now consider yourself as an ego
as an individual animal human this chimp that you are
consider sort of extrapolate out from this analogize and consider
what kind of sacrifices do you have to make as
an individual in order to fit into the larger hole-ons
of which you're a part like your family your religious
community or spiritual community your university your corporation your sports
team your city your country and the entire human race
see you can't just go out and do whatever you
want you can't just walk into walmart and take a
on the checkout counter can't have that we need to
have laws and rules against that but hopefully you don't
need external enforcement of those laws and rules you don't
need a policeman there policing you on every checkout counter
so you don't on it hopefully you're wise enough to
see that there's something larger going on here aside from
yourself maybe you feel like taking a sometimes just wherever
but you realize well i gotta sacrifice my desire to
take a whenever wherever i want with with concern for
the larger whole because there's a certain a sort of
order a higher order that we're trying to establish as
a society within that walmart you know we don't want
to be walking into a walmart where people are on
the checkout counters we don't want to do it ourselves
because if everybody started doing it we wouldn't like that
either if i'm going to check out counter i want
to be sure there's no smeared on the checkout counter
now as obvious as this sounds i'm not telling you
anything new but the problem is that most people haven't
really thought deeply about these very simple obvious things because
even though it's simple in this extreme example that i'm
giving you might say well leo nobody would ever do
that well you'd be surprised what they do in china
but but but the reason they don't do that is
because we have a culture that has fed our mind
with certain ideas that instruct us not to do these
things we will get publicly shamed or ridiculed uh we
will feel embarrassment and we learn all these basic things
in school usually in elementary school we start to learn
this sort of stuff then there's very complicated peer pressure
forces acting upon us and remember culture itself is a
hold on and culture has sub-hollands or subcultures within it
see and there was a separate culture within your family
see your family taught you certain ethics morals values rules
standards and principles that you just absorbed unconsciously and that
you adhere to blindly without ever thinking about it see
you probably never even asked is it even a good
thing that i'm not allowed to take a anytime i
want maybe that actually hurts my body maybe my digestive
system isn't working properly because i'm holding my in all
the time maybe busy have you thought about that because
sometimes your culture programs you with ideas and rules that
are not so healthy now maybe in this walmart example
it's a healthy rule it's good that you're not allowed
to take a anywhere you want anytime you want but
maybe there are other things that are dysfunctional for example
the libertarian political philosophy that's been programmed into you by
whatever youtubers you like to listen to or whatever or
podcasts talk radio maybe that ideology is creating dysfunction maybe
this idea that every american should be able to own
an unlimited number of guns maybe that's not such a
good idea for the whole but you see if you
take the position that i am the most important thing
in the world in the universe and that there are
no hold ons above me and that any other hold
on above me is just trying to oppress me take
away my freedom and my liberty if that's your approach
that's the same approach as one of the cells in
my body deciding that it wants to replicate itself and
leech all of the other resources in the body it
wants to steal all the calories and take all of
the immune cells for itself and replicate itself damn everything
else and that's called cancer and the problem with that
is that not only does that kill the rest of
the body eventually it also kills that cell which relies
on the rest of the body but that cell only
began to do this replication process in a sense because
it didn't see how it fit into the larger hole
and it refused to sacrifice itself for the larger hole
so sacrificing yourself a larger hole doesn't mean that you're
going to be a slave to the whole that would
also if if it turned into slavery that would be
oppressive and that would be pathological too so we don't
have just two choices here either absolute freedom in the
libertarian sense or slavery and tyranny there's a delicate medium
balance that needs to be exquisitely struck and it's really
difficult to strike that balance well that's the challenge of
government and politics we've had governments all over the world
that were way too oppressive and tyrannical that were unsustainable
and had to be overthrown and led to lots of
misery and suffering and on the other hand we've also
had social organizations that were too lacks too libertarian-like too
loosey-goosey didn't have enough laws rules structures and that led
to all forms of exploitation evil enslavement and so forth
for example right now in america and in most parts
of the world there's not sufficient regulation over the powers
of corporations and these corporations are basically able to do
whatever they want and they're able to exploit the out
of a majority of the citizens they're able to basically
practice predator predatory capitalism and predatory marketing to sell and
milk money from the citizenry and the government isn't really
doing much about it because it can't because it's been
co-opted and corrupted by these corporations and so rather than
having tyranny of a king or a monarch which we
don't have in america that we have tyranny of of
of libertarian uh anarcho-capitalism effectively and plutocracy so it's all
about striking that exquisite balance and most humans are really
bad at doing that it takes wisdom to know how
to do that there's no algorithm that tells you how
to strike this balance there's no mathematical formula there's no
simple procedure that's the whole intelligence of life and reality
is figuring out all of these balances in all of
these infinite different situations and we as mankind are placed
right in the nexus of making these decisions you see
when it comes to evolving your body you didn't make
any conscious decisions for how to organize your body how
the cells are going to work you know what the
heart is going to do how many times it's going
to be you didn't make any of these decisions it
was all made for you by the universe and you're
just coasting off of that you're taking it all for
granted but now the universe gave you an opportunity with
this body since this is the brilliance of the universe
the beauty the universe designed this body and then gave
you this body so that now now the universe is
sort of putting upon you this this interesting question of
like what are you gonna you do with this body
and this mind because the mind is part of the
body uh what are you gonna do with this how
are you gonna use it and can you create something
analogous to what i created with when i created you
can you do that yourself and achieve the same kind
of exquisite balance that i achieved to create you so
that you could create something else and transfer that beauty
throughout the universe at higher and higher orders it would
be sort of like a really good analogy is imagine
if i was a really good drawer and i took
a pencil and on a white piece of paper i
drew a human and then i drew for him a
pencil and i animated that human such that he can
then and i gave him the off the autonomy to
then draw his own drawings and then i would see
can he draw as good let's say i'm a master
drawer i can just do everything perfectly if i draw
him perfectly can he then also learn how to draw
something else perfectly that's that's the amazing thing that's going
on here and it's not easy or trivial for that
little version of me because i basically drew a version
of myself on this paper that little version of me
to learn the wisdom and intelligence that i use to
create him to then create something else as holistic and
harmonic as what i created when i created him so
you have to be very careful in how you think
about where you sacrifice for your collective because you can
also sacrifice for your collective in dysfunctional toxic ways for
example tomorrow the gov the american government could declare war
on iran and issue a draft and draft you into
the war potentially and this war could be predicated upon
you know a need to get iranian oil or some
you know some stupid reason like that now am i
telling you that you should go and sacrifice yourself for
america in order to kill iranians and and perpetuate this
war no see that would not be intelligent that would
not be wise that would not be the right balance
so you can't just be a a sheep in the
herd and just walk off off the cliff when the
whole herd decides to go off a cliff you got
to be part of the herd because you can't avoid
living without the herd as a as a social animal
humans are very social and everything we do is social
so you can't avoid being part of the herd but
what you can do is you can be independent enough
to avoid the you know collective madnesses that come every
every generation whether it's with war or with religion or
with genocide or with racism or whatever it is you
can avoid those you can stand up and say no
to those you could say that's wrong that's that's a
that's swing the pendulum too much in the opposite direction
see with the with these hall our keys there's no
clear controller of the system and this is what many
conspiracy theorists get wrong is they they they they tend
to have a worldview that thinks that there's a a
small number of people sitting at the top of a
pyramid that are controlling and manipulating the events of the
world but that's not really what's going on now that
doesn't mean there can't be some conspiracies there can be
certainly a group of people can can gather together and
conspire to assassinate jfk certainly that's possible in fact that's
that's basically what happened there i imagine i don't think
it was a single gunman but anyways so that's certainly
possible but what you have to understand is that nobody
is really controlling this thing it's it's a deeply twisted
inverted strange loopy circular causality sort of system so like
for example who controls the us government is it the
head politicians is it the president is it the speaker
of the house is it the senators sort of but
not really none of them individually has that much control
over anything no individual senator can pass almost anything even
the president has extremely limited abilities to do stuff as
we've seen lately with the trump administration even as as
awful as trump was and uh as sort of uh
you know as much stuff as he wanted to push
through with executive orders there's only so much he can
do many of them are struck and down struck down
by by courts checks and balances and so forth there's
very little an individual senator can do and so in
a sense blaming them for the collective actions of america
is rather silly like when you blame an individual senator
for us going toward iraq an individual center doesn't really
have that that much responsibility and then you have to
ask but how did the senators get there who gave
the senators and the the president power well it was
the people so isn't it all ultimately the people who
are to blame so like if there's some president you
don't like let's say you don't like donald trump but
who elected him the people now you might argue that
well he didn't win the popular vote and all this
well i mean fine uh but there were other presidents
you don't like who who did win the popular vote
so what the fact that you're ignoring is that it's
really the people who are giving the power to the
politicians or then controlling things who you're mad at so
who are you really mad at you're mad at yourself
you're just not seeing it right because to see it
you need to have a holistic understanding and you would
need to appreciate the sort of circular causal chains that
are going on now you might say oh leo but
that's just that's just sort of the the uh all
a facade government really the control of the government is
in the deep state and in the you know the
rich and powerful jews or whoever who are who are
controlling the world uh so this this sort of these
conspiracy theories right but but this is this is completely
delusional because no single billionaire i don't care how rich
he is has that much control over society or the
world jeff bezos elon musk these people they don't have
that much control over things and even you may say
well but if we get 20 of them together then
they have control and not not really you can get
20 billionaires together and they still won't have that much
control now could they do some scheming and manipulating and
be evil together sure of course they could and they
do um but they don't really control nearly as much
as you think and again who gives them power where
do they get their money from again from you you
probably shop on amazon pay jeff bezos's salary see so
it all goes around circularly such that it's not clear
who's in charge because there is nobody really in charge
of course that doesn't mean everyone has equal power not
at all some people have way more power than others
and i'm not saying that the power structure we have
now is optimal it's very far from optimal it's very
dysfunctional but we can't make it functional and optimal we
can't find that exquisite right balance until we come to
an understanding of how complex and multi-dimensional this whole causal
chain is how circular it is and we also make
sure we include ourselves in that to take responsibility for
it right see one of the one of the most
idiotic attitudes you can take is to be mad at
your government for doing things you don't like and then
blaming them because that creates sort of a duality between
your government and you you are your government now of
course that doesn't mean that you individually can stop a
war or change the present or something but that's the
nature of how holons work right an individual cell in
my pinky can't do very much in terms of changing
the body it can't just like decide to you know
do whatever the hell it wants and that's not a
bad thing so of course to start to realize how
you are just a a whole lawn within many larger
hold ons above you this this requires humility and a
letting go of one's ego because by definition the more
egotistical you are the more selfish you are the more
you believe that the whole world revolves around you and
therefore damn everybody else i'm just going to do what
serves me this kind of selfishness is the very definition
of evil and this is what leads to all the
suffering and problems and ugliness in the world so to
have a well-balanced harmonized system the individual holons and elements
within the system need to have a proper humility and
to know their proper place which requires selflessness so the
only reason realize this the only reason your body is
able to function and to generate the ego that you
are that you think is so special and so important
is because every part of your body is in a
sense selfless your heart is selfless because it just pumps
when it needs to pump and it doesn't just take
a break whenever it wants you would think that the
heart gets tired doesn't it deserve a break no it
doesn't deserve a break because if the heart takes a
break that will kill the body and in turn that
will kill the environment for the heart the heart can't
exist without a outer body protecting it and supplying it
with food and oxygen and nutrients and immune functions and
so forth you see so in a sense the heart
is wise enough to understand that it needs to keep
working for the sake of the body and that that
is not enslaving the heart that's actually allowing the heart
to exist see obeying the laws of your country like
paying your taxes rather than trying to cheat on your
taxes if you're selfish you want to cheat on your
taxes because you feel taxation is theft and then you
become like wesley snipes and then they they throw you
in jail if they catch you um but but see
that's necessary because if we didn't pay our taxes if
everybody was like wesley snipes then we couldn't have a
military to defend us against invaders we couldn't have roads
couldn't have electric system couldn't have schools fire departments police
and many other things that we all need and without
these you would be living in such an awful community
that you yourself as a libertarian you might think you
would want to live in such a community but you
just don't understand that this community would be so awful
it would be full of so much theft and rape
and violence and exploitation and slavery that you yourself would
denounce this community and start your own new community with
some laws and rules that are more strictly enforced and
taxation to pay for all those um enforcement mechanisms it's
just that you haven't thought through how everything is interconnected
and that is the that is the key to holistic
thinking which we're gonna talk about much more in part
two we're just we're just getting started here and you
can see just how interesting and and profound already this
is and how many implications this has if you're a
designer if you're gonna design anything in your life if
you're an engineer if you're uh even like a web
designer software programmer a lot of this is designed if
you're an architect if you're even a politician because a
politician is basically a designer of society that's what a
politician is or at least should be this term social
engineering has has gotten sort of a negative connotation uh
but actually social engineering is exactly what we need more
of we need to be less political and more socially
engineery think like engineers selflessly so this sort of selfishness
creates pathology within the holarchy but at the same time
if you're too selfless then you can't survive so how
do you strike that balance well that is the whole
dilemma of life that's why you're alive that's why you
have a brain that's why you have consciousness is to
figure that out that's the game of life is figuring
that out so don't look for a simple algorithm or
some ten commandments to tell you how to do it
that's where you're gonna become conscious do conscious work do
all the self-development work and then you're gonna be one
of the best people on the planet at doing that
and still you'll make mistakes but but it'll be a
lot better so it's important to remember that holes are
not automatically more important than parts and parts are not
automatically more important than holes and that the causal connections
that we're talking about here tend to be circular tend
to be strange loopy tend to boomerang on themselves tend
to backfire and they tend to be not just bottom
up but top down and sideways and diagonal so we
could say that every whole on seeks some degree of
autonomy to do its own thing and individualism and every
hold on seeks some degree of community see you might
think that you want to maximize individuality and just to
be purely individual but actually you don't want that you're
not going to be happy doing that for you to
be happy as a human you want to find a
balance again an exquisite balance between individuality and community you
want to engage with others in friendships in sexual union
in relationships and families and so forth in teams in
corporations you want to do all that even like when
you interact online on twitter or in the youtube comments
section or on facebook that's you engaging in community when
you leave your little stupid troll comment that's you actually
getting some value and pleasure out of community otherwise you'd
just be sitting at home alone and that would get
boring for you so you don't want to you don't
want to be purely individual to be like a pure
individual you'd have to go and like live in the
middle of the forest all by yourself for the rest
of your life you would be miserable most people would
be miserable they actually wouldn't be able to handle it
they would have deep depression and some existential crisis even
some people who do that they still they have loved
ones they have family they go see and so forth
in order to just to tolerate being out in the
wilderness for a year or two even monks who live
in monasteries they're part of a community it's not one
monk it's a bunch of monks ramen and maharshi he
didn't just live in a cave by himself he had
a whole village that basically grew up around him and
gave him a sense of purpose and meaning and community
now of course he probably could he was probably so
awake that he could have just lived by himself and
been happy but but nevertheless he didn't do that why
didn't rama and maharshi just tell everyone to off in
his village and just go live literally in a cave
by himself with not talking to anybody clearly because he
found some value in community even though he was supposedly
very enlightened um but also you don't want to get
too lost in community there's the opposite problem of getting
too lost with your family getting too attached to your
family too tied up with their stuff this is a
big problem for people or getting too wrapped up in
a romantic relationship such that it becomes codependent and toxic
and you lose your own sense of values and priorities
and life purpose just to be with the other person
this can also happen with your country or with your
religion you can become too attached to dependent too merged
into your country or your religion such that you're not
thinking independently you're not acting independently and this leads to
all sorts of horrors and evils there's a further wrinkle
here i have for you and this is where it
gets really practical there's a difference between males and females
the masculine and the feminine there's maybe a better way
to put it uh in what they seek and value
autonomy or community so the feminine values community more the
masculine values autonomy and individuality more this these are generalizations
it doesn't always have to be this way and remember
some men can be more feminine and some women can
be more masculine and all of us value these things
to some degree it's just a matter of finding these
balances and they're general trends but generally the male mind
the masculine mind tends to want to assert itself in
the universe tends to want to control and to dominate
and the feminine wants to be part it wants to
surrender to the universe not to dominate it but to
be dominated to surrender in a healthy way and to
be part of a union and so that that's what
many females are looking for in relationships and with marriage
is they're looking for that sense of community with the
guy they're looking to for a stable guy that they
can surrender to in a healthy way and of course
the guy is sort of interested in that but at
the same time the guy wants his autonomy uh and
sometimes females don't understand the male's need for autonomy and
independence and sometimes males don't understand the females need for
surrender and community and so there's uh there's sort of
a there's pathologies on both sides in both directions oftentimes
a common problem men have in romantic relationships is that
they're too afraid of commitment and uh of intimacy with
the woman they want to have sex with a woman
but they don't want to get too intimate because they
they start to feel that they're losing their sense of
individuality autonomy they're getting tied down that sort of feeling
and so you have to work past that if you
want to have good relationships with women as a man
and then with women it's a different problem it's that
the woman tends to lose herself too easily to the
man and to sort of become like a doormat or
become relinquish her own values and sense of priorities and
life purpose to the man and then not really have
her own she gets lost in the romance and in
the love of it and then and then that becomes
a problem for her because if the man leaves her
or cheats on her she can't stand on her own
she can't take care of herself and she becomes too
attached so the male is generally too detached the female
is too attached so we have to we have to
learn to compensate for our weaknesses and for our strengths
so this idea that individualism is an absolute good or
collectivism is an absolute good or that libertarianism is an
absolute goat or that socialism is an absolute good this
is all nonsense it obviously doesn't work if you look
throughout history we have a long record of extreme individualism
and extreme collectivism and both of them fail miserably so
what you need to see is you need to sort
of rise above that go meta don't get don't get
caught up in the in the war between the individuals
and collectivists that you see in the news and on
in politics and on tv you got to rise above
that and start to look at the situation from a
higher sort of a holistically informed perspective to see the
the true complexities here of the situation it's not about
capitalism versus socialism it's about rising above that and looking
for for higher transcendent metastructures and systems beyond those two
that will address the limitations of of each one without
succumbing to the pitfalls of the other and a perspective
and an understanding that is more complex more holistic and
more self-aware and more selfless than the the previous two
systems so be careful about demonizing one side or the
other or getting lost in these culture wars or these
partisan debates now that doesn't mean that both sides and
all these debates are equally wrong or equally right both
sides are usually partial one side could be more wrong
and more selfish than the other side but that still
doesn't give you license to demonize them that would be
doubling down on the mistake and this i see the
same sort of problem happening in in the gender wars
in trying to understand male and female attraction uh i
see that men and women both struggle very much to
understand the opposite sex and to understand especially how sexual
attraction works and how how different it is for males
and for females and then demonizing the other for it
so you got to be very careful not to get
wrapped up in that so evolution is made of hole
ons gaining more and more complexity with new levels emerging
and you have to recognize that humans are not the
highest hold on in the universe we tend to act
that way because we're so narcissistic and egotistical and we
like to pretend that the whole universe revolves around us
to the point where we actually believed at one point
not that long ago that literally the earth was the
center of the universe and that humans have dominion over
all the animals and everything else of course this is
obviously self-biased and when a whole on behaves in this
sort of narcissistic egotistical selfish manner it becomes a devilish
hold on and then all sorts of suffering and pathology
ensues which is what we're seeing all around the world
all right so one of the solutions to mankind's problems
is to just start to acknowledge culturally that humans are
not the highest hotline and that we need to have
humility and to realize that we need to make some
sacrifices to fit properly into the ecosystem that we're a
part of with the animals the fish the plants the
planet and then the solar system and beyond what happens
when we meet aliens we're going to try to think
we're better than them and that's going to create all
sorts of new problems so we need to upgrade our
thinking such that by the time the aliens come here
which they probably will at some point then we got
to be already at such a level that we we
can coordinate with them and understand that we're not going
to try to dominate them and they're not going to
try to dominate us but that it's about finding this
sort of holiday balance so reality is an infinite chain
of hollands which is what a holarchy is a holarchy
is multi-dimensional non-linear relativistic it's groundless it's centerless it's bottomless
it's topless it's infinite and it's strange loopy if you
don't know what a strange loop is that's sort of
a technical term go check out my episode called reality
is a strange loop where we talk about that sort
of escher-like circular causality that is very fundamental to the
way that reality works and now i want to sort
of move on and introduce an additional interesting topic here
an ancillary topic but it ties in with holland's this
is the notion of the indra's net this is a
concept from hinduism and from buddhism which which is which
is a very powerful concept indra's net is this idea
that the ultimate structure of the universe is this um
sort of web of orbs think of them as mirrored
orbs that are all networked together to each other they
extend infinitely out in all directions and they mirror each
other because they're like mirrored spheres such that every orb
contains the reflection of every other orb and you can
see a few images depictions artistic depictions of what that
might look like now of course don't take these too
literally this is not literally what it looks like this
is just a metaphor to help you to start to
think more holonically and more holistically about how the universe
is so under the materialist paradigm under the sort of
ordinary classical science we tend to think of the universe
as just this rigid material set of physical objects that
build upon each other you know atoms cells organs humans
cities planets solar systems galaxies and up and so forth
this is a very outdated way of thinking about the
universe you need to replace this image with this image
of indra's net where instead you see hollands that are
non-linearly interconnected with each other and that contain and reflect
parts of each other within themselves and that this is
the real structure it's a much better way to think
i want to read you a few quotations here from
wikipedia about uh indra's net describing indra's net because there's
some beautiful descriptions of it within various buddhist and hindu
texts so wikipedia here is quoting some of these ancient
hindu and buddhist texts so here's one example of that
quote the manner in which all dharmas interpenetrate is like
an imperial net of celestial jewels extending in all directions
infinitely without limit as for the imperial net of heavenly
jewels it is known as indra's net a net which
is made entirely of jewels because of the clarity of
the jewels they are all reflected in and enter into
each other at infinitum within each jewel simultaneously is reflected
the whole net ultimately nothing comes or goes if we
now turn to the southwest we can pick one particular
jewel and examine it closely this individual jewel can immediately
reflect the image of every other jewel as is the
case with this jewel this is further more the case
with all the rest of the jewels each and every
jewel simultaneously and immediately reflects each and every other jewel
added to an item the image of each of these
limitless jewels is within one jewel appearing brilliantly none of
the other jewels interfere with this when one sits within
one jewel one is simultaneously sitting in all the infinite
jewels in all 10 directions how is this so because
within each jewel are present all joules if all jewels
are present within each jewel it is also the case
that if you sit in one jewel you will sit
in all the jewels at the same time the inverse
is also understood in the same way just as one
goes into one joule and thus enters every other joule
while never leaving this one joule so too one enters
any joule while never leaving this particular joule end quote
that's a mouthful you see it's this recursive fractal interpenetration
which leads to the deep connectedness and unity and holism
of the universe so holism is baked into the very
structure of existence is what we're saying and this quote
by the way was from from patriarch duchun quoted on
wikipedia there's another patriarch quoted there who uses a metaphor
of the golden lion statue in describing the structure the
ultimate structure of the universe and so i'm going to
quote that to you here this is from patriarch fazang
and he says quote so here he's describing this golden
lion statue the golden lion statue represents the universe at
its highest level so here he says quote in each
of the lion's eyes in its ears limbs and so
forth down to each and every single hair there is
a golden lion all the lions embraced by each other
and every hair simultaneously and instantaneously enter into one single
hair thus in each and every hair there is an
infinite number of lions the progression is infinite like the
jewels of the celestial lord indra's net a realm embracing
realm ad infinitum is thus established and is called the
realm of indra's net end quote now you might think
that this is just cute stories and metaphors but actually
if you become ridiculously ridiculously conscious levels of consciousness that
are superhuman that you probably could not imagine the kinds
of levels of consciousness that you can experience on breakthrough
doses of psychedelics you can become so conscious and i'm
speaking now from direct experience i've had the experience of
literally looking at my hands in one of these states
of consciousness and realizing that my hands contain and are
made out of because my hands are made of consciousness
so are yours everything's out of consciousness that my hands
literally contain every animal every tree every human idea and
concept that are literally making up the structure of my
hands so even though it might seem like i'm sitting
here on planet earth looking at these biological hands actually
no i'm sitting inside of an infinite mind looking at
the hands which are made out of infinite consciousness and
literally these hands the consciousness in these hands is the
same consciousness that is imagining kangaroos and hippopotamuses and rhinoceroses
and humans and aliens and planets and gods and everything
and all of that is contained within my hands and
literally you can be so conscious as to look at
your hands and you can see the rhinoceroses and the
atoms and the molecules and the humans you can see
your mother's face inside your own hand how's that for
a trip now you say leo that's some crazy trippy
stuff that can't be real that's just a hallucination right
wrong because everything is a hallucination that's what you don't
understand see the earth itself is a hallucination your body
is a hallucination and so what you're hallucinating is completely
relative and completely arbitrary and it's completely fluid one minute
you can be hallucinating this the next minute you can
be hallucinating yourself as a kangaroo and uh so uh
there's nothing preventing you from literally seeing your mother's face
in your hands and that will be as real as
her real face that you believe is somewhere wherever you
believe it is see when you become so conscious that
all these distinctions of materialism uh are erased all the
boundaries are erased then then you really start to trip
consciousness is tricky is well it's tricky and it's trippy
it's both the problem is that when most people trip
they don't take their trips seriously it's not that they
take their trip seriously they don't take their trip seriously
enough that's the problem it takes a deep wisdom and
intelligence to actually really accept the metaphysical and epistemic implications
of your trip and if you want to know more
about how that works and the whole metaphysics behind psychedelics
go check out my episode how psychedelics work where i
explain all that so now we come to the final
subtopic here as we wrap up and that is that
i want to stress the point that reality is groundless
this is utterly fundamental if you want to understand reality
and this is a huge mistake that many academic scientists
and intelligent people make is they assume that reality has
a ground this is the problem of science religion and
philosophy is that it seeks almost always it seeks to
supply a ground to reality different philosophies and religions and
sciences will try to ground reality in different things mankind
has always sought to ground reality because otherwise reality is
groundless and when you realize truly understand and you truly
realize that reality is groundless um yeah it feels like
you're losing your mind it feels a bit like you're
going insane because how do you explain what it is
when you have nothing to anchor it to so what
do i mean by ground and groundless let me give
you some examples so for example physics has tried to
ground reality into things like atoms or strings or quantum
mechanics or energy or information or simulation theory or multiverses
or the big bang or dark energy so what we
mean when we say a ground for reality that means
like if i ask you clearly you're seeing some object
right here i'm holding up my hand you're seeing my
hand or if you're listening to this you're hearing my
voice so clearly you're some kind of object now where
did this object come from you have to explain it
somehow because if you can't say where it came from
this is a very very big problem for you because
it is very mysterious and in fact it it's it
causes an existential crisis for your ego because your ego
needs to be able to explain where it came from
so usually we take this whole process for granted and
we just assume that well we we came from from
the earth or from the pairs or whatever uh but
see the the problem is that if you if you
keep going back through this causal chain the mind wants
to create these causal chains and it wants to say
well you know i'm ultimately made of atoms that's just
what i am just atoms and what are atoms are
just energy and what is energy well it's just information
and what is information oh maybe it's a simulation in
the computer somewhere see and then and then our mind
gets tired of this and just says well we don't
we don't really know it's too complicated maybe science will
figure it out in the future right now we just
got to say we don't know this is the standard
game that mankind has played at any time that mankind
has come up with a ground that ground has been
debunked so the ancient greek philosophers said that everything was
made of atoms well then we figured out no atoms
are divisible and have sub-components so then so then they
said well it's not made out of atoms it's made
of quarks but then we realize that even quarks seem
to be divisible and maybe they have something smaller in
them we just can't see it but sometimes the grounding
is not just on downwards it's also done upwards you
might say well where do we come from well we
came from the universe from the stars we're all made
out of stardust right this is a common sort of
scientific explanation we're made of stardust and where does stardust
come from well it came from the big bang and
where did that come from well we don't know see
it keeps happening so on the one hand we want
to construct a ground but at the same time if
we dig deeper into the ground we realize it's actually
groundless every ground you look at and question if you
don't question deeply it'll serve as a ground but it's
really a pseudo round it's a it's an illusion it's
really something your mind comes up with as a placeholder
to say ah just shut up already and move on
with life stop asking stupid questions stop wasting time with
philosophy but if you probe deeper using philosophy and contemplation
and inquiry then all these grounds reveal themselves to be
absurd and ridiculous and none of them are the ultimate
ground within mathematics for example they tried mathematicians try to
ground the universe in numbers and equations and of course
this is ridiculously transparently self-biased because of course the only
reason a mathematician thinks the universe is mad at numbers
and equations is because he's good at manipulating them and
he enjoys them that's the only reason the universe is
not actually made of numbers or equations that's just a
projection of the mathematician's mind similarly you could try to
ground reality biologically you could say well it's actually animal
consciousness that's what reality is or it's it's body living
bodies living beings that's what reality is made up or
it's the brain really you know a lot of people
when you when you push them into a corner on
this issue they will say well it's all it's all
neurons in the brain that's what it really is but
then where's the brain say oh the brain is somewhere
in in space in a it's in a it's in
a uh it's in a vat like a like a
jar suspended in some sort of liquid brain and a
vat scenario but where is this vat and uh what
kind of space is it occupying in time and so
forth you see so you keep pushing the problem back
further and further but with no resolution this is a
game that the ego plays the ego tries to play
this game to convince itself that reality has a ground
because the ego needs that in order to ground itself
the ego literally is looking for an anchor for its
own self because the ego needs to believe that it's
real so how does the ego believe that it's real
by telling itself that it's the brain or that it's
mad of atoms or that it's the body or that
it's energy or information or that it's a simulation or
whatever a brain in a vat all of that is
imaginary because the truth is that reality is groundless it
has no ground why did you ever assume there was
a ground why would there need to be a need
to be a ground after all for reality to have
a ground that would be a very limited reality why
would reality limit itself to a ground for example if
reality was made of atoms that would limit reality that
means reality could only be whatever those atoms allow it
to be why why would reality do that to itself
if reality was just animal consciousness in a brain it
would be limited to whatever neurons can do in a
brain that would be very limited why would it do
that to itself you also ground yourself in history not
just in science for example if i ask you you're
sitting here this moment right now listening to me but
where did you come from where did this moment come
from you're going to say well it came from the
previous moment from the this day today came from yesterday
and yesterday came from the day before and that came
from the last decade in the last decade and the
last decade until you get all the way down to
your birth and then you say i was born and
then i say well where were you where does your
birth come from and you say well it came from
my parents but your parents didn't exist before your birth
your birth was the birth of your parents you get
that so the ego is trying to ground itself in
an idea of a birth of your life story of
your parents of a ancestry and lineage you say well
my where did your parents come from i might ask
you and say well they came from their parents and
where they come from well they came from our ape
ancestors oh yeah but where they come from well they
came from ancient mammals and where they come from well
they came from uh from little reptiles and things and
where they come well they came from fish and those
came from bacteria and microorganisms and where they come from
well they came from organically assembling molecules in the oceans
somewhere we don't even know uh and where did those
come from well they came from the earth and where
did that come from well the stardust and where that
come from well that came from the big bang and
where'd that come from well we don't know but all
of that came after your birth you see you want
to ground your birth in the big bang but the
big bang is something you learned and invented after your
birth likewise you want to ground your birth inside your
parents as though your birth came from your parents but
your birth didn't come from your parents your parents came
from your birth you get that your ape ancestors they
didn't come before your birth they came after your birth
so where did your birth come from do you even
have a birth or is your birth just a memory
that your ego invented to anchor your sense of sanity
and existence because if you realize that your birth is
just imaginary then what is this doing here what is
this how did i get here if my birth didn't
bring me here that gets a little closer to enlightenment
if you think that way you might think i'm just
joking or being cute with you but i'm i'm being
deadly serious and literal your birth is imaginary it didn't
happen likewise with the with the parents you think that
caused you and your your big bang so but that's
for another topic i've discussed that kind of stuff elsewhere
i don't want to get too crazy metaphysical with you
here um so my point is though that any way
that you think that reality is you made that up
you imagined it so if you think reality is energy
you imagined it if you think reality is the big
bang or stardust you imagine that if you think that
reality is atoms you imagine that if you think reality
is numbers you imagine that if you think reality is
science you imagine that so then you ask well leo
then what way is it and of course the way
that it is is no way other than how you
imagine it reality is imagination and what is imagination you
might ask it's whatever you're imagining you're asking me to
help you imagine what imagination is but that's just more
imagination you can't go you can't go underneath imagination because
that's all there is you might say but leo what
is imagination made out of it must be made of
atoms or neurons right energy isn't imagination energy no energy
is imagined but isn't it atoms no atoms are imagined
but isn't it happening in space no space is imagined
but isn't it happening in a human body and a
brain from a ape creature that was born on a
planet no all of those are imagined you can't get
underneath imagining stuff see the problem here is that you
want to confine reality to a finite thing you want
to say reality is like this and not like this
but the nature of reality is that it's infinite it's
an infinite i'll argue so it's not limited to being
this way but not that way it's always it's any
way that it wants to be reality is being however
it wants if reality wants to be a human believing
that it's a brain that was born to parents on
a planet called earth that is 14 billion years old
in the universe if that's what the universe wants to
believe and imagine that's what it becomes now if you
want to change your mind if the universe wants to
change its mind and imagine that it's a kangaroo living
a thousand years in the future on the planet mars
that's what it'll imagine and that's what will be true
and real for it until it imagines something else and
then when it imagines nothing then it'll be nothing and
there's no way that it can't be because it can
imagine everything because it's infinite imagination if you want more
on that check out my episode called what is reality
where i explain that in more detail so reality is
not made out of objects reality here we're going to
use some fancy language look at this reality is an
infinite holographic fractal mindscape otherwise imagination infinite imagination it's infinite
because it has no limits it's holographic what does holographic
mean holographic is basically just another word for indra's net
where every piece of itself is contained within itself so
a hologram is if you don't know a hologram is
a picture uh if you take a holograph holographic picture
it'll have like a picture of a whatever a bouquet
of flowers if you take a hammer and smash this
picture into a bunch of little fragments each fragment you
might think well in an ordinary photograph each fragment would
just be a piece of the of the bouquet of
flowers like sort of a jigsaw puzzle right you break
it apart little pieces but in a hologram when you
smash it with a hammer you get little fragments every
fragment still contains the full flower not a piece of
the flower the full flower and if you break that
piece with a hammer again to break one little broken
shard into more shards that shard and its shards sub
shards will all contain the original flower so no matter
how many times you break it it'll still contain the
full flower or the full bouquet of flowers in this
case now that might seem like it's impossible but it's
not impossible these holographic images actually exist now you might
ask leo if i take a hologram like there's a
hologram on your visa credit card if i take it
and cut it with scissors it's not gonna it's not
gonna display two images you can actually try it it
won't that's because it's not a true hologram the hologram
on your visa card is sort of a fake hologram
and most most holographic images that you see at novelty
stores and such they weren't true holograms a true hologram
is actually pretty expensive and difficult to make they make
it with lasers and such things and there's some complicated
science to it um sort of the science of holography
you can read about it on wikipedia if you like
but anyways the point being is that the hologram from
which the hologram on your visa card was made in
the original that is not on your visa card but
somewhere in some laboratory that original is actually a true
hologram and if you broke it with a hammer it
would actually exhibit this holographic behavior but consciousness is infinitely
holographic which means that every every corner of consciousness contains
every other uh aspect of consciousness so this coordinate in
space right here contains as much consciousness as this coordinate
space here and it could independently imagine an entire universe
if it wanted to that's the power of consciousness now
see this this seems sort of outlandish it might seem
like i'm talking about science fiction here not reality but
this is reality and you can become directly conscious of
these things for yourself so you don't have to believe
me here i'm not selling you on some ideology you
can become conscious and validate everything i'm telling you here
so you can actually become directly conscious of the fact
that consciousness is everything you can become conscious that consciousness
is infinite you can become conscious that consciousness is holographic
you can become conscious that consciousness is fractal you can
become become conscious that it's all one mind therefore i
call it an infinite holographic fractal mind space think of
it as the universe can imagine any scenario it wants
as a whole the universe is not limited to being
built up of little parts like lego bricks the the
universe is from the top down the universe can imagine
any scenario it wants for example if the universe wants
to imagine that it's a human in the 21st century
it can do that it takes it no effort in
fact that's what it's doing right now with you if
the universe wants to imagine it's a kangaroo living in
australia 10 million years ago you can imagine that no
problem if the universe wants to imagine that it's a
rock sitting on a hill it can do that it
doesn't need a brain it doesn't need life it doesn't
need evolution it cuts through all that to imagine whatever
it was evolution is something the universe is imagining the
21st century is something the universe is imagining you are
something the universe is imagining that's how you got here
you imagined yourself into existence not something in fact that's
not the right but that's not the right way to
put it you didn't imagine yourself into existence you are
currently imagining yourself into existence and you always have been
now you might wonder but leo why can't reality have
a ground maybe one day science will find the ground
maybe we haven't found it yet we need better instruments
better particle colliders better microscopes and we'll find the ground
you will never find the ground because it has no
ground you might say well how can you be sure
you haven't scoured the entire universe to know that it
has no ground right wrong i have because you are
the universe you have the ability to actually literally become
conscious of the entire universe thereby scouring the whole thing
thereby leaving no corner unturned and therefore realizing it has
no ground the buddhists also call this the groundless ground
if you want you could call it the groundless ground
when you realize it has no ground that sort of
becomes the ground the ground is that it has no
ground although if you make that the ground that's not
the true ground the the dow that can be spoken
is not the true dao that's what we're talking about
here anything you say is the ground is not the
ground so even when i say it has no ground
you might say well but that's a ground and then
what i will say is that no that's not the
ground that's just symbols and words the words are not
the ground you might say well then that's the ground
and i said no that's just a thought that's also
not the ground you say well what is the ground
and i say there is no ground you say ah
so that's the ground and i say no that's not
the ground and this goes on forever infinitely see reality
cannot have a ground because if it did it would
be finite and if reality was finite it wouldn't be
one and it couldn't exist it's impossible for anything to
exist other than infinity a finite thing cannot exist by
itself you can't have one thing without everything this is
a key insight you will one day come to if
you're serious about this work is that the only way
to have anything is to have everything you can't you
can't be biased you need everything you can't have an
asymmetry within reality so another way to put this is
that reality is perfectly and infinitely symmetrical which means that
if reality was made of atoms that would be a
bias and an asymmetry it would be wrong and it
couldn't there couldn't be atoms without being other stuff and
you might say well maybe it's energy well you can't
have energy without also other stuff and that's also a
bias and an asymmetry ultimately you realize it's all of
those things so people sometimes wonder well it's it's a
miracle that we're here it's a miracle that the universe
exists at all well in a sense yes but also
in a sense no and uh you know the logical
mind wants to know what caused the universe where did
it come from and the answer of course is that
it always was it didn't come from anywhere and you
might say well but how could it always be that
seems magical and impossible well that's the kicker is that
infinity is magic it is the impossible made possible see
for the universe to exist the only way it could
exist because it is one is that it had to
create itself and the only way the universe could create
itself is if it was infinite because it requires infinite
power because what it has to do is has to
it has to break the very rules of logic itself
to go backwards in time to cause and create itself
before it even existed it's a mind this is the
ultimate strange loop that i'm explaining to you where you
came from where everything came from where you came from
is using infinite power you created yourself you created yourself
before you existed therefore causing your existence without this infinite
power nothing could exist with this infinite power everything can
exist so there is not even a possibility of anything
not existing there's only the possibility of existence that's the
top logical absolute nature of infinite power or of infinity
or otherwise known as god so what i'm telling you
is that for anything to exist literally what is necessary
is the infinite power of god infinite powers necessary to
bring even a single atom into existence that's what the
scientists and materialists and rationalists and atheists don't understand see
everyone keeps looking for a ground for reality but the
reality is that all you're doing when you're looking for
a ground is you're just unraveling the infinite fractal that
you yourself are as god you are god wondering where
you came from and as you look outside of yourself
you are literally inventing a back story to explain where
everything came from and literally you're seeing it is the
backstory created in real life so for example if you
if you go look into a mirror right now your
bathroom mirror you might think that you're looking at yourself
that is a backstory that is being imagined by you
to help you to sort of unravel the fractal the
infinite fractal that you are if you uh if you
go travel to the edge of the universe you might
wonder maybe i'll reach the you know some ultimate answer
to the to the source of the universe by by
reaching its edge as you're traveling through space you're looking
around you're seeing stars and dust and whatever else is
out there aliens and stuff as you see all that
all that is doing is unraveling the fractal of you
see the nature of this infinite mind is that if
you keep asking it questions where did it come from
where did it come from where to come from it's
always going to keep creating more backstory more backstory more
back for it's an infinite backstory it's sort of like
if i told you you know luke skywalker exists and
you would say well where did he come from me
as the writer the author i could just keep inventing
an infinite baxter i could say well he came from
darth vader his father anakin skywalker he might say well
where did he come from well he came from uh
you know he came from tatooine and his mother you
know and he was he was made by the medicalrians
and the emperor or whatever and then where did the
emperor come from well he came from some other sith
lord who invented him and where did that guy come
from well he came from somebody else and would just
keep we can keep this going can you see that
we can keep this going forever we can also make
it perfectly consistent with itself such that the perfect the
story is perfectly consistent with no contradictions in it whatsoever
so this is what the infinite mind is doing is
it's constantly unraveling this infinite fractal of everything you see
around you so that you keep getting more and more
answers finite answers all your answers are finite because the
nature of the infinite is that it spawns infinite finite
stuff and so that's what you're seeing around you and
the trick is to realize and to grasp the whole
thing at once right what you're doing is you're unraveling
it piece by piece by piece and you're ending you're
chasing your tail in an infinite circle so what needs
to happen you need to grasp the entire thing as
a whole that's what enlightenment basically is grasp the entire
thing as a whole instantly grasp that your god creating
yourself and stop looking for a ground find the groundless
ground realize that there is no ground because you're infinite
and you can keep asking more questions forever you can
keep doing science forever you can keep doing history forever
it's just story you're imagining stories it's an infinite dream
and in this dream you can navigate the dream forever
in all directions and it's perfectly consistent uh it's made
up of infinite infinite hold-ons in all directions and uh
and then what you're not getting though is that you
are the ultimate hold on so there actually is an
ultimate hold on and the ultimate hold on is you
i the ultimate hold on is i not the ego
eye but you and not the ego you but i'm
talking about the the god you the god i so
in the bible there's a famous quote where um was
it moses maybe it was moses or one of the
one of the prophets you know has a communication with
god on the mountaintop somewhere or whatever um or maybe
it was the burning bush i forget and uh and
anyways he has this conversation with god and then he
wants to he wants to run back to his his
his you know his fellow villagers or whatever and tell
them about this amazing conversation with god that he has
and then and finally he asks god you know before
leaving he's like well who should i tell them you
are and uh and god says i am tell them
i am that's it that's the whole highest hold on
so what happened there was that moses or wherever this
this dude was i forget his name he communed he
opened up a channel to the highest hole on which
was of course himself he was stupid he didn't understand
this he was actually talking himself um so he opened
the channel to his own higher self which is god
and then his higher self told him i am and
so that's that but he didn't really understand and his
and the people he told also didn't understand and the
people who read the bible also don't understand so you
are the highest hold on there's nothing higher than you
but i don't mean the human you that's a false
hold on so it's tricky here with these holons because
there's multiple planes and dimensions within which they operate so
you might think that leo i can't be the highest
hole on because the highest hole on is the universe
as a whole like the big bang isn't that the
highest hold on it's like 100 million light years across
or something isn't that the highest hold on no because
that's happening within the higher hold on of your consciousness
it's happening to you and so the the whole trick
here that this is the thing that is so counterintuitive
that's so difficult for scientists and materialists to understand is
that the highest hold on is not the physical universe
it's you you've you've cleverly hidden that from yourself by
by imagining yourself to be an animal or a human
or a brain or something like that that's that's a
trick that you've played on yourself in order to instantiate
yourself as a human so you're imagining you're you're cosplaying
as a human you've been cosplaying as a human your
whole life oh yeah that's how tricky you are so
god everything that's happening right now god is an infinite
hallarc fractal hallucination here it is consciousness can subdivide itself
infinitely subdivisions within subdivisions within subdivisions within subdivisions for more
on that see my episode called guided exercises for understanding
infinite consciousness where i guide you through some visualizations for
that and uh and lastly reality is unity through division
reality is a unity that's infinitely subdivided that's what these
holons are all about and for more on that see
my episode called division versus unity where i explain that
in more detail all right so finally what should you
do about all this to bring it back down to
earth first of all start to notice hold ons everywhere
spend some time really internalizing this whole on concept with
your direct experience next notice how deeply interconnected everything is
keep noticing that not just once but keep doing it
every day for for years keep seeing the interconnectedness of
life and reality and everything start realizing how just how
miraculously interconnected everything is this is so important and then
this will tie in with the holistic thinking that we'll
be talking about next time next notice that the whole
is more than some of its parts reality is not
just an assemblage of a bunch of lego blocks thrown
together in a box it's more than just a bunch
of building blocks or a chemical soup it's more than
some of its parts start noticing how everything you're interacting
with is more than the sum of its parts also
of course notice yourself as a whole on both as
a human hold on because the human whole on is
not the highest hold on that's the delusion that's the
ego but also notice yourself as the god self the
pure i the i am that you get from self
inquiry and from awakening and consciousness and enlightenment and non
duality notice that that eye the non-human eye the witness
of everything that that nothingness that emptiness notice that that
is the highest hold on uh also catch yourself engaging
in reductionism we didn't talk about much reductionism here but
we'll talk about it in part two uh reductionism just
basically the the opposite of of this sort of hollandic
thinking where you're trying to boil everything down to just
atoms or something simple like that like you're you're boiling
down society just to humans or you're boiling down corporations
just to the employees a corporation is more than just
its employees a society is more than just the humans
that make it up a planet is more than just
the physical matter that is making it up so notice
yourself engaging in various forms of reductionism also start caring
about holes that are higher than you if you're a
very narcissistic and selfish person and you're barely struggling to
make it in life and you're driven by your personal
cravings then you're so preoccupied with yourself and how to
survive that you don't care about anything beyond you no
higher holes you don't care about your city you don't
care about your local government you don't care about the
federal government you don't care about the world you don't
care about the environment you don't care about animals you
don't care about your family only you that's a very
bad way to live instead start opening up your circle
of concern actually caring for holes higher than you as
though it was you start to care about your community
as though it was you start to care about your
family as though it was you start to care about
your city and your society the whole planet and the
whole universe and eventually you're going to literally expand that
out to to care about the whole universe that will
put you in the perspective of god the difference between
god's perspective and a human's perspective even though a human
is just god cosplaying um the human perspective is just
very narrow whereas god's perspective just is so wide that
it goes full circle and just becomes everything that's the
only difference and the reason god is good the highest
good is because it it has the highest most holistic
concern for the well-being of itself and everybody that is
a part of itself also start caring about the parts
within your whole this is also a problem that immature
underdeveloped people have is that they're fighting with themselves all
the time it's all like they're schizophrenic one part part
of your mind wants to jerk off another part of
your mind wants to go out and pick up girls
another part of your mind wants to get married another
part of your mind wants food another part of your
mind wants to do self-development work another part of your
mind wants to meditate and you're you're scattered and split
everywhere and then usually you pick one part to the
exclusion of other parts all your parts are warring with
each other even in your body you might have a
part you know you might be part of your mind
wants to work real hard but then your body is
another part of you that is running down it's getting
sick but you're pushing yourself because you want to work
and you know become rich or something and then this
fragments you creates disease physical disease mental disease all sorts
of spiritual diseases and so forth so start caring about
your part start caring about different parts of your body
start caring about different parts of your mind there might
be parts of your mind that are scared that are
um wounded and hurt and angry they need to be
healed and how do you heal by unifying stuff and
how do you unify stuff by caring about it see
if you don't have love and compassion for the for
the wounded part of your psyche maybe that inner child
you have that was bullied and abused back in elementary
school well that part is still a part of you
it's a part of your eo it's a fragment of
your ego but you've never really looked at it loved
it accept it and embrace it and healed it therefore
it's acting out like a little angry child and it's
ruining your life and it's not allowing you to discipline
yourself or to do the other higher stuff you want
to do because it just wants it wants some security
you want some comfort it wants some love it wants
some approval maybe some girl in school told you your
nose was too big and now you're living with that
you know that wound and um that needs to be
healed by actually maybe caring about your nose maybe you
think some part of your body is ugly that means
you're not accepting it you're not loving it you're in
conflict with the different parts of your body even not
to mention your own mind uh also be careful judging
demonizing and dismissing parts of reality this is a huge
huge trap everywhere you see this you see this in
business in politics especially you even see it in spiritual
communities you know spiritual people will will dismiss the non-spiritual
parts of reality and on and on it goes but
see the whole point for you to fully embody god
consciousness you have to accept and stop judging and demonizing
and dismissing all parts of reality otherwise you're less than
god you're a devil so start seeing also reality as
a hall archic tapestry start seeing hollar keys instead of
hierarchies start seeing the circular causations and loops the strange
loops and notice how your actions reverberate throughout the tapestry
when you go to a fast food joint and buy
food from them that reverberates throughout the tapestry it the
food reverberates in your body affects you affects your mind
but also the money you pay to that company that
reverberates too that raises the stock of that company in
the on wall street and then that proliferates the company
makes it more popular and then more of that toxic
fast food is open in other parts of the country
and then not only are you damaging your own body
when you buy that fast food you're also damaging the
body of future generations of children maybe even your own
children because once you get addicted to this food you
will addict your children to this food and more of
these stores will be opened all around the world and
then you will even affect people in africa in asia
and in australia and elsewhere as these toxic fast food
stores open up because you're feeding them money stuff like
this is what i mean but do that without demonizing
that part so see the mistake here would be ah
that fast food is evil and i'm never gonna shop
there again well that is also a problem because now
you've cut that part off and if you start judging
people who eat fast food that's also a problem because
you now you've cut yourself off from those people who
eat fast food and you don't have love and compassion
for them so this is very tricky stuff you gotta
get the balance right so start practicing this just start
noticing the reverberations throughout the hall arctic tapestry first and
then orient your life with concern for the highest hole
you can without excluding the parts but for the highest
hole what would your life be like just ask yourself
what would my life be like if from now on
i devoted every action every day from the moment i
woke up to the moment i went to sleep if
all of that was devoted to the raising of the
hot to the serving of the highest good of the
universe without demonizing or oppressing any of the parts that's
a very powerful question if you can actually discipline yourself
to align your life with that principle that's it you
found the secret to the best life you could live
right there because what better life could you live than
serving the entire universe there's nothing better to do there's
no other universes around there's only this universe and if
you say there are multiverses i'm including those in the
universe my my my notion of universe is universe with
a capital u it includes all multiverses too so when
you're working for the universe you're also working for all
the multiverses at the same time if you believe in
multiverses that is all right that's it we're done here
stay tuned for part two holistic thinking which is going
to take this and it's going to make it more
practical and we're going to go in a lot of
uh specific examples if you thought this was a little
too metaphysical in woo-woo part 2 will be much more
pragmatic and very very foundational for everything else that i
talk about alright that's it i'm done here please click
that like button for me and come check out actualize.org
that is my website there you will find exclusive free
video content on my blog make sure you check that
out some powerful insights there i share a lot of
cool stuff on the blog that i can't really share
through the videos sometimes it's other external video sources sometimes
it's quotes sometimes it's images sometimes it's gifs cool stuff
links research papers whatever whatever i find i try to
throw up there so there's that uh check out my
book list with a lot of books on this topic
check out my life purpose course to help you align
yourself with the with the universe the life purpose course
will basically help you to align with the highest whole
of the universe but in a very practical way not
a bunch of stuff and uh you can support me
at patreon.com actualized if you'd like to support this work
and here's the last thing i'll say actualized episodes themselves
of course as you should anticipate link up with each
other like indra's net the episodes are meant to be
deeply interwoven with each other what i mean by that
is that if you just watch one or two episodes
you'll get some good insights hopefully and you could apply
it and maybe improve your life a little bit here
and there but that's that's really that's peanuts the real
value of what we're doing here is i'm trying to
build a deep catalog sort of like an interest net
and every little jewel every episode is like a jewel
that i'm adding to this catalog right now we have
like 300 videos or something um and my older videos
are not as good so really the last 100 or
200 videos are the best and of course they keep
getting better so every new jewel that i'm adding is
a better jewel basically um and so we're creating this
so right now we have like these 300 joules they're
all and they're all interconnected with each other and the
more of these episodes i release the more the deeper
the interconnection becomes and it grows exponentially and so as
you watch 100 200 300 of these episodes your understanding
of reality becomes so interconnected all the concepts you're going
to start to notice concepts like counter-intuitiveness and the theme
of things going full circle and strange loops and then
holistic thinking and then unity and then duality and non-duality
and enlightenment and consciousness and love and fear and ego
and the self and being selfless and the good and
the evil and devilry and all these terms and and
hundreds more that i can't even remember all right now
because it's so much they're all going to get deeper
and deeper and deeper interconnected until you're going to get
to my ultimate goal for you is not just to
improve your little life a little bit but to develop
this just this raging holistic understanding of everything where everything
makes sense everything is just perfectly fitting together that's one
of the most rewarding aspects of understanding reality is that
it does fit together better and better and better it
makes more and more and more sense the universe makes
so much sense it's crazy as albert einstein once said
in a quote that i'll paraphrase is something along the
lines of like the most the most amazing thing or
the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it's
comprehensible it's comprehensible you can understand yourself precisely because you
are yourself see consciousness is a thing that is capable
of understanding itself but it's not easy it takes work
and one of the downsides of holistic understanding rather than
reductionistic understanding is that reductionistic understanding is much easier to
achieve because you can just carve reality up into little
bite-sized pieces you know i can release a little episode
of five-minute clip here five-minute clip there about something this
that but then you get this and then you think
you're saving time and that is very efficient the episodes
are short and you get little tidbits of stuff uh
it would be better for me because i would get
more views but the problem is is that you never
truly develop the holistic understanding because the dots are not
connected you're given a bunch of dots but no connections
that's what you got in school that's what you got
in university that's what you get in most other youtube
channels where you're watching videos or listening to podcasts you
get little tidbits and insights about this and that but
nobody is helping you to really connect everything from the
highest level up on down that's my unique niche in
this field of personal development is that i try to
take the most holistic approach so that if you do
this work with me the difference from other places you
might do similar work is that they might help you
to improve your life and to understand certain parts of
yourself and the world they might even have help you
to have a few awakenings but you will not have
this kind of ridiculous holistic understanding that i'm talking about
and this work is very ambitious my work is very
ambitious in that it's trying to do nothing short of
understanding the entire universe all of it most people will
tell you that's impossible most people will tell you that's
egotistical and that that shouldn't be done and you should
just shut up and just repeat a mantra or something
or do self-inquiry well i disagree but of course how
do you know i'm not deluded i could be deluded
you don't know so of course verify everything i say
for yourself of course it goes without it should go
without saying it's so obvious i don't even say it
although i should because it's not obvious to most people
but everything that i say is only true if you're
able to validate it if you're not able to validate
what i'm saying then it's not true so this is
not a matter of ideology but you do have to
be open to the things i say because if you're
not open to the things i say then how are
you going to validate it validating some of the things
i say is difficult sometimes it takes years to validate
one of the things that i say you can't do
that unless you're open-minded so you want to be open-minded
but you don't want to be gullible and stupid you
do want to be open-minded also to the possibility that
i don't have a perfect understanding i could be fooling
myself i could be self-deceived i've told you in my
three-part series on self-deception which is so foundational perhaps one
of the most foundational series of this whole channel i
told you in that series that i'm not immune to
self-deception nobody is immune to self-deception when you start to
think you're immune to self-deception that's when you've fallen into
self-deception the most so of course there could be errors
in the things that i'm saying you don't know and
you can't nor should you trust me it's like oh
well leo just leo sounds like he he's got all
figured out so i'll just believe him no that's not
going to help you this is work that's why i
call it work because you got to do work you
got homework to do it's not enough just to listen
to this stuff you got homework to do a lot
of it so get started and make sure you stay
for part two you
