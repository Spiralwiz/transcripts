hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org and in this
video I'm talking about a critical topic I'm gonna tell
you how to stop caring what other people think about
you why do we allow other people to have so
much control over the way that we live our own
lives I think I wonder this I've ever wondered why
you let people have so much power over you because
you are doing it and if you're a people pleaser
if you're somebody who is watching this video and this
topic is something that resonated with you and you want
to stop caring so much about what everyone's thinking about
you then you should really sit down and take a
deep look and I'm gonna help you to do this
with this video this is going to be a foundational
video because I think that this is a problem that
almost all of us face some of us face it
to such a degree that it's literally crippling and destroying
our lives this is a personal topic for me because
this is something I really had to struggle with for
a long time not just for a few years but
really for my whole life this is almost like a
theme a motif of my entire life is struggling with
this and just over the last year I've made some
really big progress you know I've been I've been making
good progress last maybe three years but especially the last
year I've made some really good progress as I've really
taken my personal development to to some advanced stages and
I have some mindsets that I think I can share
with you to help you right now right at the
end of this video to walk away with some big
shifts there going to be some paradigm shifts so if
you're facing this problem then stick with me I know
a lot of people have been asking about this topic
this is a topic that I really wanted to do
justice to I've already shot this video several times so
this is probably my fifth time recording it I've shot
it in various places from Death Valley etc and I'm
rerecorded it now because I want to make it really
have punch so my own struggles let me start about
by talking a little bit about those really I moved
here to the US when I was six years old
I moved here from Russia and that was an amazing
time for me it was really an amazing experience there
was so much here in the US that was not
available in Russia at the time when I moved here
it was in 91 which was right before about a
year before the Soviet Union collapsed so I moved here
and my family relocated and it was great except one
problem in that transition was that I started going to
school here and I didn't know the language when I
went to first grade so I had to really learn
quickly and I struggled for a while in school trying
to you know catch back up and one of the
things that really crippled me there was that it was
really hard for me to fit into the culture of
the people here in the States in school so I
always felt like I was kind of the odd one
out I always felt a little bit weird I always
felt like I wasn't normal I always felt that I
had to work extra hard to fit in with with
the culture that's here and that that lets some some
kind of deep impressions on me some deep maybe scars
nothing traumatic you know nothing shocking but still well you've
got a young mind and you're faced with that kind
of challenge you you can you can use it to
kind of scar your own self and then you can
develop it's kind of complex where you feel like you're
always assessing how people think about you maybe you can
relate with that when you're walking down the street you're
always in the back of your mind thinking about what's
that person think about me how do I look in
his eyes how do I look in her eyes when
you're having a conversation with a girlfriend or a boyfriend
you're thinking about oh how are they going to interpret
that what do they think about me when you're talking
in front of a group of colleagues that work in
back your mind you're always running that analysis right always
running that analysis about how you were perceived how you
come off so this was me for a very long
time might be hard to believe now because I've really
worked on myself a lot shooting these videos just in
himself has helped me a lot so there was that
and even more than just this incident of coming here
to the States and kind of the culture shock that
that I had to deal with and trying to fit
in but the next thing that I really that I
faced was that my dad was an interesting example because
he was the type of person that simply did not
give a [ __ ] what anybody thought about him
and it's really quite remarkable it's almost inspiring there were
good and bad components to that there's good and bad
in that but the problem that happened with me was
that I was seeing that and how I was interpreting
that thing of not caring about what people think of
you I was interpreting that as bad I was thinking
that that was a bad thing and so usually what
has to happen is that your parents your mom and
your dad they have certain values and kids will either
align with those values and they'll tend to go along
with those and they'll adopt those or some of those
values kids will do the opposite with they'll just rebel
against them because they see is they see them as
being bad or something that they don't want for themselves
so that's what happened in the case with my dad
here and with trying to be a people-pleaser in my
own mind I rationalized it like this and if you're
people pleaser then you probably can relate to this kind
of line of thinking in my mind I said well
I don't want to be an [ __ ] I
don't want to be uncaring I want to be the
good guy I want to be the white knight right
I want to be the goody-goody I want to be
epithet ik like I want to care about people so
I'm gonna go out and you know I'm gonna go
out of my way and I may be nice I
mean extra nice to people I'm gonna make sure that
I do things well that's kind of a philosophy that
I set for myself very early early early on and
I kind of rebelled from that philosophy of you know
[ __ ] it who cares what people think I'm
just doing my own thing and and now it's been
many many years and I've been I've been kind of
going full circle coming back to originally what I shunned
because there were a lot of problems with this people-pleasing
mentality that I adopted so that's what we're gonna do
in this video is we're going to help cure you
of your people-pleasing tendencies let's first take a look at
why this is happening what's really going on here why
are you trying to peel to people please here's what
I've kind of come to this conclusion here's how it
works you've got an image of yourself a self image
in your mind you've got this picture this mental picture
of what you think you're like we all have this
but you as a people pleaser your self image is
very specific your self image is that of this noble
person you're a good human being you're a caring human
being you're not like some of those other human beings
who just kind of stumble aimlessly through life not caring
about others you don't want to hurt other people's feelings
you want to do good you want to do right
in the world and you want to be perceived as
a good kind-hearted human being the kind of human being
that you imagined yourself to be your ideal self you've
got this ideal self and you want this image to
be reflected in the external circumstances so it's not just
enough that you have this image but you want a
validation of that image you want evidence that your image
is accurate you want this evidence from your boss you
want it from your mom and your dad you want
it from your brother your sister your wife or your
husband or your girlfriend your boyfriend or any of your
friends or any of your customers or any of your
clients or even a random stranger on the street that
just glances at you you want all of those people
to validate your noble self-image you want to be approved
of and you want to be loved that's basically what
you want and because of this you are working very
hard to maintain this image because as you can probably
already guess when you've got all these random and various
people in your life that you're trying to please that
you want certain reactions from that's not an easy thing
to get that's not an easy situation to architect so
what you're doing is you're running around and you're literally
trying to architect your life in a way that people
are giving you the most approval possible so that your
self-image is upheld and you could say oh look I
am this noble person after all she said so he
said so they said so this guy said so it
was written about me here it was told about me
there you're looking for that confirmation evidence and anytime you
hear evidence that is contradicting the self image that really
really disturbs you really disturbs it sends you into overdrive
to work extra hard to correct that to make sure
that you don't get any disk disconfirming evidence so you
want both confirming and you want no disconfirming evidence and
that's what you're always working towards one of the ways
that you work towards this is by telling yourself that
you want to be very empathetic right you really care
about the feelings of other people the problem is that
being empathetic while it can be very nice in your
case for you it's a trap it's a huge huge
trap that you are drowning in like quicksand here's a
fundamental problem that you need to come to grips with
is that although it's nice to care about other people
nice to do good things for them to be empathetic
to understand their feelings you are a living breathing organism
I trillion cells comprise you each of those cells is
almost like a little mini living organism by itself that's
struggling for its own survival all those add up create
you in in a very deep sense you're not even
in control of how selfish you are you are an
incredibly selfish organism and to deny this nature within you
is a challenge it's a problem because when you deny
that you are very very selfish and when you tell
yourself that you're this altruistic person when you try to
live up to that the problem is that that's that's
rubbing against your your very basic nature very basic nature
of human being and when you put the the feelings
and the priorities and agenda of everybody else in your
life above your own then you're really putting yourself in
this adversarial relationship with your own nature because your own
nature is gonna fight that it's not just going to
take it it will take it maybe for a little
while maybe it'll even take it for a few years
maybe I'll only take it for a decade but it
won't take it indefinitely and so problems start to bubble
up right you can't suppress this stuff there is some
resentment starts to built up anger builds up all sorts
of tensions build up in your relationships you start feeling
unfulfilled you start feeling inauthentic you start not being able
to create and live the kind of life that you
want which is ultimately why we're talking about this right
the reason that this is a problem that you care
too much what people think about you is because it's
preventing you from building your dream life you can't do
it and I'm going to talk a little bit more
about that in detail as we continue so at this
point and I want you to be very mindful of
this what your mind might be saying if you're people-pleaser
is something along these lines you might say below so
what it's already talking about here you're telling me that
being empathetic and being caring is a bad thing now
when when did this nonsense come about this is good
you're telling me that what I'm supposed to be an
[ __ ] now that's what your brain might say
that's what my brain said for a long time here's
the thing you've got to be nuanced here don't let
your brain bully you don't let your brain engage in
black and white thinking because right now what your brain
is telling you is I can either be a goody-goody
on one hand or I can be an [ __
] on the other and I definitely don't want to
be an [ __ ] so I'm going to be
this goody-goody and yes there's some downsides with that Leo
I understand you know not everything's perfect there's some pros
and cons but this is far preferable to being an
[ __ ] so I'm going to be this goody-goody
I'm and continue to struggle and suffer the way I
have for my whole life but it doesn't have to
be this way I'm gonna give you a new alternative
the new alternative is what I call the middle way
the middle way if on this end of the spectrum
we have self-sacrifice and altruism and on this end of
the spectrum we have the careless [ __ ] who's
a monster cold-hearted monster then what do we have here
here we have an interesting thing we have someone who
is completely independent of the good or the bad opinions
of others but yet he or she is grounded in
his or her own values and those values are good
and those values are right and that's the end of
it that's the bottom line that this person is grounded
internally by their own values and whatever opinions are out
there about this person don't matter because there is a
path that this person is walking and no one is
going to take them off this path this does not
mean that this person is a monster or an [
__ ] and also it doesn't mean that their self
sacrificing themselves and suffering needlessly in order to appease others
so it's the really the perfect path to take this
middle path and this is the path that you're going
to have to if you want to create an extraordinary
life the kind of life where you're doing big things
so we already talked a little bit about why I'm
bethey is bad the other thing that I'll add on
top of that is just to simply say that it's
not a sustainable strategy you think that you're doing the
greatest good but actually you're not doing the greatest good
when you're denying your own nature when you're denying your
own agenda when you're denying your own values this really
comes down to an issue of values because a person
who is a people pleaser the core problem with this
is that when you're people-pleasing all the time then your
own values and your own dreams those get put off
to the side and when that happens you're not working
towards them you can't you're also not working on yourself
you're not able to do the personal development that's necessary
in order to empower you to create those dreams and
for most people those dreams could actually be the way
that they help the world the way that they help
their family the way they help their friends but you're
not able to do that because you're not honoring your
own agenda because what you're doing is you're constantly concerned
about what other people are thinking about you you're constantly
sacrificing your own agenda for others for the sake of
others who impose themselves on you but you never have
the courage to impose yourself on them and really you
don't even want that because you judge that as being
bad so this whole strategy this whole strategy you have
to start to understand that this is garbage it just
doesn't work it doesn't work and you've been doing your
whole life you see that it doesn't work right you're
not accomplishing the things that you want to accomplish when
you're doing this because you're too dependent on the opinions
of others here's paradigm shift here's something that could really
change your thinking about this situation an opinion right what
somebody is thinking about you what is that what is
it it's a thought it's this thought in somebody else's
head so literally ask yourself this thought which is you
could say a figment of somebody else's imagination that you're
letting a figment of somebody else's imagination control your life
think about that when you put it starkly like this
it sounds pretty ridiculous it's ludicrous that you would do
this that a figment out there and it could be
a figment it's one thing to be influenced by the
figment of the imagination of for example somebody that you
really respect or somebody that's really important to you like
maybe a spouse or a father or mother but most
people they don't even do it this way what they
do is they're really concerned about the figments of imagination
that are in a complete strangers mind a complete strangers
mind so maybe it's a customer that you interact with
once a year and you're concerned about him or maybe
it's you speaking in front of a group of people
giving a presentation you don't even know half the people
in that audience but you're so concerned about what they
think about you what you think about what they think
about how you dress how you speak how your face
looks how your body looks how much weight you have
how good they think your speech your speaking is how
good they think your material is right or you're on
a date and you're so you're so worried that this
person that you've only known for a couple of days
is is sitting there and judging you or what they
think about you what's going on in their mind you're
letting this dictate how your life progresses can you realize
that how ridiculous that is it's really a travesty to
allow this to happen because what you're doing is you're
taking all the responsibility that you have to rekt your
own life to make yourself happy fulfilled in life and
you're just giving that away to somebody to a random
critic a random stranger and some random crowd or maybe
even a close friend of yours or a boss or
colleague no one should have that kind of power over
you but yourself so what's the solution here you need
to start getting grounded in your own values what you
think is right what you think you should be doing
right getting grounded in that and then just going along
and really not caring about the opinions of other people
either bad ones which are critical opinions or good ones
which are which is praised both of those you shouldn't
really care about because somebody who is grounded their own
values who knows what they want out of life who
knows what they stand for in life who knows what's
going to fulfill them and won't won't write who knows
what's right and what's wrong for them who knows that
do they need somebody to tell them yes you're doing
a good job no you shouldn't be doing that yes
I like how you dress or how you look no
I don't like your work I don't like your art
I don't like this thing that you said here are
they gonna be concerned about any of those things I
mean when you really know what you want don't you
just go for it you just go straight for it
and that's a powerful way to live life that's how
you create a powerful life that's how you be a
creator because if you've got all these people on the
sidelines giving you their opinions and their critiques and it'll
slide snide remarks and their little praises and compliments and
you're always constantly distracted looking one way in the other
how are you going to move forward how are you
gonna build out that grand vision that you have for
your life it's just not gonna happen it's not gonna
happen and every single one of those people they have
their own agendas they have their own values they don't
know your vision they don't know your dreams they don't
know what you want to do in life they don't
know what's right and what's wrong for you they don't
have your values so they're in charge of enforcing their
values you should be in charge of enforcing your own
don't be the one that's left out without any values
you need to enforce your own one objection that might
come up about about this point is that you might
say something like below what about feedback don't I need
feedback I mean if I'm doing this work if I'm
making this art if I'm making this music if I'm
doing something in a relationship if I'm doing something for
a customer or a client don't I need to know
if it's good or if it's bad or if it's
right or if it's not what if I'm building a
business don't I need to know if it's gonna be
profitable if it's gonna be successful feedback is important there
right well the thing here is that you're really worried
that you won't make it on your own you're really
worried that you don't have your own guidance system and
that's what we need to install and you is your
own guidance system because if you have your own values
by which to guide yourself then you can take feedback
there's there's no reason why you can't listen to you
know two people telling you things it can be a
good source of information but the problem isn't feedback the
problem with you is a lot more emotional it's a
lot more irrational very neurotic you're not really looking for
feedback what you're looking for is validation and approval and
you're really trying to stay away from criticism or anything
negative because you just want to build up that self-image
that you've got right you want to preserve that self-image
that beautiful self-image of your ideal self if you could
just have that validated by everybody out there and nobody
contradicted it everything would be perfect right that's how you're
thinking that's not feedback that's that's like ego mania happening
there very subtle ego mania be careful about your ego
telling you that you're selfless it's actually when your ego
is telling you that your selfless that's usually when you're
being the most selfish so really watch out for that
you might also object and say well if I don't
get proper feedback then I'm gonna get off course you
know I'm gonna get off course get off course could
of course you might say leo these people in my
life they keep they keep me on course they keep
me knowing that I'm doing the right thing otherwise maybe
I'm doing something wrong I won't even realize it what
if my guidance system breaks well sometimes it's good to
have people to hold you accountable to to do some
sanity checks on your own decisions you know that's all
well and good but you don't want that to become
a way of life and this concern that you have
that you're going to become some sort of monster some
sort of [ __ ] you're gonna become some sort
of failure in life if you don't have all this
criticism coming in or you don't have all this feedback
coming in you're not always constantly looking for opinions and
approval of other people this is nonsense actually the best
way to live a very successful life is by not
looking at the opinions of others when you look at
the opinions of others that's the most likely to make
you more neurotic in your life that's the most likely
way that you're going to fail because you're gonna be
just going around in circles worrying all the time about
what everyone's thinking about you but not honoring your own
agenda so I already mentioned that praise and criticism are
both problems for you and this might be a point
that you haven't really realized and thought deeply enough about
yet because criticism this is obvious right if you're an
artist or you're a business person you're working somewhere you're
in a relationship it's it's obvious that criticism is something
that is emotionally disturbing to you you don't like criticism
right I mean who likes to get criticized about something
so you can see how this will sabotage you right
if you're doing your art and someone keeps telling you
that your art sucks all the time your parents tell
you your arts no good your friends tell you your
arts no good maybe you submit your art to a
gallery and the dealer tells you your art is no
good so you do all this stuff you're getting all
this negative negative feedback about it and all of a
sudden it's making you doubt yourself can I even be
an artist can I be successful should I be doing
this or maybe I should stop being an artist altogether
right there you're starting to basically sabotage yourself because you're
listening to all this feedback that's out there I mean
how many artists were told that they would never make
it how many artists were told that their art sucks
how many artists were told that their art is worthless
and will earn a penny only for that art to
go on later in someone's life or after they're dead
to earn you know millions and millions and millions of
dollars so it's dangerous it's dangerous to think and to
take that criticism seriously so this might be obviously you
probably know this already that you shouldn't be taking criticism
too seriously because it's good it's gonna run you into
the ground but what about praise you might ask yourself
you might say Allie oh what's you know what's wrong
about getting praised what's wrong with a with a nice
compliment here or there and I mean technically speaking there's
nothing wrong with praise the problem though for you is
that you're neurotic about it you need it you're desperate
for it you desperately need it to prop up this
beautiful ideal self image that you've got which is a
total fiction but you need to prop it up so
you need to you need to praise you need to
compliments so maybe you're that kind of artist that puts
out some work but you're not very confident in that
work until someone comes up to you and says oh
man that's amazing maybe you need it to sell maybe
you need to sell some prints or some copies maybe
you need to earn X amount of dollars for you
to get that validation that praise that positive approval that
oh yeah this art has been accepted it's good now
I can go on and I can create more well
see you can't rely on that because not always will
you get the praise you want and if you're neurotic
about needing praise if you're desperate for it if you're
thirsting for it all the time then when someone doesn't
give you the praise that you think you deserve which
happens so often then what happens you get resentful you
get bitter you start to doubt yourself you start to
question that person - why didn't they give me the
praise I deserved how could they be so insensitive how
could they be so cold and so heartless how could
they be so judgmental so this just further undermines everything
you're trying to do in your life it makes it
very difficult to build your dreams out how are you
gonna build out your dreams and your vision with all
the work that's required when you know the work and
the time that that takes a while to happen during
that time you might have a lot of naysayers you
might have a lot of people criticizing you you might
have a lot of people questioning your motives making fun
of you ridiculing you saying that you won't make it
or maybe even they'll tell you that you're doing good
but they won't give you that amazing praise if you
think you deserve for your work or any other part
of your life and all of that stuff is gonna
just gonna drive you deeper into the ground it's gonna
get you stuck so what's the solution to this how
do we solve this problem you need to come to
a realization right now this is where the paradigm shift
comes in we've talked a lot about of this stuff
but here's the realization you need to admit it's the
first step admit to yourself right now that the current
strategy that you're using this strategy of seeking approval for
your self-image that this is a shitty strategy and that
it's time to drop it you need to admit that
to yourself because most people pleasers they won't even get
this far they don't like being people pleasers but they
never take this first step of really thinking it all
through and saying wait a minute this is a strategy
I'm using it's a overarching life strategy and it's just
not going to work there's no way it can work
when you think your strategy is correct and you think
it's gonna work then you're gonna keep doing it so
you need to admit that it's not gonna work hopefully
I try to convince you a little bit of it
here and I'm gonna continue to do that as we
keep talking here but you can do your own work
and investigation to really convince yourself that this is true
and I guarantee you that it's a good move to
make to move away from the strategy of course you
have some reservations right your brain doesn't want to do
it because well you have a lot of good reasons
you have fears potential fears of what might happen to
you what might happen to your success in life that
you currently already have and you're clinging to you might
wonder what's going to happen in your relationship you might
wonder what's gonna happen with you you might tell yourself
that you're not being authentic if you're not a people
pleaser all this various area stuff comes up which was
very natural because your brain uses all those reasons and
stories to keep you very grounded in your in your
present strategy but you need to bust through that and
you need to decide right now that the best course
of action for you the best strategy is to become
independent completely independent of the good or the bad opinions
of others this means that people will come and will
praise you and you'll take that praise but it won't
change your trajectory you won't need that praise you won't
thirst after it also it means that if people come
and they criticize you they laugh at you they make
fun of you they have a negative image of you
whatever that means then that's also okay you're not going
to be triggered by it the game that you're playing
right now and it is a game write this up
holding of the ideal self image it's a game this
game that you're playing the problem is that it can't
be won it can't be won because what you're trying
to do is you're trying to make every opinion out
there exactly the way you want and you're basically trying
to control other people you're trying to control think about
this you're trying to control the imaginations of other people
it's nuts what you're trying to do and it's not
going to work it's too much work to do it
and one of the other reasons that it's not going
to work it's simply because opinions are very ran very
random in nature very capricious what that means is that
a lot of times what people think about you says
very little about you and your art or your work
or your looks or your personality or anything else about
you it says a lot more about that other person
I mean think about how does that happen to you
when you were in a bad mood yourself something bad
happened he maybe you've got a flat tire earlier that
morning on your way to work or maybe you skipped
out lunch and dinner and breakfast here and eat for
a long time so now you're a little cranky because
you're so hungry or maybe you had just a big
breakup or a big fight with your wife or your
girlfriend or your boyfriend so something like that happens to
you and then somebody else comes to you and asks
you to maybe give them give them some some feedback
on the work that they did or somebody else is
in a conversation with you and they're there trying to
get your opinion on something and then you chime in
there and what are you you're negative right you're negative
you're hyper critical you say something off the cuff that's
a that's insensitive maybe you criticize someone harshly or something
like that and this is what happens with other people
right that's what happens with other people so when you
think that somebody's criticizing your art or is criticizing your
looks or is making fun of you or is giving
you a sarcastic comment I mean there could be literally
a million reasons for why they said what they said
and it might not have to do anything with your
art or your looks or your your value as a
human being it might simply be that that person had
a breakup or a death in the family or maybe
they don't have a really good sense of art so
their opinion isn't worth as much as you think it
is or maybe they just skipped lunch and so now
they give you a critique whereas if they didn't skip
lunch they would have given you a compliment very random
right I want you to ask yourself do you want
to give give your dreams and your vision that you
have for your own life do you want to put
that in the in the hands of randomness in the
literally imaginations of other people that are out there many
of whom you don't really even know too well and
a lot of them who you don't even respect that
much but you still take their opinions very very seriously
ask yourself this question can I live an extraordinary life
if I'm dependent on random circumstances is that going to
happen what you're gonna realize is that it's not gonna
happen and that your life probably right now is a
lot less than it could have been if you hadn't
been working this this people pleats of strategy for so
long and so you know someone get wrenched in it
okay so basically what we're talking about here is that
it's okay right it's okay for the following things to
happen it's okay for someone to think that you're an
[ __ ] it's okay it's okay for someone to
think that your work is [ __ ] that's okay
too it's okay if somebody mocks you if someone ridicules
you if someone makes fun of you if someone makes
you have to be fool that's okay too and it's
okay if you don't get that compliment that you think
you deserve to get or that you really want it
to get all of this stuff you need to treat
it as just you know just the wind blowing it's
the wind blowing left one morning right the next morning
you gotta treat it as though it doesn't matter because
here's another deep realization that you need to come into
into contact with and that's this that there is nothing
really that another human being can offer you of true
value this is a powerful realization that I had about
oh I'd say five months ago that really helped me
to get over this people-pleasing thing is that I started
to realize that wait a minute what is it really
that somebody else a human being is offering to me
in terms of what's really important are they really offering
me fulfillment how much fulfillment am I getting from this
praise that I'm getting over here this nice critical review
that I get over here this nice thumbs-up that I
get in my video this nice comment that I get
this nice thank-you letter that I get I mean don't
get me wrong all that stuff isn't nice right but
if your people please we have to really tell yourself
wait a minute what's the value and all that stuff
can another person give me something that's truly valuable at
first you might say of course of course Leo I
mean other people gives us valuable stuff all the time
someone give me some money or someone give me some
sex or some love or a marriage or dah dah
dah dah work you know all this all this stuff
but think about it a little bit deeper a little
bit deeper what you're gonna find is that nobody can
really fulfill you sure they can give you some material
stuff they can give you job opportunities and and all
that all that kind of stuff and then give you
sex and love and but will the will that really
fulfill you what you're going to find is that this
game that you're playing of trying to uphold this self-image
you think that this upholding of this self-image so now
is going to fulfill you but honestly it doesn't it
doesn't really fulfill you does it even when it's perfectly
upheld it's not that fulfilling I mean that praise they
got at work that nice review you got in some
magazine or under one of your YouTube videos or something
like that that can be nice but what happens a
day or two passes a week passes a month passes
you don't even remember that you got it you don't
remember what it feels like it was just a nice
little hit what's a lot more fulfilling is to be
on your own path in life to be honoring your
values to be living to your dreams here to be
living to your full potential in life right to be
embodying your own values to be fighting and championing those
that's what's really fulfilling creating your dream life that's what's
really fulfilling not these really criticize and compliments that you
get left and right so you don't need to be
upholding this this self-image up there who cares if it
gets a little bit of smudges on it once in
a while you need to accept that accept that your
self-image will get tarnished and that people out there don't
need to be costly validating it in fact and I'll
get to this point a little bit even later in
this video is I'm going to tell you that that's
actually impossible the standards that you're setting are simply guaranteed
to fail so as a recap you don't need praise
and you don't need approval try to like live into
this in your mind you have to you have to
kind of trick yourself because this is unnatural for you
your people pleaser so you think that you really need
this approval you really need this praise you really need
people to love you to think that you're a good
human being but really it's okay you're not gonna die
people think that you're a bad human being you're not
gonna die if somebody is criticizing you you're not gonna
die if a couple of people in this world think
that you're an [ __ ] which invariably they will
it's okay to challenge people tell yourself this it's okay
to do that it's okay to offend people it's okay
to hold it unpopular opinion it's okay to not fit
in all the time it's okay to be abnormal to
not be the average in society or the average of
your group of friends or that the one that fits
into your family it's okay to be the odd one
out and it's okay for people to criticize you for
that it's okay for people not to like you it's
okay for people to think that you're stupid or that
your opinions are foolish or that you're flat-out wrong or
that you're an idiot in your mind a people pleaser
will tell himself that wow this stuff this stuff is
you know it's horrible must avoid at all costs but
really if you go out there and you actually experience
more of this more of this rejection more this criticism
you shouldn't build up a tougher skin and you sort
of realize you know what it just doesn't matter that
much I'm gonna be dead soon anyways there's a lot
more important stuff than a figment of the imagination in
someone's head over there and that's how you have to
kind of start to start to think if you're going
to be building a big life you're gonna be going
out there you know imposing yourself on the world constructing
something important maybe challenging the status quo you're gonna be
you're going to be clashing with people sometimes as a
people pleaser you don't want to clash with people you
want everything to be nice and proper and prim and
that's not gonna happen if you're building a business there's
gonna be tension there if you're building a relationship is
gonna be tension if you're interacting with your friends are
gonna be tension and tension comes from authenticity when you're
authentic how that the person is authentic there can be
tension and that tension is also authentic tension and that's
actually that's okay that other person doesn't mind us so
much actually what that other person really doesn't like is
you being fake when you're fake all the time just
to avoid any source of conflict it's hard to be
attractive not just in intimate relationships but I mean anywhere
it's hard to be attractive because you make yourself so
bland right it's like you take out everything that's unique
and special about you you hide all that stuff behind
your back so that nobody sees and then you present
this just like pristine vanilla mask that you put on
and that kind of mask people aren't engaged with it
they're not excited about it it's not good for business
it's not good for marketing it's not good for sales
it's not good for your relationships or your love life
and it's really not good for your soul because when
you do that your soul gets strained you feel empty
because all that stuff that's unique about you that you
put behind your back well that's the stuff that makes
you really fulfilled when you express it so self-expression is
really probably one of the biggest things that you're sacrificing
as a people-pleaser when you've got a big vision and
you're going out there to build it a lot of
people won't understand what your vision is about especially at
first your parents might not understand what you want to
do for your career they not dead it they understand
it they just don't get it they think it's wrong
right maybe your friends think that the personal development you're
doing is stupid maybe your partners at work or your
colleagues think that the some direction that you have for
the company from this project is it's also wrong headed
in some way and they're very critical of it but
you've got this mission you've got your own values right
and you want to live those which means that you
have to put aside the opinions of those people who
don't see the vision yet this is this is one
of the biggest Ruggles of being a visionary is to
deal with all the naysayers that are out there so
you gotta develop some tough thick skin and you got
a you got to do that even though you're not
gonna have the feedback that you wanna have the praise
if you want a front in fact you're usually gonna
have criticism and maybe even ridicule so think about that
I think that's ultimately my point here is that you
have to choose between whether you really want to uphold
this nice shiny self-image that you've got or you would
rather build this beautiful dream life something powerful do something
powerful with your life which would you rather have because
there's definitely conflict between the two and I think it's
time for you choose this one over here write your
dreams your extraordinary life I want you to build that
so here's how we're gonna practically do it I want
to give you an exercise in fact I'm gonna give
you two exercises in this video because it's important to
actually put this into practice not just think about it
so the first exercise I'm gonna get you going on
right now here's the one thing that you're taking away
from this video it's this one single statement I am
completely independent of the good or the bad opinions of
others such a powerful statement it's so powerful that I'm
gonna say it with you right here I want you
to say it with me three times in a row
we're gonna say it to get it to sink into
your mind alright ready I'm gonna guide you I am
completely independent of the good or the bad opinion of
others alright say it with me I am completely independent
of the good or bad opinions of others same it
with me again third final time I am completely independent
of the good or the bad opinions of others good
this is a powerful statement you don't presently realize how
powerful this statement is here's my assignment for you if
you really want to get over this people-pleasing thing then
here's what you're going to do for the next 90
days this is not gonna be easy for the next
90 days straight for five minutes five whole straight minutes
you're gonna affirm to yourself as an affirmation you're gonna
say to yourself with your eyes closed for five minutes
straight I am completely independent of the good or the
bad opinion of others and you're gonna do that for
five whole minutes just repeating it repeating it repeating it
repeating it repeating it and then doing that day after
day after day after day week day and weekends workdays
and holidays for 90 days straight if you do that
that's gonna be a very powerful impulse to reprogram that
the subconscious mind of yours which right now doesn't believe
this at all but if you say this for 90
days straight you're gonna be surprised at how simple something
like this can be and yet still have a very
powerful shift on your psyche so go ahead and do
that and don't dismiss this as you gonna become some
sort of evil monster or some sort of [ __
] cold-hearted person right this is not gonna happen to
you this might be a problem for somebody else if
I was talking to an audience of not people pleasers
but Psychopaths or murderers or [ __ ] you know
if I was talking to people like that then I
wouldn't be given this conversation then they need more empathy
right they need a dose of empathy in order to
to get them back towards center you you're so off-center
to this side here you don't need more empathy what
you need is a little bit of cold heartedness really
it's not called hardness it's just uh it's just not
caring a [ __ ] right to put you on
this middle path that's what you need so don't worry
you are not going to become evil you're not going
to become a monster people are not going to hate
you because you do this in fact people will start
to respect you because you find your spine in life
right and you get some sense of direction and the
final thing the final point that I want to leave
you on is that you also got to consider this
this game that you're playing of trying to to please
everybody even if you play this game perfectly give you
everything right you're the perfect human being you're the perfect
human being for your parents for your siblings for your
spouse for your girlfriend for your boyfriend for your for
your co-workers for your friends for your boss you're just
the perfect human being for that random stranger that's walking
down the street you do everything the way they want
there are still going to be haters they're still gonna
be people that criticize you they're still going to people
that think bad of you I want you to really
realize how much of a losing game you're playing because
in your mind you might be telling yourself well if
I just did a little bit better you know maybe
if I was a little bit better with my parents
or with my relationship in my marriage alright my you
know and my job then all my problems would be
solved I would have this glowing self-image here it would
be all validated and pristine and then everything would be
great well that day is never going to come and
in fact the more you're doing good stuff in life
the more assertive you are which you need to be
in order to accomplish big things in life then the
more attention you're going to draw you're gonna draw attention
for people maybe you get a little bit of Fame
at your job in your you know in your social
circle and as you're drawing more attention just by the
law of averages at least one person in 100 is
gonna hate you they're just gonna for any random reason
either hate how you look hate how you sound hate
your ideas hate your philosophy hate everything about you criticize
your work hate your work hit your family friends 100
will will think that about you so the more successful
you become in life the more of at upper skin
you're gonna need because you're gonna have lots of people
that are gonna be criticizing you in various ways and
that's okay because you have to let go you have
to just release your clenched you right now you've got
this pristine self-image that you're just clenching so hard you
gotta get to release it and just let it go
that's like a you know a fairy tale that you
don't need anymore it's like that security blanket that you
had as a little kid that made you fit feel
safe and good well after you grow up a little
bit you don't need anymore you can just leave it
to the side and kind of like be grown up
so that's what I'm encouraging for you here and the
final exercise you know how do you stay up with
this how do you follow up and implement this stuff
here's what you do I want you to start going
against the grain right against the grain of what you're
used to I guess the grain of people-pleasing I want
you to become very mindful and conscious of all the
little areas in your life where you are being fake
being inauthentic sacrificing yourself for other people it can be
something extremely simple like maybe you get an email from
your boss and instead of serving your kids dinner you
have to sit down you feel like it to sit
down and instantly reply to your boss because you feel
like if you reply to your boss within 30 minutes
of getting his email then you're gonna look a little
bit better in his eyes maybe it's just a simple
little thing like that or you're being fake whereas if
if you were more authentic and grounded in your own
values then you might say to yourself wait a minute
you know it's I should really finish with the kids
here then I'll answer the email later or maybe even
next morning like little things like that I want you
to become very mindful of those and I want you
to almost purposefully screw around with a system a little
bit so push people's buttons a little bit you need
that you're a people pleaser so your pendulum it's swung
all the way over to this end your you just
start to swing it back this way right and it's
okay if you even go a little bit towards the
[ __ ] and the cold-hearted zone right here because
you'll find your way back you'll find your way to
the seiner you got to kind of trust yourself on
this so right now you need to like apply some
force in the opposite direction and here's a very easy
way to do this very easy everyone has what a
Starbucks near them right we all have a Starbucks near
us everywhere in the world so you have no excuses
here's what you can do an exercise I want you
to do this at least once in your life go
to a Starbucks and preferably during a busy time when
they have 10 or 20 people in there and you
know people are lined up ordering their coffees maybe it's
the middle of lunch or something like that and get
in line stand there make sure there's some people behind
you in the queue and then as you're moving ahead
when you get to place your order and you're standing
there you're about to walk up to the cashier you
just stand there and you think to yourself and you
start observing the menu as though you don't know what
you want to order and you stand there and you
stand as long as you can but you do that
for at least a couple of minutes where you just
stand there your feet are totally planted the cashier is
looking at you asking you to come forward to place
your order but you stand here like you don't give
a [ __ ] and you mumble to yourself wondering
what you want to order and you do that even
though you know that there are 10 20 30 people
behind you that are eager to get their orders in
otherwise maybe they're gonna be late to work and you
just stand here and you take that pressure that's what
I mean by going against the grain you kind of
go against the grain of society right here when you're
doing this you take that pressure people they're weird looks
maybe someone's gonna tell you that you're that you're being
rude that you're being careless good good you need that
you need that because you want to be this goody-goody
you want to pull this pristine self-image you need some
you need some people to tarnish it for you and
you need to tell yourself you know what it's okay
if a couple of people in this world think that
I'm an [ __ ] it's okay it's even okay
if I think I'm an [ __ ] sometimes it's
okay it's a better way to live all right this

long video but this is something that was very near

developments that I've gotten in the last year or two

negative comments I mean I get a lot of positive
comments which is great but but even those I had
