            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/yhfeLiuG_wo' target='_blank'>Leaving On 30-Day Solo Retreat</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>30-Day Solo Retreat Goal</b>: Leo Gura is planning to undertake a silent 30-day meditation retreat by himself to focus on personal growth, research, quality content, emotional self-observation, and aiming towards significant awakening experiences.  
</li><li><b>Effect of His Work on Personal Development</b>: Gura highlights the struggle of balancing personal growth alongside the research, formulating ideas, and releasing videos for Actualised.org, which is mentally taxing and could potentially hinder his personal development. 
</li><li><b>Changes in Perspective</b>: Leo notes that he is becoming less concerned about consistent video releases, quantity of material, and pleasing the audience or the YouTube algorithm. The focus is shifting more towards quality content, original research, and his personal spiritual development. He's also becoming less attached to the desire for large audiences and material success, realizing they don't bring true happiness.  
</li><li><b>Retreat Practices</b>: During his retreat, Gura will disconnect from digital media and work, focusing on Kriya yoga, brain training using an EEG machine, mindfulness, concentration practices, contemplation, and observing his emotional reactions. The possible use of psychedelics during the retreat is still under consideration.
</li><li><b>Emphasis on Solitude</b>: For the implementation and mastering of practices related to personal growth, Gura underlines the need for more time in solitude. The intent is to embody the topics he discusses, which now require deeper personal understanding and experience.
</li><li><b>Reorganization of Video Release Schedule</b>: Upon return, Gura plans to reassess the situation and hints at less frequent video releases on Actualized.org, potentially shifting to bi-weekly or slower schedules. The emphasis will be on ensuring quality content that provides new insights for humanity's forward progression.
</li><li><b>Transition to Next Stage</b>: After five years of releasing videos, Gura feels the need for evolution. He believes it's time for him to transition into the "enlightenment chapter". While he is not leaving Actualized.org, he will assess the platform's evolution along with his personal growth, potentially leading to changes in his content's format.
</li><li><b>30-Day Retreat Details</b>: Leo Gura will focus on self-introspection during his 30-day retreat. He won't create content during this period, unless a significant breakthrough occurs. After the retreat, he will share insights and experiences from the retreat in a video. His time will be filled with preparing meals, groceries shopping, and maintaining mindfulness during these activities. 
</li><li><b>Expectations and Emotions</b>: Leo anticipates a mix of excitement, intimidation, suffering, and insightful breakthroughs from the retreat. He suggests that his spiritual practice and personal journey have led to this moment. Relatedly, he feels ready to tackle the challenging task of daily spiritual embodiment and significant ego deconstruction.
</li><li><b>Transition in Actualized.org</b>: Leo perceives his work with Actualized.org as a completed chapter, necessitating a shift towards fresh projects. However, he clarifies that he isn't abandoning the platform, but rather envisions a renaissance period for it. He potentially sees working on a book or transitioning to in-person teachings over videos. 
</li><li><b>Content Creation Approach</b>: Leo delves into his non-linear process of content creation. This method involves simultaneously working on about 150 video outlines, aggregating novel ideas, and refining each concept continuously over time. This approach helps him deliver an interconnected perspective on a variety of topics. 
</li><li><b>Desire for Innovation</b>: Leo's teaching approach deviates from repetitive teaching methods. He focuses on constantly discovering, experimenting, and introducing new concepts in spirituality, personal development, science, and philosophy. This goal aligns with his core drive of pushing the boundaries of known concepts rather than re-teaching existing content.
</li><li><b>Integration of Spiritual Insights with Scientific Findings</b>: Leo Gura reflects on the importance of cross-referencing spiritual teachings with research findings from diverse fields, including addiction recovery, psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral science, sociology, politics, and evolutionary theory. He states that he supports and promotes scientific thought, especially when used to advance our understanding of spirituality, psychology, philosophy, and government.
</li><li><b>Bringing Current Ideas to the Forefront</b>: Gura emphasizes the importance of applying advancements in technology, alongside new techniques in brain training, psychedelics, and research chemicals to current practices. He asserts that relying purely on existing teachings for enlightenment is not adequate to address humanity's evolving challenges and complexities. Spirituality, he says, needs to continuously grow, evolve and integrate new knowledge and insights.
</li><li><b>The Intellectual Infrastructure for Global Awakening</b>: Gura suggests that before physical advancements in connectivity and technology, humanity needs an intellectual revolutiona clear framework and foundationto facilitate widespread awakening. He stresses the role of Actualize.org in providing these intellectual structures, explaining that concepts and theory are critical for proper spiritual study and self-development.
</li><li><b>The Need for a New Enlightenment</b>: Gura emphasizes the urgency of a new age of enlightenmentone that combines spiritual awareness with scientific and philosophical insights. He advocates for a broad, integral, and holistic approach to spirituality and human development, integrating modern insights from psychology, psychotherapy, and other human sciences. He stresses the need for a broader understanding of spirituality beyond established religious and spiritual doctrines, calling for the integration of belief systems, sciences, philosophies, technologies, and social sciences.
</li><li><b>The Role of Personal Sacrifice</b>: He suggests that personal sacrifices or discomforts may be necessary to embody the truth and foster personal growth, cautioning that comfort can lead to disconnection from the suffering of others and result in dysfunctional pursuits of pleasure. 
</li><li><b>Influence and Power and Corruption</b>: In this section, Gura notes the potential for corruption and deviance that accompanies the acquisition of influence and power. He postulates that without consciousness and self-awareness, individuals or organizations could inadvertently become dogmatic and rigid, detracting from their purpose of integration and self-understanding. In order to actualize their visions, individuals must work on self-purification and address their health concerns. 
</li><li><b>The Importance of a Compelling Vision</b>: Leo explains that, like in the hero's journey, sacrifices are part and parcel of pursuing a compelling vision. Personal virtues such as self-discipline are essential to avoid the pitfalls observed in the career downfall of politicians like John Edwards and Anthony Weiner due to personal indiscretions. 
</li><li><b>Spirituality and Self-exploration</b>: Gura advises undertaking personal retreats for self-exploration, inner reflection and understanding of personal weaknesses and wickedness. This process of conscious suffering is seen as important for personal growth and humility. 
</li><li><b>Integrating Non-Duality Across Spiritual Traditions</b>: Gura asserts the need to integrate non-duality across all spiritual traditions and religions to better understand how to live life. This involves interconnecting spiritual practices with diverse areas such as self-help teachings, science, politics, technology, and education. 
</li><li><b>Transforming Systems</b>: Gura concludes this excerpt by stating that the scientific, cultural, nutritional, educational, and political systems need to be reformed to serve humanity better. The vision is to achieve an enlightened society that is awake and interconnected.
</li><li><b>Redefining Buddhism, Christianity, and Existing Spiritual Practices</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that simply spreading existing spiritual practices will not awaken humanity. He suggests that awakening humanity will require adopting a comprehensive approach that includes using psychedelics, reforming the political system, education, corporate culture, and nutrition among other significant changes.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Self-improvement</b>: He opines that while it is feasible and commendable to help others awaken, it is equally crucial to focus on personal development, purifying oneself, and developing a strong connection with truth. 
</li><li><b>Integrating Spiritual Teachings with Intellectual Frameworks</b>: He points out that ancient spiritual sages and masters were good at mastering themselves internally but failed to integrate their knowledge with intellectual frameworks that could shape a society's intellectual tradition and culture. Gura promotes the idea of breaking down the silos between spirituality and other sectors like government, science, and philosophy, which he believes is the future of human and societal development.
</li><li><b>The Challenge of Balancing External Impact with Personal Development</b>: Leo suggests that as individuals strive to make a significant impact on society, they must exercise caution not to neglect their personal inner growth. He warns against the temptation of materialistic desires that could potentially corrupt a person's influence and power.
</li><li><b>Addressing Personal Health Issues and Making Sacrifices for Greater Good</b>: Leo discusses his recent health issues and his decision to start eating healthier and detoxing his body intensively. He shares that one needs to make sacrifices for their big vision and work on improving their health and energy levels. 
</li><li><b>The Role of Sacrifices in the Hero's Journey</b>: Leo defines the hero's journey as making sacrifices for a greater good and stresses that this ultimately leads to personal fulfillment. He relates this to situations such as starting a new business or having a child, instances wherein self-sacrifice and responsibility are vital.
</li><li><b>Personal Limitations and Vision</b>: Leo warns of the dangers of letting personal limitations and selfishness sabotage one's visions. He advises on the importance of maintaining self-discipline, citing the fall of politicians like John Edwards and Anthony Weiner due to personal indiscretions.
</li><li><b>Importance of Personal Integrity in Fulfilling a Vision</b>: Leo Gura explains how impulsive behaviors and selfish desires can derail even the most impactful visions. As an example, he cites the downfall of politicians who could have made significant contributions but ended up in legal trouble due to personal indiscretions. Leo views these situations as falling prey to the "devil within," i.e., personal weaknesses and immoral temptations. 
</li><li><b>The Role of Retreats in Self-purification</b>: To prevent self-sabotage, Leo recommends engaging in retreats, which require facing personal limitations and demons. Such intense, inward-looking experiences, though filled with suffering, are synonymous with conscious suffering. This contrasts with unconscious suffering, which stems from avoiding challenges and doesn't lead to personal growth. 
</li><li><b>Danger of Comfort and Luxury</b>: Leo warns against living a comfortable life, distanced from the reality of human suffering. Overindulgence in pleasure and avoidance of discomfort leads to disconnection from others and a selfish existence. This could snowball into pathological behavior and constant unconscious suffering.
</li><li><b>Importance of Deliberately Seeking Challenges</b>: To learn and grow, Leo advises actively seeking out challenging situations that align with the greater good. He stresses that this doesn't mean inflicting pain unnecessarily, but simply doing things that need to be done, which will naturally involve facing fears and personal inadequacies.
</li><li><b>Comparison of a Hyper-materialistic Life to a Fulfilled Life</b>: Leo contrasts the superficial comforts and ultimate dissatisfaction of a materialistic lifestyle with the challenging, yet deeply fulfilling journey of aligning with a higher purpose or mission.
</li><li><b>Advocacy for Becoming Instruments of a Higher Purpose</b>: Leo proposes becoming a "vessel for Toyota's work," which involves setting aside personal egotism to serve a higher purpose. He describes this path as challenging but ultimately rewarding, providing profound fulfillment absent in an easy life.
</li><li><b>The Sacrifices Involved in a Hero's Journey</b>: Leo cites Gandhi as an example of someone who lived a hero's journey, facing many hardships but deeply impacting society. Despite threats, imprisonment, and eventual assassination, Gandhis life was one of purpose, far from mediocrity.
</li><li><b>Challenges and Rewards of Living According to a Higher Purpose</b>: Leo acknowledges the difficulties and potential backlash transformative people face. However, he reiterates that the rewards of such a life, filled with engagement and profound fulfillment, outweigh the sacrifices. Comparing this to a life spent in aimless routine jobs like working at Starbucks, he emphasizes the need to become a vehicle of a higher purpose. 
</li><li><b>Announcement about Future Content</b>: In closing, Leo assures viewers that despite embarking on his inward journey, the series on Actualized.org will continue with more content to come.
