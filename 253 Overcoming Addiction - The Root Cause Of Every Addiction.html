            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/G5ZYV-IMIUU' target='_blank'>Overcoming Addiction - The Root Cause Of Every Addiction</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Overcoming Addiction - Understanding and Identifying Addictions</b>: Leo Gura, host of Actualized.org, discusses overcoming addiction. He insists that everyone needs to understand this topic as everyone has some form of addiction. He provides a definitive test to identify if one is addicted to a behavior - stop that behavior for a week, and if cravings arise, it indicates addiction. He points out that numerous behaviors could turn into addictions, including, but not limited to, drug consumption, overeating, excessive socializing, work, shopping, or even thinking. 
</li><li><b>Fear of Emptiness as Root Cause of Addictions</b>: Leo emphasizes that the common root cause of all addictions is the fear of emptiness - the existential fear felt when left alone with nothing to do. Addictions, he points out, are merely distractions and escapes from this fear. 
</li><li><b>Personal Insight - Overcoming Food Addiction</b>: Leo shares a personal story about overcoming his addiction to food. He recalls a moment while starting his fitness journey when he resisted his craving for ice cream, deciding to sit with that craving rather than give in. He views that experience as a turning point in his battle with food addiction, and remarks that the strategy could work with any kind of addiction. 
</li><li><b>Problem Linked to Inability to Be Alone</b>: Leo highlights the inability to sit alone in an empty room as a key problem for those with addictions. This ability is an indicator of self-development and emotional maturity. The need for external stimulation, he remarks, reveals a lack of mastery over one's life. 
</li><li><b>Working Towards Internal Grounding</b>: He suggests a move towards self-actualization, which involves grounding oneself internally  being content with simply existing rather than constantly seeking stimulation. Being able to sit comfortably alone in a room, without agitation or cravings, is his proposed litmus test for a content life. 
</li><li><b>Life's Emptiness vs. Avoidance</b>: Leo addresses the reality that most people's lives are hollow or empty due to running away from existential truths since childhood. Avoidance strategies can range from playing video games to reading books or even eating certain foods. He states that people tend to overstuff their lives with stimulation to escape the feeling of emptiness, leading to feelings of guilt and dissatisfaction.
</li><li><b>Understanding Emptiness</b>: Leo Gura explains that all addictions stem from an existential emptiness. This emptiness is inherent in everyone and can't be filled by any amount of consumption or material possessions. He emphasizes that the fear of this emptiness, or void, leads to dysfunctional, addictive behaviors and dissatisfaction with life. Rather than running away from this void, Gura suggests confronting, embracing, and accepting it to overcome addictions.
</li><li><b>Contemplation of Mortality</b>: Through contemplation of one's own mortality, Gura explains that people can better understand the concept of emptiness or void. He cites the lack of sensations and experiences after death as an example of this emptiness, similar to the state of deep sleep. Gura argues that this void doesn't only exist after death  it exists in reality, and people often run away from facing it.
</li><li><b>Facing the Void to Overcome Addiction</b>: Gura suggests that sitting with the emptiness and eschewing distractions is key to conquering addiction. This means sitting alone, without distractionsbe it food, drugs, or video gamesand surrendering to the emptiness. Gura emphasizes that this process can be difficult as cravings and desires will arise. However, he argues that enduring this discomfort and facing these inner demons without giving in is a necessary component of overcoming addiction.
</li><li><b>The Emotional Labor of Addiction Recovery</b>: Leo Gura identifies a common fallacy in addiction recoveryindividuals seeking techniques to avoid the emotional labor that is integral to recovery. He argues that addiction stems from avoidance of emotional labor, meaning that confronting and enduring this labor is necessary to truly recover. He encourages individuals to deeply understand this concept and embrace emotional labor as an essential aspect of sustainable recovery.
</li><li><b>Techniques for Self-Actualization and Overcoming Addiction</b>: Gura identifies three techniques for overcoming addiction and becoming psychologically stable: the "do-nothing" technique, mindfulness meditation, and strong determination sitting. He also refers to addiction as emotional immaturity, asserting that a non-addict, or a self-actualized individual, is someone who is internally grounded. He cautions that it's impossible to be fully self-actualized while still nurturing addictions.
</li><li><b>Techniques to Overcoming Addiction</b>: Leo Gura detailed four techniques to combat addiction. The first three being the "do nothing" technique, mindfulness meditation, and strong determination sitting can be found in their respective videos. A bonus fourth technique, existential investigation, involves introspection of one's existence and directly confronting one's inner demons. Achievable by making some time to sit in a room alone without any stimulation whatsoever. 
</li><li><b>Emotional Addictions</b>: Leo introduces the idea of soft or emotional addictions, which are habits that are not considered addictions traditionally, such as criticism, judgment, constant need for love, validation, compliments, or success. These emotional addictions, while often overlooked, can be as obsessive as more evident hard addictions.
</li><li><b>Concept of Self-actualization</b>: Self-actualization can be envisioned as the eradication of addictions; a self-actualized person does not rely on external stimulation but instead finds enjoyment by just being. This state, which can be achieved through introspection and personal growth, is seen as attaining internal wealth, allowing the individual to find happiness in doing nothing.
</li><li><b>Limitations of 12-step programs</b>: While acknowledging the usefulness of 12-step programs, Leo points out that they most often focus solely on the abandonment of addiction and fail to provide insight into the bigger picture of self-actualization. Instead of just overcoming an addiction, the crucial mission should be working towards self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Resources for Self-Actualization</b>: Leo mentions his website, Actualized.org, providing free resources and tools aimed at self-actualization. He emphasizes that the goal of his resources is not just to solve problems temporarily but to assist individuals in living their lives to the fullest. His upcoming paid courses and more free resources are also geared towards this end. 
</li><li><b>Patience in Achieving Self-Actualization</b>: The journey to self-actualization requires patience and steady effort. For users to truly understand and embody the concepts, frameworks, and techniques Leo shares, it may take around six to twelve months. Subscribing to his newsletter, leveraging his book list, and staying tuned for future resources and courses are some ways to ensure consistent learning and growth towards self-actualization.
