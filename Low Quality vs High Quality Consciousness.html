hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about low quality consciousness
versus high quality consciousness see the problem is in general
is that society that you grew up in your culture
feeds you such little pictures of what you're doing here
on earth what your life is here for that you
don't even know what your prime directive is in life
what your prime directive is people are so confused and
so distracted and so busy chasing their tails around in
circles that they don't even know the prime directive you
want to know the prime directive and this applies to
every single human being and not just to human beings
but to basically all organisms this is what life is
all about the prime directive is to increase the quality
of your consciousness that's it that's it it's that simple
to increase the quality of your consciousness all life and
especially personal development if you're a personal development junkie boils
down to this this is what growth entails is the
development and increasing the quality of your consciousness and everything
else is a distraction it's a distraction and everything that
happens to you in life including the most mundane things
when you wake up in the morning and you go
make yourself some cereal for breakfast that right there is
already a test of the quality of your consciousness every
single action that you take in your life every single
domain of life that you interact with people in family
relationships business relationship friend relationships you know the larger relationships
you have politically with people and so forth these are
all in a sense tests and opportunities for you to
either show up in low consciousness or in high consciousness
and these can be used to either raise your consciousness
or to keep yourself in lower consciousness and every human
being starts out basically in low consciousness and if you
want high consciousness you're gonna have to work really hard
your entire life taking advantage of every single opportunity all
your relationships all your career opportunities you're all the business
you do all the money transactions you do every morning
you wake up every decision you make about whether you're
going to the gym and what you're putting into your
body as far as food all of that is little
instances and opportunities for raising your consciousness higher and higher
and higher and higher to ultimately get to extremely crazy
high degrees of consciousness and generally speaking those organisms or
systems which are not able to raise their consciousness efficiently
will ultimately die out uh by killing themselves that's what
will happen so this is a the game of life
it's to go from low to high consciousness now the
word consciousness this is interesting what does this word mean
well it's a pretty loaded idea and there's different ways
that it can be defined but for the purposes of
this episode the context that I'll be talking about this
in I'm going to define it as follows it's the
degree of accurate perception that you have or don't have
so high consciousness means a degree of accurate perception and
if you think about it perception is the only thing
you have of reality there's nothing else you have of
reality but perceptions of it and in fact and this
is a deeper point that I won't really go into
in this episode that's all you have all you really
have is consciousness all you really have are perceptions so
now can you start to get a sense of how
important this is because if you don't have accurate perception
of reality basically the only true thing that there is
you got wrong can you see how that could create
problems in your life can you start to see and
appreciate that consciousness is not just a wishful hippy concept
that it's actually the most tangible thing that we've got
going which is why it's so powerful and so important
because if you can't perceive reality accurately what do you
got you've got nothing you've got nothing but your fantasies
and delusions so what I'm going to claim is a
pretty radical claim is that accurate perception is the key
to living a good life and that in fact it
will solve every single problem in your life if you
get an accurate enough perception of reality and that every
single problem you have in your life ultimately comes from
inaccurate perceptions of reality and nothing else nothing else it
all boils down to this so even stuff like relationship
problems family problems health problems business problems money problems these
all boil down to inaccurate perceptions of reality this is
huge but I don't really have enough time to go
into all that what I want to talk about is
I want to talk about the difference between low consciousness
high consciousness so you can see the quality differences between
conscious and that are possible and there's a huge range
here so let's start by defining the characteristics of low
quality consciousness the characteristics are ego and self-centeredness first and
foremost fear low-quality consciousness is permeated with fear dogma ideologies
rigid belief systems clinging to ideas and pet theories this
is all a key hallmark of low quality consciousness also
a little picture of thinking seeing only little pieces of
reality but not seeing the whole thing from a bird's
eye view and of course people with little picture thinking
also are focused on short-term gains so this is short-term
gain thinking as well also a blindness to backfiring mechanisms
so people with low quality consciousness do not see how
they shoot themselves in the foot with their own attitudes
and behaviors and in fact they behave very arrogantly thinking
that their low quality consciousness is actually something for them
to be proud of you see you can tell this
you know like people who are very dogmatic for example
say oh well I'm really you know stubborn about my
faith and that's a good thing they actually turn all
these negatives into positives also a key characteristics of a
local low quality consciousness is mechanical behavior because the opposite
of mechanical behavior is conscious behavior so basically you're behaving
like a robot or a machine if you have low
consciousness also the degree of love that you exhibit is
highly selective and the way you treat people is highly
unequal and non democratic so basically you select your little
clan and you love and care for your little clan
but then you basically are against the rest of the
world which is why we see a lot of partisanship
and a lot of clan rivalry and so forth in
cultures that exhibit low consciousness characteristics right because this is
one of the characteristics they will love their family a
lot but they will hate the neighboring family if that
neighboring family happens to be of a different skin color
or of a different cultural background or of a different
ethnicity or something like that also low quality consciousness is
characterized by moralization having strict rules about what's right and
what's wrong also characterized by projection onto others of all
the limitations of the low quality consciousness to see the
low quality consciousness will not admit that it's a low
quality consciousness so the only option it really has is
to either completely uh dilute itself and deny that there
are these limitations but these limitations they crop up right
because you can't hide them forever because the low quality
conscious inevitably comes and clashes with reality and reality is
stronger so when that clash happens and the [ __
] hits the fan what the low-quality conscience will do
is project all that onto everybody else onto government onto
family members on to spouses on to friends on to
other races on to other political parties and so forth
and this is what creates that sort of anger and
indignation indignation and self-righteousness and also scapegoating and blame also
the low quality consciousness is highly materialistic it's after material
goals it only understands and measures success and progress in
life through material things generally speaking and it's also arrogant
arrogant not in the way that most people think mostly
it's arrogant in its beliefs and what it feels is
right and it basically feels that it is correct while
everything else out there is less than or wrong than
it and this arrogance makes it very difficult to then
correct this state of low quality consciousness because low quality
consciousness won't admit any limitations and so therefore it thinks
it's the best that there can be and that there's
no better alternatives but actually there are much better alternatives
speaking of which let's now talk about high quality consciousness
what characterizes this well for it's basically the polar opposite
of what I just said so firstly selfless and giving
that's the hallmark characteristic of high quality consciousness it's fearless
and courageous it's not worried about dangers and threats and
all this sort of stuff because it's secure in itself
it's focused on direct experience over belief which is if
what frees it from dogma it's committed to truth and
accuracy it values learning and growing very highly rather than
tradition which is what the low quality consciousness mostly leans
toward rather than being mechanical high quality consciousness you could
think of it as an intelligent machine it's like a
machine imbued with wisdom and foresight and intuition and vision
it's a machine that is creative in the sense that
it can come up with novel and creative solutions on
the fly rather than just following mechanical procedures and in
this respect it's also spontaneous and sort of organic because
it doesn't predetermine all of its behaviors and actions it
is robust enough and creative enough to find those solutions
on the fly so think about some people you know
some people are able to do that they're able to
be highly creative and flexible in situations those are conscious
people and some people are very rigid and they can't
handle it when they're faced with a novel tough situation
or challenge and they crumble and collapse underneath it or
they become indignant about it like how dare reality serve
me up this surprise that wasn't in my procedure rule
set and see this sort of machine collapses and that's
why ultimately it dies a high quality consciousness takes 100%
responsibility for its actions behaviors results and how it feels
its emotions especially the low quality consciousness will always blame
others for the negative emotions that it creates in itself
whereas the high quality consciousness will recognize that all the
negative emotions are created by it and our limitations of
consciousness and so therefore if it wants to correct these
negative emotions it needs to raise its consciousness and of
course a high quality consciousness acknowledges that it's not the
highest quality consciousness and that there's a lot of room
for growth even higher in this respect it's humble rather
than arrogant it doesn't say that oh well I'm high
quality consciousness and I'm the best that there is and
there's no further to go no it says there's miles
more to go high quality consciousness is big picture understanding
and when you have big picture understanding rather than little
picture you tend to think in terms of long term
gains rather than short term gains and also you become
hyper aware of backfiring that happens within complex systems you
start to become aware that you are your own greatest
enemy and that every action you take can be counterproductive
it could be you shooting yourself in the foot and
so you become hyper aware of these you start to
really watch out for those and then when you see
them you ask yourself questions like how can I prevent
that in the future so that my actions don't backfire
and come and bite me back in the ass and
of course high quality consciousness is characterized by indiscriminate love
not a clannish localized love but an indiscriminate love for
everyone and everything regardless of whether they're your family or
they're your local school or your local government or your
nation or your race but everything no matter how different
it looks from you and there's a larger caring and
concern for entire ecosystems not just for your little corner
of the world that applies only to your little ego
into your little life I want to read you a
powerful quote from Thomas Campbell which goes right to the
heart of this issue of quality of consciousness he says
that love and joy do not dominate our feelings most
of the time is normal but not a good sign
love joy peace compassion humility and balance are the dominant
expressions and feelings of a high quality consciousness your feelings
and I'm also going to adhere myself your motivations to
always reflect the real you with perfect accuracy if you
feel anger negativity inadequacy anxiety that is a reflection of
how you are and what you are on the inside
and not how other people make you feel and quote
so the question is here how high are you and
judging by the comments that people leave me on my
psychedelic related videos not very high so there's two key
factors I want to share with you that are very
important for gauging where your consciousness level is I found
that in my life is a huge revelation to know
these because these can tell me where I'm at so
that I'm not tricking myself and I can know like
am i growing am I really growing or am I
just bullshitting myself the two factors are the quality of
your feelings and the quality of your motivations these things
like Thomas Campbell said perfectly correlate and reflect what you
really are on the inside how really developed you are
so key insight number one from this episode is that
emotions tell you exactly how you are so how you
feel right now and five minutes from now and 60
minutes from now and then 120 minutes from now and
every single hour those habitual feelings you have how do
you feel do you usually feel happy or do you
often feel depressed you often feel anxious you often feel
a pissed off at the world or pissed off at
your family are pissed off at your spouse for whatever
reasons that generally tells you your level of consciousness and
the more negative your emotions the lower your level of
consciousness and the higher quality your emotions the higher quality
your consciousness is very simple it's a very simple equation
but also it can be very eye-opening when you actually
see this at work don't just take us as a
theory of mine I want you to actually find this
occurring in your life like you stub your toe on
the coffee table after you're done listening to me and
then you get mad at the coffee Tim is goddamnit
that stupid coffee table stub my toe on it again
and then you feel bad well I want you to
connect that to the fact that that tells you where
your level of consciousness is at believe it or not
it's not the case that everyone stubs their toe on
a coffee table and that has the kind of negative
reaction that you have see and that's just one example
out of thousands that occur every single week in your
life so your emotions are like a fuel gauge or
a barometer that tell you what's going on every single
minute of your life if they tell you what's happening
the problem is that people don't really understand how to
listen to their emotions and what's worse is that people
who have low quality consciousness generally suppress their emotions and
are not aware of their emotions so it's sort of
like imagine that you're like Homer Simpson's come to mind
from The Simpsons you know like he's sitting in the
nuclear power plant and he's looking at all those gauges
on his console and there's like the you know the
core temperature of the of the nuclear reactor he has
a little nothing little thermal gauge that tells him if
it's if it's overheating or whatever and rather than sitting
there and looking at the gauge and and doing his
job and carefully monitoring that gauge as though it's going
to go into some sort of meltdown mode you know
what he does instead is he he sticks a sticker
on it with a smiley face so that he never
has to look at the gauge again so no matter
what the gauge is showing he has a little fake
smileyface sticker plastered on it so that's what a low
quality consciousness person does is they do that to the
point where they're they numb their emotions so much that
they don't even have a connection to the signals that
they need to be listening to to see how they
need to be changing their life to follow the prime
directive of living and then of course you can see
how that leads to disaster in their lives and this
is how most people [ __ ] up their lives
is by a by doing exactly this Homer Simpson phenomena
there's also the second key insight that I wanna hammer
into you is which is uh that motivations your motivations
tell you exactly how you are not even so much
your actions but your motivations what are you pulled towards
in life money sex greasy food TV easy entertainment or
giving sharing connecting contributing loving expressing compassion and gratitude and
generosity you know and these motivations also I want you
to notice them on a very micro level in your
life I don't just mean your very broad motivations like
you want to have a nice cushy career yeah that
tells you something about your level of consciousness of course
but I mean more fine-grained I want you to go
through your day and every single hour every single 15
minutes of your hour look at what are you being
motivated towards right then and there like what are you
motivated towards when lunch hour comes what are you motivated
towards when you first get to work in the morning
what are you motivated towards when you get off work
and you come back home and you have some free
time these choices you're making throughout your day these are
what are defining your consciousness and they reflect your level
of consciously you can't lie about these things and that's
why I love this this concept that I'm sharing with
you here because this allows you to very accurately gauge
where a human being is at so not only can
you apply these to yourself which I highly recommend that
you do but you can also then once you apply
it to yourself and you see how it works in
you and maybe you're going to be shocked at how
low your consciousness is compared to what you thought it
was that might be a bit of a rude awakening
uh but then you can apply this model to other
people and you can very quickly sense you know this
person going to do business with is he a low
quality consciousness person or high quality conscious person very easy
to tell based on how he feels about his life
how he wears his emotions on his sleeves you can
read all that very easily from people and also generally
what his motivations are you can read that pretty easily
too so here are some questions for how to measure
consciousness in yourself and in others how do I feel
on an hourly basis how loving am i how fearful
am I how intellectually open am i how well do
I govern myself am i able to so what that
one means is am I actually able to govern myself
successfully or do I fail can I get myself to
successfully go to the gym or will I fail can
I get myself to successfully eat the right food that
I want to eat or will I fail can I
get myself to work on that book project that I
have or that music project or that film project and
get it done without a lot of resistance and inner
turmoil or will I fail that one's very instructive and
also how noble are my motivations so when I'm going
to work and I'm working on a project what's motivating
me to work on that project is it because I
feel like this project will actually make a difference to
Humanity in the world is that my motivation or am
i motivated because I don't want to get fired is
that my motivation can you see the difference in quality
there that's a huge difference or like if I'm in
my relationship let's say I have a girlfriend or a
boyfriend and I have maybe an opportunity to sleep with
somebody else and I'm in this relationship to like a
long-term relationship so uh if I am thinking about cheating
on this person what are my motivations there even if
I don't cheat was I motivated not to cheat because
I was afraid that I would be caught and that
I would lose this great person in my life and
therefore then I would lose something that I value or
was i motivated not to cheat because I thought it
was the wrong thing to do and because I wasn't
really even that interested in getting more sex I wasn't
really craving sex so I didn't really need it so
therefore I had no desire to cheat you see so
even though your action in this case the action was
I didn't cheat but the motivations were very different you
see in the end you can't really suppress your true
motivations and your true feelings for too long you can
do it for short periods of time like if you
hate your job you can still go to work and
suppress that emotion of hatred for a while but not
forever eventually it's going to bubble up to the surface
in ways that you probably never anticipated and it's going
to snowball and snowball and snowball and then it'll you
know just slowly like creep in and corrode your entire
career same thing with relationships you can't hide your true
feelings and motivations in long-term relationships it'll eventually corrode that
relationship so these are some questions by which to measure
consciousness now I want to address some questions some kind
of common questions that people have on this topic one
question I commonly get is something like well Leah I
just don't feel good in my life I don't like
life in general what should I do well listen to
what I'm telling you here when you tell me that
you don't like your life or something about your life
what that tells me is that you have low quality
consciousness why because that's a feeling you have right it's
a feeling of dislike a frustration of anxiety of hatred
of fear of depression of sadness of apathy whatever that
those are all emotions so I want you to get
good at reading that gauge that tells you like oh
if I'm experiencing depression that's telling me something about the
quality of my consciousness and what's the solution to raise
your consciousness now I realize that's a bit generic as
a solution you're going to need to find a specific
way to to handle that but at least I want
you to see on a big picture level like oh
that's what it means that means if I raise my
consciousness the depression will go away see a lot of
people get they get stuck in depression they think oh
I'm going to be depressed for the rest of my
life I don't know what to do about this maybe
it's because my you know I'm off my genetics maybe
it's because I did something bad at my job maybe
it's because my boyfriend left me maybe it's because I
don't look as handsome and as sexy as all my
friends and therefore I should be depressed no it has
absolutely nothing to do with any of that those are
all illusions uh you just gotta really take it on
faith I guess that this principle is true I mean
I don't take it on faith I actually can see
very clearly how these things that I'm talking about are
reflected in everybody I interact with in my life and
myself right so for me this is all like it's
all highly empirical stuff but for you this is your
first time coming into contact with these ideas it might
seem like this is just like some wild far-fetched psycho
theory some steel some psychobabble theory that you don't see
any empirical connection with but if you just kind of
go around you start to look you'll start to see
that everything I'm talking about is reflected in real everyday
life so that's that question answered another question is but
you know but Leo what about success and what about
pursuing sex and pursuing money what's wrong with that nothing
wrong with it per se but it's the hallmarks of
low quality consciousness that's what that is and you'll very
soon learn if you just do a little bit of
investigating that human beings with high quality consciousnesses are not
motivated very much by success sex or money they just
aren't they've transcended those things they've seen that these things
are not inherently fulfilling and that actually all these mechanisms
backfire very dramatically on you if you over indulge in
them or if you make them the prime directive of
your life if the prime directive of your life is
success you're going to waste your life I guarantee it
and if the prime director of your life is sex
you're going to waste your life and that's going to
lead to disaster in the end and if your prime
directive is money that's going to be a wasted life
you're going to get far less out of life than
you could have otherwise gotten the problem is convincing a
low consciousness person of this because they're so certain that
these things will actually work for them so what do
you do well you need to transcend these cravings for
these low consciousness things not out of any kind of
moral obligation not because these things are inherently evil or
bad or wrong or that you shouldn't do them but
simply because they're not nearly as fulfilling as what comes
after them and you might say well what comes after
them well there's a lot of stuff I mean you
can be creative you can contribute to the world you
can get involved with longer deeper relationships and building connections
with people friendships life purpose you know having a career
that's more than just about sex and money and so
I mean not sex but success and money so you
know those are higher consciousness things and that's just the
tip of the iceberg of what higher consciousness looks like
you can go much much higher than that another question
people have is but Leo if I do what you're
saying here won't people walk all over me because I
will no longer be defending my selfish interests so much
and so then I'll become a doormat and I'll be
abused by all the selfish egotistical people out there so
it sounds like the higher consciousness people will get abused
by the lower conscious people this is a myth that's
actually not how it works a high cautious person is
aware they're not stupid they're aware people who are doormats
and got walked all over these are not high consciousness
people these are actually low consciousness people these are people
who have wounded egos and so they have these neurotic
patterns that allow them to be walked to be walked
all over and they're not conscious enough to see that
the way that they're living and behaving and acting in
their life the way they're structuring their life will backfire
on them in one way which is that people will
walk all over them people who are high consciousness do
not get walked over easily because they're fearless so they're
not afraid of confrontation they're not afraid of enforcing boundaries
they're not afraid of insisting on what they feel they
deserve in life which is exactly what someone who's a
doormat is afraid to do generally speaking so this problem
just won't happen to you in fact if you are
currently a doormat or a people pleaser and you get
walked all over raise your consciousness and then see what
happens that problem will resolve itself also you might be
wondering but Leo what about your life purpose course how
does this seems like here you're talking about some sort
of higher purpose the prime directive so if my prime
directive is to be raising my consciousness but then your
life purpose course talks about like your career how to
develop a life purpose around the career how do you
reconcile that well the answer there is that the life
purpose course is designed to be pragmatic I make a
course it has to be pragmatic and it's focused on
getting you some tangible results around your career what I'm
talking about here is kind of like the prime directive
of raising your consciousness as a human being you might
think of it as a more general overarching life purpose
just as an organism that you have which means that
even if you don't have a career eat if you're
a bum on the street or you decide to have
no career at all your prime directive should still be
to be raising your consciousness but you know uh in
this day and age we need to feed ourselves and
most of us actually like having careers not just because
we need them to pay our bills which of course
we do but uh more than that we want our
careers to be an expression of our deepest values and
we want to be creative we want to be creative
in the ways that we like rather than the ways
in which our boss likes and so in that sense
uh that's what the courses is helping with us to
figure that out and of course that should be a
high consciousness thing too and that's what the course is
helping you to do so really these things come together
you're you might think about like your career life purpose
is what the course helps you to figure out and
then your personal purpose as a human being is generally
to just raise your consciousness every single day you wake
up and you just ask yourself okay how can I
raise my consciousness today how can I improve its quality
where is it low quality what would it mean to
go from low quality to high quality how am i
creating and sustaining low quality consciousness in my relationships in
my business with my finances and all the other facets
of my life so you might be wondering at this
point so how do I increase consciousness Leo well I'm
gonna give you the big picture I can't go into
all the details because actually that's what I cover in
all my other episodes so almost every single episode I
release in some way or another helps you to see
how you can increase your consciousness in some specific way
in some specific area of your life but here I
want to give you the big picture the big picture
is important so that you have like a roadmap right
because right now you've probably been living your entire life
and nobody has given you a roadmap for where you're
going what's your ultimate destination you don't know but now
you do your ultimate destination is high quality consciousness it's
a little bit of an abstract destination so you got
to be smart enough to them drill that down to
specifics and to really understand what that means but here
are the broad strokes of how to increase your consciousness
firstly increase the capacity that you have to love also
secondly increase your capacity to feel happy independent of circumstances
that means that if you're sitting on a bench waiting
for somebody let's say and they are late and the
bench doesn't feel very comfortable it's like a hard metal
bench and you've been sitting there for a while and
now you're feeling kind of antsy and your ass is
hurting because you've been sitting for long on this bench
ah you don't feel happy right generally that situation well
that tells you what your level of consciousness is so
then your job in that moment is to figure out
a way to increase your capacity to be happy with
that situation see that would be just one little example
of how you could apply this thirdly to increase consciousness
increase your capacity to be intellectually open which means that
you're able to entertain ideas and opinions that are very
different for ones that you hold or are familiar with
and that you're not clinging to any one of those
so I would call this open mindedness or even radical
open mindedness increase your capacity for that so that if
I come up here and tell you that I saw
an A liyan or some paranormal activity has happened to
me and you would say well leo that's [ __
] we know that that's not real that can't happen
right so that if I tell you that regardless of
whether you think that that's possible or impossible it doesn't
trigger you emotionally and that you're open to it you're
actually open to entertaining that possibility without getting all up
in arms and pulling out the pitchfork and then writing
me little nasty comments in the comments section and so
forth see that's a capacity equality of high-quality consciousness to
be fully open no matter how ridiculous something might seem
that someone has said and to be able to entertain
it not necessarily to accept it on blind faith not
even necessarily to believe it but just to entertain it
and to not be emotionally triggered by it fourthly increase
your capacity for self governance how effectively can you control
your behaviors and actions when you decide to pull the
trigger that's huge that's huge and you probably are wondering
well Leo how do I increase my capacity for self
governance that's a tall order to fill there's a lot
to talk about there there's a lot of different techniques
that could be used to do that I mean it's
basically a life long process for doing that but I
have many episodes that tell you different techniques and methods
for how to stop procrastinating for example I have an
episode called how to get [ __ ] done how
to be a strategic thinker and so forth so you
know I've got lots of content that help you to
do that fifthly increase your capacity to face fear this
is huge you probably are not aware of yet on
a practical level how much fear runs you in your
life fear can be very subtle fear is not just
something like oh I'm afraid of death or I'm afraid
of Donald Trump becoming president say it's not like that
there's much much subtler fears that I'm talking about here
right very little fear is very little fears you might
just wake up in the morning and experience a fear
that your spouse ate all the breakfast in the refrigerator
and so now there's nothing for you to eat on
your way to work and that might now motivate you
to behave in a little selfish manner towards your spouse
maybe you're going to be Lancie a little bit pissy
I say some little insulting little thing or be a
little sarcastic or passive-aggressive or something like a very subtle
thing but where did that come from it was motivated
by your fear because you're not facing the fear of
the prospect that there's no breakfast in the refrigerator in
the morning yeah so again that's just one little example
out of millions that you should be looking into and
sixthly the way to read to increase your consciousness is
to transcend selfish and protective motives this is also a
subtle one you have to look out for this really
watch your motives like a hawk to see how every
little thing you do throughout your date a little manipulations
that you engage in how those are being done to
to somehow boost up your ego and all the selfish
little stuff that you have going on in your life
all the personal stuff that you're worried about you know
like maybe you wake up this morning and you want
to rush to work why do you want to rush
to work well because you want to get to work
early so that you're the first person who gets to
the computer and then gets to select your vacation days
for the next month because maybe there's other people at
work who are also vying for those same vacation days
and you want to get a little bit earlier just
ten minutes earlier so that you could put in your
request so that you could get the vacation days that
you want and beat out all your co-workers that would
be an example of a very subtle selfish motive and
something that you would want to transcend to get to
higher quality consciousness yeah so I want you to notice
the subtlety here and how these opportunities for self-actualization for
raising your consciousness are arising almost every 5 or 10
minutes every single hour every single day of your life
on the weekdays and on the weekends and during your
work days and your vacation days right there's no time
off if you really want to and if you want
to self-actualize quickly then the biggest thing you can do
is start to look for these micro opportunities don't be
just focused on the big stuff it's easy to get
seduced by the big stuff and think like well I'm
just going to wait till I'm enlightened and then all
my problems will be solved and until then I'm just
going to be hey like a selfish jackass that's not
going to fly and also like you might think well
when I go to that retreat or that workshop or
that seminar that I have scheduled three months from now
that's when I'm really gonna do a lot of growing
and until then I'm just going to be an unconscious
mechanical robot doing all these selfish local consciousness things ah
that's you're missing so much opportunity for growth there see
when you actually tune your mental filter to start to
see all these opportunities you're missing it'll be kind of
shocking might feel kind of bad at first because you'll
feel like man there's there's so much stuff I can't
even I can't even understand how I'm going to take
care of all this because it requires a lot of
attention and energy for me to be monitoring all this
stuff on a minute-by-minute basis in my life and then
actually thinking of how I can turn it around from
low consciousness into high cost you know that requires a
lot of focus and mental energy that wears me out
throughout the day living my life that way it's much
easier to just kick back unwind and run mechanically through
my day so at first it might seem overwhelming might
seem kind of depressing um but don't worry I'm not
saying that you have to be perfect here you don't
need to catch every single opportunity there's going to be
way more opportunities that you'll be then you'll be able
to make use of but even just five 10% more
of catching of these opportunities throughout your day is going
to be very eye-opening for you and it's going to
increase your level of development by two fold by three
fold by five fold if you actually start to become
mindful of these things so now you have the big
picture this is the big picture of human life I've
kind of just given it to you without explaining exactly
why this is the prime directive of human life is
to increase consciousness I'll tackle that issue more in depth
in future episodes here I just want you to kind
of sort of take it on faith and by that
what I mean is take it on as a tentative
hypothesis so you can still be skeptical basically I want
you to kind of take this on and say well
okay so Leo presented me with some model here now
let me take this model let me not just not
believe it blindly let me adopt it as a tentative
hypothesis and let me walk around for a week in
my life and just see if stuff fits this model
also maybe let me think about back into my life
into my dealings with my family and my boss and
my co-workers and so forth and let me just put
that through the filter of this model and see if
stuff clicks and make sense what I'm claiming is that
you'll have a lot of clicking in your mind and
they'll be like oh of course that's what's going on
that's why that person cheated on me or that's why
that person screwed me over in business or that's why
I wasn't have able to have a successful friendship with
this person here it's because we were at different levels
of consciousness so this should start to explain a lot
and of course don't just apply to other people first
and foremost apply to yourself this is the big picture
now you have the roadmap for all of life I
hope you can see the power of this this is
the magic key to all of life you've been given
it right here so don't don't forget it don't fall
back asleep what I recommend is that you like write
this on your bathroom mirror in big bold letters the
prime directive of my life is to increase the quality
of my consciousness and then to focus on that every
single day and to work to embody that until your
entire mode of living from morning to the time you
go to bed at night is all about looking for
opportunities to increase your consciousness rather than what most people
do is what do they do they look for opportunities
to get a little bit of pleasure or to avoid
a little bit of pain or to maybe earn a
little bit more money or to have a little bit
more sex this sort of stuff that's mostly what you're
focused on in your day isn't it or just like
juggling balls a lot of people are just so busy
it's just like juggling balls how do I take the
kids to school how do I get to work on
time how do I get back on time how do
I have to nur with my wife and this and
that so it's just like you're juggling balls all day
but you're forgetting that your prime directive as increasing consciousness
you can juggle balls for a decade and you're just
going to waste a decade of your life not increasing
consciousness and in fact your consciousness is going to get
lower and lower and lower if you're not working on
it on a habitual basis so now you know and
you have no excuses alright that's it I'm signing off
