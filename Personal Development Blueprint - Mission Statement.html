hey there this is Leo for actualised gorg and here
we're continuing on with the blueprint series going down the
list and this is blueprint concept the blueprint concept that
I call personal mission statement so this one's going to
be pretty straightforward and clear-cut but my objective is to
really convince you of the importance of it so first
of all let's start off by saying what is the
personal mission statement and why is it important what is
it basically it's a document either written in physical form
electronic form that lists the most important things about who
you are so your values your life purpose it lists
some of your top strengths it lists some of your
elicitor zone of geniuses your zones of genius and it
lists some of your top goals for the year so
that's basically what your mission statement is and for me
that's a one-page at most a two-page document you should
keep it concise and short and sweet just as short
as you can make it without losing everything that's essential
all right so that's what it is why is it
important and this is a really important part that I
want to get home to you in this video it's
important because it keeps you printable principle-centered right Steven Covey
in his best-selling book seven Habits of Highly Effective People
maybe you've heard of it I definitely go out check
it out huge big best-selling self-help book but in there
he lists seven Habits that effective people need to have
so these are like seven master principles and one of
them I believe the second one maybe the first one
even is called B principle-centered that means you need to
be guided by principles and not just be blowing around
like a leaf in the wind right too many people
out there are not principle-centered that means that they're centered
in something else you're they're either centered in their work
there either centered in their friends they're centered in their
church they're centered in their marriage they're centered in some
other relationship they're centered in seeking pleasure they're not centered
period but the fact is that their Center is placed
somewhere outside of themselves the proud when you do that
you don't have stability you're not grounded right and we
want you grounded in order to go out there create
an amazing life and to be if both a creator
but then also to be getting the things that you
want in your life to do that both with career
and anything in your personal life in order to accomplish
that you need to be out there and you need
to be enforcing and asserting your reality out on the
real world on the external world so it's a matter
of inner world influencing outer world but what is the
case with most people it's the opposite they've got that
flipped backwards it's the outer world that's influencing and asserting
itself on them what they feel is dictated by the
outer world what they want to do their goals are
dictated by the outer world you know what they're doing
in the morning when they wake up the first thing
that they're doing after they brush their teeth and all
that well they go and they check their email then
all of a sudden it's the external world that is
asserting its agenda on on your internal world and when
that's happening you're not a creator you're at the effect
of your life you're not affecting life and we want
to flip that back around the way that it should
be for you and the way to do that is
to have a personal mission statement so this is how
it starts now a mission statement now we're gonna get
into the meat of what it means to have a
personal mission statement first point and I'm gonna give you
a format for exactly everything you need to have on
it a little bit later right now though we're gonna
start with how do you implement this in your life
so once you understand the importance of it and you
get a buy-in for why you need a mission statement
here's what you're actually going to be doing to get
it to function in your life because the idea is
pretty simple the problem is that you're not actually executing
on it that's the problem that I find with most
people so first of all write it if you don't
have it you've never sitting down to write a personal
mission statement you're gonna want to sit down and do
it and you'll know what to do because I'm gonna
give you a full format for how to do it
and it's gonna be down below in the article so
you're gonna write it out but then that's the easy
part after you've written it out you're gonna read it
every morning as part of your daily ritual for five
minutes so that means every single morning for the rest
of your life from today onwards after you've written thing
you're reading it no matter what no exceptions you're reading
it for five minutes that means you're just going through
you're reviewing it you're looking at your your purpose in
life you're looking at your values you're thinking about a
little bit but basically just kind of going down the
list yes sure it gets boring you still have to
do it it's important and you're probably going to think
but is it really important is it really worth spending
five minutes my morning doing it stuff yes it is
it's that important you have to be personal setter that's
one of the key principles that's the reason that it's
one or two in Stephen Covey's seven Habits is because
it is that important you have to start influencing the
world rather than the world starting to influence you and
the best way to do that is to make this
part of your routine so just like you would when
you get up and when you get out of bed
what do you do usually go brush your teeth at
least I hope you do maybe floss maybe you go
take a shower put your contact lenses in put your
makeup on whatever you got to do get yourself pretty
and then you go to work or you have breakfast
part of that routine as soon as you're done with
all your shower stuff then get your personal mission statement
in there as soon as possible so you don't need
to do it the second you wake up I find
that that just interferes too much with your with with
personally my hygiene ritual but after my hygiene ritual the
first thing I do is I read my mission statement
I do it every morning for five minutes and that's
something that you're gonna have to do you have to
build a habit of it it's gonna take you perhaps
30 days to build this habit so give yourself 30
days those first 30 days it's gonna be inconvenient it's
gonna be a bit of a pain in the ass
but it's only five minutes so shouldn't be that bad
it's a pretty easy habit to build do it for
30 days after that it's gonna get much easier yes
even after that you still have to keep doing it
you're gonna have a tendency even after the first seven
days you're gonna be like well Leo I already know
this thing by heart it's pretty simple it's not a
complicated document I know all the stuff on here I
memorize that I committed it surely I don't need to
keep doing this just a waste of five minutes no
you need to keep doing it this is about train
it's about training logically you might know this stuff you
got a train remember that elephant and Rider analogy you
got to train your elephant you got to train your
subconscious mind in order to be soaked in these principles
these principles are what guide you throughout the rest of
the day he's going to inform your decisions you're making
this could inform how you're allocating your time priorities that
you're setting how you're interacting with people how you're feeling
your moods your emotions your thoughts so this is super
super important even though it's very simple really you should
be very thankful that you can get so much for
just five minutes of work but don't take that for
granted and slack off and say oh I don't need
to do it just because it's five minutes it's reading
a stupid little document no you have to do it
it's important and what I really want you to do
is to get your buy-in on this because the reason
that you're not going to follow through on this entire
principle of having a personal mission statement and by having
it I mean you're looking at every day because if
you just have it somewhere tucked in under a drawer
under your bed and you haven't looked at it in
five years it's covered with dust and spiders that's not
gonna do any good that doesn't mean you have one
to have one means that you're practicing reading it and
you're looking over it you're reviewing it you're tweaking it
every single day that's what it means to have one
so unless you have one then you are not gonna
be out there and creating your you can't really live
your values unless you're looking over them especially when you
start unless you've been doing this for years and you've
just got a totally committed you're not going to be
aligned with your values yet you're not going to be
aligned with your goals yet you want to be reviewing
your goals you want to be looking at your your
life purpose you want to have that in front of
you all the time it's going to be centering you
it's going to bring you back to Center after all
this stuff that's happening in your day because what happens
is you're going to run through your day and you
can get taken off course stuffs gonna happen maybe something
that fortunates gonna happen you're gonna have a fight with
your spouse you're on a problem with your kids your
boss is gonna yell at you your clients are gonna
throw a wrench in your whole equation and then you're
gonna be putting out fires the whole rest of the
rest of the day and you're gonna be frazzled and
frantic you're gonna go bed go to bed then you're
gonna wake up the next morning and you're still going
to have that basically what's gonna happens you can be
shifted little bit the extra in the world is gonna
shift you from your Center from your principles and you
need to bring yourself back and remind yourself oh I
actually value X Y & Z my mission purpose my
my life purpose is actually X and my goals right
now my top goals are actually ABC you're gonna need
that to bring you back to center so I don't
know how else to convince you this really you're gonna
have to struggle through it and the first time around
you're probably not gonna believe me that it's important and
after you study personals not long enough finally you're gonna
come to the realization that you gotta train yourself and
this stuff needs to be drilled into you and that
five minutes every morning is actually a small price to
pay for the payoff that you will get months and
years down the road when your goals are accomplished you
have a lot of discipline you have a lot of
integrity you're feeling great you're living on top of your
values you're fulfilling your life purpose and everything is working
and firing on all cylinders for you because you've been
investing five minutes every morning so that's all I'm gonna
say about the importance of it if you still have
concerns if you still have some sort of lingering argument
in your mind while you're not gonna do this and
make it a habit then well you got to work
that out either get coaching for me or for somebody
else leave a comment below if you have questions about
why you really need to be doing this or ask
a friend talk to somebody who really knows what how
to achieve success in their life and they'll tell you
this is something that's really really important get that buy-in
from yourself it has to be important to you if
you feel it's important you'll do it if you think
it's frivolous then you won't do it so okay moving
on to the next point I beat that one to
death is should it be physical should it be electronic
what kind of format I think that you know there's
different formats especially nowadays it's even more than just physical
electronic there's all sorts of electronic possibilities should it be
on your iPhone should it be on your iPad should
it be in multiple places should it be on your
work PC home PC that's it it's electronic if this
physical should be in a binder shouldn't it be on
a sheet of paper that you're posting on your bathroom
mirror should it be a fancy little diary what should
it be there I think any one of can work
probably multiple combination those can work it really depends on
your own preferences here I'm gonna give you the leeway
to figure out what is gonna work for you what
I like about electronic and that's the way that I
keep mine is on my laptop electronically is what's nice
about is that you can edit it you can edit
it easily because if you've gotten in some fancy binder
and it's all laminated or if you've got it in
a in a nice diary that you don't want to
markup and erase and cross stuff out in or if
you've got on your bathroom mirror how are you gonna
edit that sucker and that's actually gonna be our next
point is that you have to keep editing this thing
because this is a live document as you're growing as
you're discovering more about yourself and you will be you're
gonna want to polish this stuff up what I found
personally is that as I'm reviewing this every morning because
I'm reviewing it so often I start to make subtle
changes to it subtle shifts and wording I might rearrange
the order of the values that I have I might
add one new value I might remove one value so
it's kind of like a working copy it's always under
construction for me and I don't change it every day
but I would say that at least once a week
I will make a tweak on it small tweak here
small tweak there sometimes I'll make a big tweak sometimes
you'll literally get a you know a big something will
happen in your life where you're actually gonna go and
you're gonna really like remove one value and add a
totally different value that you just realized was a value
of yours you hadn't realized before that's important you want
to be able to make those changes and you want
those changes to be easy to make so you'd have
to bend over backwards to make them and that's all
I'm gonna say about that for me personally I like
electronic I've tried to transition everything that electronic makes it
a little bit more portable for me and the easy
to edit but if you're into the physical and you're
like how that feels you like writing it out by
all means go for that but on to that next
point that I was talking about is polish you want
to be able to polish this thing and edit it
and keep editing in it and you know make a
habit of doing a little bit of thinking when you're
reading down this personal mission statement you're gonna be reading
down it and you're gonna be reviewing it but you're
also gonna be contemplating don't just do it like a
monkey and it can tend to become that way because
it gets a little bit boring to read the same
document over to get over and over again but you
want to be content plating this right thinking about it
is this really true is it really true that this
is my top value is it really true that this
is the best wording I can have for my life
purpose maybe there's a better wording you know ask yourself
those questions so that you can get you can get
some answers and then you get more clarity all right
so I just went ahead there and move my powerpoint
up to the next slide because what I want here
is I want to give you the format for the
mission statement and for this I use the PowerPoint behind
the camera so that I can give you all the
points in the mission statement format so you have them
right here you don't even need to go down is
it the article to fish them out but they'll be
there too so what is the mission statement format alright
this is my for me this is like the magic
recipe the one that I use and everyone's gonna have
a different format for me this has worked really well
so go with this one use it and then you
can once you get a little more advanced and you
build up the habit you can play around with the
format for me it starts like this one is your
general purpose in life what is your general purpose and
this is going to be different than the second point
which is your specific life purpose so for me I
like to have a general purpose and a specific one
the reason I do that because my general purpose this
is the one that I make abstract and I make
it such that I hope it'll never ever ever change
so this is the one that grounds me completely this
is one I can come back to no matter what
I don't care if I had a bad day I
don't care if I got a divorce I don't care
if I murdered somebody I don't care if police beat
down my house and arrested my entire family this purpose
is gonna stay the same no matter what and for
me personally it's to understand life and to experience life
that is my general purpose and also I tend to
be a little bit long-winded I have kind of a
secondary general purpose and that is to put my energy
towards creative contribution towards making something new and unique and
contributing something new to the world so that for me
is my general purpose and I can be totally confident
in that that totally grounds me because I know that
no matter what no matter what happens in life I
don't care if World War three starts if there's a
nuclear apocalypse zombies come up from the dead whatever I'm
always gonna want to understand life that's always that's something
that's gonna be really important to me and I'm gonna
want to experience as much of life as I can
and I'm always want to contribute something creative something positive
and creative to the world to me that is the
bedrock of who I am and what I'm gonna find
important in life and meaningful for you that might be
something different so I definitely encourage you to think about
this you're gonna have to go through and when you're
writing the statement you have to think about each one
of these points and it can take you days weeks
months maybe even years to really get to the core
of what it is that your true answers are for
you what your authentic answers are to all these points
in the format but you got to start somewhere so
start now rather than waiting for a year so point
number one your general life purpose for you that general
life purpose might not be to understand life maybe you
don't care about understanding life I'm an analytical guy I
like to understand stuff maybe for you it's living with
love maybe for you it's about excitement maybe for you
it's about I don't know you know going out there
and being a thrill seeker an adventurer or maybe for
you it's it's something along those lines maybe it's friendship
maybe it's your connection with God whatever it is doesn't
matter put it on there I think about it once
you know it put it on there then the next
point on this list is going to be your specific
life purpose and specific life purpose this is a one
sentence phrase try to keep it as concise as you
can a short one sentence phrase about what you're doing
with your career what are you contributing to the world
how are you affecting the world maybe for you this
is going to depend on what your job is and
really what you want to be doing with your life
creatively and how you want to be impacting the world
for me personally right now this is something I'm still
working on still polishing up my specific life purpose right
now is to become an authority in personal development and
to influence people with my understanding so that's what I'm
doing right now right and it was shooting these videos
writing articles etcetera etcetera that is my life purpose for
you it's gonna be something different probably totally different unless
you're doing exactly what I'm doing in which case you
know if you're a doctor then you're gonna want to
write something like my purpose is to heal people my
purpose is to be the best cardiologist out there or
my purpose is to be the best plastic surgeon in
the world or if you're an actor then your purpose
is to create the best movies that you can create
or if you're a writer it's to create the best
you know the best novel that inspires people or that
a chance people delights people so this is gonna be
career related most likely for you whatever your specific life
purpose is that's point number two all right point number
three is one word one word maybe two words for
what you're mastering over the next 10 years this one
is important because I talked so much about mastery and
mastery is one of the blueprint concepts but mastery to
me is such an important concept and all convince you
of it throughout these videos eventually that it will be
for you too and I want you to have what
it is that you're mastering over the next 10 years
in your life so again this might also be career
related one or two things for me what is it
on mastering personal development what does that mean that means
that for the next 10 years I've committed myself no
matter what I'm gonna master personal development I'm gonna study
it I'm gonna learn all there is to it I'm
gonna practice it I'm gonna experience it I'm gonna struggle
through it and I'm not quitting I'm gonna keep going
along that route for 10 years to just see where
it takes me I don't care where it takes me
I'm gonna do it for 10 years there's no quitting
I want the same for you so what is that
for you again if you're a doctor then maybe it's
mastering the specific specialty within doctoring if you're a lawyer
maybe it's mastering some aspect of law right if you're
a writer it's going to be mastering the craft of
writing if you're a teacher it's gonna be mastering maybe
public speaker or teaching in some fashion whatever it is
if you're a street sweeper and that's where you're gonna
be for the next 10 years then it's going to
be knowing and mastering how to sweep streets you know
I don't care what it is whatever it is that
you find that you have a passion and something that's
going to be important for you something that you can
commit to for 10 years and something where there's enough
that you can sink your teeth into it and study
it and learn it and really become excellent at it
so what is that for you that's point number three
you're gonna put it on your list and just one
or two words as all you need you don't even
need a sentence for that for me it's personal development
all right the next thing on your list is going
to be your top ten values so values is a
deep topic I'm not even going to scratch the surface
of it here all I'm gonna say is that once
you do know your ten values then you're gonna write
them down in order of most important to least important
just single words maybe two words if you have a
value that requires two words to describe it I talk
about values in other videos values is actually a another
blueprint concept because they are super super important so I
talked about Values Clarification how to go through all that
in another video but here just the top ten values
that you've got just to give you some idea of
what my values are just kind of rattling off what
I can remember from my list it's number one it's
understanding number two its consciousness number three is creating number
four is independence number five is uniqueness number six is
excellence number seven is I'm you know rusty is is
health then there's also Beauty is on the list accomplishment
is on the list and self discipline and self-control or
on the list so that's my list of values and
I actually think I have probably like 11 or 12
of them not just 10 see I come up with
this format so I'm special I get to break the
rules only for myself but yeah once you got your
10 values write them down and then you'll be going
through and reordering in them and shuffling them and tweaking
the words on it as you're reading through this list
every day so your top 10 values and then of
course the next point moving down the list is going
to be your top five feelings the top five feelings
are going to be five words usually adjectives for how
you like to feel the best feeling that you could
feel in your life so if you have the ideal
life how would it feel to you in five words
for me that's something like and I'm still refining this
because I I tend to be choose picky and indecisive
here for me I have more than five right now
but I'm a hone it down so right now definitely
proud is one of them excited is another one optimistic
is another one calm is another one calm is in
tranquil serene those are some of the adjectives for it
what else do I have on there strong feeling a
feeling of strength that you get also disciplined I love
the feeling of being disciplined being on top of everything
and energetic I love having energy I love feeling well
rested and good in my body so those are some
of the ways that I like to feel so have
five adjectives for you that are the most important those
are gonna be important to ground your goals and everything
else because those feelings are ultimately what is making you
fulfilled in life so you're gonna have that and then
going down the list is you're gonna have your top
five strengths now what are these these top five strikes
you can get by going to authentic happiness calm which
is Martin Seligman's site he's kind of the founder of
the positive psychology movement he's a psychologist researcher who studies
fulfillment of happiness and he has a website called authentic
happiness calm it's kind of associated with the University that
he works at and there there's a bunch of different
assessments you can take and you can take the character
strengths assessment and when you're done taking this it's all
online is free go ahead and do it'll take you
30 minutes or something pretty pretty easy to do it's
gonna pop out five-year greatest human strengths there's like a
list of 50 of them or something I forget exactly
how many and it'll choose the five that are most
correlated with with the the way that you answer those
questions and for me those ended up being something like
number one is critical thinking and open-mindedness that's one strength
they tend to have like a wordy description then the
second one came out to be creativity and on Genuity
ingenuity and an originality so that's the second one the
third one came out as something like compassion the fourth
one was wisdom the fifth one was like a love
of learning and I have like a sixth and seventh
actually on my list so love of learning wisdom I
forget the rest but it's on there that's why I
had this list I can remember the top five and
then so you can have those strengths and those are
gonna ground you because those strengths are the things that
you want to be living on a day-to-day level this
is the stuff that you want to be putting your
best foot forward at in work for example in career
is living these strengths and you want to find a
way to get those strengths also playing parts and your
personal life and your hobbies and your relationships other things
you're doing outside of career so that's going to be
the point about strengths and then going down the list
is you're gonna have the zones of genius so this
comes from the book the big leap by gay Hendricks
there he talks about what it means to be living
from your zone of genius and you have some questions
there and he lets you figure out what your zones
of genius are I talk about that in other videos
so I'm not gonna help you identify them here but
once you know what your zones of genius are you
can list them there however many there are for you
for me right now there's three one is big-picture thinking
two is oh god what does my son is genius
number two is so yeah big-picture thinking and then it's
about conveying people and helping them understand so basically a
form of persuasion is number two and number three for
me is quality controlling the quality of products and services
that I put out there so those are my three
Drizella genius and those are great because again this is
this is kind of where you want to be working
out of is out of your zones or genius and
bringing them again into all aspects of your life whether
in business and career most definitely but then also if
you can make them work in your personal life and
your your relationships family life also good and then finally
what you're going to have at the end of your
personal mission statement document is you're going to have your
top goals for the year so what do you want
to accomplish this here list them in the order of
most important to least important and how many of these
goals I would say 5 maybe 10 kind of depends
probably keep it to about 10 goals you can't list
every goal for the year identify that you probably want
a separate document for that but here because you're reading
this mission statement every day especially in the morning when
you're just starting right before you go to work knowing
your top five or 10 goals is important it's gonna
it's gonna subtly shift the way that you're moving and
creating your day and the things that you're prioritizing in
your day because those goals are gonna be at the
top of your mind especially because you just finished reading
the statement you finish reading those 10 goals and that's
gonna that's gonna set you up for success and then
also those goals you're gonna spend quite a bit of
time polishing up and editing those because goals tend to
well first you tend to accomplish them and so you
might want to cross them off the list and put
new goals on there as you're getting new goals they
might displace the other ones that were on there sometimes
goals when you write them down they just fall off
your radar because you no longer want them after a
certain while that's kind of crazy a crazy phenomenon belt
just basically accomplishing gold but not even going out there
and accomplishing and achieving them simply by losing your desire
to chase after them and that can be a really
powerful thing so that about does it that's the whole
format for the personal mission statement if you had a
fall trouble falling along and remembering all that you can
find it down below in the article I write more
you can find it on actualised org slash blueprint and
