What is the point of life an advanced explanation Are
you ready to hear it? Listen close cuz this is
gonna be really good Why is life structured as it
is have you ever wondered that if we take a
step back and We look at the big picture What
is reality up to what is it doing? Where is
evolution headed? I? mean really look Why be born why
suffer why grow? Why mature why go to school? Why
get married? Why have sex why earn money? Why die
Why go through all these contrivances it sure is a
lot of effort for nothing, isn't it? Or maybe it's
not for nothing then again. Maybe it is What is
reality really up to Oh Leo reality's not up to
anything don't be silly. It's just reality. It's just some
arbitrary stuff going on Do you really think that's what's
going on some arbitrary stuff is going on you think
that this this is arbitrary You think the room you're
sitting in is arbitrary You think this face and body
before you is arbitrary you think these words coming out
of my mouth or arbitrary you think? That your ability
to understand every word that I say These various abstractions
is arbitrary You think billions of years of evolution a
universe filled with? Billions of stars and planets. This is
all arbitrary It's just somehow here Without any further logic
behind it Well stop assuming that Life is dumb It's
not dumb at all If anyone here is dumb, it's
you for failing to see the design of life Life
has a grand overarching design and it is not by
any means random or accidental or coincidental or arbitrary This
is a grand design of the highest brilliance a design
that is so epically brilliant that you struggle to even
comprehend a fraction of it a tiny fraction of it
from your limited vantage point as a human being So
do you really want to know what the point of
life is It's possible to know The problem is can
you handle knowing it? Because of course as you might
expect when we're talking about the design of the entire
fucking universe The but the the the point might be
a little bit radical a little bit bigger than your
petty human problems a Little bit bigger than your petty
human logic and what your mind can understand and Maybe
it won't fit into what society has taught you what
your religion or your guru or your science has taught
you Maybe it's just a little bit bigger than that
Okay, so here it is hold on to your hat
To understand this we have to split this up into
two parts So ultimately I want to tell you what
the point of your human life is But before we
get there, we need to talk about what the point
at the universe is because your human life is a
part of the universe and so we got to start
at the macro level the universe moved down to the
micro level, which is your little petty human life and
then of course they will converge as they must because
Everything is ultimately one So here it is the universe
the macro picture The universe is an infinite singularity as
I have said before imagine a hyperdimensional sphere with infinite
radius That means it extends forever and it never ends
it Extends not in three dimensions not in four dimensions
in an infinite number of dimensions Of course it doesn't
even look like a sphere because a Sphere has a
finite radius. What does a sphere with an infinite radius
look like? Well, actually it looks identical to a sphere
with a zero radius So in a sense this sphere
is literally nothing but at the same time it's everything
This sphere contains inside of it every possibility all possible
pasts presents and future's happening simultaneously at once not inside
of time and not inside of space because those are
within This sphere that I'm talking about This sphere is
an unlimited field of consciousness, this field is self-aware sentient
alive intelligent unlimited all loving and creative This field is
of course God as religions have talked about for thousands
of years as people have speculated about But you can
become directly conscious that this is the case. You don't
need to speculate or theorize about it or take it
as Dogma this field Subdivided itself into an infinite number
of parts. Why did it do this? Because there is
no distinction between a division and a unity So this
sphere since it's eternal and has existed outside of time
forever Already contained within its within itself all possible subdivisions
Because this sphere is absolute infinity an Infinite singularity. It
is one. There's only one of them in existence There
can only be one because this is reality there is
only one reality within this reality are an infinite number
of sub realities, but the ultimate overarching encapsulating reality is
one and that turns out to be a very crucial
point to understanding the purpose of the whole universe Because
if you assume that there's something outside the universe You're
not getting it There can't be anything outside of it
because it has an infinite radius. So it includes Every
possible space where there could be something else. It includes
every possible dimension where there might be something else You
see that so because it's one it's radically one Because
it's so total There is nothing outside of itself and
no one outside of itself and So there's only one
thing that this Sphere can do all it can do
for eternity is explore itself and Be itself This sphere
remember don't think of it as a dumb physical object
think of it as a Sentient field of consciousness is
some mind it's a universal mind which is able to
imagine and think This sphere has a desire it can
desire it wants to know itself and It wants to
be itself, of course just for it to be it
has to be itself just to be But it also
wants to know itself and As it turns out because
it's one there's no distinction between knowing and being and
It cannot be itself or no itself Because being a
knowing are really the same thing unless it lives through
itself It needs to live through every single possibility of
itself in order to simply be itself So what the
singularity does in its infinite wisdom is it creates and
sends down probes into itself So imagine this sphere sending
probes inside of itself to look into itself to see
what it is because otherwise without these probes they can't
really know what it is so What's happening is that
the universe is trying to see its own insides from
every possible perspective and All there are in the universe
are perspectives there is nothing but perspectives But there is
an infinite number of these perspectives and so For the
universe to be what it is It has to explore
all of those perspectives and when it completes doing that
Then it will complete its own existence In this way
the universe bees itself knows itself experiences itself and creates
itself because all of these are actually one To be
itself and must create itself to know itself. It must
experience itself So being knowing experience and creation all turn
out to be the same thing So you might also
Think of it like this if this is a giant
mind which can think up anything it can imagine anything
you can imagine dreams to infinity any number of dreams
that can imagine so imagine that this mind in order
to realize itself as What it is and to realize
its full potential as an infinite mind what it must
do is it must literally think through every possible thought
that can be thought and every possible dream that can
be imagined and So, of course It goes about doing
this it has forever to do it because time itself
is something that it dreams up Space itself is something
that it dreams up Amongst a million other things that
it dreams up So this mind or this universe has
trillions of sentient beings in it all of which are
its probes They're not apart from it. They're not separate
from it. They are it they are like tunnels that
run through the interstices of this hyper sphere and Your
human life This thing that's happening right now that you're
conscious of this is one of those probes and So
what your life is from God's perspective from the absolute
the ultimate perspective From the highest biggest picture perspective is
that God is using your body and your life to
give itself a colonoscopy To look inside of its own
asshole to see what's in there That's your life tada
That's what you're doing here you are God giving itself
a colonoscopy and That's what every creature is because without
you you see God could not know what it is,
so You are a essential fundamental irreducible part of God
You are of course also the whole of God itself
because God is nothing but the sum total of all
of its infinite parts and you are one of those
parts and You are all of those parts, but right
now you're only conscious that you're one of those parts
So let's summarize here. What is the point of the
universe? The point of the universe I'm going to phrase
it here and frame it for you in maybe eight
different ways So these are all basically the same thing
we're talking about the same thing, but from different perspectives
So one way we could phrase it is that the
point of the universe is itself Because there's nothing outside
of itself because it's one so what's the point the
point is it This is the point being is its
own point Another way to phrase it is that the
point is for God to simply be itself Another way
to phrase it is that the point is to experience
all the parts and the whole Because you can't know
the whole without experiencing all the parts Another way to
phrase it is that it's for God to experience being
a creator See fundamentally God is a creator It's a
creative capacity. It's an infinite creative capacity. So it creates
everything It's like a fountain that just spews out creativity.
And so it does so for eternity to infinity Creating
everything and then delighting in its own creation and through
this process God actualizes itself as a creator Another way
to phrase it is at the point of the universe
is God realization. It's for God to awaken to its
self It's for God to experience its own infinite magnitude
Because God is a marvelous thing And it's epic and
is huge it's the biggest thing that exists So, how
does it realize its own enormity Through this process called
life that's how The point of the universe is for
God to create itself and to love itself and this
part about love it might seem like it's a Cute
romantic New Age notion but it's not this is absolutely
central To the physics of the universe is love It's
all created out of love and for love See my
episode. What is love if you want to know more
about that Love is uh it Has a deep metaphysical
topic. I'm talking about metaphysical platonic love here. I'm not
talking about some sexual attraction Although of course, that's one
example of love and The other way we could phrase
the point of the universe is that it's unity through
division God realizes its own unity through all of its
own divisions But now you're wondering well Li okay that
maybe sounds interesting and cool but what does it got
to do with my Mundane ordinary life you're talking about
Stuff about the universe it has nothing to do with
my personal life and my job and my relationships in
my family. Well, Here we go. Here's the connection So
again the point of your human life now And I'm
gonna explain it about eight different perspectives phrase into eight
different ways is as follows Number one is to realize
that you are God Because everything is one you're not
just a part of God you are the whole of
God and so a very important part Of your human
petty life is to realize that you are that The
whole and not just a part that you are not
just merely a probe or The eyeball on the colonoscopy
machine But that you are the one looking through the
colonoscopy machine So imagine that you're giving yourself a colonoscopy
and So your job is to realize that you're doing
that Because right now so far in your life. The
only thing you realize is that you are the tip
That goes in and you don't realize that you were
the rest of it and the one looking through it
and the one who is inside of looking into That's
what you fail to realize so far. So that's a
very important central point of your life Secondly, it's to
realize that you created all of this all of this
all of it But that you forgot Weird sounds behind
me Distracting me So where was I? Okay, so you
forgot that you created all of this. So when you
go out and you look into the night sky The
stars and so forth you Created all that and your
job is to become aware of that. That's what it
means to be aware of the oneness of it all
Your job is also the point of your life is
to realize your own magnitude just how big you are
to realize that you are unlimited in fact and Absolutely
infinite and That you are the creator You created it
all you just don't know how you did it yet
So your job is to find out Your job is
also to love yourself and By that I don't mean
love your personal self. But of course including that but
I mean loving all of yourself Loving everything. So when
you go out and you look into the night sky
to the Stars everything you see and All the way
beyond all that even love all of that Another point
of your life is to become godlike So this is
a little bit separate and distinct from simply realizing that
you're God because you can realize that you're God but
that you can go back to being ungodlike in your
manner and lifestyle and So really Most of the work
within spirituality and Your evolution as a Consciousness is becoming
more and more godlike. That's the hardest part Is actually
changing your lifestyle to reflect your realization that you are
God and that you are the Creator Another important point
of your human life is to be a conscious creator
and Again this is distinct from realizing that you are
the Creator because you can realize that you are the
Creator but then You can still go about creating an
unconscious manner so here you need to actually realize that
the power of creativity That spawned the entire universe is
literally at your fingertips at your disposal Should you choose
to tap into it and to use it in a
god-like manner? You can do that, but will you do
that? Well, that's a whole other point Most people don't
Another point of your human life is to conquer fear
with unconditional love By doing so you become godlike in
your life In the way that you hold and carry
yourself in the way you think and act Another point
of your human life is to embody love and goodness
Absolute love and absolute goodness, which is the same thing
as saying to be godlike in your lifestyle and As
you do this another point of your life is to
inspire others through your example in the same way that
God inspires human beings to write poetry to Make movies
to create songs to create paintings to build buildings to
Fly to outer space all of this is inspiration God's
inspiration But now see when you realize that you are
the creator and you take full ownership and responsibility for
your creativity and what you create and you start to
do it consciously from Love and goodness having conquered your
fear and your own selfishness and egotism now you can
inspire others through your example to also become godlike like
you and also to realize themselves as God and the
reason of course that you want to do, this is
Not to earn some money from them or to get
some sex from them or to get approval from them
or to become a guru you want to do this
because You as God realize that you are one and
so therefore all those other people all those other parts
of you your sisters and your brothers that The greatest
gift that you can give to them from God's position
of love is the realization that they themselves are God
and So you can help them to unify the various
divisions within God that were created Another important point of
your life is to experience the duality People forget this
Especially those people who are serious spiritual seekers seeking awakening
they forget that you're here You're incarnated into this life
For a specific reason it's to experience duality That's why
you were created you're a probe You see so don't
don't go running off into some nirvanic realm just yet
take in the richness of the duality that's here because
When you exit this life and when you fully merge
back into the absolute Whenever that is There's not going
to be anything there. They're not gonna be any distinction
there it's going to be completely non-dual and completely formless
and in stinked and So You're gonna actually want to
come back down here to experience distinction and duality the
up and the down the good and the bad and
So forth God wants to experience duality because duality is
a part of Non duality God wants to experience limitation
God doesn't just want to be unlimited. It also wants
to be limited because to be truly unlimited is Simultaneously
to limit yourself in every possible way That's the enormity
and the radicalness of this design Another point of your
human life is to experience every moment fully Fully Rather
than the way that you run through life now, which
is that you're just Doing stuff and living in your
mind living conceptually in the future or in the past
But you're not present enough to realize the beauty of
what this is here You're disconnected from being Another point
for your human life is to help others to awaken
because you love them and Because they are you and
I've already sort of touched on this point a little
bit earlier It's a bit of a duplicate Another point
of your life is to evolve your consciousness See you're
here not to eat and Work and get money and
acquire pleasure and sex and family and all these things
cars and houses. That's not why you're here You're here
to evolve your consciousness all of that other stuff is
just grist for the mill of evolving your consciousness Are
a probe which has a certain limit on how much
of God you can see See because God is such
an amazing stupendous and wondrous and loving thing that your
Capacity to handle it's love and beauty only goes up
like say on a scale of one to a million
it only goes up to like a hundred and so
your lifetime here is supposed to be growing you're you're
like Your eyeball so that you could take in more
and more of the light of the consciousness the beauty
and the love To go from like a hundred to
two hundred To three hundred so you can take in
more and more and more and more until ultimately you
get to the point where you become Infinite in your
capacity to take in consciousness and love and at that
point you explode and you become God you merge with
God The probe realizes that it was God the entire
time The point of your human life is also to
align your will with the will of God because these
are actually not quite the same thing and I'll elaborate
more upon this in my episode about free will which
will be coming up pretty soon in the future It's
really a companion episode to this one But basically for
ordinary human beings their will is not aligned with God's
will because they are so selfish and they are Devils
And they're they are incapable of love because they're crippled
by fear And so it turns out the things that
they desire and that they want for themselves and for
the world are rather shallow and petty and ungodlike we
might say and So the more that you grow yourself
and evolve your consciousness the more you realize that you
are God the more you Start to align your will
with God until at some point. They actually become identical
Of your human life is to create the most beautiful
creation possible again because you realize that you are literally
the Creator You're not a creator. You're the creator. There's
only one creator here and it's you and So when
you realize that and you take ownership of that then
the question becomes what kind of world Would God create
and then you realize that you as a human are?
literally doing that through your hands feet mouth eyes and
Everything you do in your life You are creating the
world But the question is what kind of world will
you create? Will you create a heaven or a hell?
Will you create knowingly or unknowingly Accidentally or deliberately because
you see God didn't create this entire universe accidentally or
Unknowingly He did it with with very clear intention Precision-engineered
So are you gonna do that within your own life?
Are you gonna replicate that or are you gonna choose
to be a devil and you can choose to be
a devil you? could choose to create unconsciously and if
you do choose that then what happens is is that
That's fine. That's also God You're not really contradicting God
if you do that if you choose to be a
devil but Then that is God experiencing what it's like
to create Unconsciously, and of course God also wants to
experience that It would be almost like a master Paynter
imagine Picasso, you know He's so good at the technical
skill of painting that it doesn't even challenge him anymore
he can paint anything with perfect precision and That actually
was the case with Picasso I mean his art is
very abstract and loosey-goosey but when he was trained, he
was professionally classically trained as a Just like a realist
artist So he could do that, but now imagine, you
know the artist just gets bored because you know, his
creations are too perfect so what he does is he
just like Drinks two bottles of vodka and then goes
paints just to see what that's like and of course.
He'll probably create some ugly stuff What do you know?
It's interesting? Who knows what'll happen? So so most people
who are creators what they're doing I mean, they're still
gods everyone is God The problem is you don't know
your God So when you don't know that your God
and you haven't taken ownership, you play a victim you
haven't taken control of your creative power Then what you
do is you're like that drunk You're like that drunk
Expert artist who's a painting all sorts of silly stupid
stuff. And so that's what most people are doing and
The last point of your human life is to choose
and to define who you want to be How you
want to show up in the world? Because as a
creator you have that choice now, of course virtually nobody
Exercises this choice because they believe that life defines them
and they believe that they're victims and they're stuck but
when you realize your God now you have a choice
about this and you can define who you want to
be and how you want to show up and so
you can decide whether you want to show up as
a devil or as an angel and Either way, it's
fine. There's no right or wrong answers There's no judgments.
You can go any way about it you want Because
God has total freedom So here's what's gonna happen in
your life and In the universe as a whole is
that you will reincarnate an infinite number of times until
you realize every corner of God you will in fact
live through all possible lives through all humans and Non-humans
alike and aliens and everything else that exists in the
universe. You'll live through all of it Because there's only
one universe and there's only one self capital S self
and You're it God is it You and God are
one At every stage of your incarnation consciousness will be
evolving Evolving towards what towards greater self-awareness a larger embrace
of oneself a larger embrace of the world in the
whole cosmos towards greater love Unconditional love and towards a
greater and deeper realization that you are one with everything
and that you are God and Ultimately what this leads
to through all these different incarnations is finally you will
reach a point where you merge back into the total
unity of What you are? nirvana Total lack of distinction
There's nothing there. It's total emptiness this Nirvana, but this
is paradise. This is The ultimate heaven the ultimate bliss.
It's pure bliss you will merge into it and This
is what we call the Godhead and That is your
ultimate truest nature and you will realize that and you
will be at total peace as this Godhead nothing can
touch you because you're completely immortal and you exist this
therefore eternity as Nothingness and Then you'll get bored of
that and you will decide to divide yourself again and
this whole process will begin again You will polarize out
of this Indistinct nirvanic state and you will divide yourself
an infinite number of times to recreate the whole game
over again and You'll go through it again and again
and again and again and again to infinity forever for
eternity and that is What you've been doing here and
that's why you're sitting in that chair right there Right
now exactly where you are listening to me as I'm
sitting here Or maybe you're standing Or maybe you're lying
down or maybe you're upside down. I don't know where
you are Tada, that's what's going on here Consciousness has
divided itself and it seeks to reunify with itself and
this cycle goes on forever You have an infinite number
of lives and you cannot die All that's going to
happen is that you just change forms and you probe
yourself from one Orifice to another orifice to another orifice
turn the orifice cause there's an infinite number of orifices
But luckily you have it infinite time to probe yourself.
So here you are Going through one of the orifices
which is the country that you're sitting in right now
Whatever you're doing your current life the relationship you're in
the marriage you're a and the children you have and
all that That's one orifice of God that you're exploring
And Of course, you have nothing to lose in this
process and there's no possibility of failure because in the
end all pads eventually lead to Nirvana it's just a
question of how long How many? Incarnations. Will it take
you to finally realize Nirvana? It's possible for you to
realize Nirvana right here right now because Nirvana is actually
not somewhere else, but literally right here But It'll probably
take you many incarnations Ted - why is it up
to the point where you realize that? Now, let's answer
some projections But Leo, I thought life was meaningless. Isn't
that what Buddhism teaches isn't that what enlightenment is about?
It's meaningless right now You're saying that there's meaning to
life No, I didn't necessarily say that there's meaning to
life Actually life is literally meaningless It has no meaning
But don't confuse this with some negative outlook some pessimistic
nihilistic depressed state or a lack of passion or creation
Meaningless means It has no meaning so meaninglessness itself is
meaningless Therefore you can still be passionate and creative and
do whatever you want nothing changes in Fact you now
have the freedom Because of this meaninglessness to create whatever
kind of meanings you want of Course being is prior
to meaning and is much more profound than meaning That's
something you need to become conscious of Being is its
own point? Oneness must be its own point because there's
nothing outside of The universe that it could appeal to
to be a point. It's not like the universe can
go somewhere it can only work within itself You see
there's nowhere to go. It has no place to go
because it is everywhere already So, where's it gonna go?
What kind of point is it gonna have its point
is itself? but what you need to realize is that
you are part of that point because you are it
and You as God are a conscious intelligent creator therefore
you get to define what point you want your creation
to make But while Yes, it's true that everything is
ultimately meaningless You have to also understand that Human life
has a deliberate design and a higher function like a
cog in a machine So like if we take a
car engine We could say that the car engine and
some ultimate absolute sense is totally meaningless. It has no
value It has no worth. It has no meaning just
a car engine But at the same time we can
say that the Pistons in that car engine have a
very specific deliberate function that was deliberately designed Those pistons
are there because they're supposed to be combusting Moving crank
shafts and so forth you see and So in that
sense, the pistons have a function they were designed with
a function likewise your life here is not accidental You
were just some random creation of Your parents having sex
it's much more profound than that You have a function
which I've explained already Your function is to evolve and
to realize God and Then to take full ownership of
that So it's sorta like a game that God is
playing with itself. God is purposefully artificially limited limiting itself
so that it could experience what it's like to live
through itself as a limited thing and then to realize
itself and Do that over and over again it in
a bunch of different ways and through that it gets
to experience life in all the Multi-faceted richness that it
is and through that it gets to experience its full
beauty love and Grandeur and magnitude and its infinity so
you can't appreciate infinity until you've literally live through every
possible life Through every possible era through every possible time
On every planet in every universe and all the multiverses
all of it together Only then will you fully appreciate
what infinity means Another objection, but leo. I thought that
nothing mattered. Yes. You're right nothing matters Yet God must
still be God it must still experience all of its
parts because that's what God is and the only thing
that's impossible for God is For God not to be
God So ultimately creation doesn't matter God doesn't create because
it matters God creates because it doesn't matter God creates
for the joy of creation God creates to delight itself
just to be itself Because there's no point outside of
itself. So all it can do is play with itself
Creation is its own end because there's nothing outside of
creation Think of it like a child playing with LEGOs
There's no reason for the child to create anything particular
with its Legos, you can create whatever it wants it's
playing so it will just create whatever gives it the
most joy and delight of Course the child can create
monstrosity Or it can get very kind of Deliberate about
what it wants to create and create we can create
the most grand beautiful designs you can create whatever it
wants it can do both and There's nobody judging this
child because this child is all by itself. It's all
alone So it has an infinite number of time and
a different number of Lego blocks It can build whatever
it wants. And of course you are this child As
a human your creative capacities are of course limited So
you don't have an infinite number of locks? You only
have a certain number of blocks but still it's rich
enough you have enough blocks that you can build some
pretty amazing stuff or if you do it unconsciously you
can build some monstrosity and If you just let your
life run on autopilot without deliberately creating anything then your
default Creation because you're still gonna be a creator no
matter what you do. Your default creation will be a
monstrosity And so that's what most people's lives are. They're
monstrosity Because they don't realize that their creators Another objection,
but Leo isn't this religious dogma that you're talking about.
No Don't blindly believe anything I say here Verify for
yourself discover it for yourself if what I say is
true. You can discover it you can verify it But
leo, how could you possibly know all this Seems like
you're just making this shit up pulling out of your
ass It's difficult to explain to you how I could
know all this precisely because the knowing of it is
so grand and so complex, and so subtle That you
will only be able to know once you know You
can't anticipate it. You can't predict it. It won't fit
within your logical schemes or within your paradigms of proof
and evidence But the way that I know it is
through a combination of Ways which you could use and
I recommend you use these ways through mystical experiences that
I've had many of them through contemplation through deep study
and research of Dozens and hundreds of spiritual books and
spiritual scriptures and through my own intuition and Ultimately the
way that I know it is because God Told me
and Of course people don't like to hear that. That
sounds kind of kooky But at the same time I
am God, so what happened was that I literally invented
it. I Imagined it. So when I say that God
told you told me I told myself So when you
realize that you are God and that you create everything
you will also realize that you are speaking to yourself
and that you are inspiring yourself and creating yourself and
Therefore you yourself are ultimately going to imagine and create
for yourself The explanation to what it is that you're
doing so in a sense it's like the child is
sitting there playing with LEGOs And imagine that it's been
sitting there for hundreds of years playing with LEGOs. Just
kind of eternal child that doesn't age And then at
one point it asks itself this question, like wait a
minute. What am I doing here? What is the point
of all these Legos? How did I even get here?
And Then it starts to think and contemplate and then
ultimately it realizes oh, yeah, that's it I of course
I put myself here to play with these Legos you
See, but the child can't turn to any kind of
external resource because the child is all alone forever So
when you realize that you will realize that ultimately all
the answers that you come up with for life are
actually your own imagination and Of course people get turned
off by this they say Oh, leo. So you're just
imagining all these is they're not real but what you
don't understand is that Creation is imagination. You're imagining everything
everything you call real you're imagining You're just not taking
ownership of it yet because you don't realize How you're
creating it because you're not conscious enough of that yet
when you do you'll realize that You are making all
of it up Including the chair that you're sitting on
Including the stars the atoms the planets your body and
everything you are imagining at all that's what this is
and Of course, you're imagining all of your explanations for
reality It's a bit of a mind fuck It's a
bit of a tough pill to swallow for many rationalist
and atheists and skeptics but nevertheless It is what it
is. You can realize this for yourself Another objection Leo,
but what if you're deluded? Well What's your alternative You
see you have to propose an alternative Be very careful
because don't assume that well leo. Well, my alternative is
just science Or my alternative is just nothing But you
see that then becomes what governs your whole life That's
how you live your life under this nothing And so
therefore what you do by having nothing as an alternative
we're having science as an alternative is that you're a
piss-poor? Miserable creator you're a victim You don't realize your
full creative capacity So the way you can test whether
what I'm saying is deluded is try it for yourself
live your life as a creator as though you were
God and See if that doesn't improve your life dramatically
and Then ask yourself. Is there a better way to
live? And what you'll see is that there isn't and
through this you can convince yourself that what I'm saying
has some truth to it Another objection, but Leo, what
about your life purpose course, are you contradicting that? No,
I'm not everything I'm saying here is just an extension
of the Stuff I talked about in a life purpose
course the life purpose courses is Very narrow and specific
about helping you define your career and also to find
your top values and top strengths and all that in
it It's supposed to be specific and concrete to really
get results in your life and what I'm talking about
here is just Giving a bigger context to that life
purpose course. So take what you learn a life purpose
course, which I recommend you take It'll help you a
lot to figure out your life In a practical way
and then connect it to with the stuff that I'm
saying here and then you'll be on fire You'll be
on fire But leo does this mean that I can
fail at life because it sounds like you're saying that
there's like These different lives and I'm gonna incarnate through
and you know, I could evolve slower or faster Some
people have all slow or some people grow faster and
so forth And you know what leo what happens if
I don't realize God before I die Like I said
before there's no failing at this game Because death is
just an illusion death doesn't really exist your eternal and
your immortal and all roads ultimately lead to Nirvana So
it's a question of time and even that is not
a problem it doesn't matter if you live through 50
lives and Don't get enlightened because uh The point is
to experience those 50 lives So don't don't like think
that your your goal here is to quickly rush in
Nirvana's as soon as possible No, your goal is to
savor all of yourself all of your delusion and idiocy
and duality limitation Suffering and pain. Yeah experience all of
that How else can God know what pain is unless
it lived through you to realize that so create all
the misery and death where you want destroy the entire
world and therefore give God the the pleasure of Realizing
that as part of what it is Another objection, but
Leo, I just want to escape to this life and
all this pain and suffering. I just want to escape
to Nirvana So why don't I just kill myself? You
could nothing stopping you you're totally free to do that
of course What you don't realize now is that the
grass is always greener on the other side So once
you do kill yourself and let's say you even do
escape to Nirvana well, you're gonna be there you're gonna
be omniscient and all-knowing and Totally indistinct and then what
will happen is that you'll just you'll want to polarize
yourself back and divide yourself again and return back here
Because it's gonna be boring up there you're gonna want
to experience all of the duality all of the limitation
It's almost like a video game You can always quit
a video game at any time But if all there
is to do is play video games And you're not
playing a video game then when you're not playing it,
you're just kind of sitting there doing absolutely nothing There's
nothing you can do. There's nothing to see there's nothing
to look at. There's nothing to interact with that's like
Nirvana and then so you get tired of that and
then you want to get back into the game and
So that's where you are right now you got into
the game from a position of Nirvana. You just don't
remember You see if you knew that then you would
start stop trying to run away from where you are
right now where you are Right now is the perfect
place that you need to be? You are here to
experience duality Besides which Nirvana is not separate from this
place right here right now If you become conscious enough,
you can realize Nirvana in this very present moment There's
really nowhere to go Don't think that Nirvana is someplace
else. Nirvana is right here when you die, you will
be right fucking here There's nowhere to go You're already
nowhere Because there's no such thing as space or time.
There's only nowhere you are residing within nowhere You have
always been within nowhere. Anywhere you go is nowhere Another
objection, but leo isn't this ego? I mean, it sounds
like you're saying that there's like a a point and
a purpose to life, but this is ego, right? Wrong
I am explaining the architecture of life Like I said
with that analogy about the car engine in the Pistons
so I'm not saying that there's one right purpose. I'm
not even saying that you have to evolve I'm not
saying you have to do anything you can do whatever
the fuck you want But there is this overarching design
Just like with that car engine It's not egotistical to
say so this is just what God is I'm just
basically explaining to you what God is It functions in
certain deliberate ways It's not arbitrary It's not just random.
It's not just chaos There's structure here But Leo doesn't
enlightenment mean that there's nothing to do and It sounds
like here you're saying that now I have a I
have a mission I have stuff to do Well be
careful here because I didn't actually say that there's anything
to do if you want you can do nothing Also
careful because enlightenment doesn't say anything about what you should
and shouldn't do per se All that enlightenment means is
that you realize that you are the creator and Then
the question becomes what do you want to create? Enlightenment
doesn't tell you per se what you should create and
in fact, there are no shoulds in the universe Nobody
can tell you what you want to create because you
yourself are the Creator So if there are any shoulds
you created them yourself? So the only way there couldn't
be shows is if you create them if you don't
create them, they're not there You see so nobody can
force you because you're one you're all alone. You're like
that child playing with LEGOs There's nobody telling the child
what to do What he can or can't build? What's
right or what's wrong if that child wants to sit
there for a million years and not touch a single
Lego block he can Do that or he can build
monstrosities or he can build? brilliant Things that move and
evolve and whatever, you know do whatever you want but
if you fully understand that you are the Creator you'll
probably want to actually Experiment with the process of creation
and not just sit there and do absolutely nothing Because
you know being a creator is fun. Lego blocks are
fun Most people who aren't building with the Lego blocks.
It's not because they've decided consciously not to build that
would be okay The problem is that they haven't made
a conscious decision. It's just that they don't even know
that their creator It's like they're sitting with a bunch
of Lego blocks, but they don't even know that you
could Stack them and stick them together To build stuff
because nobody has explained it until now now it's been
explained to you. Now. You could say aha that's my
purpose here is to play with these blocks in a
conscious way and That would be helpful to you whether
you are or are not enlightened yet In the last
objection but Leo what you said here doesn't conform to
the spiritual scriptures that I've read and the classical teachings
Or to what? I Cocteau Li has said or something
like this look That's because there's much more to spirituality
than one or two realizations or what Eckhart Tolle has
told you There's a lot more there's a lot more
depth and also breadth to it. And there's a lot
of ways to talk about it So a lot of
the things that I've said, you know aren't original they
have been said many times before by many gurus Yogi's
sages Mystics and Scriptures and so forth. You just have
to like really dig through it and think through it
and also realize these things for yourself which can can
be difficult to do it can be difficult to put
all this together a Lot of times people think of
enlightenment way too simplistically as just one or two realizations
of no self or something like this but there's more
to it a Lot of gurus don't teach you well
about your creative capacities and powers And actually one more
objection, but Leo isn't reality perfect Isn't that what enlightenment
reveals so then why are you saying that it needs
improvement? It doesn't need there's nothing to improve Isn't improvement
just ego seeking This is very simplistic black and white
understanding of non duality Yes, everything is perfect and nothing
I said here contradicts the perfection of it So like
that child playing with those Legos From the absolute perspective
anything the child creates was perfect Even if he creates
some monstrosity, it's okay. No big deal. What's the problem
the monstrosity? He's just creating stuff. It's bit still perfect
But Even if everything is perfect, you can still create
stuff out of those Legos and enjoy whatever you create
So the mistake is to think that if everything is
perfect, then I shouldn't even touch those Legos But that's
wrong Nothing in the perfection Says that you can't play
with the blocks and be a creator. In fact, it
would be a big mistake to interpret it that way
Conscious creation is not about needing something to be better.
You're not doing out of a sense of lack like
ooh, you know like Something is not right in my
life. So I'm gonna go create something that that's not
what I'm talking about. What I'm talking about is Self
is expressing yourself Self-expression as God expressing your godhood not
out of lack, but out of abundance out of love
Not out of fear, not because you need something not
because your ego is scheming towards something not because you
want to manipulate somebody to get something, but just purely
out of love and selflessness Because that's how God does
it. God needs nothing God didn't create this whole thing
because it needed to it did it because it loves
itself and it wanted to It's just being who it
is See, it's just being who it is. And so
the invitation here is for you to become more aware
of who you are Authentically and then to follow that
and If that means you just want to sit there
and not touch anything if you want to escape to
some nirvanic realm Go for it. Nobody's stopping you. You
can do that, too But realize that you'll just come
back here You'll get bored of that you'll come back
So this is the overarching Explanation of the point of
life quite profound quite significant It's not so simple as
just saying everything is meaningless and purposeless When you understand
everything I said here at a deep level your entire
life will fall into place Everything will become crystal clear.
You will know what to do. You will stop being
lost the way you have been for decades 99% of
people have no idea what life is about Which is
why they're so miserable They feel depressed uninspired mundane alienated.
That's right, because you're alienated from yourself as God you
are God alienated right now and That's why your life
sucks and you are literally uninspired Which literally means, you
know inspire in Spirit you literally are uninspected You lost
your own spirit You're living a materialist life. And so
of course you're miserable and depressed. Of course And of
course you're addicted The reason you're addicted is because you
haven't discovered the joy of creation if you did you
wouldn't be addicted to anything You wouldn't need anything if
you purify your ego and you became selfless and you
became godlike So all your suffering and pain is self-created,
of course So this gives you an opportunity to escape
from that This is your escape plan if you want
You know in the end if you want to suffer
in misery and be a devil go right ahead God
will. Love you anyways God will just experience what devilry
is like and This explains why society is also so
dysfunctional is because 99% of people are What make up
Society and of course because they're miserable depressed and uninspired
and alienated society is also this way and That's why
all the chaos and dysfunction in society is happening within
government politics business These mass shootings that we see on
on the news terrorist attacks and crime and drug abuse
and Corporate shenanigans and corruption and government all this this
is just the only reason it's happening is because the
people who are doing it 99% of our population is
literally uninspired Alienated from their true self Probably just like
you and So most of our populace is wasting their
lives Not being loving creators because they haven't found the
love within they haven't found universal love and so of
course It's no wonder that our society is so unloving
and unkind That's why Because you must find the love
within And Nothing in your life will ever substitute For
universal love Because that is your true nature and because
you as this probe as this Individuated spirit right now,
which is living through this particular incarnation. You have a
thirst, you know you Slava you have a deep down
knowledge a remembrance of the power of love Because you
were that before you incarnated here So you want to
get back to that that's what you're seeking that's all
that human beings are ever doing in life The only
thing human beings are doing no matter who they are.
How evil they are How big of a devil they
are or anything is they are seeking love Everything that
any human being has ever done was done out of
love. The problem though is that it's a twisted Contorted
love a Dysfunctional neurotic love so, for example when a
terrorist blows himself up he's doing it out of love
Love for his religion love for his ideology love for
his fellow Friends and family and mates love for God
love for Allah but you see it's a very twisted
form of love because the love is very partial like
he loves Allah, but he hates the Christian God or
the Hindu god or Jewish god or some something like
that and See, he loves his family and maybe his
his national compatriots and fellow Terrorists, but he doesn't love
Americans or he doesn't love Europeans or whatever But see
that's because he's not realizing that he has everything he
hasn't realized that yet. So his love is is is
so twisted and dysfunctional See so as you actually become
truly more loving in your love becomes universal and your
love is not very partial to your particular tribe Family
friends your own body Your own personal possessions your own
ego, but your love extends to the entire universe and
all sentient beings then your love is gonna be Less
devilish love and more like godlike love the universal love
because God's love is completely unlimited unconditional and universal So
my suggestion for you having heard all this is to
start living your life as if you were God Here
are three questions to help you to figure this out
number one if I were fearless and unlimited What would
I create? Number two if I were totally selfless, how
would I live? Number three if I were immortal, what
would I create? And what would I do? And you
see immediately that this is hard to do it's hard
for your ego to do this because you're so goddamn
selfish and This is why you need many lifetimes and
a lot of years of personal development and growth and
consciousness work in meditation psychedelics and all this stuff you
need all that and It's so difficult and painful and
challenging you have ego backlashes and backsliding all this stuff
Yeah, because this is the process of evolution evolution is
not easy being God is not easy It's the ultimate
challenge to completely let go of all your fears all
your egotism and Become totally selfless fearless and loving Not
easy, but it sure is worth it and that's the
whole game of life there's nothing else going on here
That's it So I recommend that you align yourself with
the purpose of the universe because up to this point
You've been living your life totally out of alignment and
you've been feeling the consequences the very real practical consequences
of that You've been feeling it in your relationship in
your career In your finances in your politics And your
personal life Within your own mind You've been driving your
own self crazy with your mind So how do you
make this alignment? Here are some ideas first of all
by taking 100% responsibility for your life That's what God
ultimately has to do. God has to be totally responsible
because He's all alone. She's all alone God can't play
victim So stop playing victim God can't whine judge, bitch
moan blame or scapegoat anybody else because God is all
there is So stop doing that if you want to
be more godlike Also, I recommend that you align yourself
by Working to raise and elevate your consciousness. This is
very direct through meditation psychedelics self-inquiry Shamanic breathing other sorts
of techniques that I've shared in the past Also, you
can align yourself by discovering and also deciding who you
want to be in this life You get to decide
do you want to be a devil? Do you want
to be an angel? Do you want to be inspiring?
Do you want to be a leader? Do you want
to be loving or do you want to be filled
with hate? Do you want to judge do you want
to blame? Do you want to scapegoat others? do you
want to wage a war against the feminists or the
Marxists or the terrorists or the Nationalists or the the
Democrats. What do you want? The problem is that you're
you're doing all this without having decided what you want
and so it's just unfolding automatically and what you're getting
by default is devilry because devilry is unconsciousness Another way
to align yourself is by following your highest vision for
yourself and It's very easy to find what your highest
vision for yourself is Its who you would be if
you were ultimately loving ultimately selfless and ultimately conscious What
would that look like That is you Moving towards God
if you follow through on that fearlessly and I underscore
fearlessly because you will have a lot of fear and
It will not be easy. Your ego will resist it
all the way So what I'm describing here is not
easy stuff Which is why it's so rarely done, in
fact, it's so rarely done that what I'm saying here
sounds insane and utterly impossible a total pipe dream for
most people because you have no references of Others in
your community who have done it and in fact those
few people who have done it are Deified as gods
within our culture Jesus Buddha Muhammad Handfuls of others What
did they do why are they so famous Why are
they revered and worshipped by billions of people for thousands
of years? Because they did this and Because it's so
hard But also because it's so hard It's so inspiring
and the reason it's so inspiring is because you know
that this is what your purpose in life is That's
why it inspires. You nothing will inspire you more than
being totally loving selfless and cautious Because that's all there
is that's to do to hear that's all we're doing
here That's the pinnacle of existence Nothing can inspire you
more than that So Why not live your life? inspired
Why not live your life? inspiring others Why not live
your life demonstrating the goodness and love of what you
ultimately ihara You see and the reason is all of
your weaknesses and all of your fear And another way
that you can align yourself with the purpose of the
universe is by helping to inspire others and to awaken
others through your love and through your speaking of truth
and Through your personal embodiment and demonstration This is you
playing the highest role that you could play in the
world So in conclusion your spirit yearns to express itself
Not just in any way but in the highest possible
way in the most inspiring possible way Your spirit is
fueled by love and selfless action Which is why why
when you go to the movies and you see some
Great movie some tearjerker movie that brings you to tears.
Why do you cry? Because what you see there is
the highest expression of God love and selflessness This is
the highest motivation that exists for mankind this is the
highest motivation entire universe Because this goes to the very
source of all of existence There's nothing higher Your spirit
is Supercharged when you allow it to reconnect with The
oneness the truth of existence that's what fires your spirit
up and don't make the mistake of thing that there's
only one way that you can do this like Don't
get the silly idea that you have to become a
guru in order to somehow inspire your spirit and Reconnect
with oneness. No, like there's a million different ways that
you can do it you can do it as a
lawyer as a politician as a Scientist as an inventor
as an artist as a musician as a filmmaker as
an astronaut as an inventor as a businessperson There's a
million ways that you can Translate the love and selflessness
of God into our physical world and We certainly don't
need everybody to be gurus We need to inspired artists
and poets and filmmakers and politicians and Lawyers and business
people, especially businesspeople lawyers and politicians. We need them to
be more inspired than anybody else Otherwise what we get
is the devilry that we see happening all over the
world right now nationalism and all sorts of environmental destruction
catastrophe and racism and hatred and division you see People
who sow division in the world do so because they're
scared and Because they don't know how to love and
because their love is so partial and limited and because
they have not realized themselves as God Sure, they worship
God, but they don't actually realize that they themselves are
God They're hypocrites The majority of Christians and Muslims are
total hypocrites Your spirit yearns to reconnect with the truth
and that is ultimately your way to salvation and The
world's way to salvation because if more people don't do
this then the world is going straight to hell and
You and your children and your children's children will live
and experience that hell and you know what it's totally
fine God loves it. All God loves hell This world
can get annihilated through nuclear war and environmental destruction and
God will enjoy it all Because that's how unconditional and
selfless God's love is God loves Anything that it creates?
So now, you know now you know what true living
looks like true life begins now for you today Now
you know why you're here for the first time in
your life and You can feel it in your spirit.
The things that I've said here have resonated deeply within
your heart Which is a sign of its truth Because
it has triggered love within you it has motivated you
and it has inspired you and The reason it has
is because is true Welcome to the first day of
your life Return to this episode repeatedly because you will
forget You will fall off the narrow path towards God
and you will fall into depravity and devil, Ori and
forgetfulness and All of this will just become a pipe
dream for you Unless you come back again and again
and again and you work and you push to expand
yourself to grow yourself to Wash yourself of yourself Until
you build enough momentum and enough critical mass that finally
you reach a tipping point And from that point on
you are on the narrow road to To awakening and
to living as a creator and to demonstrating for the
whole world What you can do is God Alright, that's
