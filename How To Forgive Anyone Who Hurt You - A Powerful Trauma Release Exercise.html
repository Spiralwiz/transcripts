I want to teach you about the power of forgiveness
forgiveness is a very very powerful tool that can help
you to heal and to reach new levels of consciousness
and fulfillment in life this is not just some new
agey BS this is the real deal this is where
the rubber meets the road this is real where the
real work happens the real inner work so you're gonna
get a taste of that here this is not gonna
be a theoretical talk about intellectual philosophical stuff this is
gonna be a hands-on guided forgiveness exercise and you will
learn what forgiveness is and how powerful it is by
actually doing it and this exercise can change your life
if you apply it properly so are you open to
that do you want to roll up your sleeves and
actually get to work and try how this works most
people are in denial about how much forgiveness they have
left to do in their life I know I was
like when I was first introduced to this idea forgiveness
you know me being sort of rationally minded scientifically minded
person you know I look at it like well forgiveness
like who do I have to forgive like it sounds
so intangible it sounds so airy-fairy and new agey is
it really gonna produce a material change in my life
like I want something concrete but forgiveness seems it's like
it's almost like this sort of like girly fluffy thing
that you just do to kind of puff up your
emotions or change your state but actually it's not that
way at all and you will discover that by actually
trying it you have way more forgiving to do than
you realize or that you're willing to admit this template
this exercise is gonna be a template for how to
heal any situation in which anyone ever in your whole
life has ever wronged you or hurt you in some
way now think about that that's a pretty powerful tool
if they can do that because think of how many
people have wronged you in some way in your life
and especially of course we're talking about childhood and we're
talking about your teenage years we're talking about your family
situation your parents your siblings but also beyond that your
relationships some people get into some brutal and nasty intimate
relationships some people have falling-out with their friends or they
get bullied at school I mean the list is endless
there's so much to work on but really the the
the meat of this work is gonna be around your
family and around the first 20 years of your upbringing
whatever that involved and usually of course that involves various
degrees of trauma and of course people have wronged you
even people that you love deeply have wronged you so
many times not just once not just twice but I
mean your family members have wronged you in so many
ways you hold so many grudges and resentments and and
that all it all accumulates and it's there sort of
in your subconscious mind and so this this template I'm
gonna present to you here this exercise will will sort
to clear that out it's very powerful now because it
is so powerful I got to issue a warning here
that if you're gonna do this with me you can
get emotional I might also get emotional as I'm guiding
you through this this may stir up repressed trauma in
your life and you know depending on how much that
you've had and how serious it's been it can be
very powerful to bring that stuff up maybe something repressed
will come up that you've swept under the rug for
twenty years we don't know now of course you probably
want to start with something light we don't want to
get into something super heavy right away but just as
a warning keep that in mind so this is going
to be rather long guided exercise it's gonna require about
thirty or sixty minutes of your time uninterrupted you're gonna
have to sit there with your eyes closed as I
guide you through it and you're gonna be doing some
visualizations and other things that I'm going to asking you
to contemplate so just prepare yourself for that there's not
gonna be a lot of preamble here we're gonna get
right into it so if you're ready then let's get
going this actually requires your earnest participation this is a
live exercise okay are you ready but first before we
actually begin I need you to kind of preliminary pick
a person that you want to work on forgiving so
we need a specific person this should be somebody who
hurt you or wronged you in some way someone that
you resent or are angry with to some degree someone
you have some emotional baggage with someone who had a
traumatic impact on your life now like I said probably
you're best off picking your mom or your dad or
your siblings or other family members perhaps an ex-girlfriend or
boyfriend or an ex spouse perhaps some bully at school
something like that if you had some really serious trauma
like you were abused sexually or physically that might be
something you want to hold off on for now because
that can you know that can really stir up a
lot of deep stuff and that might be something you
want to actually have like a therapist for or whatever
but assuming you didn't have such serious trauma then I'd
recommend you pick your mom or your dad to work
on because there's a lot of forgiveness to do on
your mom and on your dad and on your siblings
but pick one right now and also pick a specific
situation so it's not enough just to be a person
we want some traumatic event that has caused you to
feel hurt or wronged like you were treated unfairly in
some way and you feel like there's still some injustice
that lingers and remains so probably something that happened in
your childhood it could be a minor thing or it
could be a major thing so if you need to
pause this recording right now and take a moment to
select the person and the situation and assuming you've already
selected that now let's begin so I'm gonna be guiding
you and I'm also going to be explaining and teaching
how forgiveness works all at the same time so this
is a something you're actually going to be experiencing and
learning by doing it not just through theory all right
so sit back get comfortable in your seat make sure
you're not going to be interrupted for the next 30
to 60 minutes close your eyes and relax just take
a few moments a few breaths to close your eyes
and just to relax and to clear your mind now
bring to mind the person that you're going to be
forgiving in this exercise and bring to mind the situation
with this person that you're gonna be working on there
are probably more than one situation but we're gonna focus
on just one for now you can focus on other
other ones later so just pick one juicy one now
if you need to when you're gonna be reliving this
situation a little bit here in your mind you can
do so from a third-person perspective sort of like an
outsider looking back like you're from the future self looking
back into the past self and observing that situation so
that sort of third person looking from the future back
into the past this gives you some distance so if
it was a really traumatic event with a lot of
emotions and pain and suffering you can be somewhat detached
from that and look at it an observer rather than
someone who's deep in it so now bring to mind
the situation and observed in your mind simply what happened
replay it a few times in your mind of course
this situation was supposed to have hurt you in some
way or made you feel resentful towards this person or
made you feel wronged or like some injustice was done
to you and because of that you might be angry
you might be upset you might be depressed or what
other other negative emotions might be there good keep replaying
that situation in your mind while I'm talking notice your
true feelings towards this person as the result of this
situation now you might love this person but deep down
there might be some resentful feelings that you have suppressed
or just try to ignore or that you never fully
aired out or communicated either to this person or even
to your own self you never really deeply explored this
situation and the feelings that it generated in you probably
because they were negative and so you just wanted to
sweep them under the rug and to avoid it but
now we're coming back to face it so notice your
true feelings about this situation how did it make you
feel don't try to act tough or pretend like you're
invincible but actually how did it make you feel you
are probably more vulnerable than you want to admit what
feelings about this situation in person haven't you fully expressed
yet what have you kept uncommunicative and unsaid what judgements
do you have about this person in this situation notice
especially your judgments of them judgments are things like he
was a bad person she was evil that was so
gross what he did to me that was so terrible
what she said to me etc how did this person
wronged you or hurt you how did he or she
fail you what is it that you wanted from them
but they failed to give you in this situation and
how do you really feel about that take off your
armor and the surface level stuff and go to your
true genuine feelings so if you feel hurt allow yourself
to feel hurt so just keep replaying this situation with
this person over and over again in your mind from
a distance looking at it because this is a thing
we're gonna be working on forgiving now first we need
to bring this up to the surface so it's in
your awareness so we have something to work on to
forgive now this person in this situation is what we're
going to be working on to forgive so now ask
yourself do I want to forgive this person for this
situation yes or no but don't feel forced to say
yes let's go slowly here really your mind as I'm
guiding you through these different questions your mind I want
your mind to actually gain traction with the questions that
means you're not just answering them mindlessly because you feel
you have to give a specific answer or do something
I'm telling you but rather be true to your own
feelings and go at your own pace so ask yourself
honestly do you want to forgive this person or not
and if the situation was terrible enough you may not
want to and that's okay then just say no I
don't want to but before you cement your answer let's
look a little deeper what does forgiveness mean here what
are we asking you to do what are you saying
yes or no - are you willing to let go
of what they did to you without holding it against
them in any way anymore are you willing to let
go of the hurt and the sense of injustice are
you willing to stop judging them are you willing to
stop demonizing them are you willing to understand the situation
from their point of view are you willing to extend
your mercy to that person are you willing to let
go of needing to get even so are you again
replay the situation in your mind again and look at
that person in the face in your owns mind's eye
and just take a look are you willing to forgive
this person now again before you submit your answer let's
consider why would you say yes to forgiveness what's the
point of forgiving this person you might feel like they've
wronged you so badly that they don't deserve forgiveness why
should I forgive them after what they did to me
that's a very common reaction but let's really explore this
notice that you are holding on to negative feelings about
this person in this situation and if this is a
situation that happened in your childhood and now you're an
adult you've probably been holding on to these negative feelings
for years for decades maybe for 40 years it's been
nagging on you knowing on you notice that your hate
resentment and judgment weighs you down in life it makes
you a better person so my question to you is
do you want this negativity to continue in your life
or do you want to let it go the choice
is yours I'm not forcing you to do anything here
don't feel like you have to answer in some way
to please me if you don't want to forgive then
don't forgive I won't judge you for it but I
just want you to contemplate for a moment do you
want to be a hateful person or a loving person
so this here is a matter of what kind of
life do you want to create for yourself going forward
imagine that forgiveness will make you stronger as a person
so do you want to be a strong person or
a weak person do you want to be big or
do you want to be small so again replay the
situation in your mind and considering all these extra factors
that I just told you think about your answer do
you want to forgive this person yes or no this
is about what kind of person do you want to
be going forward stop acting like a victim here set
your intention what do you want do you want to
forgive or do you want to keep holding on to
that resentment you can you can hold on to it
until you're on your deathbed if you want to the
question is is that wise is that really what you
want we're just trying to get you to consciously consider
your options and to make a choice consciously do you
want to become strong do you want to be living
from your highest self or do you want to continue
being small do you want to continue being traumatized do
you want to continue have to have bad dreams about
this for the rest of your life and to have
it souring your relationship because if this is a family
member you probably see them again at least on occasion
and maybe even often maybe you talk with them on
the phone and it's ours everything do you want to
keep that going or do you want to clear the
air and maybe rebuild that relationship keep looking at this
situation until you realize that you want to be strong
and not small which means that you want to forgive
so if you're still resisting saying that you want to
forgive then just keep keep keep looking deeper until your
mind realizes that forgiveness is the wisest course here and
if you're unsure be courageous and take a gamble after
all you can forgive a person that you can you
can pick pick your resentment back up later if you
want to if you really think that the forgiveness was
a mistake so take take a gamble you don't really
have much to lose now let's look at this situation
from the other person's point of view I want you
to deeply contemplate why did this person hurt you did
they do it because they wanted to hurt you be
careful here because if the event was traumatic and very
emotional then it can start to trigger you and you
can start to feel as though yes the person wanted
to hurt me but if you contemplate and look deeper
which you'll realize that the person didn't actually want to
hurt you it might feel that way from your point
of view but that's not what they were doing from
their point of view so take a look and try
to understand what they were doing from their point of
view and remember their point of view is not your
point of view people are different so how you react
to a situation how you might have handled that situation
is very different than how somebody else might because you
have different strengths different weaknesses different genetics different upbringing a
different personality different capabilities the four talents different experience different
resources more money less money more status less status you
might be a different gender you might be an introvert
and they might have been an extrovert and so because
of this there are many different ways in which a
situation can be handled now here is the key to
this forgiveness business I want you to notice that in
this situation whatever they did to hurt you they didn't
do it because they wanted to hurt you and to
cause you suffering they did it for five key reasons
these are universal truths about human behavior number one they
did what they did to hurt you out of ignorance
that means that they were doing their best to do
good in that situation but given their limited understanding of
life and their limited capabilities the result wasn't so good
for you from your point of view and so it
hurt you but they were trying to do their best
they were just ignorant and so their best wasn't that
good try to see that this is a very Universal
point that covers many situations most of the quote-unquote evil
stuff that people think other people do to them isn't
really evil it's just action out of ignorance and that
really that person who hurt you was probably trying to
do what they thought was best for you from their
point of view now this can get very twisted because
if they're in a low state of consciousness what they
think is best for you if they're very very ignorant
then what they think is best for you might be
exactly the opposite and it might end up hurting you
but they don't know that so take a look at
this situation with this person and just see were they
acting out of ignorance another universal point point number two
is that whatever they did to hurt you they did
it out of weakness and out of fear maybe they
cheated you somehow maybe they lied to you maybe they
tried to screw you over maybe they stole something from
you maybe they manipulated you whatever they did to you
notice try to see what their motivations for doing it
were and notice that if they did something nasty to
you it's probably because they were weak in that moment
and they succumb to fear some kind of fear they
were afraid of something therefore they hurt you again this
is very Universal and very common when people think that
other people do evil things to them usually those people
who are quote unquote doing the evil things are simply
acting out of weakness and fear point number 3 if
they hurt you they did so out of selfishness notice
that this person in this situation was probably being selfish
point number four they did it out of a desperate
desire to get love because they lack love so if
this person hurt you it's because actually deep down they
were lacking in love and they wanted love from you
but because they're ignorant and they're selfish and they're weak
they didn't know how to properly get the love that
they wanted from you so they got it in some
sort of way that ended up hurting you but getting
them the love that they wanted so notice that this
is another very deep universal principle of human behavior so
usually when somebody does something evil quote-unquote evil it's because
they simply want love but they don't know how else
to get it other than through this selfish action which
then we call evil because it hurts somebody else and
point number five they did it out of a lack
of consciousness this person hurt you because this was not
a high consciousness person at that time in that situation
if the person had more consciousness if the person was
more developed if the person was in a more conscious
state they would have behaved very differently in that situation
notice that so very likely all five of these points
ignorant fear selfishness the need and lack of love and
lack of consciousness all five of these points played out
in your scenario with this person and this completely explains
why they hurt you so I want you to very
clearly replay the situation in your mind and just notice
the real root reason why you were hurt because this
person acted out of ignorance weakness fear selfishness unconsciousness and
a need for love if you still can't see this
keep replaying the situation and keep contemplating it deeper until
you see that this is true I guarantee you that
it's true it's just a question of how deeply are
you gonna go inside of their minds to try to
understand their motivations can you see how in this situation
this person was not being evil but actually this person
was trying to be good and that this person was
seeking love in ignorant ways that's all that this situation
boils down to that's really all that these kinds of
situations where somebody gets hurt boiled down to is people
are seeking love in one form or another it might
be in the form of money or sex or a
relationship or a favor or a business opportunity or fame
or pleasure these are all just different forms of love
people seek these things not knowing why they're seeking them
because they think that they will ultimately lead them to
so sort of fulfillment and satisfaction and they pursue these
things in ignorant ways so apply this principle to your
specific person and situation until you can see clearly how
this is so really understand why the person behaved the
way they behaved not in all the little details you
don't need to go all the way into the back
of their life but you also can just kind of
hypothetically consider that this person for example maybe this person
cheated on you or maybe this person lied to you
or manipulated you and you might feel like well but
they shouldn't have done that but to say they shouldn't
have done that this ignores their entire life history this
ignores how they were raised how they were brought up
what kind of trauma they carry what kind of education
they received or did not receive what kind of ideas
and beliefs and ideologies they were indoctrinated into as they
were growing up what kind of challenges they're facing what
their health situation is like maybe they're in bad health
therefore they're acting in a selfish way because they need
whatever because their health is is limited or maybe they
were born in a certain environment where they're their environment
severely limited their opportunities for success or for sex or
for money or for fame and that's why they act
the way they act maybe they were born or raised
in a different culture in a different country in a
different generation different era where there were different standards different
values they were programmed with these standards and values and
now they're acting from those in this situation you see
so you have to sort of consider all those factors
you can't just assume that the person is identical to
you and therefore they should act the way that you
would have acted try to see that given their worldview
given their genetics given their personality type given their environment
given their upbringing given the things they were led to
believe given their value system given their unique matrix of
fears and insecurities that all of this shaped this person
to be as ignorant as he or she was in
this situation and to seek love in such limited ways
that it resulted in you getting hurt can you see
that and now here's the final kicker that's going to
lead to you getting healed I want you to bring
to mind all of the times in your life when
you acted out of ignorance weakness fear selfishness unconsciousness and
a need for love notice how you do this too
now of course it can manifest in very different ways
maybe this person cheated on you but you say well
but leo I've never cheated on anybody yeah maybe not
but we're really trying to go broad here and go
deep as well which means we have to get abstract
so look at where in your life you have acted
out of ignorance weakness fear selfishness unconsciousness and a need
for love so if this person cheated on you for
example what was that well they needed love and that's
how they got it it ended up hurting you okay
but where in your life have you acted in a
similar manner where you needed love and you acted in
such a way that ended up hurting somebody else but
you needed it so badly that you couldn't help yourself
and therefore somebody else got hurt draw that direct connection
that commonality between this person and yourself what you need
to see is that this really isn't personal it's not
about you and it's not about that other person these
are universal dynamics of human behavior in life that we're
dealing with here you weren't hurt because somebody personally wanted
to hurt you you were hurt because somebody else was
acting out on universal principles of life trying to survive
and working with ignorance weakness fear selfishness unconsciousness and a
need for love and they didn't know how to satisfy
it or they satisfied it in some unrestorable way than
Aperta you so it's really not personal and likewise you've
done the same thing think about times where you inadvertently
hurt somebody else out of ignorance weakness fear selfishness unconsciousness
or a need for love you don't even notice sometimes
when you hurt somebody it's not even obvious it might
seem like well shouldn't it be obvious that this person
hurt me not to that person not necessarily because they
have a different worldview a different value set and because
they're so preoccupied with fulfilling their needs their need for
love that they're just acting it out without even being
aware of what the consequences are what the collateral damage
is that is nutshell is ignorance that in a nutshell
is lack of consciousness notice how in your life you
try to be good most of the time almost never
do you intentionally try to hurt others when you hurt
others it's usually inadvertently out of ignorance of some kind
now apply this principle to this person in this situation
try to see how this person was actually trying to
act good but they failed simply because they lacked enough
awareness notice that when you do something quote-unquote bad in
your life you are still fundamentally good the bad that
you do is a mistake it's a failure it's an
oversight due to your weakness fear and ignorance it's not
because you're trying to be bad really all you ever
want is to be good the problem is it's difficult
to be good and now apply that exact same principle
to this person in this situation notice that this person
who hurt you is also fundamentally good and they are
trying to be good but they're doing it in their
own way through their worldview through their paradigm through their
belief system through their education through their upbringing through their
personality through their genetics through their body through their mind
and just like you all this person who hurt you
ever wanted really from life was love that's all they
wanted if they lied to you cheated you manipulated you
bullied you why were they doing all those things because
they wanted love try to find that common thread between
your behaviors and this person's behaviors and really all human
behaviors what we all have in common is that we're
all struggling for love we all fear we're all ignorant
to various degrees we're all selfish to various degrees we're
all unconscious to various degrees now granted there are many
many many degrees of it some of us are less
ignorant and others less selfish than others but why is
that isn't that just because we were born in a
different time in a different place to different parents with
different genetics different personality different circumstances different limitations were placed
upon us recognize that your parents were born in a
different time where it might have been much more difficult
to survive requiring them to be more blunt in their
approach this is a deep existential commonality that we're drawing
and you know deep in your bones you know what
fear is what selfishness is what ignorant is what a
struggle for love is you know this deep in your
bones because this is your entire life in a nutshell
this is what you've spent your whole life struggling with
these obstacles these limitations you know these limitations intimately so
you should be able to draw a deep common link
between your struggles and the struggles of this person fundamentally
the struggle is the same it just manifests itself in
different ways take your and really notice this deeply in
this specific person and the specific situation now here's where
the magic happens now knowing all of that now that
you're more conscious of what's really going on in this
situation now are you willing to forgive this other person
for the very same things that you struggle with how
can you hold a grudge against this person for being
selfish and unconscious and fearful and needy and desperate for
love when you yourself are those things and have been
those things your entire life are you really gonna sit
there and with a straight face continue to judge this
person who hurt you simply because they were struggling in
their life to get by to meet their needs you're
gonna judge them for that well then you're gonna have
to judge everybody and yourself too because that's what we're
all doing is your heart big enough to understand and
accept that people struggle with life all the time people
struggle with fear selfishness unconsciousness and love all the time
can you forgive a human for being scared can you
forgive a human for being ignorant can you forgive a
human for being unconscious can you forgive a human for
wanting love can you forgive a human for trying to
be good but failing along the way can you forgive
a human for being selfish are you willing to be
so merciful so strong that you even drop the need
to get even with this person with humans who are
being a turrent unconscious and selfish and scared can you
drop the need to get even with these people this
is crucial because a selfish hurt person wants to get
even a generous strong person can extend mercy without needing
to get even which is the highest strength the highest
strength that you can possess is to be hurt by
another and to not need to retaliate to get back
at them because you're secure in yourself and I also
want you to notice that if you were hurt a
lot of times the reason you were hurt is because
the person who hurt you was him or herself hurt
by somebody else so it's a chain of hurt so
somebody screwed you over because they were screwed over somebody
lied to you because they were lied to themselves someone
cheated on you because they were cheated on in the
past someone hit you because somebody hit them so I
you to think about this are you willing to be
strong enough to break this chain of hurt or are
you gonna be a link in this chain and pass
the hurt on to somebody else you see because when
you hold on and you don't forgive you carry the
hurt with you and that hurt bubbles up in unconscious
and ignorant ways and it affects your behavior and it
ends up inadvertently hurting others maybe your children maybe your
spouse maybe your friends probably the people closest to you
will get hurt the most by the hurt that you
refused to let go of and forgive so I want
you to think about this do you want to be
the type of person who carries this hurt around and
transfers that others onto others and infects others with it
like a virus or do you want to be strong
and do you want to cut the cord cut the
chain right here right now and save somebody else from
incurring your hurt because see now you're conscious enough to
know that if you keep carrying this hurt you're gonna
hurt others is that who you want to be now
here you have the option to make a conscious choice
now don't make the choice just yet let me give
you the two options so listen to your options first
option number one do you keep do you choose to
keep judging this person who hurt you and not to
forgive them in case notice that you are doing so
if you make this choice you're choosing it out of
weakness selfishness fear and ignorance or you have option number
two you can choose to be selfless and good and
to heal yourself and to let go of this resentment
and to cut the chain of hurt in which case
you choose consciousness wisdom and fear I mean and love
over fear so those are your two options now you
are ready now that you really are aware of what
the consequences of your choices are you can now make
a conscious choice as to how you want to proceed
forward consciously do you choose fear and selfishness or do
you choose selflessness and love look at your options don't
feel forced here I'm not forcing you to choose anything
this has to be a conscious free choice look at
these options and make a free choice are you capable
of enough selflessness to let this hurt go to forgive
this person are you loving enough to embrace the one
who hurt you because you understand that they just acted
out of ignorance and fear do you want to be
the type of person who judges others for their selfishness
and fear or do you want to be a type
of person who deeply understands the challenges of life and
the universal dynamics that shape all human behavior and therefore
you understand that humans will act out of selfishness and
fear and a need for love and out of ignorance
and yeah sometimes they'll they'll cause some collateral damage which
might be you but is that gonna cause you to
debase yourself now and to also become selfish as a
result or are you gonna rise above that which do
you choose are you strong enough to love even when
others are too weak to love you or are you
so weak that you're gonna wait for others to love
you before you extend your love to them are you
strong enough to be able to love without requiring your
love to be returned back to you immediately do you
dare to love a person who hurt you recognize that
if you don't forgive this person in this situation right
now you are being less than your highest self you
are being less than you are fully capable of because
you are capable of love and that if you reject
this forgiveness you're doing so out of fear the fear
of what would happen if you loved somebody who hurt
you or somebody who is ignorant which is of course
the very same cycle that led to you being hurt
in the first place by this person so again right
now you have the option the choice to consciously break
this cycle of ignorance so do you choose to forgive
do you choose fear or do you choose love make
your choice whatever choice you make is fine I don't
judge you for what choice you make if you still
decide not to forgive then that's fine that's just where
you're at now there's an additional point before you can
fully forgive the other person you must first forgive yourself
what do you forgive yourself for forgive yourself for all
the times that you have been a turret selfish fearful
and unconscious and needy for love in your life forgive
yourself for all the times that you have inadvertently hurt
others now why would you forgive yourself for this because
that's life because life has put you in this existential
bind where you have to survive and where you start
life from ignorance from total ignorance and you have to
figure out life but life is complex survival is complex
and counterintuitive and it takes trial and error to learn
how to navigate life and how to love and how
to be fearless it takes work and trial and error
to correct your original ignorance with which you started life
so are you gonna judge yourself for having been born
in ignorance does that make any sense of course not
this is just how life has to be you have
to start from zero from a blank slate and then
you have to learn and you learn through trial and
error and you make mistakes and you hurt others and
this is just a part of life and of course
others are doing the same thing and this generates the
full gamut of what we experience in life the highs
and the lows so are you willing to forgive yourself
for being ignorant and selfish and fearful and needy for
love why would you not this is the human condition
and if you're able to hear forgive yourself then notice
that you simultaneously forgive the other person as well there's
no difference between forgiving self and forgiving other because the
very dynamics that are running you are the same fundamental
Universal dynamics that are running all others so what you're
really forgiving is not a specific situation where somebody cheated
on you or stole some money from you or whatever
you're forgiving the general universal principles of ignorance selfishness fear
unconsciousness and craving for love and these are much easier
things to forgive when you frame it in this universal
way because these are like forces of nature is sort
of like forgiving gravity what is there to forgive gravity
is just a force of nature it's not personal see
you and everybody else is in this existential bind in
life everybody is doing their best to try to cope
with reality in whatever ways they're capable of in whatever
ways they know how and a lot of people just
don't know how to cope in healthy ways don't overlook
that to you you might know how to cope with
a situation in a healthy way but don't assume that
others do don't assume that your parents or people from
a prior generation to you have that kind of knowledge
and wisdom remember your parents they grew up in a
time where there was no internet you couldn't just Google
how to cope with depression or with an abusive father
or was alcoholism or something like that it was a
different time they had to cope with these things without
the information that you have today they couldn't go on
YouTube and just search for a video for how to
forgive somebody and then easily in in an hour or
two forgive their mother for whatever for not loving them
they had to suffer your parents probably had to suffer
through that for 40 years until they had you and
then of course they transferred on to you they weren't
lucky enough to stumble upon a video like this they
weren't lucky enough to come across self-help or personal development
or spirituality or non-duality or awakening or any of this
stuff they didn't know maybe the most it is there
with the church where they got brainwashed that was their
life that was their reality they didn't know better that's
ignorance so I want you to keep replaying this situation
with this person in your mind while considering these principles
that I gave you until you realize that anything short
of total forgiveness in this situation would be beneath you
you are too good and too strong not to forgive
this person keep doing that until you've completely forgiven this
person and then check to see if there's any judgment
resentment hurt or anger that remains and if any remains
keep going through this process like a cycle keep trying
to draw a deep commonality between you and the actions
of this person until you realize that their actions are
your actions and that to forgive them as to forgive
yourself and vice versa do this a few times and
you should be able to let go of all judgment
resentment hurt and anger about this situation just keep contemplating
a deeper and deeper and deeper you may need to
do this a few times that's it that's the exercise
now there's an even deeper version of this exercise for
those of you who had some degree of Awakening or
God realization or love realization or the collapsing of the
duality between self and other so those of you who
have not had a collapse of self and other have
not had a mystical direct experience of this have not
had a awakening then the following section is not going
to make much sense to you but those of you
who had let's quickly just go through this this is
the ultimate step that's going to heal you so what
we did up to this point is great that was
sort of at the psychological level now we're really going
to the existential level if you've had some degree of
awakening then you know that the boundary between self and
other is not real and that is permeable and so
you can do this same exercise that we just did
but also in addition to that add on top of
it that you're going to notice that the other that
you resent and are hurt by that that person is
literally you so now we're not just saying that all
the other person behaves in certain Universal principal ways that
are similar to how I behave they are selfish and
I'm selfish and therefore we're all one no no no
that doesn't go deep enough that's still at the psychological
level now at the existential level you need to replay
that situation with your mother or your father or whoever
hurt you replay it in your mind again and literally
notice that your mother or father is you that you
hurt yourself and that you have been resenting yourself and
you were the one who were hurt so both you
were the herder and the one who was hurt and
the hurt that was felt but that's all possible if
you have some degree of awakening some degree of non-duality
and when you do that you start to understand that
the reason that this hurt happened at all in this
situation was because in that situation both parts of reality
both parts of consciousness was asleep and was divided and
fragmented and then finally what you do is you reunite
the two you merge yourself with the other and that
you notice that you and other are one you are
the one who hurt you and you notice that all
of that is you with a capital y all of
that is God with the capital G and also if
you've become this conscious through your enlightenment work then you
might have become conscious that reality self and God are
completely inevitable there's no other way that it could be
so this situation that happened to you it couldn't have
been otherwise not only could it not have been otherwise
because reality is absolute it was also perfect because it
was necessary for your awakening every little detail of your
life that happened to you was all necessary for you
to have your Awakening and for you to go on
and have further and deeper awakenings that's the perfection of
it so you can recontextualize this situation that happened in
your childhood or whatever with this person who hurt you
you can recontextualize that as that was necessary for you
to learn about love and forgiveness and fear and suffering
and to make you more compassionate to bring you to
this point so that you can overcome the situation forgive
let go be merciful and realize a deeper form of
yourself as love and if you've had an awakening into
what love is then you know that you are loved
and then you know that forgiveness is nothing other than
your love you being loved is forgiveness and when you
have an even deeper awakening you realize that everything is
love love is not some emotion or some individual expression
love is the expression of the entire universe such that
no matter what happens it is love so really when
you realize this you realize you go full circle that
there's absolutely nothing to forgive because everything that ever happened
to you was love and at this point you have
accepted yourself completely as what you truly are which is
love and now everything makes sense and you're completely whole
and you're completely healed and now nobody can hurt you
and retrospectively you look back at your life and you
realize that nothing really hurt you because it was all
just necessary for you to learn a deeper form of
love so who got hurt what was wrong now this
this last part here this is some advanced stuff that
I'm saying towards the very end if if this doesn't
resonate with you if you think this is going a
little bit too far into the stratosphere I totally get
that you can just keep working on the psychological level
that's powerful enough by itself but when you bring in
this existential non-dual level this is when you truly have
a complete healing complete and you want to get to
this level because at the psychological level it's still not
deep enough they're still gonna be wounds and still trauma
you can sort of cauterize those wounds at the psychological
level through therapy and through some of these exercises but
eventually you simply need to realize that everything is love
that's the only way to heal yourself completely now it's
not enough to do this exercise just once you're gonna
have to probably do it multiple times until you get
the hang of it you don't need to do it
in all the precise detail and all the steps that
I went through here you can just run through this
recording a couple times to get the gist of it
and then once you got the gist of it you
kind of understand and you can just you can just
do a simplified version of it you don't have to
go through every step and every question do a simplified
version of it basically all you're doing is you're just
you're drawing a commonality between the one who hurt you
and you who got hurt and you're just your unifying
those clothes you're bringing the two closer and closer together
until they just merge into a unity and the whole
thing just nullifies and cancels itself out and it heals
itself in unity it's basically what you're doing so you
don't need to go through all the detailed steps here
and this is just I wanted to guide you in
a very specific way just to teach you about this
now that you know then you can do it faster
it doesn't need to take hours I recommend that you
practice this on multiple individuals significant people in your life
family members those that were closest to you in your
childhood those that caused you the most pain and suffering
pick an individual person and run through the cycle it
can be an abbreviated cycle but run through it for
each individual this can take you days weeks months to
do depending on how much you've had and also for
certain very significant people like your mother your father your
brother your sister maybe your ex spouse or something there
might be so much material there that you need to
do it not just for a specific person but individual
traumatic events that happened with your father for example when
you were five years old 10 years old 15 years
old 20 years old whatever try to find those events
again it's also gonna depend on how traumatic your childhood
was how selfish unconscious and ignorant was your father or
your mother the more ignorant unconscious and fearful and selfish
they were the more trauma and hurt they transferred on
to you inadvertently and therefore the more work you're gonna
have to do to let it all go but also
the deeper your lessons will be so don't think that
if you had all this trauma that somehow you're in
some terrible situation know the upside to having a very
traumatic childhood is that yes it was terrible and I
wouldn't want to live through that myself but the upside
is that if you're able to overcome all that and
to heal it all you will be so powerful so
much more powerful than a person who had it easy
so you have more on your plate but if you
work through everything on your plate wow you can become
really strong also you have more people to forgive than
you think so sit down at some point in your
life with a blank piece of paper and try to
write down all the people that are worth forgiving in
your life for major things but also minor things scan
through your childhood scan through your teenage years try to
find stuff try to find stuff outside the family as
well make this investment in the future of your life
by sitting down now spending the next week or two
doing all this forgiveness work you won't have to do
it forever a couple of weeks of it maybe a
month of it at most should be enough to cauterize
a lot of those wounds and to heal a lot
of stuff and make that investment now because it's gonna
free you up think about how much is gonna free
up your life going forward it's gonna free you up
with your family relationships it's gonna free you up in
your intimate and sexual relationships it'll improve relationships with your
brother your sister your co-workers your friends and so on
and it'll make you a more loving and easygoing and
peaceful person otherwise what happens is that as this trauma
accumulates and it doesn't get processed fully it doesn't get
forgiven and let go you carry it around and it
just it robs you of energy it makes you a
bitter petty depressed a cynical type of person because you've
been so hurt by life that now you lash at
back out at life and you want to hurt others
in life and again that cycle perpetuates itself finally what
I want you to notice here is the power of
understanding I want you to notice and draw a connection
between how proper understanding of a situation removes all the
baggage that was there this forgiveness exercise was based upon
understanding just by deepening your understanding of situations you're able
to heal and to understand a thing fully at the
existential level for what it really is will completely heal
you and so if you think that reality is this
terrible god-awful thing why am I here why am I
so miserable why does life have to be so terrible
that's simply because you don't have a high level enough
understanding really a deep enough understanding existential understanding of your
life and yourself and other people because if you did
then it would heal you and you would not be
this depressed nihilistic cynical person you would be loving God
is mercy because God has infinite self understanding so the
closer your understanding approaches out of God which is omniscience
the more omniscient you become the the more mercy you
will have until with total omniscience you become completely selfless
completely fearless completely full of love completely merciful to the
point where there's not even anything left to forgive anymore
because you completely accept yourself as what you are which
is the truth the absolute which is everything and then
you're incapable of judging yourself or anybody else because you
are everything when you're everything what is there to judge
what sense does it make to judge or to hate
anything to be resentful about anything because anything you resent
would be just you shooting yourself in the foot it
doesn't make sense the only way you can resent something
or be hurt by something is by thinking of it
as separate from you that only exists within duality realize
this that forgive this is nothing other than self-love self-acceptance
unity truth and consciousness that is God's mercy you're so
conscious that you have nothing left to hate nothing left
left to nitpick about nothing left to resent nothing left
to reject because you have completely accepted yourself as what
you truly are and what you are is inevitable so
there's no choice but to accept yourself as what you
are because to reject the absolute to reject the inevitable
is insanity now I want to give a warning here
and this warning goes especially to women in regards to
your intimate relationships be careful not to use this technique
to tolerate people who are actively abusing you right now
so if you find yourself in some abusive relationship with
some jerk who is mistreating you not appreciating you hitting
you whatever do not use this recording to forgive this
jerk and keep suffering his jerky behavior towards you and
keep suffering his abuse that is a misuse of forgiveness
in your situation what you have to do is you
have to leave this abusive relationship acknowledge first of all
that you're in an abusive relationship and this is toxic
and that it's not going to work out leave muster
the courage to leave and then you can practice forgiveness
all you want you can forgive yourself for getting into
this terrible relationship you can forgive the this boyfriend or
this spouse for for being this to you and all
that you can forgive later first you got a like
you got a recognized hitter there is such a thing
as physical danger and just emotional danger you don't want
to you don't want to use giving us to just
like maintain a bad such a sort of like an
objectively unhealthy situation and I mean I'm guys can also
suffer this not just women but I mean guys can
also you know get get just stuck in a toxic
relationship and just keep going at it and and thinking
that well if I just forgive this person more if
I just love this person more maybe they'll correct themselves
it's like know at some point you got to get
serious like if this person is a jerk if this
person is if this person is just totally selfish and
is abusing you and is unwilling to work with you
then to communicate with you is not willing to work
on themselves is blaming you for everything leave this is
where you leave this is not where you where you
used love to try to salvage this thing in this
situation the most loving action is to realize that this
person is not right for you and if this is
not going to work out and to to cut to
cut that cord before it gets out of hand because
it's not gonna work out either way you're just gonna
stay in there and suffer eventually it'll still break apart
so you're not gonna salvage that with with some kind
of unconditional love leaving don't forget that leaving a toxic
relationship is love there's nothing about unconditional love that says
that you have to tolerate a relationship in which you
are being enslaved by somebody else see me being loving
doesn't mean that I have to be your slave that's
a common misunderstanding if you've done this exercise at the
psychological level I encourage you to come back to it
again later at the existential level to really get the
most out of this exercise you have to do it
after you've had some mystical experiences some non dual experience
of some awakening some God realization some love realization after
you've done some psychedelics or even in the middle of
doing some psychedelics do this exercise it's extremely powerful because
psychedelics will open your mind to God to love to
consciousness to the ignorance that others are in and that
you yourself have been in your entire life prior to
the psychedelic cuz they're gonna open your eyes and once
your eyes are open that's when the true forgiveness can
happen that's why psychedelics are so great for trauma work
and right now psychedelics are being approved by the FDA
MDMA is being approved for for treating PTSD mushrooms are
being approved for treating terminal illnesses coping with terminal illnesses
and for for dysfunctional relationships and and other things these
psychedelics are clinically proven to be one of the most
effective tools for these sorts of traumatic situations traumatic childhood
events therapies that that helps with that so I mean
this is not just stuff that I'm makin up like
there's really solid science in the next ten years psychedelics
like MDMA LSD and mushrooms will be approved by the
federal government in the US and other places to be
used in clinics with therapists and licensed practitioners for these
purposes because it's undeniable the science at this point is
undeniable at their ability to to heal and to treat
trauma and why is that simply because they raise your
consciousness they open you up to the fact that everything
is one and when you realize everything is one everything
is love it's real easy than to to forgive others
and to let that stuff go and then you're free
to move about your life and you're no longer tied
down by all that stuff so ultimately that's the point
you want to get to you want to have so
many mystical experiences and you want to have so many
awakenings that you realize that just everything is yourself everything
is love so there's nothing left to forgive because no
wrong was ever done alright that's it I'm done here

better content in the future that's it I will say
one final thing which is that all too often people
treat enlightenment or non-duality as some dry old philosophical nihilism
that's not what it is at all what people don't
realize is that enlightenment is healing with enlightenment you become
complete you become God you become loved practically the point
of enlightenment or awakening is to heal yourself and to
make yourself whole again your birth was like a fracture
in the universal mind a split in the universal mind
and with your awakening or enlightenment that fissure that split
is healed and all the pieces are put back together
again or with your death it's the same thing with
awakening you don't awaken to some bleak nihilistic reality you
awaken to love you awaken to the fact that God
is love and that you are God that's real awakening
Buddhists and so forth they talk about emptiness of course
love is emptiness love is nothingness consciousness is nothingness so
everything I'm talking about here is emptiness it's just that
the word emptiness has a lot of bad connotations to
it it's often confuse with nihilism and people who've never
really fully deeply experienced emptiness don't really understand that it's
love so for me one of the most shocking things
that I realized when I awoke deeply enough is is
that is that emptiness is love see I wasn't I
wasn't out there looking for love see I talk about
love a lot now people might think the coldly oh
you you're so like lovey-dovey and you're so new agey
and hippie because you're talking about love love love and
all this sort of stuff but it's like so you
must have been that way your whole life's like no
I was cynical atheistic rational scientific logical skeptical there was
no love in my worldview for most of my life
I had a rude awakening to love to the point
where it was undeniable then I had to admit it
and then I had to accept it and embrace it
and of course that was challenging to do given my
sort of materialistic scientific atheistic skeptical cynical nihilistic worldview that
I sort of had previous to that but all of
that changes with awakening that's the power of awakening see
reality is not this neutral thing that materialists and scientists
have taught you to believe like oh well reality must
be neutral no it doesn't it doesn't have to be
neutral reality can be love why can't it be love
that's the that's the miracle of awakening you see Awakening
is so good that when you realize how good awakening
is literally it's goodness is what kills you awakening another
way to say it is that you die by drowning
in an ocean of infinite goodness and then you become
nothing you become God and then you're awake and then
it's so obvious that when you look around the room
and you look around the city and you look at
TV and you look at everybody around you you look
at everything you look at your family you look at
your past you look at the future everything you see
everything that's happening around you you realize of course it's
all love how could it not be love what kind
of sick twisted universe would this be if it wasn't
pure love the twisted nough sickness of it wasn't in
the universe itself it was in your perception of it
it was your ego that was twisting it and distorting
it so when we unravel your ego once that is
out of the way then you see reality as it
is just pure love that's the point of awakening people
sometimes ask me well the open but if awakening and
death are the same thing then why why not just
like why work so hard to awaken I'll just wait
to die on my deathbed and it'll be the same
thing as working really hard for enlightenment today so why
don't I save myself the effort so you're saying that
you want to live for the next 50 60 80
years you want to live a miserable life where you
never see the love that is all around you the
infinite love that is everywhere you want to completely miss
that for 80 years and to only realize on your
deathbed that it was all love that's here's life strategy
Oh what kind of life is that you're consigning yourself
to hell that's the most tragic life you could live
is to live your entire life it would be like
this it would be like imagine you were born you
were born and your parents who died right before your
birth let's say your parents died and they left you
they were billionaires they left you with a hundred billion
dollars a trust fund of a hundred billion dollars you
were born and people told you that there's this you
have trust fund go look in your trust fund there's
something awesome there and you're like ah trust findable what
iWhat that's some I don't need no trust fund and
you just I'm just gonna live my life I'm too
busy I'm gonna keep living life I don't care about
this trust fund and you're gonna be living life you're
gonna be struggling you're gonna be going to a to
a minimum-wage job and you're gonna be just like struggling
to pay your bills your entire life and then on
your deathbed you will finally wise up up wisen up
enough to go actually check your trust fund and then
you realize that it was it had a hundred billion
dollars in it and then you're dead see that would
be the most tragic situation but that's exactly what you're
doing when you're postponing your awakening because every minute that
you're not awake you're living through an unnecessary hell not
realize the love that is all around you that is
your god-given birthright in a sense that you have simply
just like ignored given your ignorance so I mean you
could do that if you want to if you're a
masochist but I recommend you awaken sooner rather than later
so that you can appreciate the love what do you
do after awakening you appreciate the love and then you
radiate the love and you participate in the love and
that's how life should be what else should life be
but love if you sort of think about like if
you could design life from scratch let's say you were
God and you were just sitting up in the clouds
and you were thinking about like huh what kind of
what's the best kind of life that I could invent
her for people what would it be it would be
infinite love but the problem is you see is that
humans are so scared of love that they spend their
whole lives running away from it and God can't force
the love on you God can kind of nudge you
towards the the love as they say you you can
you can lead a mule to to water but you
can't make them drink it's like that God is leading
you to love but God can't make you realize that
your love if you're in denial about it like I've
said before denial is a very powerful force fear also
is a very powerful force so as long as you're
in denial about truth and as long as you're full
of fear and selfishness even God Himself cannot make you
realize that it's all love you have to open your
mind and let go of your fear and let go
of your hurt and your frustration and your bitterness and
all that forgive yourself and others make yourself whole and
then you'll realize it and that's the point of blanking
you
