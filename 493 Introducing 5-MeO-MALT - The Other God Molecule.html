            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/seG-RLxnnQQ' target='_blank'>Introducing 5-MeO-MALT - The Other God Molecule</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Introductory warnings about 5-MeO-MALT</b>: Leo, Leo, introduces a new psychedelic substance called 5-MeO-MALT, which has significant potential risks and dangers, especially compared to classical psychedelics like mushrooms, LSD, and DMT.
</li><li><b>Properties of 5-MeO-MALT</b>: Leo describes 5-MeO-MALT as a potent psychedelic with effects similar to 5-MeO-DMT, able to evoke intense spiritual awakening experiences. The substance is effective at low doses and must be used responsibly to avoid injuries or death.
</li><li><b>Personal discovery of 5-MeO-MALT</b>: Leo did not invent the substance but discovered its potential effect and believes its profound benefits on spiritual growth have been overlooked due to minimal trip reports. He stresses that every psychedelic has to be discovered individually by its users.
</li><li><b>Effects of 5-MeO-MALT</b>: Leo explains that 5-MeO-MALT, like 5-MeO-DMT, leads to pure experiences of non-duality, infinite consciousness, and god realization. However, it does so with a different flavor, involving more color and slightly more visual representation.
</li><li><b>Comparison of DMT and 5-MeO-MALT</b>: Leo recounts how 5-MeO-MALT took him by surprise when he smoked it, causing a sudden and powerful awakening experience. This substance has a more holistic feel and is slightly longer-lasting than 5-MeO-DMT.
</li><li><b>Metrics for comparing psychedelics</b>: Leo details the two metrics he uses to assess psychedelics - holism and stability. He explains how some psychedelics, like 5-MeO-MALT, can prolong and expand thought processes, being stable enough to examine existential questions deeply.
</li><li><b>Benefits of 5-MeO-MALT</b>: Leo highlights the beneficial effects of 5-MeO-MALT, such as its ability to enhance introspection about oneself as God and reality's construction. He posits that its gentleness and stability allow for profound spiritual discoveries. 
</li><li><b>Safety considerations</b>: Disclaimers and safety warnings related to the use of this potent psychedelic were presented. Overuse of this substance can lead to psychological and physical injury, possibly even fatality. Leo urges careful adherence to safety protocols, especially considering the minimal existing trip reports on this substance.
</li><li><b>5-MeO-MALT versus 5-MeO-DMT</b>: 5-MeO-MALT, compared to 5-MeO-DMT, is less intense and more holistic, offering an opportunity for deeper introspection and understanding of how reality is being constructed. This includes understanding how one dreams up their parents, science, logic, mathematics, and others.
</li><li><b>Body load of 5-MeO-MALT</b>: The physical discomfort of 5-MeO-MALT is less compared to 5-MeO-DMT for Leo. While 5-MeO-DMT can cause nausea and physical discomfort, which can distract from the contemplative aspects of the experience, 5-MeO-MALT is more manageable and comfortable.
</li><li><b>Personal variance in psychedelic effects</b>: Leo acknowledges that psychedelics' effects vary significantly based on a person's sensitivity to these substances and their own personal growth, and warns that the effects he experiences may be more pronounced due to his heightened sensitivity and experience level with psychedelics.
</li><li><b>Administering 5-MeO-MALT</b>: Leo suggests "plugging" (rectal administration) as the preferred method for consuming 5-MeO-MALT as it reduces the risk of overdose and is not damaging to the lungs like vaping. He suggests starting doses at 10 milligrams for plugging and gradually increasing it based on individual responses and tolerances.
</li><li><b>Frequency of 5-MeO-MALT usage</b>: The substance does not build tolerance, meaning it can be dosed frequently if desired, but Leo recommends against using it more than once a week or multiple times a day and warns about the risks of addiction and potential mental disorders from misuse.
</li><li><b>Serious intent required for psychedelic use</b>: Leo stresses that 5-MeO-MALT is not a recreational psychedelic and should be used with serious spiritual intent because it can lead to an intense experience of actually encountering God, realizing the infinite nature of reality and everything being an illusion.
</li><li><b>Results of 5-MeO-MALT usage</b>: Apart from showing the hallucinatory aspect of reality, the use of 5-MeO-MALT also triggers a sense of infinite love, leading to a profound experience of God's love. However, Leo acknowledges that these results may vary between individuals due to personal differences in sensitivity and response to psychedelics.
</li><li><b>Legal considerations and recommendations</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of knowing the legal aspects of the substance usage. He recommends being well-informed about the potential legal risks in individual countries and advises considering travel to a country where it's legal, instead of risking legal penalties. 
</li><li><b>Benefits of 5-MeO-MALT</b>: Despite potential risks, Leo strongly recommends trying 5-MeO-MALT due to its profound, transformative effects on human consciousness. He notes it offers deep introspection into the mechanisms of how the mind constructs reality.
</li><li><b>Comparison of different psychedelics</b>: Leo advises against viewing one psychedelic as the ultimate one. He proposes that different psychedelics, like different tools in a toolbox, offer diverse ways of accessing the same truths. Accordingly, lack of access to a certain substance should not be disheartening, as others may still yield remarkable experiences. 
</li><li><b>Understanding of non-duality through psychedelics</b>: 5-MeO-MALT and other such substances can provide deep insights into spirituality, oneness, love, infinity, consciousness, and non-duality. Exploring these truths from different angles with varied substances leads to deeper integration and comprehension. 
</li><li><b>Importance of baseline work</b>: Leo highlights the necessity of laying down a psychological foundation through gradual doses and inner work before attempting to gain radical insights from substances like 5-MeO-MALT. Due to its intensity, unprepared users may encounter distressing experiences or "bad trips". 
</li><li><b>Personal experiences with 5-MeO-MALT</b>: Despite reports on potential adverse effects, Leo shares that he has never had a bad trip on 5-MeO-MALT after approximately ten uses. He describes the substance as benevolent, non-distorting, and rather safe. However, he acknowledges that experiences can vastly differ for other users.
</li><li><b>Purity and Types of 5-MeO-MALT</b>: Judging the purity of the substance by its color, closer to white or slightly off-white is deemed more trustworthy. Darker color substances might indicate impurities. There are different versions of the substance, such as the HCL salt and freebase version, both can be consumed, and freebase is more potent than the salt version.
</li><li><b>Collection of User Experiences</b>: Encourages users to post their trip reports for scientific research purposes in the future. Observing that the substance can have therapeutic potential similar to how MDMA is used for healing PTSD, depression, and anxiety due to the profound love and increased introspection experienced.
</li><li><b>Personal Responsibility and Risk Awareness</b>: Emphasizes caution and personal responsibility when using this substance. Asserts that, in his personal experience, it is not toxic or damaging but advises that individuals must figure out how it will affect them.
</li><li><b>Critique of Mainstream Spirituality and Emphasis on Psychedelics</b>: Discontent with mainstream teaching of concepts such as non-duality, god, love, awakening, and enlightenment. Claims that, based on own experience, psychedelics are the most direct and powerful way of gaining deep existential insights.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics and Spiritual Understanding</b>: Discusses psychological limitations of understanding deep teachings without psychedelic use, excluding a small percentage of spiritually gifted individuals. Discourages misconception that traditional practices like meditation and self-inquiry alone can lead to profound understanding.
</li><li><b>Use of Psychedelics as a Teaching Tool</b>: Plans to use psychedelics as a teaching tool, citing them as the most direct way to access insights about reality. Criticizes the idea that traditional practices alone can provide a profound understanding. Argues that psychedelics can provide direct understanding of God within a short time. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Other Spiritual Practices</b>: Acknowledges the importance of other spiritual practices like meditation, yoga, and self-inquiry. Asserts they provide enlightenment but not the deepest understanding of God. Claims psychedelics can provide this understanding for those who have not yet reached that understanding.
</li><li><b>Consideration of Psychedelic Usage</b>: Discusses the need for continued exploration with psychedelics, despite potential criticisms. Maintains stance on psychedelic awakening and encourages others to follow their own path if they disagree.
</li><li><b>Role of Psychedelics in Awakening the Majority</b>: Believes the responsible exploration of psychedelics can awaken more people and transform mankind. Emphasizes respecting these substances and the importance of not attaching a bad reputation to them which can impact the entire field of psychedelics.
</li><li><b>Collective Responsibility in Psychedelic Usage</b>: Highlights collective responsibility when using psychedelics not to jeopardize potential therapeutic benefits these substances can offer to others. Taking both personal and collective responsibility is seen as crucial in advancing humanity and awakening the world.
</li><li><b>Importance of Supplemental Spiritual Practices</b>: Despite advocating for the use of psychedelics, Leo Gura still recommends maintaining other spiritual practices like meditation, yoga, and self-inquiry. He asserts that these practices on their own are insufficient for understanding reality at its deepest levels, but can be beneficial in boosting consciousness to a certain degree.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics as Aid for Understanding</b>: Gura argues that the human baseline state of consciousness is inadequate for comprehending the construction of reality using 'Gods mind.' He believes psychedelics are an invaluable tool for amplifying one's consciousness and facilitating a deeper, more holistic understanding of God, love, and existence.
</li><li><b>Advocacy for Psychedelic Exploration</b>: Leo stresses that he no longer needs psychedelics but argues they are the most efficacious tool for those who are still seeking deeper understanding. Gura emphasizes the need for honesty and realism about the likelihood of not reaching profound understanding through meditation alone.
</li><li><b>Legal Exploration of Psychedelics</b>: Gura mentions options for legal exploration of psychedelics, such as traveling to other countries or finding non-illegal substances. He also highlights that these endeavors require time, money, and effort, just like other spiritual practices. But he believes the breakthroughs and deep understanding gained from psychedelic experiences are worth the efforts.
</li><li><b>Condemnation of Dabbling in Psychedelics</b>: Gura warns against casual exploration of psychedelics, stating that individuals need to keep delving deeper to fully understand the experience and the depth of the proverbial rabbit hole.
</li><li><b>Defending the Use of Psychedelics in Awakening</b>: Rejecting criticism over his support of psychedelic awakening, Gura firmly maintains his stance that psychedelics are an efficient route to awakening. He advises those who disagree with his approach to go their own way. Leo believes that a majority of mankind will not be awakened through traditional methods like meditation retreats and self-inquiry, and that responsible psychedelic exploration holds more promise.
</li><li><b>Future Potential of Psychedelics</b>: Gura posits that the future for psychedelics is promising, predicting discovery of even more powerful substances that could help people overcome physical and psychological ailments, spiritual struggles, ego issues, and more. However, he cautions that the advancement and acceptance depend on the responsible usage and behavior of the individual users.
</li><li><b>Call for Respect for Psychedelics</b>: Leo urges respect for the psychedelic work and substances, calling out behaviors that could tarnish the reputation of such substances. Theres insistence on meaningful, respectful use of psychedelics, not just for personal responsibility but also considering the reputation of psychedelics and their potential impact on society at large. Leo emphasizes the collective responsibility as misuse could limit access for others who might potentially benefit from the substances. He concludes by underscoring that psychedelics are a tool for moving forward and aiding in global awakening.
