[Music] you one of the mind-boggling consequences of non-duality and
becoming very conscious is that all criticism becomes untenable all
criticism is delusion and here I want to explore why
that is the case this is in fact the case
and it's one of those consequences of non-duality that most
people don't understand when they just hear about non-duality being
spoken of by a cart Ola or somebody else like
that this is one of those additional wrinkles that you
discover as you go deeper down the rabbit hole see
criticism is one of the mines greatest traps the mind
uses criticism as a red herring to distract from turning
inwards and self-reflection criticism is very convenient at orienting the
mind outwardly externalizing whatever problems exist on the inside to
the outside and getting the mind to deny responsibility and
looking at the world holistically see because to to do
an effective criticism you have to trick your own self
into believing that the thing you're criticizing is separate from
yourself and distinct from you and therefore you are then
justified to criticize it because it's not you but the
only way you can do that is by not being
conscious of the fact that everything is one so what
criticism does is actually criticism actively prevents people from noticing
that everything is one because if you notice that everything
is one and you're conscious of that 24/7 what are
you gonna criticize yourself you would constantly be walking around
criticizing yourself and of course that's a giant waste of
time and also you would notice very quickly just how
unsatisfying that is as an attitude towards life it's a
very ungrateful and unhappy way to be I mean how
happy are you criticizing people all the time or criticizing
yourself all the time that's the very definition of neuroses
so that's the trap but to really wrap your mind
around this to really understand this at a deep level
well that takes some work that takes some contemplation of
this topic see criticism requires judgment and I've talked about
judgment in the past and how problematic judgment is I
have an episode called how to stop judging where I
talk about this I also have a few episodes about
morality and the problems with moralization and should statements where
we also touched upon this topic but I really specifically
want to talk about criticism because see the mind loves
to be slippery here and to not connect all the
dots so the mind might say oh yeah well criticism
is one thing and judgment is another thing and moralization
is a third thing and that all these are different
things in fact they're all very closely connected but see
the problem with criticism is the same problem you have
with judgment and with moralization it's that judgment is a
rejection of reality it assumes that people or situations have
an alternative choice that they could have come out otherwise
and in fact they don't they couldn't reality as it
presently is before you in the present moment could not
be otherwise this is a key thing you got to
become conscious of and the mind doesn't want to become
conscious of this because the mind is very imaginative and
so it can go inside it get start to imagine
all sorts of alternative scenarios like well that person could
have been nicer and this situation could have been better
and that that thing there could have turned out put
more positively like that but the fact is that what
we have right now in the present moment is what
we've got and if you're a believer in science then
you know that science tells you that everything happens according
to physical laws and all of it has been stemming
from the very origin of the Big Bang from the
very beginning of time from 14 billion years ago all
of that has been like one concert one symphony one
one giant movement of the universe moving up to this
present point right now every single word that I'm speaking
started there so in a sense it's all caused from
there and here we are and it cannot be otherwise
and for you to wish that it could be something
else well is that something that your own mind is
projecting perhaps upon reality maybe you were wishing that I
would say a different word here or there or do
something this way or that way or maybe not me
but somebody else but these are games that your mind
is playing with you because you're caught and lost in
your imagination as you become more conscious you become more
aware that oh yeah this is all just the doing
of my imagination and it's a really unsatisfying way to
live but see the mind hates to accept this because
this requires extreme maturity and consciousness because then you have
to accept all the evil of the world and that's
of course something your mind hates to accept because your
minds entire job is to help you to manipulate the
world to get all of your personal needs met all
your survival and thriving needs and the best way to
do that is to get you to to point your
finger at all this other evil stuff out there and
the thing that you call evil is really just that
which gets in the way of your agenda take a
look that's really what you mean by evil when you
say the word evil of course most people don't know
that so of course criticism is a really tricky habit
to break and in fact it's more just a habit
it's an addiction especially in Western culture as a society
we have developed this addiction to criticism you see it
all over the news you see it in politics you
see it on YouTube you see it wherever you look
everyone's criticizing everybody else everyone's pointing fingers because it's so
easy to point fingers it's much harder to turn inwards
self-reflect and take ownership of all the stuff you don't
like about life and to stop complaining and moaning but
see most people they don't want that they don't want
to take responsibility they don't want to turn inwards and
self reflect they are working hard at a dead-end nine-to-five
job which is mind-numbing and grueling so when they get
home after eight hours of work another two hours of
commute you know that's ten hours of the day they
get home they're dead tired they want to just crash
on the couch turn on the TV look at some
news look at the latest politics and it criticize away
along with all the commentators there who have made careers
multi-million dollar careers out of criticizing that's basically with you
get paid for is just constant criticism and then and
so this this person who's sitting on the couch tunes
in what that resonates with that and then gets a
little bit of Glee a little bit of pleasure guilty
sort of low consciousness pleasure from from criticizing whoever is
the easiest person to criticize at that time in the
news that's how this little game works it's a real
addiction just like junk food is an addiction Internet is
an addiction whatever else is an addiction so is this
except this is one of those subtle addictions which is
much harder to break because when you're in a group
of people who are always constantly criticizing then you get
caught up in that mentality and you don't know any
other way to live or any other way to interact
with the world but you're missing out on a lot
so here's some examples of where criticism is untenable or
how it is untenable rather and of course here you
might immediately objected you might say but Leo who are
you to say that criticism is untenable because after all
you're criticizing people all the time throughout your episodes I've
heard you criticize Trump I've heard you criticize certain teachers
certain Nando traditions certain people the way they understand things
certain pickup artists certain this or than that you're criticizing
people all the time so aren't you being a hypocrite
well of course as I become more conscious I become
more and more conscious of the limiting ways in which
I habitually emote speak act and think and so one
thing you should be seeing within me if I'm actually
truly growing is a change in attitude about a great
many things and this is one of those things so
yes it's true for example that I like to criticize
Trump I have in the past and I still have
a sense continue to do so today but the important
thing is is that you have to understand that criticism
can come from two different places the first place is
the conventional place this is the place of just criticizing
unconsciously just criticizing because you honestly believe that some person
is a fool or is evil or something like that
and the second place is the more conscious way to
criticize which is you criticize but at the same time
you understand that your own very criticism defeats itself that
your own very criticism is untenable which is what I'm
advocating for in this episode so for example with Trump
he's very easy to criticize everybody loves to criticize him
how could you not he does look like a fool
he says foolish things he lies almost constantly he has
ridiculous positions he's very unconscious and I'm not saying that
as a criticism of him I'm saying that it's just
tough act that's just how he is regardless of whether
you like it or hate it but it's so easy
to criticize on that forgetting that Trump is the way
he is because he can't be otherwise literally he can't
that's who he is that's who he must be given
his genetics his education his upbringing his life experience all
the people he surrounds himself with and all of that
that's what that creates he is a product of our
very culture of our materialistic stage orange culture so that's
what you get when you take American culture and you
sort of take it to its pinnacle and you exaggerate
it to the extreme you get something like Trump but
of course most people don't like to really think about
the depth of that they just like to criticize Trump
for being Trump and of course I do too and
it's kind of a guilty pleasure but also I understand
at a deeper level why he has to be the
way he is and I can't really blame him for
being the way he is because he's just a product
of our culture a product of our time and of
course you might say all about leo but I mean
doesn't he have a choice it sounds like you're being
very defeatist tanned fatalistic here saying that all he can't
be otherwise I mean after all tomorrow can he decide
to like stop tweeting or to not tweet the sort
of racist thing he was going to tweet and in
one sense he can but in another sense he can't
see because for him to stop doing that kind of
low conscious stuff that he does he would have to
actually experience a shift in consciousness he'd have to become
more aware he'd have to become much more self reflective
and the whole tragedy of it is that when you
have a deeply unconscious person he's incapable of self reflection
it's painful the ego doesn't want to admit its own
faults and mistakes and and look inwards Lee and it
doesn't want to be honest with itself and honest with
other people it doesn't want that it wants to defend
itself and to push through his agenda which is what
you see within Trump and of course as you become
more aware of your own ego doing that within you
you start to then empathize with you that same mechanism
working within someone like Trump so on the one hand
I can criticize him on the other hand I can
also see why he must be the way he is
and I can also see tendencies within him for example
that exist within me that exist within humanity at large
but uh but most people when they criticize them they
don't really see that they don't see those lessons they're
just criticizing him out of a sort of guilty pleasure
by externalizing all their problems and that just becomes more
of the same stuff so all your criticisms of Trump
are ultimately untenable whatever they are even if you think
Trump will lead us into nuclear apocalypse which maybe he
will and that's a very legitimate criticism is that he's
actually perhaps one of the greatest dangers to America itself
is him but also you have to understand that that's
still an untenable criticism because yeah of course of course
every single system which is a complicated system its greatest
threat is itself from the inside not from the outside
it's not terrorists who are the greatest threat to America
it's America that's the greatest threat to America it's American
culture that will ultimately be the undoing of America if
America gets undone but of course who wants to really
think about those deep truths people don't like that people
like to think about simplistic truths and they like to
think that oh well Trump could be different if he
just wise up a little bit if if he listened
to his advisors a little bit more if he did
this and he did that and then everything would go
nicely yeah if if if and if my aunt had
a dick she would be my uncle but she doesn't
this is true not just a trump this is true
of everything that you might criticize all the low consciousness
stuff within society all this stuff that pisses you off
all the evil stuff you name it corporate greed people
getting addicted to things people scamming each other people doing
violence to each other all these mass shootings that we
have terrorism all this sort of stuff you like to
criticize this stuff we do as a culture but while
we're criticizing we're not really thinking about how we ourselves
are part of the very same problem that is contributing
to the - this cycle see for example like corporate
greed you might like to rail against corporate greed and
sometimes I get in that kind of mood you like
to rail against corporations like maybe pharmaceutical companies many of
these pharmaceutical companies they're earning billions and billions of dollars
feeding the medical industry with false information false studies that
they're skewing and paying for so that their drugs can
be justified to have a legitimate use and then those
are are sold by doctors and hundreds of people thousands
of people get killed every year from this get injured
get diseases don't get cures that they otherwise could have
get gotten cures for you know children have problems and
all this because of this stuff and you might say
well this is a very evil system and let me
go out there and criticize these evil corporations for being
so greedy and doing all this yes but that's such
a superficial level of understanding of what's really going on
and it's separating you from this entire cycle see what
people don't understand though is that they're part of this
whole cycle because you're part of this whole industry you
contribute to it you might think oh well I'm just
one of the ordinary citizens who are getting screwed over
by these greedy corporations but is that really true have
you ever worked for one of these big greedy corporations
many of you probably have and it doesn't necessarily mean
that you have to work for the pharmaceutical company itself
and be its CEO or its marketing guy you could
be the person who's just a secretary or the guy
who washes the floors the janitor and you're still contributing
to that entire cycle and even if you say oh
well I don't do that I work for some other
company I work for some web development company oh yeah
but your web development company exists to serve clients and
some of those clients are some of these big greedy
corporations like pharmaceutical companies you see so you're very paycheck
comes from this entire cycle and you might say well
Lea I don't even do that I'm completely unrelated -
any of that well do you have a 401k do
you invest in the stock market maybe the S&P 500
what is that where is your money going your money
is going to fund these greedy corporations and actually these
greedy corporations are precisely so greedy because they're working so
hard to try to give you a return on investment
on your 401 K money that's ultimately what they're doing
so they're screwing all these good citizens over to get
you a little bit extra five cents dividend per share
on your stock see so we're all part of this
system we're in this together and of course the whole
key to non-duality to becoming more conscious that you start
to see more and more how you're not isolated from
anything you develop this holistic understanding and you realize that
every piece of reality's interconnect with everything else so to
criticize one thing of course it's hypocrisy what do you
think is going on here when you're Curtis I mean
reality is one thing whatever you take your finger and
point it with - you're pointing at that thing with
the thing which is reality so you're using reality to
point at reality it's all one self-involved circle-jerk that's what
reality is it's a strange loop so for this very
reason all criticism becomes ultimately untenable criticism I mean terrorism
is another thing that people love to criticize but terrorism
this is this is this is such a hypocrisy to
criticize because the West loves to criticize terrorism as if
terrorism is some faraway third world radical Islamic problem and
people like sam harris for example love to criticize Islam
for those reasons but this is a deep not a
deep well rather it's it's a shallow it's a shallow
understanding of the problem it's an understanding of the problem
which takes you out of the equation very conveniently of
course but see the true causes of terrorism are not
some radical Islamic guy who sits in a cave somewhere
far far away it's actually the very policies and culture
of developed first world countries as these countries rise in
power and in status they then use their power and
their status to manipulate the entire world to manipulate geopolitics
to stage all sorts of fake Wars to do what
to make the business environment the global business environment favorable
to the giant corporations who are in charge of the
country and so as this is happening all around the
world there's a deep inequality that develops between the third
world countries and the first world countries and this gap
gets wider and wider and wider because the first world
countries use all the third world countries basically as wage
slaves to work for them and to do all their
dirty business and then we go and we try to
manipulate them to get the best of their resources we
destabilize governments all around the world the US has been
doing that for the last 60 years in South America
in Africa Middle East almost anywhere that they can of
course it makes sense because the u.s. is trying to
make the environment as favorable for self as possible that's
what egos do both individually and collectively so of course
the u.s. is doing that and of course what do
you get when you do enough of that when you
do a lot of that eventually you piss people off
you develop enemies because of the deep inequality that's being
created and then of course you get stuff like terrorism
now is that the only factor for terrorism know there's
many complicated factors but it's certainly one of the most
significant factors and it's one of the factors that actually
implicates ourselves and of course we don't want to hear
that what we want to do instead is we want
to point our fingers and just say oh well it's
just those backwards Islamic radicals and all their backwards cultures
and all those silly beliefs it's just that if they
just became more scientifically minded all this would be solved
so in other words they need to become exactly like
us so that we can get along with them because
the way that they are now doesn't fit our agenda
for our stage orange desire to go out there and
to make them the world a suitable host for our
McDonald's and KFC s and all the chains and all
the big businesses in big oil and Big Pharma and
all this other stuff but see nobody talks about this
because that's too much responsibility that's too painful that would
actually require that we have to self-reflect as a country
we'd have to re-evaluate our culture and our materialistic paradigm
we have to think about all this stuff we'd have
to actually show some compassion for other cultures for other
ways of life we'd have to actually show some compassion
for the backwardness of some cultures and have to actually
think about that and not just want to get in
there and exploit those backwards cultures which are perhaps not
as scientifically developed as us yet but maybe we'll be
in a couple hundred years but they're not there yet
but we're gonna exploit them to earn some money so
we have to really evaluate all that as a country
as a culture and of course who really wants to
do that that's painful that's boring that's long you don't
see anybody on TV none of the political pundits or
news anchors talking about this sort of stuff no it's
just like they hate us for our freedom and so
we need to fight them or otherwise you're gonna kill
us it's just you know overly simplified like that so
criticising terrorism well who are you really criticizing are you
seeing the interconnectedness of all these issues and how they
all directly relate to yourself and if you're criticizing politics
and the government like a lot of people like to
do well what's your role in that what's your responsibility
do you realize that the government is just made up
of citizens and that those citizens are you people like
you and the reasons the government functions so poorly is
because people like you are lazy and they just sit
on their couch and they just do nothing and they're
just whine and complain and criticize all the time but
they don't get involved they don't actually try to go
out there and bother to learn what the problems are
and what the possible solutions are do you see that
your to the very thing that you're criticizing in fact
your criticism is contributing to the problem because the more
you criticize the more other people around you start to
criticize the more everybody gets into this criticism circle-jerk and
then nothing productive gets done because criticism is not designed
to be productive it's designed to be anti productive that's
its point the point of criticism is to maintain yourself
the ego to maintain homeostasis both as an individual but
also collectively as a society while we're criticizing everybody else
guess what we're not doing we're not looking deeply in
words and fixing our own true problems and so nothing
really gets fixed how about science I like to criticize
science and sometimes I get criticism for being critical of
science and people say Oh Leo why you gotta criticize
science so much I mean isn't science good and aren't
you going overboard with your criticism of science but you
see when I criticize science I understand the deeper structures
of science I've studied the philosophy of science for a
very long time and actually when I criticized science I
do it from a position of love it's because I
love science and I want science to be pure and
non dogmatic and the thing I criticized science for is
all its dogmas and all its paradigms and in all
the ways in which it's being myopic because I understand
that science modern science goes all the way back to
the ancient Greeks and Romans 2,000 years perhaps even longer
where the materialist paradigm first came about the Greek atomists
Democritus he posited the idea of the Worlds made of
atoms and from there we sort of just ran with
it and that still continues to this day and I
understand how tricky my own mind is and therefore how
tricky everybody else's mind is and how tricky the minds
of the scientists are and I know from my own
experience how dogmatic they are because of how dogmatic I
get to be and all the fault traps that I
fall into and I've fallen into for many years in
my own life that I've had to work through say
so I can empathize with that and I know the
history of science and all the paradigm shifts that science
a struggle through for the last 2,000 years and all
the bickering back and forth and all the pseudoscience that
went on and all the struggles with that and I
know that modern science can't be other than what it
is you see it has to be the way that
it is and it'll continue to evolve and people will
continue to be bureaucratic and they'll continue to be dogmatic
and closed-minded because that's just the nature of science because
the nature of size is that it tries to be
rigorous that's part of its Pro and part of its
con sort of like an antivirus system you know a
very strong antivirus system on your computer is great until
you want to install some software and then it Flags
your good software as a virus and then it screws
up your whole system because of these like false positives
well science has the exact same problem it's precisely because
science tries to be so rigorous and so objective that
it excludes things like spirituality non-duality and paranormal stuff and
psychedelic stuff and a bunch of other stuff that's the
point of science the mistake is to then think that
all of science has the truth the science doesn't have
the truth science is this very little walled in garden
which has very very strict rules and boundaries for what
can get inside of it so a lot of good
stuff doesn't get inside of it not for hundreds of
years until those rules change and those rules will only
change with a lot of back-and-forth bickering and debating and
ultimately people dying those people who didn't believe in those
rules will have to ultimately prevail over those who did
and those who did have to ultimately die and new
generations of scientists have to be born that's how science
works it's a cultural bureaucratic process so anyways my point
is that hi I understand that I'm not just criticizing
science just to criticize sighs I understand that it's a
very it's a very deep thing and on the one
hand I criticize science but on their hand I also
understand that all my criticism of science is untenable because
science can't help being how it is so what am
I really criticizing and how about non-duality talk about the
mother of all useless debates how much debate and criticism
have we had within religious traditions mystical traditions and non
dual schools and teachers and teachings and students for the
last 2,000 years sometimes I think that if we took
every single person who argues and criticizes and debates about
non duality and we put them into giant hamster wheels
so that rather than spending all that energy criticizing they
will just run in this hamster wheel and we plug
that into the into the national power grid we would
be able to fuel the entire world just from the
energy which has exerted on debating non duality and the
deep irony there is as supposedly if you're truly becoming
more and more non dual and more conscious which is
what the Hun who allottee is about then you should
becoming more and more conscious that all your criticisms of
non dual teachings and teachers and schools is all a
giant waste of time and then it's a red herring
from being conscious and of course that's precisely why people
who pursue non-duality criticize so much precisely because it is
an obstacle and a distraction away from doing the actual
work that's not a bug that's a feature that's a
feature of most mainstream spirituality is that it distracts you
from actual spirituality see the devil is very clever he's
gonna use the very thing that's supposed to set you
free to enslave you and that's exactly how most people
approach spirituality but of course to be really non-dual is
to understand that non duality and duality are both the
same and not different at all and that you really
have no valid criticisms of anyone even if people are
believing in stupid things if even if they're believing and
untrue things you realize it can't be otherwise they have
to believe in those things given the state of our
culture the state of our society the development of people
at large and all the misinformation that's out there and
the trickery of the mind most people even if you
give them all the right information they're still gonna manage
to trick themselves just because that's the nature of the
mind and a truly non-dual person understands that doesn't get
upset by that but accepts that accepts reality as it
is now as he imagines it should be in some
ideal ik fantasy scenario so of course I could go
on and on with these examples but I think you
get the point and of course a lot of objections
come up at this point people could say things like
but Leo you know it sounds like what you're arguing
here for is just a relativism and like we should
just tolerate Nazis now according to your philosophy that old
criticism is untenable because if it's all untenable then there's
no reason to criticize the Nazis or murderers or anybody
else and of course that's not what I'm saying what
I'm saying is that you're still free to act however
you want to act what I'm just questioning is your
self-righteous self justifications so if the Nazis roll their tanks
into town and you don't agree with the Nazis you
can still have standards you could still disagree with them
you can still have preferences for what kind of lifestyle
you want within a society you want to live in
you can go fight those Nazis I'm not saying you
can't do any of that I'm saying that your criticisms
of it you're self-righteous criticisms that that's just untenable beliya
does that mean that everything is predestined now because it
sounds like you're saying that people don't have a choice
in the matter and things will just turn out the
way they're gonna turn out no what I'm saying is
at the present moment is exactly how it is and
it can't be changed what will happen in the future
well of course that's changeable we don't know what that's
gonna be so in that sense everything is not predestined
and it does matter what you think and what you
do that's precisely what's going to determine the future and
it's possible to change the future without criticism see which
leads to the next objection where people ask well leo
but isn't criticism leading to improvement aren't I actually doing
something good by sitting on my couch and criticizing those
terrorists or those Nazis or those politicians or whatever and
what I would say as a counterpoint to that is
that actually what leads to improvement is not criticism but
self-reflection and that here is a very counterintuitive move that
you have to make which is that you have to
avoid the trap of thinking that your criticism is actually
beneficial to the world in some cases it might seem
like it is but in most cases actually it probably
has the exact opposite effect of what you think a
good example this is sam harris sam harris loves to
criticize Islam for some of its radical and superstitious elements
and he loves to criticize religion in general distinguishing it
from science and from rationality but of course as we
understand all these distinctions will eventually collapse they're all untenable
and what you see practically with him is that you
know he argues a lot back and forth with people
but um but but his criticism ultimately has come to
this point where it's supposed to be coming from a
place of like yeah I want to criticize religion so
that it improves itself but is it really improving itself
or is it actually having the exact opposite effect I
mean sam Harris gets so many death threats he can't
even tell people which city he lives in anymore because
he's afraid for his own life and for his own
family and I can I can sympathize with that I
can understand that but when he gets to that point
you have to also under like well maybe there's a
better way to interact with the people or the ideologies
that you disagree with then this kind of sharp biting
criticism because well is it having the kind of effect
that you want it to have what I would suggest
is that if we really want to improve the world
it's not gonna come from more people sitting on their
ass criticizing other people it's gonna come from people taking
radical ownership of their own lives and really self reflecting
and then helping other people to self reflect and then
ultimately that will lead to to more improvement then you
will get by criticizing people here and there now of
course you will object and say here well Leah aren't
you now criticizing Sam Harris so you just said yourself
that all criticism untenable and now here you are criticizing
Sam Harris so you yourself are guilty of the very
thing the very hypocrisy that you're speaking out against yes
of course that's the larger point that's the thing that
the finger is pointing to the finger is pointing to
the moon what I'm trying to point you towards is
that there's a possibility to sort of rise above the
fray to not get caught up in the mudslinging contests
that we see where people criticize each other and then
another set of people criticize those people who criticize the
other people and there's another layer of people who criticize
those people for criticizing those people for criticizing some other
people and so everybody's criticizing everybody else you see this
doesn't work out too well so when you become conscious
that your mind says oh how do I exit the
entire thing is that possible can I just get out
of this entire game I don't want to be involved
involved in this mudslinging contest at all and what would
that look like that would look like recognizing that all
criticism is untenable and just dropping it it even means
that you have to recognize that your own criticism of
all the criticism is also itself untenable of course and
if you think that leads to a paradox in a
contradiction of course it does of course because reality is
non-dual it's a strange loop and therefore it must be
contradictory at the very rock bottom so you might say
well leo so that means then that you're saying it
is okay to criticize other people because at first it
sounded like you were saying it's not okay to criticize
other people that's low consciousness and now you're saying that
that itself that criticism is also untenable therefore now you're
saying it is okay to criticize other people so which
is it am I allowed to criticize people of course
you are you can criticize people of course that's the
paradox of it that's the freedom of reality that's what
you're noticing here reality is infinitely free it gives you
all these degrees of freedom to do whatever you want
and the question is what are you going to do
with it yes I have to contradict myself because the
paradox of criticism is that all criticism is untenable and
also all criticism is tenable so I'm not here saying
that now you need to go out there and become
a critic of the critics that's just more criticism it's
the same problem is trying to stop violence by being
more violent you're not going to stop violence by out
violence in everybody else who's violent that doesn't work in
the same thing with criticism when you actually understand this
paradox that all criticism is both untenable but also tenable
what tends to happen is a profound silencing of the
mind it's like this Zen moment that you have you
understand the game and what it's about and when you
see the game from a sort of meta perspective then
you stand above it and that makes a lot of
difference so while it might sound like I'm just being
a postmodernist here and saying well it's criticism is bad
on the one hand but it's good on the other
hand it's untenable on the one hand it's tenable on
the other hand it seems like I'm just mentally masturbating
back and forth and that none of this has any
practical use ah it does have a very big practical
use because there's a big difference between people who understand
what I'm talking about here and those who don't let's
call the first person person a who doesn't understand and
the second person person B who does understand person a
is what I would call righteously critical he's critical and
he actually believes in his criticism and he's actually disturbed
by the thing which he is railing against so if
he's railing his Trump he's actually disturbed by Trump if
he's railing as terrorism he's actually disturbed by terrorism person
a person B is more conscious than that he sees
the game he's at the metal level he's above it
a little bit so can he still be critical yes
but when he's critical he's pragmatically critical which means he
uses criticism as a strategic tool when necessary in moderation
he doesn't use that as an escape for his ego
and very importantly he's not disturbed by the thing he's
criticizing so he might criticize Trump but also he sees
that the the devil's advocate opposite perspective of why Trump
must be Trump and can't be any other way and
he's not too disturbed by Trump and he sees terrorists
and he might be critical of terrorists as well because
he doesn't like violence for example but he also understands
that those terrorists don't really have an option given their
background where they grew up the culture they were in
the poverty they were in the kind of conditions they
were in and the kind of injustice is that were
done to them of course they must turn out to
be exactly the way that they are he understands that
at a deep level so he's not disturbed by it
the way that person a is so now there's a
list of differences between person a and person B person
a and this I'm the reason I'm outlining it like
this is because people often will rebut me and try
to say oh alia but all this stuff is just
kind of wishy-washy mental masturbation with no practical real-world consequences
no this has huge real-world cons winces and here I'm
trying to draw those out for you so person a
practically will be much more critical overall just in terms
of volume if you measure the volume of person eight
criticism versus person B's criticism person A's will be a
hundred times larger which makes a big deal person a
also takes his criticism very seriously much more so than
person B because of this he suffers more he's more
angry and he's never at peace he lashes out more
he's much more likely to do evil person a is
because when you really believe in your own criticism then
you have much more justification to yell name call view
other people as being subhuman you're much more likely to
threaten violence to actually commit violence to commit murder to
do all the sorts of nasty stuff that we generally
don't like much more likely to do that stuff then
person B cuz person B is above it he doesn't
take it so seriously person a also lacks compassion and
the deeper understanding that I've been talking about person a
doesn't see the non-duality person a doesn't see how everything
interconnects in reality he doesn't see the sort of the
holistic big picture and of course he doesn't have compassion
because he's put up a barrier between himself and the
thing he's criticizing so he can't really have compassion for
that other person because he can't step into the other
person's shoes a person who is truly critical of terrorists
or of Donald Trump or anybody else he literally cannot
put himself into that person's shoes and experiencing actually himself
being Donald Trump or being a terrorist because there's this
division that was created of course this division is completely
phony in fact if you took that person who hates
terrorists and you put him in the exact same situations
as a terrorist was in from birth he himself would
become a terrorist and if you took that person who's
very critical of Trump and you put him into the
exact same situation and shoes that Trump was in his
entire life he would be precisely Trump person a is
also unproductive he wastes a lot of time complaining with
all his criticism rather than self reflecting person a also
can't appreciate the full rich diversity of reality because the
whole point of criticism is to deny diversity see reality
is so infinitely diverse that it actually threatens your very
sense of survival and existence because infinite diversity comes at
the cost of things having to constantly be coming in
and out of existence constantly but the ego hates that
so the ego wants to lock a reality down confine
it to a little fixed position or a little box
and that's why the ego is so critical is because
it doesn't want change but reality is always changing it's
always flowing it's always flexible person a took a position
against that whereas person B is actually aligning himself with
that aspect of reality he's flowing with it he's appreciating
the full diversity of everything even when that diversity threatens
himself when it threatens his ego he says well screw
my ego then I much more prefer to be conscious
of the full diversity even if it threatens my very
life whereas person a does the exact opposite of that
and ultimately person a ends up being ungrateful and disconnected
from the beauty of life disappointed by life whereas person
B is able to see the beauty in everything he's
connected to everything even all the evil stuff that he
doesn't like he still sees the beauty in it so
for him it's a win-win whereas for person a reality's
a lose-lose because there's always something new to criticize the
ego never gets to a point where it's completely satisfied
with everything now you might still say but Leo so
am I now never allowed to criticize is that you're
advocating sounds like it and the answer is no the
problem is not so much in the criticism it's in
how conscious are you when you're actually criticizing and are
you seeing the bigger point here which is that when
you're criticizing how good do you actually feel is that
actually how you want to live your life that's the
bigger point the bigger point is that you can rise
above this mudslinging contest you know there's a the old
funny adage that says that when you get dirty with
a pig down in the mud watch out because both
of you will get dirty and the pig is gonna
enjoy it so for you it's a lose-lose when you
wrestle with a pig in the mud so you have
to realize that getting involved with a pig wrestling contest
that is up that is a situation you want to
steer clear from you want to stay away as far
from that as you can rather than getting involved in
that and it's very hard because of course the pig
will throw them out at you and when the pig
gets you with a little bit of mud you're gonna
want to throw some mud back at him but you
have to question yourself do I actually feel good throwing
mud is that how I want to actually live do
I want to become a pig myself do I want
to go that low or do I want to rise
above that it has a counterintuitive move to rise above
that when you got some mud in your face from
somebody flinging it at you but Leo isn't some criticism
legitimate you see the ego pulls this very sneaky move
it likes to create this artificial distinction between legitimate and
illegitimate criticism and like I said surely yeah some criticism
is illegitimate you're right but some criticism is just too
important some is really legitimate like it's really important to
talk about Islam it's really important to talk about the
postmodernist like Jordan Peterson likes to rant against the postmodernists
as though they're gonna bring the whole world to its
knees and you know what maybe they will I don't
know but nevertheless its criticism and you gotta wonder is
building a career around being a critic of the world
or some group the best way to live your life
is that really how you want to do it and
then look there are many people in the in the
world who have built multi-million dollar careers from constant credit
that's all they do it's just constant criticism these are
the news anchors the TV political pundits the conservative radio
show hosts and and folks like that in certain academics
do this and certain intellectuals and authors and writers and
speakers do this and it's it's kind of sad because
on the one hand I can see how yeah they're
contributing to reality and they have to do that and
in a sense I can't fault them for it someone
has to play that role if Jordan Peterson's not gonna
play it someone's gonna play it that's the diversity of
reality so I can't really fault him for it on
the other hand there's a higher level and the surest
way to keep yourself from reaching the higher level is
by letting your ego play this little trick on you
ah but our our criticism is very important and it's
very legitimate if we don't criticize the whole world is
gonna collapse that's that little trick the mind is very
tricky see this whole notion of legitimate versus illegitimate this
is just a tool of the ego the ego creates
these labels which it then attaches to things which then
make it feel like oh it's really got a strong
good position that it can't let go of what I
would suggest to you is just let it go anyways
even if you think the whole world's gonna collapse just
let it go if the functioning of the whole world
hinges on you being a a virulent critic then the
whole world's not worth very much you gotta think you
got to think that there's something deeper driving the world
than your criticism that's not what's gonna make humanity pull
through is your criticism that's not gonna do it in
fact if anything that's gonna contribute to the very thing
you're trying to prevent because that's precisely how low consciousness
tends to work he tends to backfire the very thing
you're trying to prevent is the thing you're actually gonna
cause it turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy in a sort
of very ironic and poetically delicious way but Leo aren't
you yourself a critic here aren't you highly critical of
people or at least you have been in all your
prior episodes so what hypocrisy from you hearing you deliver
this message I recognise that I've been highly critical of
certain people and ideas and traditions and schools and things
in the past and I probably will be to some
extent in the future but also what you should see
in me if I'm truly growing is you should see
my attitudes in my positions about things change and one
of the things I've been recently made aware of through
just states of higher consciousness mystical experience and so forth
is that that way of speaking and thinking and acting
is just not gonna cut it to get to where
I ultimately want to go see what I realize is
that there's a glass ceiling if I want to maintain
my prior attitudes if I want to be a critic
the way I've I've tended to be then there's only
so high I can go in my consciousness and so
I have to choose do I want to go to
the ultimate levels of consciousness then I have to give
up all this criticising or I could keep it criticising
but then I'm gonna cap my as far as I
can go and for me I would rather go to
the very top than to maintain my critical attitudes so
what you're gonna see over the next couple of years
is you're gonna see a sort of softening in my
stance you're gonna see me sort of rising above the
the mudslinging contest and not participating in it because actually
what I realized is that I'm not happy or fulfilled
when I'm involved with this mudslinging contest I would much
rather spend that time just being conscious of being here's
a nice little metaphor I have for you imagine the
pack of hyenas like you've seen on the Discovery Channel
out on the African savannah and they've just found some
corpse of a dead animal and they're chewing and gnawing
this thing to bits and pieces and it's a big
pack of hyenas and there's a bunch of them and
they're all fighting with each other trying to get the
best parts ripping pieces of meat off the bone and
then ripping it out of each other's mouths and clawing
at each other and fighting for for status who's gonna
be the top hyena so that's one scenario and now
imagine the other scenario of a manta ray this giant
blue majestic manta ray gently flapping its wings and gliding
through the Pacific Ocean deep in the waters very cool
and nonchalant cool as a cucumber so here's the question
for you which do you want to be for the
rest of your life do you want to be a
hyena or do you want to be a manta ray
the choice is yours the hyenas they're the critics this
is all the people you see on TV in the
books and the magazines in the news on YouTube these
people who criticize other people who criticize other people for
criticizing other people and criticize other people for criticizing other
people for criticizing other people it doesn't stop the hyenas
nature is that it criticizes no matter what it'll find
a way to criticize anything the manta ray he's above
all that he doesn't care the manta ray has gone
meta I don't know about you but recently I've had
a shift where I've decided that I don't want to
be a hyena anymore I want to be a manta
ray that's how I want to live and so for
that to happen some changes will be happening and if
you want to be a manta ray I'll show you
how to do that in a minute but before we
get there one quick other point that I want to
make about this metaphor is that notice that the manta
ray doesn't demonize the hyenas the manta ray doesn't think
the hyenas are bad the manta ray doesn't go around
criticizing the hyenas behind their back the manta ray is
cool as a cucumber no matter what he doesn't care
what the hyenas do he keeps being a manta ray
that's what it means to be a manta ray the
hyenas are all in it together and they're all doing
and copying each other the manta ray is off on
his own so what this means for our topic is
that if you want to be a manta ray that
means you have to give up criticizing hyenas you can't
be a manta ray while criticizing hyenas that makes you
a hyena not a manta ray make sure you don't
forget that that's a tricky little thing so if you
want to become a manta ray how to do it
well I'll give you six questions for helping you to
reframe all criticism so whatever you get into a situation
where you are starting to act like a hyena and
you're noticing it here are some questions you can ask
yourself to flip it around number one how is this
situation a red herring number two what am i failing
to accept here about reality number three is this productive
he is my being a hyena productive number four how
can I be more constructive with my energy in time
number five is this making me feel happy being a
hyena and number six what positive lesson can I learn
from this thing which I am tempted to criticize so
for example if you are tempted to criticize Trump or
a terrorist or a Nazi or some hyena or somebody
else you ask yourself what can I learn from those
hyenas see that's what the Mantaray does he doesn't criticize
them he learns from them he says ah those hyenas
I might not like particularly what they're doing but I'll
learn a positive lesson from that rather than just sit
on my ass and criticize them so those are some
handy questions and lastly what I suggest to really make
this embodied and actualized in your life is that you
take on my 30 day no criticism challenge which I
will be doing myself starting today and the way you
do that is you take a rubber band or a
wrist band like this you put it around your wrist
and you make a commitment to not be critical of
anyone over the next thirty days and to be mindful
of that and anytime that you catch yourself because you
will catch yourself if you have this wristband it'll help
you to catch yourself just getting into the mode of
being a hyena and then you recognize oh wait a
minute I want to be a manta ray not a
hyena and maybe you ask some of these questions of
yourself like is being a hyena actually gonna make me
happy is it gonna be productive is it gonna be
all red herring from turning inwards and doing consciousness work
and then you drop it you drop your criticism and
you keep that up for 30 days straight keep this
wristband on your wrist the whole time don't take it
off every time your eye catches it you remind yourself
what this whole challenge is about you remind yourself of
this image of the hyena versus the manta ray and
you just ask yourself which one do I want to
be and then you visualize yourself being a manta ray
and you visualize yourself for the rest of your life
living that way versus living as a hyena and then
you use that to inspire you and you pay attention
to how you start to feel and how much better
you start to feel over these 30 days and that's
it so you will see me wearing this wristband for
a while now for about a month and maybe I'll
give you an update in the future about how that
goes for me so I'm doing it I encourage you
to do as well just as one final warning the
one trap you have to avoid here is that you
want to make sure you don't turn everything I'm saying
here as a weapon against other people so if you
see other people criticizing other people for example maybe you're
on the forum and you sue too you see two
people in an argument with each other criticizing each other
back and forth over some issue and then you're really
tempted to jump in there say all guys but Leo
said no more criticizing stop criticizing you're being bad for
criticizing and notice what just happened you turned into a
hyena you got tricked by the situation so be very
careful about that turn inwards always turn inwards don't use
any of these ideas against other people use it against
your own ego and that's the end here all right
please make sure you click that like button for me
come check out actualized org take a look at my
blog I'm posting a lot of new stuff there check
out the forum we have lively discussions there also the
forum will really test your hyena or manta ray nature
check out my life purpose course check out the book
list a lot of important books for you so our
meeting there and lastly just stick with me for more
content in the future I will be returning to more
practical topics it might sound like lately I've been going
very abstract and deep and metaphysical and that that's gonna
be the future of actualized org no that's not the
case there will still be very many practical topics I
want to shoot practical topics about how to shop for
healthy food how to do all sorts of stuff like
this which is just very practical but what you're gonna
see is that actually when I returned to these more
practical topics all the abstract and metaphysical stuff that I
talked about previously you'll see how it's actually deepened my
ability to understand and to talk about the practical stuff
and that's the connection that I want you to be
making the practical and the theoretical or the abstract these
are not separate things these all inform each other and
to really have a profound understanding of the practical topics
it helps to have the existential stuff really nailed and
understood because when you're doing practical stuff but you don't
have the existential stuff nailed all the practical stuff is
mostly gonna be a waste of your time you're gonna
be running around doing a bunch of stuff you're gonna
be busy but your busyness is not gonna be grounded
anything truthful you want to ground your practicality in truth
in the actually most important things in life the higher
consciousness stuff which is why I love to sort of
oscillate back and forth covering topics between the existential and
metaphysical versus the practical and we'll be doing more of
that in the future and you will see that when
I talk about practical stuff in the future I will
get to like the really core the essence of it
my ability to talk about the practical stuff will have
skyrocketed I can feel that in me it's just I
haven't really been actualizing it in terms of talking about
on episodes but over the last year I've been doing
so much existential work on myself but also I can
see that man there's so much practical stuff that all
of this will ultimately fuel so what I'm really doing
is I'm investing into the existential to build my foundation
so that when I talk about practical stuff in the
future is gonna be like both practical but also like
deeply deeply significant you want to have both and that's
what you're gonna see for me going forward so make
sure you stick around for that you
