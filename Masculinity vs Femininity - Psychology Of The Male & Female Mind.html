Hey, this is Leo, for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm really excited to be talking about masculinity versus femininity.
Because I want to help to get you a really
deep understanding of the psychology of the male and female
mind. Imagine the following situation. You buy yourself a new
cat, and you bring this cat hole. You bring it
home and you're excited to do all the cat stuff
that you know cats love to do. So what's the
first thing you do? Well, you say, okay, boy, come
here. I want you to rollover, rollover. And the cat
sits there. Looks like you're kind of funny, doesn't move.
And you kind of scratch your head. You're wondering what's
wrong with this cat? Why isn't it rolling over? But
you shrug it off? And you say, Okay, fine. All
right, boy, let's go, let's go to the park. I'm
gonna go take you for a walk to the park.
So you grab the leash, hook it up, and walk
your cat out the door. He's resisting a little bit,
but you kind of pull him anyways. And you're walking
to the park and you're walking through the park. And
as you're walking through, people are looking at you a
little bit funny. But you don't really mind. So you
just walk in and you got your bag of stuff
and you got your cat and you're just enjoying the
beautiful day. And then you get out onto the grassy
knoll there. And you take out a tennis ball from
your bag, and you throw it out there far into
the grass and you say Go, go boy, and you
unhook the the cat. And you say go Fetch, fetch
the ball. And the cat just sits there. And looks
like you're kind of funny. starts looking around and sniffing
the grass. Huh? What's wrong with his damn cat? I
know he wants the Frisbee. So you pull out the
Frisbee, throw the frisbee. Let's go play frisbee boy. And
so you throw the frisbee out there towards the cat.
And it just flies over his head. He doesn't jump
for it. At this point, you're gonna look concerned, you're
gonna get frustrated. Maybe you're thinking I bought the wrong
cat. Something's going on with this cat. All right, I'll
give it a couple of shots. I'm sure we'll break
them in. You say yourself. All right. So you get
into the car and you're driving back home. And then
an idea hits you, hey, why don't we go to
the pet store. Pet Store, we'll buy some cool cat
toys they're gonna like to play with. And as you're
driving to the pet store with your cat, they're sitting
near near you at the front seat. You roll down
the window, and you say go ahead and boys stick
your head out the window. Feel the air. And you
try to stick them there towards the window. But he's
afraid he runs away from the window. Okay, kind of
weird. You're thinking yourself? Well, let's just keep driving to
the pet store. So you drive to the pet store.
And there, you pick out some nice toys for him.
And then you drive back home and you come back
home. And you're coming in there with your bag of
toys. And you pull out what a bone here boy,
here's a bone you like bones, right? And you throw
it in front of him. And he just sits there
and kind of sniffs at the bone, and then turns
around and walks away. What's wrong here? ludicrous, right? ludicrous.
The problem is that we're treating the cat like the
dog. The problem is that we don't know who we're
dealing with here. And this is exactly what we do
with the opposite sex. This is exactly what you do
with the opposite sex. If you're a man, you treat
the woman not like a woman, but like a man.
And if you're a woman, you treat the man not
like a man, but like a woman. And this problem
right here is at the very core of many of
the issues that you have in your relationship. So this
is like a very deep root problem that I see.
What I want to talk about in this episode is
gender differences. And the point, the very broad point that
I'm going to make is that gender differences are very
real. Not only are they real, but they're biologically based,
they're physiologically based, they're actually wired into our genetics. So
they're real on a very deep level. And they're not
merely social or cultural roles. Like, you know, over the
last 50 years, especially with the feminist movement, there's been
a lot of equalizing of the gender roles in society.
And that's been good. But also with that we had
a problem, the problem that came about is that we
tend to think that, oh, well, gender differences. These are
just, you know, shallow surface level things. But actually, they're
not. And I'm going to go into a lot of
depth here on various research, and various principles and ideas
that you want to think about. And we're going to
talk about the science, we're going to talk about some
of the theory and the concepts. But then also, I'm
going to drill it back down to your practical relationship
life, how do you actually use these concepts to smoothen
out your relationships, and you'll find that some of these
shifts in your thinking, could be causing many problems in
your relationship that you haven't realized up till now. What
I've personally discovered is that it's really important in life,
if you ever want to deal with the opposite sex
in an intimate way, to understand how the opposite sex
thinks, very important. And this is something that most people
don't prioritize very highly. And in general, men and women
just suck at understanding each other. And what this does
is this leads to bitterness and contempt within relationships. And
it leads to bitterness and contempt towards the opposite gender.
And it creates nasty relationship problems, it creates anger, it
can even lead to things like disrespect, and even really
nasty stuff, like abusive relationships with physical abuse, or verbal
abuse, violence, like all sorts of very dark stuff. But
even if you are not going down to that very
dark stuff, I guarantee you, I guarantee that you still
have smaller issues, and hiccups in your relationship, because of
some of these things that you're not recognizing about women,
or about men. And the real problem here, with discussing
this issue is a it's an emotional issue for people,
it's very difficult for them to treat this issue objectively.
And what I find is that both men and women
have their own defense mechanisms put up. And quite frankly,
there's a lot of self righteousness going on, with men
being self righteous thinking that, hey, you know, we got
a better than women, and women don't understand us. And
then women doing the same thing. And they say, No,
no, no, we got it right as women, and it's
men who don't understand us. And the fact is that
you don't understand the opposite sex you not your opposite
partner. But you, of course, your partner also has problems.
So really, it's both sides who are unconscious here. And
they're not really willing to accept gender differences. Or if
they do accept gender differences, then they use that in
some sort of negative, neurotic way to entrench and justify
their prejudices and their dogmas, which is not at all
what we're gonna be doing here. Here, we're going to
be opening your mind and breaking you free of some
of these limits. There's two classic dismissals that the genders
make. So what do the men characteristically say about women?
They say that women are shallow, that they're overly emotional,
that all they're after is money, that that's what they're
attracted to. That they're just looking for a provider. And
the general gist of that is that women are emotional,
crazy drama queens. So that's what women say. I mean,
that's what men say, against women to dismiss, having to
go and understand why women actually think the way they
think. And then what did women say about men? Well,
they say also that men are shallow in a different
way. Women say that men are cold. They're all about
looks. It's all about the ass. It's all about the
boobs. And men are fundamentally not loyal. They're like dogs.
So the the gist of it is basically that men
are careless, they're unavailable, they're superficial. I'm going to talk
more about that as we continue. But right now what
I want to do is introduce the masculine feminine polarity
spectrum. So I like to think of masculinity and femininity
as sitting on a spectrum with many shades of grey
in between. So it's not that you're just a man,
or you're a woman. And it's not that you're just
masculine or you're feminine. But those things are different. And
they can intermix in all sorts of different ways, which
creates edge cases. But even though there are these edge
cases, it's still helpful to talk about stereotypes in generalities,
because I think that they apply to large percentages and
probably majorities of both the sexes. So what is the
spectrum? On the one hand, you've got masculinity over here,
like full blown masculinity, and then you've got full blown
femininity over here. And then you've got everything in between,
all the way to the middle, and in the middle,
you've just got like, neutrality, or equal 50 50% ratio
of both these things, right. Now, what's interesting is that
you can sit anywhere on this spectrum, it's not necessarily
the case that you're just over here or over here.
In fact, what I find is more people, more people
are probably towards the center, although they're still polarized. Now,
how do you determine what is masculine? What is feminine?
Well, I like to think of it in a little
bit of like a poetic language. And that is as
a form of energy. Think of masculinity as an energy
that is going outward, pushing outward. And this energy is
all about penetration into the world. And it's about imposing
yourself onto the world, dominating the world, you might say.
Now, this is like an attitude. It's an orientation towards
life. It doesn't just happen in the bedroom. Although, of
course, in the bedroom, it's very, very pronounced. And it's
extremely obvious and undeniable there. But it also happens in
more subtle shades. In the way that a man carries
himself the way he talks, the way he makes jokes,
the the way he interacts with people, the way he
does business. That's masculine. Now feminine. What does that that's
the polar opposite. So if masculine is pushing out, feminine
is soaking in. It's soaking up life. It's kind of
being at the cause of things. And it's flowing with
life. And it's flowing with emotions, and it's receiving or
surrendering to life. Now, again, that's a generalization. But that's
a pretty nice way to generalize feminine energy. So you've
got these two poles, right? And rarely is a person
super, super feminine. I mean, super masculine, or super, super
feminine. It's usually a little bit more towards the center,
but not all the way. It's not like people are
gender neutral. Most of us aren't, I would say that,
like, at least 50% of men are reasonably masculine, in
their natural attitude towards life. And 50% of women, at
least, are naturally feminine, and their attitude towards life. And
then of course, you have a mix of people who
are all over the place. You know, there's a lot
of variability here, we're talking about statistical averages and trends.
But nevertheless, it's helpful, it's helpful to look at the
world this way. And what you can do is you
can you can peg yourself, pat yourself on the spectrum,
where, where do you live? Where do you feel most
comfortable, as a man or as a woman? And we
should make an important distinction here, between who you are
on the outside, and who you are on the inside.
Lot of people get this wrong, they think that well,
just because I'm a man on the outside, that means
I must be masculine, right? No, not necessarily. In fact,
a really interesting study, which I'll cite in a little
bit here will show just how Stark this distinction can
be. But the the gist of it is, is that
who you are physically on the outside, can be completely
independent from who you are, psychologically on the inside. So
you could be a man on the outside, but actually
be very feminine on the inside your psychology, it could
be very feminine. And likewise, you can be a woman
on the outside, but have a very masculine psychology. So
that complicates things a little bit. But nevertheless, you know
yourself, right? Go ahead and peg yourself somewhere on the
spectrum. It just helps to orient you. Also, you might
want to ask yourself, Where where, well, where's my, where's
my spouse? Where's my partner? Where's my siblings on this
spectrum? Where are my parents on the spectrum? Where are
my friends on this spectrum? Not because you want to
pigeonhole them and limit them and now be prejudicial against
them. That's not what I'm telling you here. What I'm
telling you here is that your attitude towards the opposite
sex when you interact with them both in the bedroom
and outside. bedroom, it does depend on how you view
them. And just like, if you have a cat and
you try to treat it like a dog, that's going
to lead to problems. In the same way, if you
try to treat a woman like a man, that's going
to lead to problems, and vice versa. And I would
suggest that you have a lot of problems in your
life related to this. And they can be very subtle.
So I'll point them out to you as we go
along. Right? Don't make the mistake of thinking that this
is like a stereotype that now limits I like to
think of this as a stereotype that actually allows you
to understand the world from the other person's perspective, from
their point of view. So actually, this is an expanding
stereotype. Sounds a little weird to say that. But definitely,
you know, stereotypes do have truth in them. And if
you use them to actually get perspective from the other
person, than they can be very helpful. And that's exactly
what I encourage you to use them for here. So
let's go back to that point that I made about
the feminist movement. You know, in the last 6070 years,
there's been the feminist movement, and you know, women's rights
have happened, and women have the right to vote. And
there's been a lot of equality in the workplace happening
and anti sexual harassment laws and all this stuff, at
least in the Western world. And that's been a really
positive trend. But I think that one problem that happened
there is that yes, you know, we got more equality
with civil rights. But there's a distinction to be made
between civil rights, and then just who you're comfortable being
in your body. So even though we want civil equality,
we want men and women to be equal, politically, and,
you know, legally, and all that kind of stuff. We
want them all treated fairly and treated nicely. But the
problem with that is that if you carry that over
too far, you can start treating everyone equally. Even in
your intimate relationships. And even in your just casual interactions.
It's like, it's overly equalized. And I think that with
Western society, and Western culture, and media and politics, there's
like this overreaction to over equality. Because there's this real
sensitivity to being politically correct. And in fact, even just
talking about this issue, when I talk about this issue,
and I bring it up, you know, I get a
lot of flack from men and some women who have
their own agendas. And of course, you know, I have
my own agenda, too. So we all have our own
agendas. But generally, you know, this is a very touchy
subject to talk about kind of like talking about race,
that can be a touchy subject, too. And society just
wants to kind of say, well, okay, just treat everyone
totally equally, like we're gender neutral. But the fact is,
we're not gender neutral. We don't want to kid ourselves
about that. The fact is that biologically, we are very
different from each other, both genders. But this biology is
not just happening on the outside, it's also happening on
the inside. And this is what most people don't understand.
And I'll cite some studies on this coming up here
in a minute. But you know, for me, personally, my
own story, my own personal story is that I really
didn't get involved with romantic relationships through high school and
college, because I was so focused on other parts of
my life, not because I didn't want to, but just
like I was really focused on my career, and my
life purpose. So after I figured that part out, you
know, after college, then I was kind of open to
go and explore romantically start dating and getting better at
that and learning about women learning about masculinity, because I
didn't even know that much about masculinity, even though I
was a man. And so, you know, I started studying
that and started actually getting experiences there. And one of
the things that kind of blew my mind is learning
about the asymmetry between intimate, male female relationships. It's not
like the relationship is symmetrical. Not at all, there's division
of labor there. And there's also very big differences between
what attracts a woman to a man and a man
to a woman. There's real a cemetery. And I see
a lot of people not noticing this a cemetery and
I, when I started off, because I grew up in
the 90s. And you know, the 90s has already been
affected by the feminist movement a lot. So it's, everything's
like equal, right? And so when I was growing up,
I'm like, well, just treat everyone equal treat everyone neutrally.
So I would basically my approach to treating women in
a relationship would be, hey, you're just like a man,
right? We're all the same. And little did I know
how how many problems that causes causes a lot of
problems. Even though society tells you hey, that's what you
should be doing. Well, maybe that's what you should be
doing in the political setting. But that's definitely not what
you should be doing in the bedroom. Certainly not in
the bedroom, you can't even do it in the bedroom,
even if you wanted to, you couldn't do it in
the bedroom. Because there's just, it's just so blatantly obvious
how different we are not just physically but psychologically. But
you also, it's hard to do that not even you
know, in the bedroom, but just outside the bedroom, when
you're dealing with your girlfriend or boyfriend that will cause
you problems. So one of the key insights that I
want to share with you is something that I call
a symmetrical but balanced, asymmetrical, but balanced. This is a
concept I actually got from game design, I used to
be game designer. And one of the concepts in game
design is that sometimes you're designing a game where you
have two sides, but they don't have equal resources. So
what do you do when, you know one team has
the tank and the rocket launcher, and the other team
has a sniper rifle? They're different sides with different weapons
and different powers and different skills yet there they need
to be able to fight and kind of play together.
Otherwise, it's going to be a, you know, if it's
an unbalanced game, that it's not fun, and no one
wants to play it. So you got to balance those
out, even though the sides could be different. How do
you balance it out? Well, you can balance something that
is asymmetrical, you don't necessarily need to give both sides,
a rocket launcher, and a tank and a sniper rifle
to make them be able to balance out. So that's
kind of the art of good game designers know how
to balance a symmetry. But as it applies to this
context of men and women, I think the best example
of this balanced asymmetry is in the Yin Yang symbol,
the classic timeless symbol known across the entire world, for
balance, right, we can use this symbol to represent balance,
and what is the Yin Yang, it's a circle. And
then it's got this S shape like this, where you
have one part sticking out, and the other part sticking
in, and then vice versa, one part sticking out the
other parts sticking in and you got the black and
the white. And this can be used to represent masculine
and feminine in and out penetration and surrender. And that's
a beautiful symbol. But notice that this symbol is not
equal. What would the Yin Yang look like if it
was truly equal? Well, if we were very politically correct,
and we wanted to equalize the Yin Yang, we would
just erase the S shape the dividing line here in
the middle, we would erase that, and then we would
just draw a straight line down so that we would
have two perfectly equal hemispheres. But if we did that,
I think you can see that we would lose some
real beauty in the Yin Yang. And in fact, it's
like the balance is even more beautiful, when the sides
are different and complementary, perfectly complementary. And I think that
that's kind of the dynamic that we have, as men
and women. That's kind of how nature designed us. And
it's a really cool design. And I think that when
you go against this design, and you try to pretend
like everything is equal, then that creates some frustration and
some friction that naturally shouldn't be there. So let's talk
a little bit about the science behind this. One of
the things if you start doing research into the biology
of the mind, and the brain, and physiology of the
male and female body, is you start to see that
there are really big differences, not just physically, but internally,
with the brain. So our brains are literally wired differently.
And there's a really great book called The Red Queen,
which tackles a lot of the biology and the physiology
behind male and female differences. And there's a lot of
depth in that book, which I can only scratch the
surface of here, but I'll mention a couple of really
important studies. One of the most important studies, or things
that they've discovered, is that when the human being is
born, when it's just conceived, it's not even out of
the womb, yet. Already, it has a certain physiology to
the brain. And what they discovered is that the default
human brain is the emotional brain, which, in other words,
is the female brain. That's the default brain. So if
you take a baby, and you you just state it
in the womb, and then you give it birth, and
it's just kind of left alone to its own devices,
then that becomes the female mind. Now, how do you
get the male mind? To get the male mind what
needs to happen is you need to inject that female
mind as it's developing with testosterone. Testosterone is the male
hormone so what how happens is that when you're in
your first trimester or second trimester, I forget exactly when
during the pregnancy, but when that baby is just developing
in the womb, if it's supposed to be a boy,
usually what happens is that the body, the mother's body
naturally injects a shot of testosterone into the, into the
baby into the bloodstream. And that testosterone works on the
development of the brain. And literally, what it does is
it severs the corpus callosum, which is the bridge, the
physical bridge linking the right and the left hemisphere together.
In the baby's brain, it severs that. And that results
in the male mind. And then that that mind develops
more and more and more, the hemispheres become more and
more specialized. And then the baby is born and it
grows up. And then at puberty, you get a second
injection of testosterone, of course, as you're, as you're developing,
and you're maturing and becoming an adult, and so that
creates the adult man and his mind. And then you
know what the woman, the woman gets an injection of
testosterone, I mean, not testosterone, but estrogen and the other
female hormones. And that creates an even more female mind,
later on after adolescence. So this is a really cool
thing. Because what it tells you is that the brains
are actually literally different. The female brain is more like
holistic, because that severing of the hemispheres hasn't happened. So
the left and right, they are more kind of like
working together on problems. And the male mind, or the
male brain is more about specialization. So you have the
left and right hemispheres specializing for particular purposes. And this
can be seen in various studies that you can do
on men and women. Now, this doesn't mean that were
totally different. I mean, there's still a lot of similarity
and overlap between the male and female mind. But it
also means that there are some real differences that we
have to acknowledge. Here they are. The men's brain is
wired for systematic thinking, and for figuring out how stuff
works. This is very important to understand, especially for women,
because women have difficulty understanding this. Literally, the male mind
is wired for logic. That's what it's wired for. It's
wired for modeling the world. That's what the man does
most of his life is he walks around modeling the
world. That's his thing. Have you noticed that about men?
That's what men do. It's funny. Now, what about the
women's brains, women's brains are wired more for emotional thinking,
and loving and empathizing. And relating to other human beings.
That's what emotional acuity gets you is that better ability
to relate and interact with other human beings. It also
allows you to do language a little bit better. In
the male mind, language is limited to one hemisphere, mostly,
in the female mind, the language is kind of distributed
across both hemispheres. And so this makes them a little
bit stronger at verbal skills. And this is actually demonstrated
in studies in you know, subtle ways. So for example,
they've done studies where they have a man and a
woman trying to navigate through a maze. And they just
try to see who's better at navigation. And what they
discover is that consistently, men are better at navigating maps,
and navigating three dimensional spaces. Why is that? Because their
mind is more systematic, and it's able to actually create
a picture or a model or a map of the
territory, which helps them then to navigate that complicated space.
Women struggle with that a little bit more, which is
maybe why women struggle, figuring out where to drive sometimes
common stereotype, right? But this shows you that maybe there's
a little bit of a biological underpinning to that stereotype.
And then, what about for women? Well, what they discovered
for women is that women have slightly higher verbal skills,
generally speaking, than men do. And then of course, women's
minds are much better at understanding subtle emotional cues. And
in a sense, you might say that femininity is all
about like being in touch with Your intuitive nature, right?
It's not about rationally needing to figure everything out sometimes
the way men want to do, it's more about just
kind of going with the flow and also being in
touch with your emotions and your feelings and using that
as a guide. And that's a valid way to guide
yourself. So it's interesting how that happens. Now, also, what's
interesting is that, you know, we talked about how that
testosterone is shot into the, the baby's brain when it's
still developing in the womb, well, there can be failures
with that, not always does the boy get a full
dose of testosterone, which is what can lead to a
man growing up, but having a more feminine mind than
some other men. Right. And likewise, when the girl is
developing in the womb, she might get a bit of
testosterone that maybe she shouldn't have otherwise gotten. And so
that makes him a little bit more masculine. And so
this starts to explain why there are so many edge
cases and so much gray area on the spectrum of
masculine feminine, right. And in fact, what's cool is that
you can actually have a man who has a female
mind. And you can have a woman who has a
male mind. And nowhere is this more point poignantly displayed
than in this study. And this one study that they
did is just mind blowing that it works this way,
what they did is they took fruit flies, they took
fruit flies, and they isolated the different genes, and they
splice some genes in the fruit fly. And what they
discovered is that you can take a male fruit fly
splice in some female genes, and then what happens is
that you actually get a male fly on the outside,
with a female brain on the inside. And you know
what happens in that case, the characteristic behaviors of female
flies will be exhibited by the male fly. Just as
though he was a female, even though from the outside,
he looks like a male. So for example, female flies
will flap their wings in a certain way. Or they'll
have certain patterns with which they'll move their legs or
how they'll, they'll spin around, or how they dance and
coordinate with other flies. So you can see those behaviors
in a male fly, if you give it a female
brain. And exactly vice versa, you can take a female
fly on the outside, give it a male brain, and
then that will create male tendencies and behaviors within the
externally female fly. This is an amazing, you know, amazing
piece of research. And they've actually done this in the
lab. And they they've seen this and, you know, you
can go and follow up on that research and just
take a look at it for yourself. But I think
that that, that helps to explain quite a lot about
what's really going on here, why we do have these
real gender differences. And that's why I say that gender
differences are not just social and cultural norms, there seems
to be something much deeper there. So men's brains are
really built for logic, because logic is helpful for building
stuff, constructing stuff. And women's brains are geared to be
emotional, because emotions are really helpful for relating to people,
but most importantly, for nurturing children. So women's brains are
more capable of giving the child the love that it
needs so that it can grow up into a healthy
adult. And we'll talk about that in a second. Another
study, or set of studies that's really fascinating is to
take a look at chimps studies. And there's a really
great book by France to wall who's one of the
leading primatologists in Europe, and where he talks about the
research that he's done for, like 20 or 40 years
on chimpanzees, and bonobos. And what he does, he sits
in a zoo, and he watches chimpanzees and bonobos and
studies them very deeply. And what you see in these
studies, is that, first of all, you got to understand
that there's a big difference between chimps and bonobos, chimps
are male dominated, their hierarchy is male dominated. So there's
like an alpha male and a beta male and a
whole chain of males. And that's like the power structure
in chip group. In the bonobo group, it's the exact
opposite is female dominated. And so you've got like the
alpha female, and then beta females and got the hierarchy
of females and then you've got the males who are
basically ruled by the females. Really cool. But what's even
more interesting is how the males and the females reinforce
their power. So the, the male chimps in the chimp
group, that They literally conspire to, to murder each other
or to plot assassination attempts. This is how they vie
for power. And so what happens is that often, male
chimps will bite each other to death or beat each
other to death. And they'll actually coordinate with other chimps
to help them to do that. So like literally, you
know, they create coos, it's incredible. And then the women
just kind of sit back and watch as all this
happens. So it's a very violent, kind of domineering, very
highly masculine form of rule. Whereas with the bonobos, it's
the exact opposite. The females use a much more gentle
form of manipulation and persuasion to maintain their power. And
their power is not reinforced through physical strength, or plotting
conspiracies. Instead, it's reinforced through building long term relationships, and
through solidifying those relationships with love. And in fact, what's
crazy about bonobos is that they have sex constantly, all
the time. They have so much sex is ridiculous. Not
only do they have sex, but they they have homosexual
sex, so women will have sex with other women. Why
does this happen, because the sex is not used for
procreation purposes, as much as it is used for bonding
purposes and building relationships. So it's all very emotional, you
might say, it's very sappy. I'm very feminine way to
rule. And then males just kind of sit back and
just follow the lead in that. So it's really crazy
how that works. Now, for the human species, I think
we're a little bit obviously more like the chimp than
the bonobo, but it shows you how big of a
difference it makes, what kind of mind is ruling the
society. And what the dynamics are there, it's just shows
you if you start reading these studies, and this is
just the tip of the iceberg of this kind of
study about chimps and bonobos, you start to see just
how different the male and females are within the species.
So if you take a look at a male Chimp,
and a female, Chimp, they are different in how they
behave and how they act. And the same thing for
the bonobos. It's quite amazing. So I think that what
all of this says, is it says that we have
real differences in Preferences and orientation and an attitude towards
life. That's the key difference here. I'm not saying that
like, men are better, or women are better, or men
are stronger, and women are weak or something like that,
first of all, notice that in this discussion, we're not
making any prejudicial claims. And we're not saying that, like,
hey, men are better, or women are better. We're saying
that there's pros and cons to the natural design of
the mind, as you would expect, right? In evolution. When
you engineer something, it works better at certain things, and
then works on other things. And then some other design
and evolution works better at certain things, but then not
other things. Kind of like what you expect, right? And
design has a natural function coming along with it. And
so what I think happened in evolutions infinite wisdom, is
that it specialized the sexes, so that the task of
living together and raising a family together became easier. So
that instead of having two totally equal partners coming together,
and just dividing all the labor equally, what happened was
that there was the division of labor. Men were more
geared towards going out there, and maybe hunting or procuring
resources, or vying for power, that kind of thing. And
women were more geared towards building relationships over the long
term and, and then raising the children and spending time
with the children. So you know, that's, that's our heritage.
That's what it looks like, at least from the evolutionary
history perspective. Now, does that mean that that's what we're
destined for for the rest of eternity? No, and we've
had a lot of equality happen there. But I think
we have to be honest, that the attitude differences and
the differences in desire are there between the sexes. Men
want different things than women. And women want different things
than men. And there's many examples we can cite of
this. I mean, do you really think that it's just
a cultural norm, that we dress a baby girl in
a pink dress? And then we dress a boy in
some kind of like tuxedo, when we take them to
a formal event? Do you think that's just a cultural
norm? I think it goes deeper. I think there's something
about the color pink that actually women are more drawn
to, like, physiologically, their mind is more drawn to it
than the male mind. You know, I don't know if
they did did any studies on this, but I'm pretty
sure that if you just take a look at the
in innate desires of a baby that's just been born,
and you give it a pink blanket versus a blue
blanket, that if it's a girl, and it's a kind
of feminine mind, it'll probably be more drawn to the
pink blanket. And if it's a boy who has a
masculine mind, he'll probably be more drawn to the blue
blanket, not for cultural reasons or for peer pressure. But
just because naturally, that's what the mind is kind of
pulling him towards. And you see this everywhere else in
society, right? So it probably starts at a very early
age, right from birth. But you also see it just
exacerbate more and more as we mature, and become adults.
Just go take a look at any engineering department, or
computer science department in the university. You know, I haven't
been to all university. So I don't know what it's
really like. But I'm willing to guess, because I was
in engineering when I was when I was in my
undergrad. And if you've been in the engineering department, you
know that there's like 95% men and 5% women in
engineering, or in computer science. Now, you could say, well,
Leo, that's because you know, women aren't given the same
kind of opportunities in math and science that men are.
And there's prejudices in the system against women for going
into fields like engineering. Now, I would say, yeah, there's
probably some of that. Sure. And it was certainly really
bad. In the past, it's gotten a lot better. And
we we still probably want to make it more equal.
But I would submit to you that that is not
the reason why there's only 5% women within engineering classes.
The reason why is because engineering and computer programming are
highly logical, highly systematic ways of thinking that not that
women can't do it. But women don't really want to
do it. You see that difference? Huge difference. Don't misinterpret
me as saying that women can't. I'm saying they don't
want to. Generally speaking now, are there women who break
this exception? Of course, there are the 5%. There are
many women who are great scientists, and engineers, and logicians
and mathematicians. But how common are they in society? They're
pretty rare. Right? And the opposite of this is also
true. So go find an activity or a role, or
a job, where you require a lot of emotional thinking
and empathizing. And you will find that there are much
fewer men in that job, or in that activity than
women. So what would be an example of this, I
don't know, maybe like human resources, in companies, human resources
in the job where you need to, you know, be
kind of empathetic with people a lot. And it's a
kind of a people relationship type of job. And so
there's more women gravitating towards HR than men, just as
a general rule of thumb. Now, does this mean that
a man cannot be good at HR? No, of course
he can. But he's geared and drawn towards something else?
Because he has some different desires. Right? I mean, and
of course, the most obvious example is raising kids. I
think unquestionably, females are better suited towards raising children than
men. You know, does this mean that a father cannot
raise a child on his own? And have the child
come out? Well, no, Dad could do that just fine.
But that's the exception. That's not the trend. And if
you take a look at the way the male mind
works, it's not really good at relating to people. In
fact, there's a really important book on this subject called
the essential difference, where one of the leading researchers on
autism and male female mind studies he presents a lot
of studies in this book and a lot of in
depth discussion. But what I learned from this book is
amazing thing is that, if you consider what the male
mind actually is, is that it's the female mind. That's
a little bit autistic. Think about that. Autism is a
disorder, where what happens is that the mind becomes extremely
logical, overly logical, it becomes so good at modeling and
systematizing that it becomes like overly anal about factual stuff.
And what this does, this creates an actual disorder because
an autistic person has such difficulty relating to other people
and empathizing with other people. And they literally can't see
the world from the other person's shoes. And this creates
very practical problems for them, because they can't even like,
sit there at the dinner table and engage in a
discussion, because they'll just blurt out some totally obnoxious thing
that they don't understand is going to offend everyone at
the dinner table. But to them, it's just like a
logical fact. And so that's one problem with autism, also,
Asperger syndrome is another form of that. The way that
happens is that you get the male mind, but then
it goes hyper masculine, it becomes hyper logical, and it
becomes autistic, turns into a disorder. What's interesting, though, is
that if you compare the male mind to the female
mind, what the male mind is, is just a slightly
more autistic, female mind. And this is exactly what makes
men behave like men. This is exactly what makes a
little men a little bit more detached, a little bit
less emotional, a little bit less needy, a little bit
more, more like assholes a little bit more cold hearted
than women. And why is that good? Well, that's good,
because that allows the man to go out and like,
fight a war, right? pretty helpful for that, to be
detached from emotions. If you care about people so much,
then you probably won't want to slit their throats, or
bayonet them in the gut. So that helps for that.
Now, with women, they're more emotional, empathetic, what does that
help with that helps with nurturing children. Because what does
a child need a child needs unconditional love and support?
A child doesn't need logic, a child does need to
be told everything that he's doing wrong. In fact, that's
a common mistake that fathers make with their children is
that fathers are so overly logical that they're not considering
the child's feelings or emotions. They're just telling the child
exactly the, you know, the blunt truth of the world.
And maybe the child is not able to handle that
at first. And so the child becomes this neurotic kid
who's trying to please his father for the rest of
his life. And that creates problems. Right? So very deep,
right? I think this, this goes so deep if you
really want to study this subject, and you want to
take a look at all the different factors that are
here. What's what's really amazing is that, that I'm going
to talk more about this is that it's very easy
to dismiss as men, it's very easy to dismiss the
importance of emotions. Because we tend to say that oh,
well, you know, we live in a very tight time
scientific and technological society. So what good are emotions? Emotions
are useless. We want to model the world and figure
everything out. We want to be very scientifical and logical,
but women aren't logical. So women are kind of crazy.
How do we deal with that? Well, let me not
deal with that issue at all. But see what you're
not accepting about women there is that you're not accepting
that? Yes, maybe they're all crazy at times and emotional,
but they also created you. Think about your mother, if
you had a good mother, she showered you with unconditional
love. And unconditional love allows you to become the fully
developed, emotionally stable man that you are now. What if
your mother didn't shower you with love? What if she
was hypercritical? And basically like a man? What happened then?
Then you are right now a very neurotic man. You're
not an emotionally stable man. If your mother was that
way. Why is that? Well, because love, it turns out,
and they've done studies on this, some very cruel studies
on animals, where they can actually take a chimp, or
some monkey, not a chimp, but a monkey. And they
raise that monkey without the mother, they separate the monkey
from the mother monkey at birth, stick the little baby
monkey in a cage and just leave it there and
let it grow up. And what happens that monkey becomes
completely dysfunctional. It is not able to interact with other
monkeys wants to be introduced to a troop. It's, it's
always fearful. It's angry, it's basically neurotic. And it's not
able to live a happy life. Forever, that monkey is
fucked. Why is that? Because it didn't receive the mother's
affection. When it was growing up. It didn't receive the
cuddles. It didn't receive the love. It didn't receive the
attention and the looks and the emotions. So as men,
we can dismiss this a little bit too easily. Right?
This is the power of women. Women do have a
very strong power and their power is love and emotions
and relationships. And if you think that the world could
run just fine without any of that stuff, then you
are autistic. And you're you've got a real big blind
spot in your model of reality. Because society could not
function without adults who are not neurotic, and did not
receive love as children. So just keep that in mind
as you criticize women for being overly emotional. Now, what
about women, women also make a mistake here. Women refuse
to accept the male mind. Because what women don't like
about the male mind is that it's detached. They don't
like the fact it's a little bit too cold hearted
at times. They also don't like the fact that men
are highly sexual. And they're pretty frivolous with their sexuality.
So men a lot of times don't like to commit
sexually to one woman. And this baffles the woman, because
the woman's like, hey, why don't you want to commit
to me? And the man's like, Hey, I just treat
you like an object. Because I treat the entire world
as an object. Everything is an object. That's what my
mind does. I have a logical mind, which means that
treats everything objectively, to the woman, she hears that she's
like, You mean, I'm an object to you. And then,
by that point, the man is like, Shit, I shouldn't
have told her that. I was being too honest. And
that's an example of the man being autistic. Right? So
what does the man do? He lies to the woman
and he says, Oh, honey, I love you so much.
And you're you're so special to me, You're not an
object, you're not an object. So that's how it goes
right? Now, I'm, I'm kind of playing this up a
little bit. But, but you know, a lot of women
struggle with accepting this. A lot of women struggle with
accepting this. And that's what the sexes do, you know,
we refuse to accept each other's fundamental biological attitudes towards
life. Women don't want to accept attachment in men. Women
don't want to accept the male sex drive. They say
that it's wrong. And from the female perspective, you can
see how that's true. And then from the male perspective,
what men refuse to do is men refuse to accept
the emotional language of women. They think women are complicated
and overly emotional kind of needy. And that comes with
problems and you can't reason with them. They're not fact
based. And of course, you know, from the male's perspective,
that's true. But what I encourage you to do is
I encourage you to start to see the opposite sex
from their perspective, not from your perspective, it's very easy
to look at the world from your perspective, that's the
easy thing. The emotionally difficult thing is to say, Okay,
well, let me put my own shit aside. And let
me take your perspective. And let me just see what
the world looks like from your perspective. And let you
let me maybe see how I'm wrong about your perspective.
That's what people suck at. And they refuse to do.
Let me mention another really important insight that I got
from the essential difference. Here's the insight. And this in
one single statement, basically encapsulates the whole difference between the
male and female mind. It's very telling, boys would rather
hurt feelings, to uphold logic. Whereas girls would rather break
logic to save feelings. Think about that. Think about how
deeply true that is. If you just go back through
your life, and remember all the times that you've interacted
with men or with women, and there were issues there,
you could understand the opposite sex. And you apply this
principle to that misunderstanding. All of a sudden, it's like
a light bulb flashes in your head, like, Oh, of
course. Of course, I see what was going on in
that situation. Of course, I understand why I was fighting
with my wife. Or of course, I understand why my
boyfriend was an asshole. Of course, because boys value facts
and logic more than emotions. Girls value emotions and feelings
more than facts. And that's reflected in our attitudes, and
in every way in which we interact in the world.
So there's a there's a real failure in assuming that
the opposite sex is like us. And we make this
mistake, because usually, how do we learn to deal with
other people? Well, we actually learn from translating our own
experiences onto other people through kind of a projection mechanism.
So For example, if I stick my hand in a
fire, and it hurts, and it burns me, and I'm
like out, okay, I learned that fire hurts me. But
then I look at another person who's about to reach
into the flame, and I say, hey, stop, that's gonna
burn you, that's gonna hurt. Why do I do that?
Well, because I can translate this experience and projected on
to that situation over there. And what's the assumption going
on there? The assumption is that, hey, my psychology is
like his psychology or her psychology. And we can use
this generalization, this general assumption. So you know, to, to
live and work in life very effectively. So it's a
very helpful assumption, except when it comes to the genders.
See, in the genders, what we do is we, we
say, Oh, I'm a man. And I like, a certain
kind of sex. And I like, you know, certain kinds
of things. And I expect the woman to also like
those things, right? And of course, the answer is no.
Women don't like action movies. And women don't like, you
know, going to the gym and lifting super heavy weights.
And women don't like you know, don't like talking about
sports. That's not what women generally like talking about, um,
some women do, but generally they don't. Women like other
stuff, why do they like other stuff, because that stuff
appeals to their nature more. You're gonna encounter a lot
of problems, if you sort of treat your woman as
though she did like those things. And I mean, you
could actually go test this out, go get one of
your, if you're a guy, go get one of your
woman friends, take her out for a coffee, sit her
down, and then spend the next 60 minutes talking about
computer rendering algorithms. Just talk about that, see how she
likes it. See, if she'll go on a second coffee
with you. After that, you know, she's gonna, her eyes
are gonna glaze over if you do that. And you
know, if you're a woman, try the opposite thing. Try
to get one of your buddies to like, you know,
an arts and crafts store. Take one of your men
friends to an arts and crafts store and talk about
the different, you know, fabrics that you're going to buy
for the wedding that you're planning and see how into
that he's going to be his eyes will glaze over,
he'll want to shoot himself, most likely. So why is
this? Well, that's because we have these different preferences. And
that's just how it is, right? So be careful about
making this assumption that, hey, what I'm attracted to as
a woman is what the man should be attracted to.
No, ridiculous. As the woman you're attracted to the man's
personality, to his humor, to his confidence, and then a
lot of women say, Well, I'm attracted to that in
the man. So of course, he's attracted to that in
me, right? And of course, the answer's no, he's attracted
to you physically, he's attracted to your body, he's attracted
to you're asked to your face into your tits. That's
the harsh reality of it. That's the reality that women
do not want to hear. And they get pissed off
at me for saying it. And they say, No, Leo,
he's attracted to my personality. And if he's not attracted
my personality, that I'll just go become a lesbian. See,
when you take that kind of attitude, what you're doing
is you're falling into this trap of refusing to understand
the opposite sex. And, you know, men make the same
mistake. make this mistake as well. You know, how many
comments do I get under some of my videos about
how to attract women that say that oh, well, women,
what they're looking for is they're looking for looks, it's
all about looks. And it's all about the money. That's
what they say. It's all about how you're how tall
you are. Well, you're judging from your perspective, from the
man's perspective, it's all about looks. So of course, you
would think that the woman wants looks from you, and
that that's what she's primarily attracted to is to your
looks, of course, you'd think that, because that's how you
see women. But see, you're making this bad assumption that
a woman thinks like a man, when in fact, she
does not. So yeah, so this is some of the
stuff you have to accept. And this can be difficult
stuff to accept. Sometimes we just don't want to let
me tell you, in summary, what the sexes really want,
here's what men really want. And this is kind of
a harsh truth. Men in their relationship in their I'm
talking about in their intimate relationship. What men want is
they want sexual variety. They want easy going companionship, so
that they can go out and dominate the world and
be a man because that's what a man wants to
do. And they want respect, and primarily sex. So what
does the man get out of an intimate relationship primarily
respect and sex Now what about women? What do women
want from intimate relationships, they want security, not material security,
even as much as emotional security, primarily emotional security. They
also want leadership. They want deep emotional intimacy. And they
want love. Generally speaking, they want love. So notice how
different those two things are. And this perfectly explains the
difficulties that men and women have with attracting and keeping
each other. It's because we, we don't understand what's going
on here. And we assume like, hey, the woman should
be like me, or the man should be like me.
And no, not at all. No, they shouldn't. So what
do we do about all this? And how do we
apply this to your life? Well, here's the gist of
it. Not only do you need to stop resisting these
differences, you need to actively assimilate and accept them. Not
only do you need to accept them, then you need
to teach yourself how to celebrate these differences with your
partner, and how to accentuate these differences. And if you
can do that, you will see that your relationship with
your partner goes so much smoother. Our natural tendency is
not to do this. Our natural tendency is to be
a stubborn mule. And to resist this entire process, and
to just say, hey, men are stupid, and I don't
want anything to do with them, or they need to
learn how to treat women better. Or the men will
say no, women are crazy and emotional. And all I'm
going to do is I'm gonna use them for sex,
I'm gonna throw them all away. Right? Those are the
two common strategies that the sexes take when they're being
obstinate. So what can you do to fix this? Well,
start by accepting some of the facts, I'm telling you
here, start thinking about them. I also encourage you to
actually start doing research, do some research, go buy some
books, maybe take a seminar about masculine and feminine, polarities.
Learn about this stuff, learn the research, learn the science.
Go date more people go carefully observe how men and
women interact. You can learn a lot from that, that
will help to convince your mind that these differences are
real, and they really exist. And then it's about kind
of coordinating with your partner to celebrate and accentuate their
differences. And I'll tell you about that in a in
a second here. But first, I want to help you
right now to get a little bit of awareness around
this with a visualization exercise. All right, so you're ready,
we're gonna do two exercise. The first one is going
to be for the men, the second one's gonna be
for the women. So all the men in the audience,
go ahead and take a comfortable seat, relax and close
your eyes. And this is just gonna be a quick
couple of minute visualization for you, just to prove a
point. And now ladies, you can just sit back and
watch. Alright, so your eyes are closed and you're getting
present. In the moment right now, let go of any
random thoughts you may have. And just get in touch
with your body and with the sound of my voice.
Good. As you relax even more, with your eyes closed,
I'd like you to picture yourself in the bedroom having
sex. Picture yourself having sex. Except this is not the
normal way you have sex. Here, what's happening is that
instead of you doing the penetrating, which is what you
usually like to do, here, I want you to picture
yourself getting penetrated. Picture yourself surrendering completely in the bedroom
and just getting completely fucked. Now I'm being serious. This
is not a joke. I want you to picture this.
You're probably going to resist in your mind is probably
going to find it a little distasteful. If you're masculine,
to do this exercise, but do it anyways force yourself.
Get past that. You're a grown man and you can
do it. And just picture that and allow yourself to
feel what it might feel like to get fucked and
to completely surrender yourself in the bedroom. The way that
a woman feels. First I want to notice I want
you to notice if you have any resistance to this
exercise, so just note that if you do but then
go beyond it and then what I want you to
do is I want you to notice how beautiful it
is and how cool it is to be Be able
to surrender yourself to life as an attitude. Both in
the bedroom and outside the bedroom. That's femininity. That's a
beautiful and valid way to live life. Can you see
the beauty in it? Can you see the beauty and
being emotional and not being so neurotically logical the way
that you are as a man acknowledge it to yourself
and just accept that as being a valid way to
live life. No better, and no worse than your masculine
approach that you typically take. Good. Go ahead and open
your eyes now. And you can sit back and relax.
And now I want to help the ladies. Alright, ladies,
go ahead and close your eyes and relax in your
seat. And now you probably know what's coming. But just
go ahead and let go of all your thoughts. Get
into the present moment. Focus on the sound of my
voice and the feelings in your body. Good. Now, what
I'd like you to imagine is to picture yourself in
the bedroom having sex. Except you're not surrendering the way
you would normally like to. But this time you are
the one who's doing the penetrating picture that picture yourself
doing the fucking you have might have some resistance to
that might feel distasteful to you. But notice it and
just go past that and picture it anyways. And I
want you to notice and to acknowledge yourself how beautiful
and cool it is to be the one doing the
fucking in life. Can you see the beauty of that
as an attitude? towards all of life, not just in
the bedroom? But even outside the bedroom? Can you see
the power of being a little bit detached from your
emotions? Can you see the power in dominating the world?
How that can be a cool thing. Just notice it
and acknowledge it as a valid way to live life.
No better or worse than your typical feminine approach. Good,
go ahead and open your eyes. Alright, so what did
you get there? You got a very real taste. If
you weren't convinced yet, of just how ingrained your tendencies
towards masculine or feminine actually are. Most of you probably
found these exercises to be difficult and distasteful. And many
of you maybe even didn't do them because of that.
Well, what does that tell you, that tells you just
how strong your preferences are for the masculine or the
feminine. It also shows you how much resistance you have
towards seeing the world from the opposite perspective. And if
you have that kind of resistance, if you are not
able to the exercise, that I guarantee you that that
is manifesting somewhere inside your relationships. You're gonna have a
very strong tendency to want to convert your partner to
your sex. This is what causes so many relationship problems.
Here's how it works like this. The woman comes home
from work and she's upset. And the man is sitting
there and he wants to kind of comfort her and
help her. So she comes over she's maybe kind of
crying or whatever. She has a really bad day her
boss was being a dick or whatever. She hates her
job. So she comes there and she's looking for all
support. Now the man what does he do? The man
in his mind just automatically says okay, let's fix her
problem for her. Honey, what's going on? What's going to
tell you what's going on at work? Oh, your boss
is an asshole. Okay. All you know, I'll go talk
to him tomorrow for you. Or you know what, I
think you should quit that job and go get that
new job. You know, I think that we can get
you job over here, that will fix your problem, Honey,
stop crying. That's what the man will do. Now how's
the woman going to react? The woman's going to react
negatively. Now the man, he thinks, Hey, I just fixed
your problem, you should love me more. The woman's going
to think, no, you asshole, you didn't understand what the
problem was, I didn't want you to fix my problem.
I wanted some emotional support. I want you to listen
to me to hear me out, and just maybe give
me a hug. And just tell me that everything's gonna
be okay. As the guy, we're like, what? Why don't
you want to fix your problem? Why do you want
all this emotional support? You don't need any of that?
How about we get you a better job, then you
can be happy. Your boss, I could be big anymore.
Now you don't need to come home crying anymore. And
now there's no problem. Isn't that what you really want?
And the woman looks at him and starts arguing and
fighting with them? Why is that happening? Because what the
man doesn't understand in this situation is that he's actually
criticizing the very essence of the woman. See, we feel
good when we are who we authentically want to be.
So the woman if you're a feminine woman, she wants
to be feminine, she wants to be emotional, she wants
to experience that emotional range. She doesn't want to be
hyper logical, or artistic like you. So you got to
let the woman do that. When you tell her that
that's wrong. And you criticize her for that. By calling
her overly emotional and irrational, what you're doing is you're
actually telling her, Hey, honey, be a woman on the
outside, but be a man on the inside for me.
Can you do that? And the woman of course says,
No, I want to be a woman on the inside.
I don't want to be a man on the inside,
you idiot. And then that creates an argument. So that's
the one side now what about the opposite side of
that? So let's say the man come home from work.
And you know, his boss was being an asshole, and
his job is going badly. He's in a glum mood.
Now, the woman is there at home. And she, of
course, wants to comfort him. So what does she do?
She runs over on the couch, she sits by him
and she says, Oh, honey, tell me about how your
day went and tell me what you're feeling. I want
to know what you're feeling. And she's trying to like,
hug him and get close to him and, and find
out everything that's going on and showered him with support.
What does the man do? The man pushes her aside,
you know, I'm going to go into the garage and
work on my car. I'll be back in three hours.
What's going on there? As the man, he does not
want to get all emotional and sappy about this problem.
As men, what do we want, we want to actually
fix problems. That's our logical attitude. So we don't want
to we want to share our feelings with you when
we're, you know, when we're upset or something like that.
We just want to go maybe be alone, not talk
to you for a while, then we can come back.
Maybe we're in a better mood or something like that.
But now, what is the woman trying to do? The
woman says, Honey, don't don't don't leave, come back here.
Tell me what's going on. I want to know more.
Tell me more. Tell me how you're feeling. She follows
him into the garage and say, Honey, tell me how
you're feeling. I want to comfort you and all this.
What does this do to the madness? Because the man
off? Why does it piss them off. Because as the
man I want to be masculine on the inside, I
want to be allowed to be who I want to
be. When you're forcing me, especially when I'm in a
bad mood, and you're forcing me to tell you all
my intimate emotions and get sappy with you know, maybe
sometimes I want to do that. But generally, I don't
want to do that. I want to detach from my
emotions as a man rather than surrender into them. And
I want to go and maybe think it through logically
and find some logical solution. Or maybe I just want
to distract myself and numb out the emotions. But if
you want me to sit here for an hour, spilling
all my emotions out to you, then that's just gonna
piss me off. What you're doing as the woman is
you're asking me to be, Hey, honey, be a man
on the outside for me. But on the inside, please
be a woman. That's what you're doing. And of course,
that creates problems. When someone criticizes your very essence, you're
gonna get defensive, and you're gonna feel offended, and you're
gonna feel misunderstood. And that's exactly what the sexes do
to each other, and how we feel about each other.
It's like the man wants a supermodel hot girlfriend, who
has the mind of one of his beer drinking buddies.
That's the ideal woman for the average man. And for
the woman, the ideal man is like, you know, this
very dominant Alpha leader guy who like kicks ass and
dominates in the world and doesn't give a shit about
anybody. But on the other hand, keep comes home, and
he spilled his guts out, and his heart out. And
he loves you. And he's so attached to you, and
He makes you the center of his life. That's what
you want as the woman. So basically, it's like you
want a man on the outside with your girlfriend's mind,
on the inside? How fucked up is that? One thing
we need to recognize is that men and women are
who they are, they have this essential difference. And what
we need to learn to do is to appreciate that.
accentuate that you won't believe how smoothly your relationships will
go, when you actually understand what's going on in these
situations. So now, for example, you know, if, if my
girlfriend comes home, and she's had a bad day, normally
what I do is I try to fix her problem
for her that would piss her off, pissed me off,
everything would go bad. And then leave me scratching my
head was like, What did I do wrong? Now she
comes home, and I understand her mind. She comes home
and she's got some problem. She tells me all about
her problem. I just sit there patiently and listen to
her, let her spiller part out. And then I'll just
give her a hug and a kiss and say, Oh,
baby, it'll be alright. I understand how you feel. I
felt that way too, when something bad happened to me.
So you just you empathize, right? Instead of fixing the
problem. You just empathize with your woman, and nothing else.
You don't try to fix anything. And what happens 30
minutes later, the woman has a huge smile on her
face. She loves you more than ever. She wants to
have sex with you, everything's going great. You're the best
boyfriend in the world. Right? Just that little little change,
a little change of not trying to fix her problem.
But where did it come from? It come? It comes
from this very deep understanding of how she thinks. Now
what about the man situation? Well, let's say I'm the
woman and the man comes home. The man comes home
and he's pissed off. Instead of going there and trying
to get him to spill his heart. I just recognize
that, oh, he probably is pissed off. He probably wants
to do like, some alone time, some space to detach
from his emotions to think things through by himself. Oh,
honey, why don't you just go work on your car
for a couple hours? And then we'll watch a movie
after I say something like that to him. And he's
like, oh, okay, cool. I was gonna do that anyways.
And so he goes off, he drinks his beer, and
he works on his car. And then two hours later,
he comes back. He's thought everything through he's, you know,
he's detached from all those emotions. And now he sits
down to watch a movie with you. And it's like,
he's, he's feeling great. And you're feeling right now you
can you can ask him some questions, you could figure
out how he feels, you know, now he's in a
better mood and everything goes smoothly, your relationship is saved.
Right? This here, right here, this difference, such a small
difference, but where does it come from? It comes from
this very deep understanding and acceptance. So first, you start
with that, then you move on to accentuation actually accentuate
you actually start to look for opportunities to make your
woman feel like a, like a feminine goddess. And you
look then for opportunities as the, as the woman as
a woman, you look for opportunities for to make your
man feel like he's this, you know, powerful warrior. And
when you can play that up, that's when you get
the most beautiful relationship. That's when the two parts come
together. And you get the perfect yin yang, where the
yin and the yang understand each other finally, and they
play together to create something larger than the sum of
its parts. And that's what I wish for you. And
to help you finally to do that. One last little
exercise. I want you to take out a piece of
paper right now and a pen and write down this
one question. This is the key question that summarizes everything
we've talked about here. Here's the question, write it down.
What I need to accept and integrate about the opposite
sex, which I've ignored up until now is blank. What
I need to accept and integrate about the opposite sex,
which I've ignored up till now is blank. Go ahead
and think about that. Write down your answer. And then
your job is to work past your resistance. To accept
it, integrate it and even perhaps, celebrate it and accentuate
it. Alright, that's it. This is Leo, I'm signing off.
