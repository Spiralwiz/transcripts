hey this is Leo for actualised already and in this
video I'm going to talk about open-mindedness alright let's talk
about open-mindedness what does this mean and what does this
have to really do with anything how is this pertinent
to your life well this is actually a video that
I've been very very excited to shoot and I really
want to actually make this video very powerful because to
me open-mindedness is I would say one of the most
important personal characteristics that you need to cultivate to be
good at personal development let me go a little bit
into the backstory of this why this is important and
then we're going to talk about how this applies really
directly to your life and why if you're not extremely
open-minded that you're not getting the results that you should
be in your life it's really hampering your growth so
we need to open you up the more we open
you up the more we can grow you faster it's
like an accelerator for your growth as a human being
alright so how does this how does this actually work
what's the connection for me personally this is one of
my biggest strengths you know I've done a lot of
thinking over over the years about what are my strengths
as a human being you know what am I really
here for what's my purpose and all this other stuff
and what I really discovered is that one of the
strengths that I just naturally have for whatever reason I
was maybe born with it or whatever is I have
a very very open mind like it's very very difficult
to offend me and I'm very curious about lots of
different perspectives and ideas now why is this important for
personal development well for me I think I've gotten some
abnormal results for personal development in the last five years
much more abnormal than most people like I've gotten some
pretty extraordinary salts I've been able to create my own
business and become financially independent my business over the last
four or five years has generated over a million dollars
in revenue and that was all pretty much passive income
I was able to quit my job and work for
myself for the last five years which has been amazing
I've really worked on my nutrition I used to be
65 pounds overweight that handled I've really worked on my
fitness going to the gym working out hard weightlifting I
know it looks skinny now but I used to be
actually pretty good at weightlifting until I had other priorities
that I'm now focusing on what else food addiction getting
totally unhooked from food addiction relationships with women I was
so so so bad at attracting women keeping women finding
a girlfriend I had to work really really hard to
figure that stuff out so these are just like some
of the examples and the reason I'm saying this is
because you know I look around I have friends I
have other people that I know and I just don't
see them getting these kinds of results and the reason
that they're not getting them isn't really because I'm that
special it's simply that I think that I have this
personality characteristic that's unique that I don't really see in
other people what I see other people doing is I
see other people getting very easily offended at different perspectives
and different ideas and what happens is that they grow
up they you're open to certain environments certain culture certain
family then they go to college they get certain conditioning
and influences there and added colors again to work and
then they kind of just get stuck right by that
point it's like a freight train it's got so much
momentum that it's just like going and going going and
if you want to change this trajectory it's very difficult
and that person might be stuck in some sort of
way of thinking with his beliefs and his perspectives and
as kind of opinions about life and then that person
is very hard - very hard to develop I mean
how do you improve your life for me to improve
my life in all these different areas with business with
health and food with relationships with improving my own thinking
patterns all this stuff took incredible open mindedness because where
I start from when I do my development is I
start here and then I look up and I see
oh I need to go way up there and I
need to see it like the next level up but
see most people they're not willing to even see that
level their ego won't let them because to see this
other level you have to have a certain like foresight
you have to say wait a minute I could be
wrong here my beliefs could be limiting me in some
way I could be holding myself back I could be
ignorant in this situation what I could totally suck in
this field that I'm trying to master or develop right
you have to be able to be like brutally honest
with yourself and to me that was very important from
childhood like I I made like a really firm like
commitment that I would never ever be dishonest with myself
with myself right you cannot be dishonest with yourself because
if you can't be honest with yourself then how are
you gonna grow how are you gonna spot your own
faults see it's not gonna happen I'm almost like super
super honest with my own faults sometimes that backfires on
me but in the end I think it's really been
important for me to grow and to get my results
right you guys want results what I'm telling you if
you want results talking about all this stuff is nice
but if you're not willing to open your mind and
take a look at radically different perspectives from what is
in your life right now then you are going to
stay stuck I mean very radically different see I see
people getting easily offended all the time and to me
this is a both laughable it's it's funny but it's
also very sad it's funny to me because as I
think it's very shallow it's extremely egotistical to get offended
at anything there's no reason that you should be getting
offended at anything and and because for me like it's
very easy to see why that's happening and I'm gonna
take you through the mechanics of that in a minute
of what's actually going on there it's not what it
seems like but it's also sad to me because I
know that because that person gets so offended so easily
that they are avoiding exactly those things that are going
to promote their growth because what they're getting offended at
are the things that their ego doesn't want to admit
to them to itself so it's bullshitting yourself I see
people bullshitting themselves all the time and then actually what
they do is they project it back out onto other
people so you yourself and then what happens is that
you don't tell yourself that you're bullshitting what you have
to do then is that your mind has to go
through all these contortions bending over backwards to accuse other
people of all sorts of wrongdoing you can get angry
at people you can get depressed you can play the
victim you can post nasty comments you can say nasty
things you can sign petitions and you can start rallies
and revolutions and you can do all of that simply
to avoid looking at yourself being honest with yourself looking
within because it's so inconvenient for you it's so uncomfortable
well to me when I was when I was really
young just for whatever reasons I said that you know
what I'm never gonna myself at least not consciously I'm
gonna say very very vigilant to that and then it
served me extremely extremely well because what that means is
that I will find flaws within myself and it doesn't
matter how painful it is I don't care how much
it hurts my ego I'm willing to look inside you
need to be the same way if you're not this
way then your progress is gonna be very slow and
at some point you're gonna hit a ceiling you're just
gonna hit a ceiling because there's maybe certain things that
you're not willing to acknowledge within yourself and you're not
willing to take responsibility for very very important now actually
this idea of getting easily offended this is funny to
me and very interesting because I think that this is
actually a very powerful gauge of your personal development level
here's how it works this is like a law of
personal development and some of you might not believe it
but here's how it is is the degree to which
you get easily offended or offended at all is the
degree to which you're not well developed as a human
being so if you take this to its maximum conclusion
then a completely self developed human being if one even
exists but someone who is extremely well personally developed right
someone who really understands themselves that person will never get
offended at anything no offending will happen to him or
her I'm gonna tell you why that is to understand
that let's take a look at what are some of
the things that people easily get offended by well people
easily get offended by topics like religion and politics oh
man religion religion is huge people get so easily offended
when you badmouth their religion or questioned their religion or
say something that's heretical according to their scriptures or their
religious views right any other perspective they're not willing to
consider and in fact any other perspective they perceive as
being threatening to their faith that is hugely hugely crippling
to their life that shows complete closed mindedness so that's
that's everything that you need to be against if you're
trying to become self actualized and personally developed the next
is you know people get people get offended by things
like murder rape racism now these sound like very negative
things and I don't wanna come off as saying like
well these are nice things these are negative things and
I'm not in any way condoning them but it's one
thing that there are bad things it's another thing that
you get easily offended by them a lot of people
will get easily offended by it and what that actually
is is a defense mechanism because they're not acknowledging certain
things within themselves sex that's another one people get so
easily offended by sex I was just posting a video
about how to improve your sex life with a girl
how to make a girl squirt and I got a
lot of people posting offensive not offensive but comments that
they were offended and it was funny to me because
you could just see that someone's mine is closing closing
down closing down closing down it's like shutting down to
what's out there in the world how about criticism of
your work a lot of people get offended when someone
criticizes their work in any sort of way so as
anything negative or even just like giving a positive constructive
criticism so many people are bad at taking constructive criticism
for this reason their ego can't handle it how about
things like comments about how you look how you dress
someone tells you that they don't like your hair they
don't like your your shoes they don't like your jacket
or they think that you're overweight or they think they're
underweight or something like that a lot of people get
offended by that for obvious reasons you understand why that
happens I mean like I don't feel I don't feel
good when someone makes a negative remark about my physical
appearance either but then again I'm not completely personally developed
so I get offended at things but much less so
than most people and the reason is because I'm very
open minded I don't care if it hurts my ego
to me that's good see this is where most people
get it wrong they think that if it hurts their
ego that it's bad they don't even see it that
it's their ego that's really functioning here and that's what's
really happening is that the reason that you're getting easily
offended at any one of these things or any other
millions of other things is that your ego it has
a certain worldview right in your brain literally as you're
growing up you're constructing a worldview a model of how
you think the world is and works this includes many
of your beliefs many of your your preferences in life
maybe your many of your various like cherished cherished cultural
ideas all this stuff gets loved together it creates this
mental model now you're running a long life and you're
using this mental model to look at everything and this
is a highly distorted perspective on reality but let's say
that's the case and so you're just going through life
and everything's fine but then what happens is that you
come across something some fact out in the world that
disturbs your mental model it rubs it the wrong way
because your mental model can't cope with that fact it
doesn't fit there's a cognitive dissonance going on and so
when that happens there's really two choices you can either
admit that wait a minute my mental model could be
wrong how could I really mental model to adopt that
new that new fact that was presented or you could
do the opposite and you can say my mental model
is completely right that fact is wrong something is wrong
with that something is wrong with reality with the outer
world and so you point the finger out there this
is what 95% of people do is that they don't
have the intellectual honesty and rigor and open-mindedness to say
you know what I'm gonna take the responsibility for all
these various facts that are coming in and I'm always
willing to adopt mine to adapt my own mental model
to fit the new facts this is really kind of
a scientific perspective to living your life that's what science
is about science is about just taking what is and
working with it and then being comfortable admitting that it's
wrong and taking on new facts and assimilating new facts
and new facts and new facts and over time what
happens is that that builds and builds and builds until
finally you get a very very accurate like scary accurate
picture of reality through scientific laws and all the stuff
that we discover through the sciences now the opposite of
that really is religion where religion entrenches itself its dogmatic
it says no this is the way it is damn
the facts damn the facts that I matter what's out
there this is the way it is that's how you
get someone like Galileo almost getting burned mistake and living
the rest of his life in house arrest because the
because the church the Catholic Church didn't want didn't want
to admit that there was there's problems in their model
their mental model about how the universe and astrology and
and the planets are moving right that whole structure of
how the the cosmos works just didn't work for them
because Galileo's model was so radical from their model and
of course they don't want to change their model they
don't wanna admit that they're wrong so what do they
do they burn the guy at the stake or they
put them in house arrest you know there's if you're
student of history you see numerous examples this is actually
very scary and it's actually good to be a student
of history here because when you are a student of
history then you start to see what is going on
here and how closed mindedness has has really robbed humanity
of its great greatness and potential and this is due
this is happening not just on a global societal scale
but it's also happening within you personally because it all
all societies are constructed out of people so this is
happening because you are being closed-minded and this is very
very important to drive home here is that you have
to open your mind up because all that's happening is
that your mental model it wants to stay the way
it is there's kind of a biological natural impulse to
to stay there but the better approach to life is
to always be expanding and opening it up being willing
to take that pain to me it's not even a
pain anymore it's like a pleasure when I see a
new fact that I don't understand a new perspective that's
totally radical for me to me it's like oh Dan
that's like that's cool a new chance to go out
there and adopt my adapt my model to fit that
new fact whereas most people would be like no damn
that like that guy is stupid they would get angry
at him or curse them or insult him or just
say something negative and like criticize and judge see you
want to avoid that if you live that type of
life then you're gonna get stuck I mean how can
you not get stuck because you're cutting off facts from
your own mental model this creates an inaccurate mental model
and it means you have to go around and you
have to always constantly be protecting your model you have
to fight for it see a secure person a really
open-minded person doesn't need to feel like they need to
fight that's why someone can come and criticize it work
okay whatever and he goes on doing his work he
doesn't need to fight for it someone comes in and
tells him some new perspective on sex or politics or
religion that might be very radically different from what he
believes and he's like oh you know what yeah maybe
that's true maybe there's actually something there she doesn't get
offended even though it's very different someone comes and tells
him something negative about himself tells them that he's fat
or that he's he's wearing bad shoes or something like
that criticizes his style of dress the person's like yeah
okay maybe maybe so what right it's like so what
why do you need to be threatened and fighting all
the time see a dogmatic person is very easy to
see them dogmatic person will pull out the pitchfork as
soon as something comes up that threatens them someone says
something about them something says some sort of little truth
you know I leave comment little someone makes a little
side comment at you and it seems innocent but then
you recognize it there's like a really deep element of
truth to it and you get offended and then you
can get like bring out your pitchfork and defend yourself
see like that's that's an adversarial relationship with reality with
life instead of doing that why don't you just say
okay yeah maybe there's something there let me look inward
let me see because it might not be very comfortable
right in the moment but you know what if I
keep this process happening it's gonna be like a scientific
process running on myself I'm gonna get better and better
and better over time and this is what personal development
is is its growth its gradual growth so each little
offensive thing that happens to you that's actually an opportunity
for you to grow but you need to see that
if you're always defending yourself if you're finding that you
have to do this then what that really shows it
doesn't show that you're you're trying to really defend something
it doesn't show that you're a crusader see a lot
of times people will say well I'm a crusader for
my religion I defend my religion I need to defend
my Pope my political party I need to defend my
culture that's not really what's happening that's actually complete what's
happening is that you're defending your own mental weakness that's
all that's happening and then you're coming up with excuses
it's your ego you need to really see through that
whole illusion it's your ego that's there and it's like
it's like the puppet master pulling the strings and you're
just like the little puppet that's doing whatever the ego
is saying just so that the ego can feel a
little bit more comfortable and all that is showing is
that the ego is actually extremely fragile for you your
worldview is extremely fragile that means that any little thing
can come in there and disturb it but with a
very open-minded person with a very developed person that's not
the case they have a very robust mental model of
the world and one of the one of the key
features of that mental model that they have is that
they could be wrong always always always they admit that
they could be wrong they could be mistaken they could
be deluded they could be tricking themselves because they know
how tricky the mind is they know how powerful the
ego is they're not immune to the ego the ego
is working on them but they admit right they admit
that they could be wrong which is important because the
other type of person the close bond does have a
person will never do that and in fact what they'll
do is they'll come back at you and say well
what if you're wrong what if you're wrong let me
worry about whether I'm wrong see an open-minded person always
takes that burden and that responsibility on himself I am
constantly second-guessing my theories my models my understanding of reality
constantly never mind saying this is the way it is
and I've spent in an ordinate ridiculous crazy amount of
time building my models very methodically much more so than
other people so if I'm doing that and I'm still
doubtful about certain things how doubtful must most people be
who aren't spending hundreds thousands of hours researching this stuff
studying philosophy and science and religion and and personal development
they should be much much much more doubtful except they're
usually much much more dogmatic and certain that they're right
and of course all that is is that it's their
ego protecting the fragility of their system so this is
actually a very very good way to gauge someone's personal
development is just you know toss them a little toss
a little sarcasm a little comment try to rub them
a little a little bit the wrong way and see
how easy do they get angry how easy do they
get upset how easily do they get offended because if
they do you can quickly tell that they're not really
self developed at all their mental model is very very
fragile and you do not want to be that person
because that person is very limited in life and they're
going to run around along that track just automatically unconsciously
running along that track and it's gonna be very hard
for them to grow in all the areas in life
that they need to grow in order to become calm
and happy and successful and peaceful in life so the
conclusion here is that take responsibility for your own offenses
use them as vehicles to promote your own growth and
really really value open-mindedness if you are a student of
personal development and you want to go far in this
open-mindedness this is the key characteristic that you have to
develop and cultivate within yourself all right this is Leo
