hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about a very important
concept that I call radical open-mindedness I'm going to take
you through a live exercise to open up your mind
and show you how to break free of dogma right
off the bat I need to give you a warning
this is an advanced episode for very open-minded people and
it's going to be extremely threatening to you to most
of you but nevertheless let's begin I want you to
think about the following analogy think about this you are
an adult and you got mercury fillings in your teeth
when you were younger and now you've been living with
these mercury fillings for the last 30 or 40 years
and what you now discover and what they've discovered is
that mercury fillings actually leak mercury into your body and
slowly poison and toxify your body so you discover this
and now you're in kind of a bind because now
what you do need to go to the dentist you
need to go through a expensive troublesome very serious procedure
where they have to go and rip out all the
fillings very carefully and delicately and expertly from your teeth
to get out the mercury without getting the mercury leaking
even more into your tissues and this is a scary
procedure to go through it's a big decision to make
and if you get all these toxins out of your
teeth put in ordinary fillings ceramic fillings and finally you
can be healthy and get rid of all the toxicity
that's in your body so this is actually something that
happens to people nowadays if you were unfortunate enough to
get mercury fillings this is something that you might want
to consider but the analogy here is that the same
thing has actually happened with your mind but you don't
really know it and I'm going to make you aware
of it right now see what's happened is that just
like mercury fillings society without you knowing it as you
were growing up has clogged up your mind with a
bond with a bunch of beliefs dogmas and theories about
how the world works which are now severely limiting what's
possible for you in your personal development it's limiting you
in your career it's limiting you in your relationships it's
limiting you in what you think you can accomplish in
life and most importantly is that it's limiting you from
doing the most advanced personal development work that's possible which
is spiritual work and what I call enlightenment work here's
something you got to really understand is a degree the
degree to which your mind is open is the degree
to which you have true freedom in your life and
most people's minds are not open you don't even have
a clue yet what true open mindedness really means and
this is another example here common theme that I'm outlining
in much of my material of a counterintuitive move that
needs to be made in personal development what's the counter
to to move here well what most people try to
do is they try to no they go through life
acquiring knowing or knowledge and they try to become more
and more certain as they get older the counterintuitive move
and if you really want to advance far in your
development you have to make this move is to let
go of knowing and to get into a true state
of not knowing profound not knowing this is a very
special state that almost nobody talks about that almost nobody
knows about and it's extremely counterintuitive you might wonder well
Leo why would I want to not know not knowing
seems to be like a weak state knowing is the
strong state I want to convince you and open up
your mind to the possibility that actually not knowing is
an extremely powerful state and we're going to do that
here with a really in-depth live exercise the rare thing
is to find people who truly don't know because what
happens that people think they know but actually they don't
know and what happens that they fool themselves with a
false certainty religious people do this rational people do this
scientifically minded people do this everybody almost everybody does this
you need to really work deep on yourself you need
to go in there and extract all the [ __
] from your mind just like those mercury fillings before
you can truly get into a state of not knowing
a state of true not knowing is extremely rare and
it's very difficult and also very threatening and scary to
stay in that state for some very profound reasons which
perhaps I'll get into as we go on I had
a really profound experience this summer where I really tapped
into a state of true not knowing and there's a
big difference between not knowing simply as a language game
like paying lip service and just saying oh yeah I
don't know there's like oh yeah I'm kind of skeptical
yeah I I leave some room open to my mind
for some new possibility that's fake not knowing then there's
actual not knowing a state that you've probably never experienced
in your life but you actually sit there and you
really don't know things that most people think they know
for example you don't know what reality is you don't
know what existence is you don't know how the world
works you don't know what life is you don't know
what other person is you question who you are to
such a profound level like what happened with me is
that your sense of identity actually dissolves and you can
have profile own mystical transforming experiences enlightenment experiences when you
get into this deep state of not knowing it's a
very powerful and very profound state so you might wonder
why do we why do we want to open ourselves
up wealth for one thing this is very very helpful
if you're trying to do any kind of enlightenment work
if you're doing any self inquiry work true not knowing
is extremely powerful also with this radical open-mindedness it frees
you up frees up your mind from concepts beliefs and
dogmas that really hold you back in life hold you
back from going out there and cheating your full potential
finding your authentic self in life pursuing your life purpose
and understanding reality at very profound levels very very profound
levels and lastly it really opens you up to some
very advanced work very advanced work and as I go
on with actualize that we're going to release more content
I'll be covering much more advanced topics and to even
listen and even comprehend some of the topics I'll be
talking about you're going to need a radical degree of
open-mindedness so I wanted what I want to do here
is I want to take you through a guided visualization
it's going to be a bit long it's going to
be maybe about 20 minutes long or so so what
I want you to do is I want you to
prepare yourself get involved here actually take this concept and
this material very seriously because it's very serious this is
a very very important topic it seems kind of esoteric
and abstract and philosophical it's very practical you're going to
start to see the benefits of this after you go
through it so go ahead and take a comfortable seat
sit with your back up straight put yourself into a
comfortable relaxed position and we're going to get going what
I want you to do is I want you to
close your eyes ideally throughout the next 20 minutes or
so as I take you through point by point the
various things I'm going to want you to think about
and imagine and I want you to really get into
it and take the things I say seriously they will
have a transformative effect on your mind if you do
alright so go ahead and get ready and close your
eyes what I'd like you to do is to get
first of all into the present moment and the way
that you can do that is by getting in touch
with the direct experiences that are happening to you right
now get in touch with what you're seeing with your
eyes closed get in touch with the feelings and sensations
in your body and with the sounds that you're hearing
including the sound of my voice get very present to
what's going on in your body right now take a
nice deep breath in and as you exhale relax your
body and get even more into the present moment and
focus your attention on the sound of my voice good
keep breathing at a relaxed pace and open your mind
to some of these new possibilities that I'm going to
present to you the first thing I want you to
do is to acknowledge to yourself then 99% of your
knowledge and all the things you think you know about
life and how the world works and is structured is
second-hand knowledge this means that this is knowledge that you
did not directly experience in any way and that you
take completely on faith from other human beings through word
of mouth and what's called hearsay in a court of
law we would call this hearsay evidence what are some
examples let me list and I want you to really
acknowledge to yourself as I run down this list that
you take these things completely on faith first is that
the earth is round you actually have no direct experience
of this you take this completely on faith that viruses
cause diseases the big bang theory that matter is composed
of subatomic particles evolution that organisms evolved and species morph
this is something you take on here say that the
earth is four billion years old whatever you might think
that Jesus said or the Buddha said or Mohammad said
or any other prophet or sage has said all of
this you don't know that they actually said you don't
actually know what these individuals said you don't even know
if these individuals truly existed acknowledge that to yourself right
now acknowledge to yourself that you don't know if you
are your parents biological child unless you've done DNA testing
you don't actually know this acknowledge yourself that you may
not be related to your brother or sister you don't
really know if you're related to them in fact interesting
experience about a year ago where after 30 years my
mom finally told and she called me up on the
phone one day and she just said oh you know
by the way your brother your brother is actually only
your half-brother blew my mind blew my mind it was
kind of a Lika Luke I am your father type
of moment completely blew my mind I had no idea
that he was it my full brother so acknowledge yourself
these possibilities and many more but this is the list
that we'll start with good keep present and keep your
eyes closed and we'll keep going there's a lot of
other stuff I want you to acknowledge and to ponder
acknowledge that you picture reality using models which you yourself
actually know are not correct what do I mean by
this here's some examples in chemistry we think of molecules
as the ball and stick models that were shown but
this is not what chemicals actually are but you when
you actually think about chemicals you think of them as
ball and stick models most likely this is a model
of reality which is actually false and we know it's
false but nevertheless this is how you view reality here's
another example you think of atoms as orbiting tiny particles
even though you probably know that atoms are not actually
particles their probability fields yet you still think of them
as tiny little round particles another example is that planets
you think of planets as being perfectly round when you
think of the earth or you think about the moon
or you think about Mars you think of them as
spheres but in fact a planet is not a sphere
it's it optical and even then it's not a perfect
ellipse because it's got mountains it's got terrain so when
you think of it as a sphere that's a that's
an approximation a model that you have but you know
if you look closely that this model is not accurate
here's another example you think of time is absolute even
though we know better we know the time is relativistic
when you look out at the sunset you think of
the Sun as setting and orbiting the Earth you don't
think of the earth as rotating you think of the
Sun as moving through the sky you think that the
Sun is orbiting the Earth even though you know this
isn't true yet this shapes your world view this shapes
how you actually see reality when you sit in a
chair and you're perfectly motionless you actually believe for a
moment that your body is in perfect stillness and is
motionless but in fact we know better we know that
the body is attached to the planet and the planet
is rotating at some ridiculously high speed thousands of miles
per second and that the solar system is rotating even
faster in the galaxy so your body even though it
seems motionless and you think you're sitting still is actually
moving at perhaps hundreds of thousands of miles per second
yet you actually sit there believing that you're motionless when
an object follows to the floor you think of the
object is falling down even though we know that there
is no such thing as up and down the object
is falling towards the center of the earth it's not
falling down but you don't think of it that way
if we put you in a room and we somehow
positioned you upside down in that room you would think
that you're upside down in a room and you would
want to become right-side up this would be a very
real phenomenon for you'd really want to be on right-side
up even though you know if you're very careful that
there's no such thing as right side up or upside
down these are just local coordinate conventions that we've adopted
on earth in space there's no such thing when you
look out into the night sky and you marvel at
the Stars you think the Stars actually exist like they're
physical objects out right now in space somewhere even though
you know better if you're very careful you know that
it takes millions of years for light to travel these
vast distances between the earth and the Stars you're looking
at in fact it takes so long that most of
those stars that you're looking at don't even exist anymore
they've exploded there's nothing there and yet you believe when
you're looking up in the night sky that they're actually
stars out there beyond which you actually think that the
stars or stars would in fact when you look at
a star very likely what you're looking at is you're
looking at a galaxy and not a star you think
of it as a star but actually it's a galaxy
that contains millions or billions of other stars but you
don't acknowledge this to yourself when you're looking at the
night sky even though you know better so what I
want you to acknowledge here is that you have a
model of reality even if you think it's very scientific
and accurate and that this model is complete fiction as
these examples show now what I'd like you to do
is I'd like you to recall how many times people
have been wrong throughout history if you're a student of
history there's a long track record of ridiculous errors that
humanity is made there's a trend here here's some basic
examples the earth is flat just a few thousand years
ago most people believed that this was the case that
the earth is at the center of the universe five
hundred years ago most people believe that this is the
case the witch trials that were held in Europe and
in North America just hundreds of years ago and how
silly and misguided they look now these wish trials that
blacks are less intelligent than whites how silly does that
look now when just two or three hundred years ago
that was considered common knowledge Euclidean versus non Euclidean geometry
if you've studied this topic then you know how long
scientists were about some principles in Euclidean geometry and the
discovery of non Euclidean geometry time is being absolute just
four hundred years ago we actually believe that time was
absolute Newton believed it now we know that's not the
case just several hundred years ago scientists actually believed that
moving faster than 50 miles per hour would make the
human body explode this was during the railroad era when
railroad trains were starting to go faster and faster people
were afraid to get on those fast railroads because they
didn't know if the human body could handle that kind
of velocity seems laughable now but this was a real
concern for scientists back then just a couple hundred years
ago people believed that lifting over 500 pounds for human
beings impossible they believed that it was a biological limit
of the human body that he could not lift over
500 pounds until that record was broken just a hundred
years ago it was believed that communication through air wireless
communication is impossible in fact the inventor of wireless communication
the radio Marconi he was nearly put into an asain
asylum when he announced that he discovered radio wave communication
just 100 years ago it was believed that flight was
impossible just 20 or 30 years ago it was believed
that human that computers would never be able to beat
man at playing chess just sixty or seventy years ago
it was believed that the four-minute mile was impossible and
just ten years ago it was believed by many people
that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction so I want
you to think about this is just a tiny list
the tip of the iceberg I want you to really
acknowledge that humanity has made many blunders in its knowledge
of how reality works and what truth is this trend
I want you to use this trend to open your
mind at the possibility that there could still be other
things right now that you hold is true which are
actually false that you could be very certain about something
but nevertheless it can be false and you might never
know about it open your mind to that possibility good
stay with me let's keep going keep your eyes closed
stay in the present moment I want you to acknowledge
now that the culture you grew up in has imprinted
your mind with norms and values and beliefs of which
you are unconscious imagine for example if you were born
in the Middle East what kind of values and beliefs
would you have how would you look at the world
differently how would your religious views be different how would
your political views be different how would your views about
women be different or homosexuality or drinking alcohol really imagine
that and then imagine if you were born in an
African tribe if you grew up in an African tribe
with no technology no modern schooling if you live in
a tribe of 50 people out in the wilderness in
a hut and you hunted gazelles and lions with spears
and bows and arrows and you were married to your
cousin or to your sister imagine how different your values
would be imagine how different your knowledge of the world
would be how different your world view would be if
you were raised in an African tribe now imagine that
you were born in North Korea and you've never been
outside of North Korea in your entire life imagine what
you would believe about government how your views of history
and philosophy and science and religion would be different imagine
how your world view would be different imagine how radically
different your values and your lifestyle would be now imagine
if you were born 10,000 years ago in Aboriginal Australia
you are an Aborigine living in Australia ten thousand years
ago before the advent of Agriculture think about what you
would believe about reality how was your worldview be different
than it is right now how would your values be
different how would your political leanings be different how would
your religion be different what would you think life in
the world actually are if you were an Aboriginal living
in Australia ten thousand years ago how would you relate
differently to people and now imagine and I'm just going
to assume here that you're a westerner and perhaps you
have Christian leanings now imagine if you're a Christian now
let's say imagine what it would be like to be
a Christian in Europe 1,000 years ago think about how
radically different your beliefs and values would be even though
you're still a Christian and you're still let's say a
white European if you are one now how radically different
it would be if you lived a thousand years ago
in Christian Europe in the medieval times in the Middle
Ages Christianity 1000 years ago was completely different than Christianity
today completely different think about how differently you would approach
your family politics abortion homosexuality your worldview the Bible other
religions all of these attitudes would be completely different 1000
years ago even if you were still a Christian good
what I really want you to acknowledge right now from
pondering some of these examples is that the culture and
society and time in which you grow up shapes your
values and worldview in profoundly radical ways and you are
generally completely unconscious of this influence in your life you
do not normally acknowledge it but acknowledge it now and
especially acknowledge that you have no say and no control
over this factor what culture what country you grew up
in what political system you're growing up under what family
structure you're growing up under what time in human civilization
you're alive in these are all factors outside of your
control and yet they profoundly influence what you believe and
how you see the world your entire understanding of life
and reality is wedded to your culture good now I
want to take you through some other considerations I'm going
to pose some questions to you and I really want
you to think deeply about these questions stay in the
present moment keep your eyes closed and really open your
mind to some of these possibilities firstly think about this
is it likely that mainstream culture society and science might
be biased might they have a political bias a financial
bias and ego bias and just flat-out ignorant or groupthink
bias is that likely answer to yourself in your own
mind yes or no and also consider the ramifications of
your answer next consider the following have you ever clung
to a position in an argument or a debate even
after you realized that you were wrong think of a
time in your life where this happened to you next
have you ever been completely certain about something but later
you found out that you were wrong like you were
really sure it was true but then a few years
later you found out you were wrong you were so
certain it couldn't be wrong at all but still you
found out you were wrong think of a time when
that habit in your life you can probably think of
one next think about this is it likely that out
of all the beliefs that you hold some of them
might be wrong answer yes or no in your own
mind next have you ever used logic to reason out
a sound conclusion only later to discover that it was
nevertheless wrong due to a false premise next is it
likely that other individuals including yourself might hold an egotistical
self agenda which skews how you see and interpret the
world is that likely yes or no have you noticed
before your own egotistical self agenda in dealing with people
and in acquiring knowledge next I want you to bring
to mind someone you've known personally who was completely certain
about something but it was obvious to you that this
person was wrong in their belief and now can you
see that you yourself might also easily fall into this
exact same trap acknowledge to yourself next that no matter
how certain you feel that you are about a opinion
or a belief you hold you could be in error
and think about the ramifications of that next acknowledge that
the mind has a tendency to deceive and to lie
to itself are you aware of this are you aware
that you deceive yourself and that you would lie to
yourself acknowledge that you do also acknowledge to yourself that
valid logic by itself proves nothing because a valid conclusion
requires valid premises how often do you tout valid logic
as justifying your beliefs are you acknowledging that your logic
could be valid but your premises could still be invalid
therefore your conclusion is invalid and now we're going to
go really deep what all this is leading up to
I want you to acknowledge that you can be mistaken
about the most fundamental aspects of reality you can be
mistaken about time-space existence cosmology religion God and even who
you think you are as a identity all these most
fundamental things that we think we know about reality that
all these and especially these we can be wrong about
open your mind to that possibility like really open your
mind to that possibility also acknowledged that there's no reason
why the human intuition should be correct about things like
time-space existence cosmology God religion or even your notion of
self that our intuition to be completely wrong about these
things because our intuition wasn't designed to understand these things
acknowledge that is a real possibility acknowledge that the biggest
likelihood for self-deception occurs when you ignore the possibility of
self-deception occurring really think about this the biggest likelihood for
self-deception occurs when you ignore the possibility of self-deception occurring
most people ignore the possibility that they are deceiving themselves
also acknowledged that when you don't know something you don't
know that you don't know it that's a bit mind-boggling
let me say it again really think this through when
you don't know something you don't know that you don't
know it which means that you can be totally absolutely
certain that you know it and still be wrong and
lastly for those of you who have done self inquiry
work or what I call enlightenment work if you try
to look into the true nature of your own being
and who you are if you've done that kind of
work then I want you to acknowledge right now that
you haven't been able to locate yourself and that you
don't actually know who or what you are as an
entity or as a being good so those are all
the things I wanted you to ponder what should have
happened as you were entertaining all these possibilities is that
your mind should have been opening and a state of
not-knowing should have been dawning on you and all your
beliefs about how the world is and what is right
and what is wrong and what is God and what
is religion what's right and what's not right who's deluded
who's deceived and so on and so forth all of
these should have been shattered because the fact is that
you don't know these things yet you go around pretending
like you do and it doesn't matter whether you're religious
or spiritual or scientific or logical or philosophical or intellectual
it doesn't matter you do this you deceive yourself with
a false sense of certainty so what I want you
to do here is I want you to really acknowledge
the deep ramifications of what we've gone through here this
is some very deep stuff we're talking about we're basically
questioning and undermining your entire worldview and all of your
beliefs about life what I'm saying here is not light
stuff I'm saying some heavy stuff here I'm basically trying
to get you to agree with me that you could
be deeply mistaken about all of this and also that
you lied to yourself about the degree of certainty you
have about this stuff what's true what's really true of
yourself honest is that you're not really certain about these
things but you pretend like you are and the more
uncertain you are the more you're going to fight and
defeat and your position and the more you're going to
cling to your dogmas okay go ahead and open your
eyes good welcome back so that's it those are some
of the things I wanted you to think about now
let me conclude by just saying some last words about
what you should do with some of these ideas that
presented to you here what do you do about this
how do you actually use this radical open-mindedness and how
do you take it further because we've just only shown
you the tip of the iceberg here the first thing
I want you to do is I want you to
actually take time to deeply ponder all of these things
that I told you re watch this episode over and
over and over again and really think about each one
of these points you could spend dozens of hours thinking
about every single point I went through here and you
would not even get one percent of how deep some
of these ideas are you could spend years thinking about
all this stuff and it would be very valuable for
you to do so so start doing that think about
it on your way to work in the car think
about it when you're in your shower instead of thinking
about all the petty [ __ ] you usually think
about really ponder these points soak in the ramifications of
some of these ideas secondly I want you to notice
yourself trying to convince others of your beliefs and your
dogmas notice when you do it become conscious of this
because you do do it you do it at work
you do with your friends you do it at the
dinner table you do it with politics you do it
with religion you're doing with everything just notice that you
do that I also want you to notice that being
in a state of not knowing or having no beliefs
whatsoever is empowering it's very deeply powering it doesn't seem
like it's going to be empowering when you first start
but when you actually get them you get a taste
of true not knowing it's very empowering and very liberating
not having to replace your old belief with any other
beliefs I want you to notice that true not knowing
is not another belief it's not another position it's not
another world view I'm not trying to get you to
become a nihilist here or to become a cynic or
a chronic skeptic those are all again positions and world
views instead what I'm asking you to do is to
basically hold no beliefs and not try to fill that
void with any new beliefs or perspectives you're actually just
sitting there totally open to any possibility without a preference
for one possibility versus another without trying to make it
come out this way or that way without having it
be any way at all you're basically completely grounded in
the present moment and the last thing I want you
to start doing is I want you to start wondering
why you cling to beliefs why do you cling to
your beliefs so much what's going on there why are
you so neurotic in the way that you defend your
beliefs why are you so resistant to some of the
things that I've introduced to you why do you have
emotional reactions when people question your beliefs can you notice
that it's neurotic and unhealthy psychologically unhealthy there's something very
deep going on there I want you to just become
curious about that like hmm what's going on there maybe
I should investigate further and get to the bottom of
it at one point my life okay good I hope
you've enjoyed this taste of radical open-mindedness keep going with
it what's going to have is that your mind is
going to expand and open and then it's going to
close back down then you're gonna have to push and
push and push to open it up again and then
again it's going to close back down and you have
to push again to open it up and this will
be a UH something that you have to keep working
on over and over and over and over again in
your life to get to a state where you can
entertain some of the most deep personal development work principles
that I want to share with you in the future
so I hope you take this stuff seriously this is
not just idle philosophy this will have a profound transformational
effect on your life and if you keep going with
it what I'll do is it'll lead to complete freedom
and liberation this is this is an amazing thing liberation
freedom of your mind in a jailbreak your mind you
can experience profound mystical States and you can discover the
truth of your own being other people's being and the
nature of existence itself this truth is not going to
be another belief or another position it's going to be
something else totally entirely different so keep your mind open
for that and stay tuned for more all right this
