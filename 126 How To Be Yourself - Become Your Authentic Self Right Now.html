            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/w1JzhhDMcpw' target='_blank'>How To Be Yourself - Become Your Authentic Self Right Now</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Struggling with personal authenticity</b>: Leo Gura explains his own struggle with being his true self and not being overly concerned about others' opinions. Illustrating this with a metaphor of people burying their authentic self under layers of negative beliefs and social conditioning, which stifles their true personality and ability to connect deeply with others.
</li><li><b>Challenges in achieving authenticity</b>: He states that the fear of others' viewpoints and a mental image of oneself from external perspectives often hold people back from being their genuine selves. Despite some advantages of heightened self-awareness, it may also inhibit free self-expression.
</li><li><b>Over-identification with empathy</b>: Leo identifies an issue of being overly empathetic and too concerned about others' feelings, causing one to compromise their authenticity. However, striking a balance in empathy is highlighted as crucial; he encourages viewers to shift the scale slightly towards 'less caring' without crossing into insensitivity.
</li><li><b>Seeking external validation</b>: The drive for approval is identified as a significant factor in people losing their authenticity. While searching for validation isn't wrong, psychologically depending on it is problematic. Approval is equated to a metaphorical 'drug', which one might compromise themselves to obtain.
</li><li><b>Transitioning towards authenticity</b>: Leo argues that true happiness requires individuals to stop seeking external validation, overcome their fear of judgment, and accept the consequences of being their true selves. The underlying theory is that fulfilling lives and successful relationships stem from expressing ones true self.
</li><li><b>Importance of Being Authentic</b>: Leo asserts the need to prioritize personal fulfilment and self-expression by reducing the influence of people's opinions. Despite potential negative outcomes like losing relationships or jobs, he maintains that it's worth taking on these costs to achieve a richer sense of self and personal happiness.
</li><li><b>Dependence on External Approval and Validation</b>: Leo Gura explains that people tend to lean on external validation such as approval, love, assistance, and tangible things like money and sex. These become crutches and are often seen as necessary and valuable, creating a sense of obligation or indebtedness. However, the dependence on these factors can inhibit personal growth and authenticity.
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding of Happiness and Fulfillment</b>: Gura emphasizes that the pursuit of these external factors is a fundamental misunderstanding of happiness and fulfillment. People are often attracted to the temporary excitement these factors provide, but they do not result in long-lasting happiness or inner fulfillment. Gura refers to a separate video where he delves deeper into the true meaning of happiness.
</li><li><b>Inauthenticity and Self-Sacrifice</b>: Gura highlights that people sometimes act in ways that are not true to themselves in order to gain a positive reaction from others. This pretension, according to Gura, is akin to "whoring oneself out". By suppressing their authentic reactions, they show a lack of assertiveness and confidence, sacrificing personal values and even their sense of self.
</li><li><b>Example of Inauthenticity</b>: Gura uses a simple example of someone cutting in line at a Starbucks and a person's reluctance to confront them for fear of being seen as rude or causing a disturbance. Even such small incidences can reveal a person's tendency to suppress authentic reactions out of concern for the opinions of others.
</li><li><b>Costs of Selling Out One's Soul</b>: Gura asserts that individuals often overlook the ultimate costs of this continuous suppression of their authentic selves. They are constantly selling their souls for superficial rewards, giving up the potential fulfillment that comes with being authentic. The biggest irony, he argues, is that these rewards will never lead to true fulfillment, as the source of true happiness lies within an individual, not in external factors.
</li><li><b>Solution to Inauthentic Behavior</b>: Gura suggests the solution to inauthentic behavior is accepting the costs of being oneself. He encourages individuals to realize the futility of seeking fulfilment from external sources, and to instead place value on authenticity and inner happiness.
</li><li><b>Costs of Being Authentic</b>: There are real-world consequences and costs to being true to oneself, such as potential loss of relationships or jobs. Historical examples demonstrate how leading with authenticity can lead to harsh outcomes. Despite these challenges, accepting these potential costs is vital to personal fulfillment and self-expression 
</li><li><b>Benefits of Being Authentic</b>: Emphasizing that not everybody pleases everyone, Leo Gura suggests that the pathway to success and fulfillment is through authenticity. Although being yourself may lead to changes in the societal standings, the magnetic attraction one emanates by being true can attract better-suited company or circumstances. 
</li><li><b>Addressing Fears and Barriers to Authenticity</b>: Some societal debts may make authenticity appear too costly. Fears may range from jeopardizing careers to endangering relationships. Despite all these potential challenges and fears, Leo asserts that self-expression and fulfillment should be prioritized over superficial things.
</li><li><b>Practical Advice for Transitioning to Authenticity</b>: Leo Gura suggests conducting a personal audit by listing out life areas where practicing authenticity may lead to complications. He asks viewers to question whether they are okay with these costs and encourages them to choose authenticity despite the potential challenges.
</li><li><b>Observation as a Tool to Authenticity</b>: Encouraging self-observation without judgment, Leo suggests taking note of instances where one makes compromises on authenticity. Being aware of one's actions and conscious about reacting in a compromised way helps in the process of becoming authentic.
</li><li><b>Advertising Actualized.org</b>: Leo Gura highlights Actualized.orgs offerings designed to assist individuals in mastering their psychology for desired life results. He proposes understanding the inner working of the mind is essential for self-improvement, and promotes the sites valuable content, exclusive bonuses, and potential win of two hours of free coaching each month.
