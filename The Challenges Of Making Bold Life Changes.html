hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm gonna Mews a little bit about the challenges
of making bold life changes it's 2016 it's the new
year and bold changes are brewing for actualize org and
for me personally and hopefully for you as well in
your life the new year I don't know about you
but the new year for me always makes me aware
of how little time I have left in my life
a little time I have left to accomplish the things
I want to accomplish and especially I've been thinking about
that this year because I've been sick you can probably
hear me have a pretty scratchy throat and I'm gonna
try to pull it through here this why also the
videos a little bit late this is because I had
a pretty bad fever and a cold last week so
I've been trying to fight through that I'm gonna work
through it here but because I was sick and I
was really thinking about like life and death and what
I want to accomplish what do I have left to
accomplish in the world and one of the things that
I want to do kind of one of my goals
with actualize that or is to make personal development more
real to show you more behind the scenes of how
I do personal development to make it more personal because
I think that a lot of personal development irreal is
actually very generic and it's almost like industrial factory-farmed personal
development and one of the ways I want to do
that is to show more vulnerability as well and share
more of my issues like the [ __ ] that
I deal with so that then you can see like
oh so he's dealing with this way and then all
I can maybe apply it in my life this way
it makes it more personal so what I want to
do in that vein is I want to discuss a
problem of my own that I'm having and you listen
and you will learn from this problem and you'll draw
some lessons so important insights for yourself so the problem
is something along the lines of this there's going to
be a time in your personal development career so to
speak where you will Intuit a need for a major
realignment in your life you'll see that you've been going
down a certain track and everything's been good and it's
been working but then now you see like a new
horizons open up for you new horizon opens up and
usually the way it comes to you it comes to
kind like a fear in your mind it goes like
this is like oh [ __ ] my current paradigm
and way of doing things will not be enough to
take me as far as I want to go it
will not take me far enough I need to change
my paradigm but you've been running this paradigm for years
and you're comfortable this paradigm you really like this paradigm
it's been working for you and usually when this happens
you're at the height at the peak of this paradigm
you've been using this paradigm ik a tool and so
you're really afraid to let it go what do I
mean by a major realignment of your life well imagine
making a deep structural change to your life I don't
mean just like a habit changing a habit or installing
a new habit or making some new friends or picking
up a new hobby you don't mean this kind of
stuff or getting a new job I mean something deeper
this is like what a real change happens for example
imagine the following you started your own business and now
what you're gonna do is you're going to quit your
business and you're going to move to Japan you're going
to become a monk just pause for a second actually
contemplate making a change of that magnitude in your own
life this is just an example I don't mean that
this is the exact change you're going to make but
find a change that would be of equivalent magnitude that
you could make in your life what would that actually
be interest imagine just for a few seconds just contemplate
the possibility of actually doing it pulling the trigger on
that not just in theory but I mean like actually
doing it tomorrow that's what I mean by making a
deep structural change in your life these kind of turning
points as I call them they will come up for
you and I'm noticing that a turning point like that
is coming up for me what I've noticed about these
turning points because I've had multiple of them in my
career and in my life this isn't the first one
is that they're firstly a really positive sign because they're
a real sign of growth it's a real opportunity for
you to grow but then of course the other thing
that I noticed about them is they're very scary and
if you've had some of these you know how scary
they are and if you've done this little imagination exercise
where you really contemplate something like quitting your business and
moving to Japan to become a monk and you really
consider that seriously that's like man that that requires something
that I don't have in me just now I don't
know if my character is strong enough for that it's
a real test of character so anyways that's kind of
the prelude but the thing that I'm talking about for
myself my kind of challenge and dilemma is the following
I've been thinking about a lot of the material that
I've discussed in my videos the last couple of years
what I call self-improvement advice and material and I just
kind of been thinking about how much of it do
I really know because I've been reading lots of books
I've known lots of seminars and workshops and this and
that and of course practicing it also I'm under I'm
not just doing theory I'm also practicing it but just
like if you watch enough of my material you you
give me a guess what would you think I know
how much do you think I know of this material
in the self-help field what would you say like 80%
50% 20% 10% what would you think so I was
thinking about this and kind of like in my own
estimation what I feel like I know really know is
less than 1% and that gives me a deep pause
because what I'm realizing as I study more and more
self-improvement material and I try to actually master it not
just know it intellectually but actually mastered in my life
I realize that my mastery of this material is inadequate
like really inadequate not for you not for teaching you
not for talking about it but just personally for me
because what I'm really after is like truth and real
self mastery not just self mastery in words not just
pretty sayings not just some techniques and a little meditation
habit here and something there but like real true deep
self mastery and when I see people who have that
kind of self mastery these are people who are really
hardcore people these are not your ordinary self-help guys these
are not your ordinary Tony Robbins and self-help gurus they're
not they're really hardcore guys who have dedicated their whole
lives to this path so uh the dilemma for me
is choosing now between achievement on the one hand and
truth and self mastery on the other and for the
last three years or so I've really been working on
the success of actualize that work my own personal success
and success in helping you guys and to me that
was kind of about truth but it was a lot
about achievement it was mostly about success and achievement and
that's success after about three years of hard work it's
been one I can say it's been one so I've
kind of exceeded my original expectations in my original wildest
dreams actually and that's been real good it's been real
good I've been really pleased with that but the problem
is of course that you always want more and the
problem with success is that whatever you're getting success there's
always like more success on the horizon that comes up
and more opportunities that come up and in fact one
of the challenges I'm facing now is like there's so
many opportunities I get easily distracted by all the opportunities
I have to say no a lot most opportunities I
have to say no to and success is kind of
like luring me for more and more and more and
this is taking me away from really the deep self
mastery work the inner work that I got to do
and so on the one hand success is kind of
luring the other hand truth and self mastery is luring
me imagine that someone came in to your room and
plot the giant suitcase on your desk and opened it
it was filled with millions of dollars and you look
at that person you say no no thank you and
you turn your back on that person and you just
go back to meditating or you go back to writing
in your journal or you go back to reading your
book or whatever else you were doing that's kind of
like what it feels like for me at this point
this is kind of what I've been thinking about over
the last week as I was in a in a
delirium of fever and then this nasty cold that I've
been fighting through because I have a lot of ideas
for how to expand actualize out of work but what
I'm recognizing in house is how sneaky of a distraction
this is because each new expansion that I plan each
new project each new endeavor each new product or each
new course or whatever even though I really believe in
these products and courses and so forth I think they're
really necessary and important they'll have a lot of people
I also see that really they're a distraction in a
sense from me doing the really deep work that I
got to be doing and my inner wisdom my inner
compass knows this isn't right and that the proper focus
for me is on self transcendence on enlightenment on truth
and on self mastery to really master this material on
a very deep level and if the teach from that
point from from that position that would be the ideal
the problem with this of course is that it requires
a withdrawal it requires a saying no to achievement ah
no to success sacrificing the money and so forth and
and that's real difficult because success and achievement has kind
of been my bread and butter for the last I
don't know what six seven years or so that's kind
of like what I've been doing what I've been pursuing
makes sense it's comfortable I'm good at it's easy right
it's not that easy but I mean like it's something
that I know how to do and especially when you
start to get good at something's like well you want
to keep doing it you don't want to change and
kind of go back to to ground zero start from
scratch it's kind of painful seems like a step backwards
and this is where the paradigm shift is required because
what I'm seeing is that my bread and butter and
the stuff that I'm good at and this achievement stuff
it won't ultimately get me to where I want to
go and then if I continue down this course for
long enough I'm gonna regret this decision that I've made
in my life and my I keeps going towards the
greater vision and the greater vision you know I was
really inspired this year when I read Gandhi's autobiography really
inspired by how Gandhi lived his life and what inspired
me really about him is the integrity with which he
lived his life like he was a leader who led
from the very front not from the back but from
the very front which is a very rare thing it's
amazing how rare such a quality is and I'm thinking
about how do I take my life and I engineered
in such a way where it reflects that kind of
way of life it's a whole lifestyle like you have
to commit yourself to this this is not something you
do on a whim and this is not something you
can really turn your back on and this is not
something you can turn on one day then turn off
the next day when it's not convenient for you like
Gandhi's whole life you should read his autobiography it's incredible
it's a little dry at first so slow to start
but if you read it in its entirety it'll blow
you away with what this man did this is not
fiction he actually did this he dedicated his entire life
to public service incredible and the way in which he
did it is even more incredible so I won't go
into all those details maybe another episode but but I
was really inspired by this and I'm trying to think
of how I can put my life into that kind
of mold and make actualize that work something reflecting a
bit of that and I'm not talking about like influencing
hundreds of millions of people like it's not about mass
scale it's about the quality with which you do it
it's about the integrity with which you do it it's
also about the kind of like the commitment that's there
and I don't mean that I want to do exactly
what Gandhi did I'm just using that kind of as
an analogy for what I want to do in my
own way and for me what that means is turning
inwards and finding the truth and finding the self mastery
that I'm looking for and then perhaps impacting others with
that wisdom and maybe not I don't know see that's
one of the fears I have and one of the
risks that I run so there's a whole list of
risks and fears that I have what about regret will
I regret this kind of decision what if I miss
my chance of success what if I regret the fact
that I didn't grab success when I had it in
my hands because success can be a point that's difficult
to get to you know it's a lot of times
you spend three or five years really struggling to get
successful and finally at this point we're all okay finally
I'm at the point where now I can kind of
relax a little bit and still success comes to me
and it's like that's what I've been dreaming of but
now it's like no you got to climb out of
the mountain climb a whole new mountain now or the
risk of not wanting to help anyone anymore I don't
even know what my what my desires and motivations will
be like and how my life purpose will change and
evolve as I get into the deeper truths that's something
I can't even anticipate really probably I'll still want to
influence people but maybe I won't maybe I'll just want
to retreat into a cave and just meditate all day
I don't know so that's one unknown that I'm dealing
with also things like sacrificing material comforts sacrificing sex sacrificing
relationships sacrificing vacations sacrificing travel and fun and sacrificing food
and like all this kind of stuff that's really nice
that you kind of like been dreaming of for the
last five years you know you've been working real hard
it's like well I'm working because I'll get all these
nice bonus juicy bonuses at the end of the journey
and now it's like well I have to give up
those those juicy bonuses to go even higher on an
even higher journey maybe I don't necessarily need to give
them up but that's something that's a a fear of
mine and then of course there's fears like well how
will people judge me what will people think of me
what about my old obligations what about my obligations to
my viewers what about my obligations to my business what
about obligations to my customers what about obligations to my
family and people who are close to me and then
of course probably the ultimate fear is like what if
I ruin my life with such a decision so those
are some of the thoughts that are kind of swirling
through my mind just wanted to share them because not
that you're facing this exact same issue in your life
but it shows you kind of like what's involved with
making a paradigm change and the fact that it's really
scary is the important part and it's really easy to
get stuck and it's really easy to just kind of
delay and to say oh you know what I'll just
kind of put this on the backburner for another year
oh I can do it next year and the next
year I can do it the next year I can
do it after this and after that and after my
success and after my relation I can do it and
just push it off and off and off and off
and off um and that's kind of like what I've
already been doing for the last year it's been fine
I can keep doing that for a little while but
ultimately like I know deep down inside of this this
tract of achievement focused life an achievement focused lifestyle on
success and on business this is ultimately not going to
fulfill me it's already not fulfilling me it's never really
fulfilled me it doesn't work it won't fulfill you either
if you think it'll fulfilling something that will fulfill you
it won't that's just a trick of your mind which
is enough to motivate you now for a little while
for next 5 or 10 years fine use that but
just realize that it won't fulfill you forever sorry to
pop your bubble and so what's really scary in life
is when you realize these things and then you're like
well [ __ ] this means I got to change
a lot of structural things in my life not just
little things but big major things how I relate to
people how I relate to society I relate to culture
how I relate to entertainment how I relate to food
I related to fitness how I relate to sex how
I relate to business how I relate to money I
relate to happiness and what has to happen is that
like a part of you has to die on this
hero's journey that you're on part of the hero has
to die so that he gets purified and pushed forward
it's a purification process and in this purification process the
impurities get burned out of you but you know the
fire does burn and it does hurt sometimes and it's
scary to stick your hand in the fire to keep
sticking your hand in the fire consciously deliberately intentionally that's
what was so inspiring about Gandhi is that he did
that consciously intentionally for almost the entirety of his life
fearlessly courageously incredible man really tough to do really rare
it's surprising rare especially in the self-help field it's very
rare because here's the standard self-help track you become the
self-help guru you write a couple of books you become
a famous author you get your name out there you
get a lot of subscribers people know you you develop
a practice you then get some people working under you
develop little company you got a little product out there
you know course you know this'll that you do a
radio show you do a TV show you do this
everybody knows you and all the sudden you're like this
big guru no one could even remember the time where
nobody knew you and then you know you're so successful
you just keep doing that for the rest of your
life and you just keep milking that cow for the
rest of your life that's the standard self-help business model
but you know um that's pretty shallow pretty shallow model
doesn't doesn't strike me as having a lot of integrity
not if you're really learning the self-help principles that I'm
talking about every week you can't really live that kind
of lifestyle not for very long I mean that's a
phase you can go through but then you have to
grow out of it you can't do the whole Tony
Robbins thing for free decade after decade after decade like
what's the point like earning tens of millions of dollars
to buy yourself like castles and mansions and helicopters and
[ __ ] like what this is this is all
quite shallow uh so like my inner intuition knows that
my life can't be about this and that really the
focus has to really change it has to stop being
me up to this point my focus in my life
even though I do work that impacts lots of people
and I like to tell myself that you know my
have a life purpose which is all about impacting people
and so forth and I do I do that but
really my work is about me and my life is
about me and that has to change and that's really
hard to change and paradoxical what this means is to
take the focus off of me paradoxically you think like
well okay leo fine go become a saint or something
but see what it actually looks like on the surface
when I do that is pear you have to I
should turn inward to do that I have to find
my own truth I have to find enlightenment I have
to develop the self mastery that I need and only
then can I turn back outward and make my life
about uh about other like really about other like Gandhi
really made his life about other now he wasn't even
enlightened at least not when he started I don't know
if he ever even became enlightened I I doubt that
but that makes it even more incredible that he was
able to do it even more incredible so the reason
I'm talking about this is because I want to give
you kind of a preview first of all like I
said I want to give you kind of a more
vulnerable take on personal development so I'm sharing a challenge
and I'm facing hopefully you can relate to this challenge
because I'm sure that you can see the connection from
this challenge to a lot of your challenge I'm going
to talk about your challenges here in a second but
here's something I want to kind of draw your attention
to is that this is what it looks like these
are the challenges of evolving up Maslow's hierarchy of needs
this is what we're really talking about here if you
watch my episode about Maslow's hierarchy of needs and how
to use it to self actualize if not go watch
that one that's important an important one for you to
watch but you basically got this pyramid with these different
hierarchies of different needs and you're sending up these ladders
or these levels these stages in the problem is that
it's really easy to get stuck at a stage especially
once you get a little higher a little higher and
a little higher and then you kind of just peter
out a lot of really successful people a lot of
really smart and brilliant people who would otherwise go on
to to really make a high consciousness profound impact in
the world they get stuck somewhere in the middle of
the pyramid they don't go to the very very top
what I'm talking about here is how to get to
the very top now maybe that's not the challenge you're
facing right now maybe right now your lower arm you
know you're on a lower level and you're not quite
suited for the top yet that's cool that might be
five or ten or twenty years away for you right
now but you know what you're still going to be
facing the same basic issue no matter what level you're
at and you're trying to ascend to the next level
you're going to be say facing similar types of issues
right you have to let go of certain things you
have to let go of old ways of doing things
and then you have to accept new ways that are
kind of scary and foreign to you so this is
how this connects back to your life you're probably wondering
okay well what does all this mean for me leo
well the bottom line is that as you grow you
will face these same similar kinds of turning points your
career might be facing a turning point your family situation
might be facing a turning point a relationship in your
life might be facing a similar turning point your relationship
to society might be facing a turning point or to
money or to business or to health these turning points
will happen to you and they probably already happened to
you they've certainly happened to me this is not my
first like I said I've had turning points back in
college turning points in high school turning points in my
first job in my first business these are really crucial
points I feel like my biggest growth has come from
making wise decisions on these turning points and actually making
a decision because see here's here's the real deceptive part
about this is that if you don't make a conscious
decision at some point what will happen you'll just kind
of play the default position and the default position is
just keeping your status quo and this is exactly what
people do is they just keep their status quo and
just keep keep at it keep at it keep at
it avoid making any decisions and then what happens is
that eventually they die your life runs out it runs
out really fast a lot faster than you think if
you're little older you know what I'm talking about fear
in your 30s 40s 50s 60s you know what I'm
talking about if you're still in your teens or 20s
you don't know what I'm talking about yet but when
you turn 30 you're really going to feel it I
turned 30 here so the point here is that you're
going to be facing these turning points and what you
need to be doing is you need to be learning
how to listen to your inner wisdom and not putting
off these decisions for too long and making the bold
choices right the hero to get on the hero's journey
the first thing he has to do is he has
to do what's called accepting the call the hero is
presented with a call the question is will he take
it or not the true hero always accepts the call
with resistance but he accepts it in the end that's
what puts him on the journey that's what makes him
a hero the non hero the ordinary guy what he
does is he has too much resistance he gives in
to the resistance he stalls he has excuses he's very
comfortable he says he'll do it tomorrow or next year
or he's got a family obligation or whatever his reasons
are that's really the first distinguishing characteristic of a hero
and an ordinary person so the hero is really one
who is in tune with his inner wisdom even though
there's resistance it's not easy for the hero a classic
thing you see in movies when you see a hero's
journey paradigm being used like in Star Wars for example
is you see the hero is reluctant he's always reluctant
he doesn't just eagerly accept the call you would wonder
like well why wouldn't hero just want to go on
a grand cool adventure why does it Luke just want
to go fly out into space and you know go
to the Death Star and destroy bad guys why does
he want to do all this well because think about
how it actually plays out in real life in a
movie it's all fun and games but in real life
when it's your balls on the line how does it
actually play out imagine you're a new situation you gotta
abandon your home your relatives your friends your girlfriend your
boyfriend whoever you got your children you got a bad
and leave all that and go off on some crazy
adventure it doesn't seem like an adventure it seems like
a some some ridiculous cockamamie scheme that people will judge
you for that has a high failure rate and a
lot of risk and potentially little reward and that you
got to make it work somehow and to something you've
never done before something you've never attempted before will require
skills you don't even know how to acquire and that's
something you have to say yes to of course you're
going to say no almost everybody says no because what
people do is they hold on to the good at
the cost of the great and so one of the
things you got to learn here if you really want
to self-actualize and you would really want to lift your
full potential life is you have to learn how to
let go of the good for the sake of the
great at these crucial turning points in your life you're
not going to have a lot of these turning points
you might have four six maybe ten of them in
your whole life I've probably had three or four major
turning points and I'm thirty right now so that tells
me that I'll probably have another three or four in
the next thirty years right so my whole life if
I live past sixty that'll probably be ten turning points
maximum and I think the ones that you make when
you're young when you're in your 20s 30s and 40s
those are going to be the most important ones because
once you're in your 50s and 60s let's face it
you don't have that much time left you don't and
you've already locked in a lot of stuff with those
at earlier turning points that you've either stalled on or
you made some kind of decision on so it's really
important that you learn how to go for the greater
vision the vision of what you really could be what
your full potential is of what's possible for you not
just a settling for good but going for like something
that will inspire others when they see it and that's
something that's really hard to find it's really hard to
find people even discussing these issues in society in culture
in the media in your family who discusses this stuff
even in self-help books this stuff is rarely discussed it's
discussed in it's like lip service only its lip service
only because even the people that are writing these books
and doing these seminars I don't see them even doing
it most of them don't do it so how can
they discuss it you have to prepare yourself for making
radical changes in your life that are going to seem
crazy they're going to seem crazy especially to people around
you that aren't inside your head and aren't thinking like
you and don't have connection to that inner wisdom that
you've got but they're even seem crazy to you they're
going to seem very counterintuitive to you and to others
around you is it going to seem like you're taking
a step backwards when in fact you know you're taking
a step forwards but I mean you know how it
worked it's like tube steps forward one step backward kind
of deal and sometimes it's like two steps forward and
then three steps backward but then in a few years
a giant leap of 10 steps forward or you just
completely jump to a whole new level a whole new
dimension a whole new playing field and that's what these
paradigm shifts these turning points can do for you it's
not just an incremental like a couple of steps ahead
what you're really doing is you're jumping to a whole
new level you're going from the little leagues to the
giant leagues to the big leagues so you're going to
have to be prepared to make these kind of radical
changes and yet and here's a real important part make
sure you listen to this part right here and yet
you balance it with responsible action and wisdom so I'm
not telling you here that what you do is you
just go take some crazy risk you just start some
crazy ridiculous business idea that everyone tells you will never
work and you just go say ah screw screw the
statistic screw the probabilities I'm just gonna do it that's
not what I'm telling you I'm saying you make radical
changes that your inner wisdom is telling you you need
to make but you balanced it with with a lot
of responsibility and wisdom deep wisdom not rashness not impulsiveness
it's not like okay so I should just go quit
school quit college divorce my wife no I'm talking about
something a lot deeper here when you make one of
these important turning point decisions this is a highly conscious
act it's not a rash or impulsive action highly conscious
you're being pulled by um something really um you might
say spiritual inside you is pulling you your life purpose
your passion your soul whatever you want to call it
something inside you is pulling you it's like I know
I need to do this I know this is right
for me that was the case for me in I'm
thinking right now about three or four major turning points
in my life up to now where that was the
case where where I had this kind of tug of
war between the conventional and then like between my gut
telling me I know I got to do this I
know this is right I know this will pay off
even though it doesn't seem like it will right now
even though it seems kind of crazy and the way
it's usually worked for me as I have resisted it
and I've been I did in a spill room painful
and scary and a lot of frustration comes within a
lot of emotional turmoil this is the hero coping with
accepting the call and then what I said is I
finally said you know what [ __ ] it I
got to do it and then one way or another
I just did it and sometimes what happens is I'm
pushed by some external factor and sometimes it's just me
making the decision you know it can vary but I
think that a lot of where I am today has
to do with the fact that I have followed through
on those turning points where I easily could have not
where I easily could have delayed where I could have
easily distracted myself with games or entertainment or sex or
relationships or whatever else with money and distracted myself and
then I would not be where I am today and
it's really amazing it's almost like a like a deja
vu moment I almost feel like I'm back in college
in my first two years of college because I was
facing the same kind of thing in college where it's
like I knew that the major I selected when I
started which was engineering that it just wasn't right for
me but I was so committed to it and then
you know I knew that there was other passion I
had to follow which was game design and I was
really uh uncertain about how to make that switch and
I thought I would you know lose a lot of
time and all this investment that I made into engineering
but then I finally did make the switch and it
was like the same situation that I'm facing now with
actualised org I'm at the point with actualize onward where
I've considered just completely shuttering shutting it down and saying
like well okay what if no more videos what if
I just go and like live in a cabin for
the next five years and just enlighten the [ __
] out of myself and then see what happens and
if I still want to come back and do something
publicly I will if I have that opportunity and maybe
I won't even want to do anything publicly and my
life will just go some crazy direction like that's something
I've considered and I'm considering right now but they on
the other hand I'm like well I do have this
great opportunity that let go of how do I keep
both you might say well you can't you do both
and that's kind of what I've been trying to do
for last year and it's real challenging in reality what
happens is that I'm really hedging my bets and when
I hedge my bets I know that I'm not really
serving that deep inner wisdom that I have I'm not
really serving my full life purpose so how do I
resolve this I don't know yet it's an open question
we'll see how it goes but either way bold changes
will be happening fractionalized org for me and I hope
for you to every new year I plan new big
changes this is how you get big results with self-improvement
habits are nice little exercises and techniques are good those
are all great but then you do also want to
consider the big picture what's the big picture strategy of
what you're doing do you have a life purpose are
you following it are you aligned with it how are
you not aligned with it how could you become more
aligned with it what big step could you take to
do that and in the end you gotta always understand
that your character will be tested if you're on this
path the hero always gets tested that's what constitutes the
hero's journey is the tests and the obstacles that he
has to overcome on the way so if you're dealing
with emotional turmoil and you're suffering in you're ambivalent you
don't know how to decide and you got all this
kind of angst and frustration there then you know I
know what that's like I've been there a lot but
that's kind of like the emotional labor that we have
to pay as heroes on our journeys to get to
where we ultimately want to be which is to actualize
our full potential I want to leave on one final
note which is the reminder that the most precious commodity
that you have is your sense of death if you
are sensitive to the fact that you will be dead
very soon it will happen very soon and it will
seem like it's happening in the blink of an eye
your life will pass before you even if you live
to seventy eighty ninety a hundred years old it'll still
seem like the blink of an eye if you can
be conscious of that as you're hitting these turning points
these potential turning points that's what's going to activate that
inner wisdom in you and that's what's been activating that
inner wisdom and mean because I was sick and I
actually I like being sick in a twisted sick kind
of way even though it's terrible but if you like
really get a bad cold or bad fever where you're
lying there palm on the bed or on the couch
and you feel like you might not even live through
the night it's so bad you really get this kind
of clarifying effect where a lot of petty [ __
] in your mind falls away because you get the
sense of impending death and you see like everything put
in this proper priority and then what happens is that
you kind of come out of that fever and then
all of a sudden two days later you know you're
back in the grind you're back in the 9 to
5 schedule and it's all forgotten just like a dream
so here's the key if you really want to fulfill
your potential then you have to turn that dream into
something you're thinking about during the day when you get
that kind of a sense of clarity when you're sick
and you have a fever you have to keep that
sense of clarity during the day when you're back at
work when you're back at home you're back with your
family or for example if you go on and retreat
you go on a meditation retreat in everything's going great
there and you have all these epiphanies you want to
change your life around you should be living this way
in that way and then you get back home and
five days later you've forgotten about all of it and
your life is exactly the same as it was we'll
see what happened is you were conscious for a brief
moment but then you fell back asleep there was a
potential turning point but then since you decided to do
nothing the turning point vanished and sometimes a turning point
can vanish in as little as five days in as
little as a week or a month or a year
it'll vanish the turning points they don't usually stay open
for very long so be mindful that remember how important
it is to be sensitive of your impending death because
it's coming and it's coming fast all right I'll leave
