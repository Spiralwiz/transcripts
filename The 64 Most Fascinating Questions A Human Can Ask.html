hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about how to develop
a deep interest in existential truth which is something that
few people are interested in and the way we can
do that is I'm going to share with you what
I came up with as the 64 most profound and
fascinating questions that a human being can ever ask I
want to make you more interested in truth in questions
of existential matters metaphysical matters epistemic matters and very few
people are generally interested in this stuff but you know
what I found in my life is that I accidentally
stumbled into these questions when I was pretty young and
I was interested in these questions basically since I was
a kid and a teenager and that that has made
a practical difference actually a very big difference in the
maturity of my psychology so it might seem like these
questions are just metaphysical and philosophical but actually what I
want to show you is that these questions are central
to how happy you are in life how much meaning
you derive from life and actually how you develop yourself
and how you grow and the deepest levels of personal
development are intimately tied in with thinking about some of
these questions and the only reason that I think that
most people have not been exposed to these questions is
simply because our culture is really bad at this it
kind of discourages it and most people have never even
really just been introduced to this stuff because these questions
are inherently very very fascinating but the problem is that
people have even introduced these questions and also the way
they go about investigating these questions is totally wrong so
I'm going to talk about all these interesting questions here
hopefully trigger this curiosity in you and then finally I'll
talk a little bit about how to tie this in
with your life so there are four categories of these
existential questions I'm going to cover first is the metaphysical
then the epistemic then questions about the self and questions
about consciousness there's some overlap between these different categories so
I took some liberties about how to structure these questions
where to put them so first let's talk about the
metaphysical the metaphysical basically means the like the structure and
physics of reality why is it the way it is
and what really is reality the first question in this
category is how come existence exists at all vision rule
wondered about that it's very puzzling this thing called existence
you can actually become aware right now that you exist
and that existence exists and there's degrees of this awareness
and it's very puzzling when you're aware that you exist
which normally or not is very puzzling like what is
existence what is it it's such a mysterious thing it's
so slippery so hard to get a handle on and
yet here it is it's like the most essential thing
that we have it grounds everything else also related question
is what is existence what does it mean for something
to exist might seem kind of obvious at first but
then again when you start to think about it pretty
deeply it's not obvious at all what existence is and
how his existence related to non-existence how do objects-- pass
from non-existence into existence and from existence into non-existence both
of which seem to happen all the time also why
is reality structured as it is our reality has a
very definite structure in order to it but why is
it ordered this way and not some other way and
are there other possible ways that reality can be ordered
other than our own you might say well it's ordered
this way and structured this way because of the laws
of physics okay but that doesn't really explain anything because
why are the laws of physics structured the way they
are and could the laws of physics be different are
they just arbitrary or do they have to be the
way that they are are there may be other universes
where the laws of physics are totally different and then
why would that be the case and then why is
our universe the way it is and not some under
way another question is which comes first consciousness or matter
so sine typically we tend to think of the world
as being made of matter and energy physical hard stuff
rocks trees rivers people cars this sort of stuff but
then again from a first-person perspective consciousness is the primary
thing we've got our awareness our consciousness that in fact
we could say actually that that's the most truest thing
we have is consciousness and yet how does this consciousness
come about and what is its relationship to matter is
consciousness something that comes out of matter like a higher-order
emergent property science seems to hold it that way but
if you start to think about this then the other
possibility opens up to you which is that maybe matter
is something that we think up or that occurs conceptually
within consciousness so which is it is matter within consciousness
or does conscious arise out of matter very interesting question
another question is what is matter energy space and time
these four things are like the most primary qualities or
quantities or variables within a lot of physics equations and
yet if you study physics uh there's no real answer
to what matter energy time or space are the things
are defined sort of as question marks and we can
certainly manipulate them in equations but when it comes to
really like getting a handle on what matter is or
energy or even time in space uh that's very very
tricky so in a sense the most fundamental building blocks
of our reality are unknown how weird is that another
question is what is outside the universe have you ever
thought about this like is our in our universe infinite
or is it finite and if the universe is finite
then there must be what that a boundary it's like
a sphere that extends out in all directions but then
there's a boundary and then what's outside that boundary is
it what a vacuum is it less than a vacuum
is it nothingness seems kind of odd what would happen
if you try to go through that boundary interesting and
if the universe is infinite well that presents some tricky
scenarios as well because how could it be infinite and
how can we even understand what it means for the
universe to be infinite and if the universe does have
a boundary is there something maybe outside that boundary like
other universes another related question is what existed before the
Big Bang so scientifically we accept the Big Bang model
at the origin of the universe but so that says
you know the universe came out a little singularity but
where did that singularity come from saying that the universe
originated from the Big Bang really doesn't answer anything as
to the origins of existence or the universe because you've
boiled it down to some unknown variable which is really
no different than saying that God created the universe or
that the universe sits on the back of a turtle
or an elephant or something like that where did the
singularity of the Big Bang come from did it come
from other universes did it come from something like a
a meta universe from a it's very interesting another question
is how does the material interact with the immaterial so
like I was saying we have consciousness we have matter
we recognize material stuff and immaterial stuff immaterial stuff is
not mystical as you might think it's actually very ordinary
stuff so immaterial stuff includes thoughts feelings emotions sights sounds
in many ways it's all the stuff that your entire
practical everyday life is composed of it's immaterial stuff people
forget that and yet it seems like there's a relationship
an intimate relationship between the material and the immaterial but
yet scientifically we haven't really been able to define it
at all not even theoretically do we understand how the
material could interact with the immaterial seems like I could
have immaterial thoughts these immaterial thoughts then shape my actions
which are material physical actions okay how does that happen
and vice versa seems like I could take some medication
or I can let drink some alcohol get drunk and
that will affect my mood and my thoughts so here's
something physical and material and chemical like alcohol can affect
something immaterial like my emotions and my thoughts how does
that happen it's very odd we don't even have a
theoretical basis for that scientifically another question is what governs
what's possible and what's impossible in the universe so we
say that some things are possible and some things are
impossible and then when we push a little bit further
we could say well the things that are impossible are
those things that are physically impossible which is governed by
laws of gravity Einstein's theory of general relativity quantum mechanical
laws and theories and such such considerations but then what
determined that for example the speed of light we might
say it's not possible to fly from one corner of
the universe to another corner of the universe to quickly
because that violates the ultimate speed limit speed of light
but then what sets that limit it's very interesting we
might also say well certain things in universe for example
are logically impossible they're irrational or just like logically and
consistent like you can't have a square circle but what
set that limit if you think of an infinite field
of possibilities but then you see our universe our universe
is sort of a limitation on that infinite field so
if our humor our universe is a limited set of
possibilities what sets those limits and those boundaries why is
it that you can't have a square circle and you
can't just say because it's logically impossible because then why
is it logically impossible why is it that it's not
possible to have logically impossible things it's interesting another question
is what governs emergent properties so we recognize that most
the universe is a set of emergent properties so if
you think that the universe made of atoms well atoms
combine together for example to create a water molecules and
then you can combine those water molecules into a glass
of water which contains trillions of water molecules and then
you have the properties of water and now water has
interesting properties like liquidity or solidity or gaseous Ness the
pending on what temperature it's at but then what actually
determines that those emergent properties of solidity liquidity and gaseous
nasaw the places that they do and that they are
the way that they are and of course that's just
one example we have emergent properties arising in every system
at every level chemically biologically socially if you think that
consciousness is an emergent property then you have that to
explain like why does consciousness arise at the level of
the month of the brain let's say your neurons but
it doesn't arise the level of atoms or molecules what
is determining that and setting those sorts of boundaries and
rules it's very interesting and how is it that an
emergent property can arise out of seemingly nowhere at all
an emergent property is by definition something other than the
parts that compose it liquidity and solidity and gaseous nough
sarn OTT inherently the properties of h2o molecules neither is
consciousness in any way conceivable as a byproduct of just
some neurons that you combine together like even theoretically it
doesn't make sense so how can that be another question
is what makes a thing of thing this is really
interesting people take things for granted people take objects for
granted but what actually determines what is an object so
you might think that I'm standing here before you and
I am one single object one single human being but
is that true or am i multiple objects because I
have hundreds of bones in my body various organs and
such so what am I am I one or am
i hundreds but then each one of those hundreds also
contains thousands and millions of cells maybe trillions of cells
blood cells and neurons and so forth so what am
I am i wonder' my millions or trillions and then
each one of those cells contains millions and billions more
of atoms and molecules and such so what exactly determines
the boundaries of a thing are those boundaries defined physically
are they objective boundaries or does that actually depend on
our mind and are these boundaries and objects actually generate
and created by the human mind which if that's the
case that opens up some very radical possibilities because basically
that means that there are no more objects that objects
are mental creations does reality have a bottom most scale
so if your student science you clearly see that there's
many different scales at which we can look at reality
we can see the bottom scales like atoms which are
supposed to be indivisible but actually we figure out a
way to divide them so atoms quarks below that and
maybe strings below that maybe strings are the bottom most
scale at this point as far as we've discovered and
then you can go up the scale very high so
you've got molecules made out of atoms then you've got
cells minute molecules and proteins and such and then you
can go up from that create organs to create organisms
from organisms those can combine to create social structures and
there's that kind of level then you can even go
higher like you could have countries you could have entire
ecosystems you can have the entire planet Earth you can
have a solar system you could have a galaxy you
can have clusters of galaxies and ultimately at the very
top you have the universe but is there a bottom
most scale for that matter reserve top most scale so
does it actually end at strings or Corpse or is
that just as low as we can see so far
given our limited abilities can there be lower levels and
why would there ever be a limit why would there
ever be a bottom level could it be that the
levels go infinitely down and also infinitely up and if
that's true then that opens up some very radical possibilities
also does the evolution of the universe have a purpose
so it seems pretty clear that the universe is evolving
because it started out from just a collection of super
hot gases and molecules which have congealed into stars and
planets and complex organic molecules and life forms and then
that's all been evolving and life has become more complex
human civilization has evolved and that has become more complex
over the years and then seems like consciousness is evolving
and developing and becoming more complex technology is evolving social
systems are evolving all of it seems to be developing
more complexity and becoming more creative and more Intel so
if that trend continues where is that going and is
that just an accidental product of evolution or is there
a plan to it a design to it is there
an ultimate goal to it what might it lead to
does it lead to ultimately a fully self-aware universe or
does it lead to something else that we can't even
imagine that's interesting to consider does external reality exist at
all that's something we shouldn't take for granted so scientifically
you posit that of course there is an external objective
reality and yet if we want to be very strict
about it we can see that all we've really got
of external reality is we've only got our prayut first-person
experiences of it so there is a possibility then that
there actually isn't an external reality on all that it
there is as far as universe goes is just a
collection of private first-person experiences all sort of interacting with
each other but nothing else external and objective beyond that
what could God be it's great question to consider ah
that's a good question consider whether you're Navia store religious
so if you're an atheist is still interesting to think
about well what would the concept of God even entail
is it even logically consistent what does it mean and
if you're religious and you do believe in God then
you got to really wonder what do you believe in
is God some sort of man sitting up in the
clouds is God part of the universe or is God
separate from the universe and if he's part of the
universe how did he create the universe and if he's
separate from the universe still how did he create the
universe what dimension does he inhabit is he outside of
all dimensions and if he is then well that's kind
of difficult to understand and if he isn't then how
do you account for his existence and also the dimension
in which he's existing did he create that dimension too
so you have all these interesting problems that come up
when you start thinking about God or basically in any
way the origin of the universe doesn't have to be
God you could also be thinking about the big bang
you run into exactly the same problems another question is
what are thoughts we all acknowledge that we have thoughts
and yet they're very difficult to define what are they
is a thought what is it a chemical thing is
it a physical thing that doesn't seem quite right it's
hard to even pinpoint what thoughts are just in terms
of first-person experiences because the thought is not a sight
it's not a color it doesn't have size it doesn't
have a shape it doesn't smell it doesn't have a
sound really so thoughts are these almost ghost-like sensations that
we experience and it's hard to pinpoint what those are
very interesting and lastly for the metaphysical category is how
did life start the very beginning very beginning yes we
kind of understand evolution but where did it all come
from because it's interesting they've done a lot of lab
experiments where they've tried to start new life just by
taking some basic complex organic molecules and kind of zapping
them with electricity and applying some heat and fire to
them to see if life will spontaneously arise and that
has not been successfully accomplished so where did life come
from it's very interesting is it just a random phenomenon
was it a fluke luck thing or what next we
have the epistemic category and the epistemic category is some
ways my favorite epistemic has to do with epistemology and
epistemology is the study of knowledge and basically the most
fundamental question we can ask there is how do we
know what we know if we're going to claim something
is true or something is valid or that it is
this way how do we know that here are some
of my favorite questions from this category how can I
know anything for certain what do I know for certain
of all the stuff I know there's various degrees of
certainty I have for it is there anything there that
I'm a hundred percent certain amount and if there is
how can I be one percent certain about it also
what makes justifications valid so one thing you'll quickly discover
if you start to study pista mala ji a bit
is that everything is grounded in justifications so the reason
we think that something is true like for example we
might say well the universe exists we can be certain
that that's true okay but then why do you believe
that how can we be certain what's going to happen
you're going to come up with justifications it's true because
of X Y Z that's what makes it valid those
are justifications but then how do you know that those
justifications are themselves valid and that the criteria you're using
to judge those justifications that that criteria is valid because
you are using only one set of criteria out of
potentially hundreds or thousands of different kinds of criteria that
you can use to evaluate validity how do you know
that your criteria is the correct criteria for that you
would need more criteria and more criteria and so on
forever so how can you be sure also it's very
useful to think about why do billions of people believe
in God a lot of religious people and also atheistic
people dismiss this question way too easily they don't really
explore what this question is asking atheists often just say
oh well yeah because people are deluded and they'll believe
anything they're ignorant they're stupid and so of course they
get brainwashed and they'll believe anything but that's a little
bit too quick and too fast of a dismissal because
it's a good question because people don't just believe in
anything people specifically believe in God or various kinds of
gods and there are certain commonalities between features that god
or gods have between all the different religions that's very
interesting it's not like people just believe that or lives
a five legged goat in the center of the earth
that would be a pretty random belief but people don't
believe that and there could be millions of other things
that people believe that generally are not believed by billions
of people in Mass collectively so we have to account
for that somehow we also have to account for the
popularity of religion we also have to account for how
so many people can be wrong and this question you
have to answer even if you're religious you can't say
oh well I'm religious so I'm excused from that question
because even if you're religious you still basically believe that
only your religion is a correct one and all the
other ones are basically wrong which means essentially that you
still believe that billions of people on the planet believe
in something that's completely false and delusional so how can
that be the case and how do you know that
you're not one of them what makes you different what
makes your religion better more true and whatever reason you
have for thinking your religion is more true how do
you know that you're not just deceiving yourself because a
lot of people in fact everybody who believes in religion
or God believes that they're right and they have very
valid reasons they'll spend hours telling you all the valid
reasons they have for why their beliefs are true just
like you and they're all very certain so the feeling
of certainty is not enough to know in fact the
feeling of certainty has gotten a lot of people into
a lot of trouble historically just because you're certain to
something doesn't mean it's true also why do people disagree
about good and bad right and wrong what's ethical and
unethical what's moral and immoral what's evil this question is
super interesting because if you examine a little bit you'll
notice that actually even within your own family there's a
lot of disagreement between you and your parents about questions
of good and bad even there in that small little
group already does there's disagreement not to mention that there's
disagreement between families between churches between different religions between different
groups of people between political parties between parts the country
between different countries around the world between different cultures around
the world nobody almost no two people agree on what
is good and what is bad and yet at the
same time people generally believe that what they think as
good and bad are objectively wrong or objectively right so
is good and bad actually an objective truth or is
that a construct of the human mind and if you
claim that it is an objective truth and how come
people disagree so much about it because after all people
do not disagree about an objective truth such as that
the Sun exists or that the grass is green or
that gravity will kill you if you jump off a
20-story building at first into the concrete people don't disagree
about those things and yet almost everybody disagrees about good
and bad why is that how is that explained also
how come intelligent people delude themselves so you have to
explain not only that there are ignorant people in the
world but that even intelligent and very well educated and
studied people with PhDs and so forth still manage to
delude themselves because after all one of the reasons you
explain how people can believe in God and other such
nonsense is by saying that well yeah they're deluded but
then you also have to account for the fact that
there are intelligent people who are very diluted but then
you have to wonder well I'm intelligent and I went
to school and I went to university and maybe I
even got a PhD or a master's degree and I'd
read a lot of books and stuff and yet I
can see that there are people like that out in
world who are deluded so it seems like intelligence and
formal education is not enough to guarantee that you yourself
are not deluded interesting so then how can you be
sure that you're not deluded a very fundamental question of
epistemology and why it's so useful is because it forces
you to ask the question of what if I'm wrong
what if I'm wrong about everything I believe about the
world what if my beliefs are not really justified or
that my justifications are just rationalizations or arbitrary constructs that
serve my ego that's something that you should really ask
yourself very deeply also you should ask yourself what if
I'm being self biased so not only could I just
be wrong or mistaken or deluded but that I could
actually be constructing a model of the world an understanding
of the world specifically that conforms to my own egoic
needs I believe it because it serves me to believe
it you see because of course if something serves me
I'm very prone to wanting to believe it because it
serves me so why wouldn't I believe something that serves
me and yet there could be a difference between something
that serves me and what the ultimate truth is so
how do I know that I haven't just been following
my own biases in my own survival needs my own
agenda and that my bottles of reality haven't been distorted
by those biases it's very tricky because after all I'm
very protective of my own agenda and when it comes
to my survival I'll do anything to survive I will
care more about surviving than I will care about truth
so then how can I trust myself that my models
of reality are true also you should ask yourself how
do I know that I haven't been indoctrinated I love
this question because everybody has to acknowledge that there's a
doctrine ation and in fact one of the ways that
we explain people who believe silly things is by saying
well they've just been indoctrinated they grew up as kids
and they were brainwashed okay but what about you were
you also not indoctrinated when you grew up no only
oh I haven't been doctrine ated well how do you
know that because after all those people who have been
indoctrinated they don't know that they've been indoctrinated that's what
indoctrination entails is a failure to be able to acknowledge
that the beliefs you hold are not really yours but
that they've just been injected into your mind through coercion
so what if you have been indoctrinated how then can
you be sure that what you know is true another
question is good that I like is what is science
is science the best way of arriving at knowledge and
if it is what makes it the best why is
it valid also a great question is what are the
limits of science so if we're going to use science
to understand the world does science have limits is there
stuff that this that science cannot understand due to the
fact that science has certain rules and limits or consigns
understand everything consigns explain everything or maybe there are other
paradigms that could be used same thing for mathematics what
is mathematics we seem to hold mathematics is pretty certain
and valid but what makes mathematics valid that's a much
deeper question than most people give it credit for also
what are the limits of mathematics is mathematics something that's
explaining the universal nature of reality or is mathematics something
that's a construct of the human mind and a projection
that the human mind makes onto reality same thing about
rationality what is rationality and why does rationality work how
do we know that rationality can be trusted and relied
upon and that it's valid what are the limits of
rationality or is rationality limitless and that it can explain
everything or is rationality a feature of the human mind
and maybe it's a projection upon reality what is more
reliable the senses are five senses rationality or intuition which
one of those three should be we should we use
to develop our knowledge which one of those is most
trustworthy also what are the biases and blind spots of
humanity as a whole this question I love because it's
rarely considered historically we know the dangers of cultural blindness
and thousands of years ago if you had a culture
living on some remote island in the middle of nowhere
it had a culture and it thought that that culture
is universal that that's all that there could ever be
that their God and their language and all that stuff
that it that was it that's the way it is
but then of course as culture started crossing the oceans
and stuff and started interacting with each other we realized
quickly that cultures are rather arbitrary and that different cultures
can be very very different and that there's no one
ultimate right culture well same thing might go for species
as a species humanity might have certain biases one might
be the rationality bias or maybe the mathematics bias or
the science bias and maybe we could imagine that there
there are species on other planets somewhere that they might
have different ways of understanding the world which could be
equally accurate and valid or just very very different but
still arriving at the same sorts of truths or maybe
higher truths so how do we evaluate our own blind
spots as humanity generally this is something that is very
rarely considered human knowledge is often considered as the ultimate
and the only and the universal way of arriving truth
and even in our planet we know that there are
animals and different creatures who have a very different understanding
of reality so a great question to ask yourself is
how do animals understand reality how does an ant see
the world has a dolphin how does an elephant how
does a bacteria now generally we say that they see
the world in a much lesser way than we do
but then that opens up the possibility for their being
higher animals maybe not on this planet but on some
other planet maybe there are animals or creatures or intelligent
alien life-forms elsewhere in the galaxy who have then a
higher understanding than humans do it's not hard to imagine
a creature with larger brain of a human after all
so then how can we be certain about our knowledge
and what we think is true why is human understanding
taken as the ultimate truth which of the experts is
right so if you notice there's a lot of experts
out in the world religious experts political experts scientific experts
linguistic experts and so forth how do we know which
expert we can trust and if we think we're the
expert how can we be sure that we're the expert
hmm interesting question so it's like how do we know
that somebody really has the ultimate intellectual authority especially if
we're trying to evaluate some other expert and we ourselves
are not the expert how can we know that they
really are the expert model of reality is most accurate
there's a lot of different models of reality scientific models
religious models and so forth but how do we know
that a particular model that we hold as being the
most accurate is actually the most accurate it's very interesting
what is truth that's a very fundamental question that we
need to ask when we study epistemology what is truth
itself is it an idea is it a model is
it a concept is it actual reality is it something
beyond reality is truth a third-person objective phenomena or through
the first-person subjective experience and also what is understanding so
there seems to be a difference between truth and understanding
if I understand how something works like I might understand
how a car engine works maybe I don't know the
truth of it but I might say I have an
understanding of it but then where does understanding come from
how can we trust and rely upon understanding how do
we distinguish between correct understanding and incorrect understanding all they're
interesting questions what is the ultimate truth so generally we
make a distinction between small or minor truths and ultimate
truths a minor truth might be something like that I'm
wearing a black shirt or that I'm six feet and
two inches tall or that I am a mammal these
might be minor truths okay fine little basic facts nice
to know that those are true but what's the ultimate
truth like the ultimate truth of reality in the universe
like the ultimate ultimate ultimate truth what's that and what
form would that even take is it possible for us
to know that truth or is that just something that's
completely outside the realm of possibility for our limited human
minds and how would we know what's the best way
to acquire knowledge is it through what is it through
listening to experts through reading a bunch of books through
doing science experiments through doing philosophical investigation maybe through meditation
maybe through religious practices maybe by traveling the world and
exploring different cultures what's the best way is reality ultimately
understandable can humans understand everything there is to understand about
reality or not simply because we're limited by our psychology
and our biology and so forth so that wraps up
the category of epistemic questions now let's talk about questions
about the self this has to do with you as
a self as an individual so that thing as an
individual first of all how can I be sure that
I exist at all now that might be self-evident but
maybe not so self-evident because when you start looking for
the self it can be difficult to pinpoint what is
the self exactly what am i it's a very fundamental
question here if I claim that I do exist then
what exactly am I am i a biological thing well
maybe but remember we said that we're not sure what
defines objects so how do I know that I'm a
biological thing what's the validity behind that also great question
is how come or how did I come rather into
being so if you think back in time an interesting
puzzle develops because you recognize that you were born biologically
but then actually you the you that you think you
are didn't come online for several years after that there
was no you until you were like age three or
four and then there developed a sense of you a
sense of ego before that it didn't exist so are
you the body or are you the sense of ego
and if you are the sense of ego then what
is that also what justifies my identity with my body
in my mind if I think that I'm the body
in the mind why do I think that how come
I'm justified in saying that because after all I do
say that the body is mine and the mind is
mine so then who is it that is owning these
things curious and if I am the body what is
everything else this is very odd to think about this
because experientially we don't actually see any boundaries between the
body and the world the body actually experientially is just
composed of colors and shapes and so is the rest
of the world so where does my body stop and
the rest of the world begin is it at the
boundary of my skin and then like I have fingernails
I can clip off my fingernails and then are those
fingernails no longer me once I clip them off what
determines that seems rather arbitrary if I have hair and
I cut the hair once the hair falls to the
ground is it no longer me and yet when it
was attached to me it was me or is the
mind constructing these boundaries because after all there's really no
difference between looking at the colors on my hand and
the colors of the wall behind my hand there's really
no difference and yet we seem to attribute a lot
of importance and meaning to that interesting even under the
scientific model the scientific model says that everything that right
now I'm experiencing that you're experiencing is a construction of
neurons in the brain and that none of it is
actually real and objective because all you have are colors
and sensations and thoughts and emotions and feelings and all
of these are just a kind of a virtual projection
of the brain the brain is creating all this stuff
and by definition none of that stuff is reality that's
consciousness so I'm conscious of my body but this is
not really my body this is just what I'm conscious
of my body as science says is something else outside
of that something behind the scenes that I can't even
access so what the hell is that thing and why
do then identify with the colors of my body in
the shape of my body when clearly all this is
just a virtual construction of consciousness interesting what is in
control of my thoughts I have thoughts and at first
it seems like I control them but when I look
a little bit closer I can see that actually I
don't control my thoughts I don't know what the next
thought will be that comes out of my mouth neither
do you if you look very closely that's why we
can have obsessive thinking and we can't stop our thinking
and also if your creative person you recognize that some
of your most original insightful thoughts you can't honestly take
credit for them because they come to you as though
coming from amuse or coming out of the blue so
what is controlling my thoughts interesting what is my role
in reality so I am alive I exist supposedly Here
I am and what's my role here do I have
a role do I get to construct whatever role I
want or is there a specific role I have to
play within society or within the community or just to
please myself is my role just to be maximally happy
is that my role in life just hedonism or is
there something more do I have responsibilities and obligations or
don't I that's interesting consider and also if you just
believe that it's all open to possibility that my role
is basically self constructed well even then the question arises
how should I live my life to have the best
life to maximize my happiness how should I live what
should i do or what things shouldn't I do all
very good and useful questions and lastly let's talk about
the category of consciousness firstly what the hell is consciousness
this is a very puzzling thing consciousness is supposed to
matter how come I'm conscious and what does it even
mean for me to be conscious how come science hasn't
explained consciousness in over 2,000 years of science and all
the experience we've done and all the theorizing we've done
and even all the philosophy we've done there is not
even a sound theoretical philosophical explanation of what consciousness could
even be and how it could connect to our physical
understanding of the universe science does not explain consciousness one
bit neither has really religion and why is that why
is it taking us so long to understand consciousness what's
going on there how is perception possible how is it
possible that one physical object can perceive another physical object
it's very odd also what unifies our senses so we
have sight sound touch smell we have emotions we have
thoughts and all of those seem to occur almost in
separate dimensions for example sites are in another dimension from
sounds those dimensions don't seem to interpenetrate really and yet
at the same time all these dimensions are unified for
us into one seamless conscious experience but it's not like
they're all physically located in the same place how does
that work also what if there are higher levels of
consciousness so we think we have a level of consciousness
that's higher than that of an ant but what if
there are other creatures or aliens out there who have
levels of consciousness that are thousands of times higher than
what human beings have and what would that mean for
our understanding of the world and epistemic questions what about
non-ordinary states of consciousness what do those mean what are
their metaphysical implications so if you start to study non-ordinary
states of consciousness you can start to study psychedelic states
of consciousness religious states of consciousness meditative states of consciousness
and you discover that there's quite a lot of different
states of consciousness it's not just the way we normally
think of like deep sleep dreaming and ordinary wakefulness there's
levels of consciousness that we know beyond that and you
can experience them but what do they mean are they
more true are they just hallucinations are they just fantasies
are they just thoughts in the brain interesting to ponder
especially if you've had a strong non ordinary state of
consciousness also how our consciousness is separated so supposedly I
have my consciousness here you have your consciousness there and
there's no ability for me to enter your consciousness nor
you to enter mine and also if I die my
consciousness disappears but yours will stay intact and if you
die yours will disappear but mine will stay intact so
where are these consciousness is located such that they are
completely independent and separated as it seems to be it's
very weird it's like we live in separate dimensions and
yet we also interact with each other very odd what's
the mechanism there also can artificial consciousness be created for
example can a computer become conscious or is consciousness a
property of biological organic life can consciousness be split or
joined that's interesting to ponder is it possible to take
my consciousness and somehow split it in two so that
then there are two consciousnesses or is it possible to
take to consciousness like mine and yours and merge them
together so that then there's one and what would that
even look like what would that mean that could have
some very profound implications for example consider what would happen
if we joined every single human consciousness on earth together
seven billion all multiplied together that would be pretty extraordinary
it might have some huge consequences also might have some
huge ramifications for epistemic questions because now we went from
a level of consciousness of unit one to a unit
of seven billion we increased it by seven billion that's
quite remarkable could inanimate matter be conscious is consciousness something
that arises from higher level order creatures and such or
is consciousness actually sort of like a field that permeates
the entire universe and maybe we have to think of
consciousness not as an emergent higher order property but actually
as the most fundamental variable of the universe in the
same way that we think about matter energy time and
space but if that's the case if consciousness is something
that's very very elemental how do we account for that
in our physics because right now our physics does not
include that at all there's no variables in physics equations
for consciousness and lastly what are the laws governing qualia
quality of being the sensations and colors and sounds all
the first person's subjective experiences that we experience so those
supposedly have certain laws and orders to them it's not
just random there's very concrete laws and yet how do
these laws arise and what are these laws supposedly under
the scientific model it's as though we can take one
neuron another neuron combining together and we get the color
red or we get another neuron and this neuron combine
them together somehow and we get the sensation of sadness
but what determines that this mechanical combination of neurons and
the chemical firings between them generate something that color red
or the feeling of sadness that's very weird because these
things are in totally different categories there must be laws
governing this stuff like physical laws and yet we have
no idea even theoretically what these laws might be so
these are the sixty-four questions now this is not a
comprehensive list you can certainly come up with more questions
depending on your proclivities and what your interests are about
life but the reason I wanted to bombard you with
all these questions is because I just want to expose
you to them and have you see that Wow these
are very profound deep highly interesting questions that are worth
studying in fact what I recommend you do with this
is that you actually devote your life to answering five
maybe ten of these top questions for you so go
through this list find your five top ten something like
that and then devote your whole life to that to
answering them to thinking about them you might think like
well this is just philosophy why should I waste my
time doing this stuff when I can just go do
something more practical like earn more money or just have
more sex and go have fun with my friends why
should I do that instead here's why what I found
is that the quality of people's lives and also the
psychological maturity and the degree of self actualization that they
experience in life is actually directly proportional to the quality
of the questions they think about and people I have
found that do not ponder existential questions and are not
interested in them they today have very shallow petty lives
because then what kind of questions are they thinking about
they're thinking about stuff like how can I have some
more sex how can I eat some better food how
can I go party how can I get some better
dry how can I just you know raise my kids
and these questions tend to be pretty low-level questions they
don't tend to produce a remarkable life on the other
hand people who are interested in existential questions these people
go on to explore themselves their own psyches their relationships
their understanding of the world they tend to have to
really push their boundaries because what happens when you explore
it essential questions is it's not just an armchair philosophical
matter actually it requires a deep search within yourself deep
questioning deep doubting various beliefs and ideologies that you've been
told since you were a kid questioning all this stuff
and as you question that stuff you grow it's not
philosophy you actually grow actually it is philosophy but it's
a different understanding of philosophy than most people have in
modern cultures if you look at the ancient Greeks the
wisest ancient Greeks were philosophers and you can see that
they were not just merely intellectuals these were people who
actually worked on mastering themselves it was a psychological affair
philosophy and psychology were very deeply linked in ways that
they no longer are in modern society which is a
shame because there is a connection now it's possible to
get lost in philosophy and go off the deep end
and just do a bunch of mental masturbation so that's
not what I'm encouraging to do I'm encouraging you to
actually take a real deep interest in these questions and
then very self honestly investigate them not because you're desperate
for an answer not because you want to go read
it in a book or you want somebody else to
tell you or you're going to go join a cult
or a religion or even some a university group or
program that's going to tell you all the answers these
questions you have to go looking for the answers yourself
which is why I didn't give you the answers to
these questions because it's sort of like doing push-ups I
can do push-ups and they'll improve me you can do
push-ups and they'll improve you but if you want me
to do your push-ups for you then what good is
that going to do you if I do your push-ups
for you they improve me not you which is why
I didn't give you the answers because I want you
just to get fascinated by the questions enough fascinated enough
that you go out there and you start to search
and in that search your life transforms some of these
questions are the most life transforming uh answers that you
will ever find some of the stuff will completely revolutionize
how you see the world how you feel about the
world one thing I noticed in people who are not
interested in existential questions is that they get depressed very
easily they have motivation problems they succumb to all sorts
of psychological delusions they buy into theories and ideologies and
stuff very gullibly because they haven't questioned metaphysics epistemology the
self or consciousness see so actually it's a very practical
thing also is very rewarding personally I think that answering
some of these questions on this list is the most
rewarding thing you can do with your life because after
all you have been gifted to be born as the
most advanced the most conscious life form that we know
about up to this point in the universe and as
that life form you have the ability to introspect into
reflection to contemplate about existence in ways that no other
creature can and what's very sad to me is that
most human beings do not use this super power it
is a super power that you have been granted whether
you wanted it or not and most people throw the
super power away and never use it instead use their
mind on very silly petty little things in life and
then they wonder how come they get depressed so easily
and how come their life is not fulfilling well of
course because you've Qiu you've chosen to use this superpower
of yours for something extremely petty and that will show
in your life and that will be reflected in how
mature and develop you are and that will limit you
from going to the deepest levels of self-actualization that are
possible now some people might say well leo these questions
that you've raised you know these are very metaphysical philosophical
questions which cannot be answered human beings have been trying
to answer some of these questions for thousands Gear's there's
no agreement so they can't be answered it's just a
waste of time and what I will tell you definitively
is that many of the questions on this list can
be answered in fact they have been answered but they
can't be answered in an intellectual way they can't be
answered in an academic way if you think you can
just write a book about it or go read a
book about it with all the answers then you misunderstand
the depth of these questions to answer these questions truly
you have to dig into yourself in some instances you
have to deconstruct yourself before the answers will be revealed
to you and that's the most valuable thing that can
happen to you in this journey I want you to
undertake that journey I want you to be passionate about
that so when I talk about existential topics in the
future you're like oh yeah I'm interested in that and
that's right up my alley rather than doing what most
people do which is to say oh no that leo
that's not practical enough for me tell me something very
petty like how to have more sex and I can
tell you that it's very easy for me to shoot
videos about advice on very petty low level topics but
where's the interest in that where's the fun in that
how is that really going to grow you all that's
going to do is just feed your ego so take
these questions seriously go out there and really dedicate yourself
to this make this a lifelong project of researching reading
being very open minded contemplating these things yourself maybe meditating
on them taking up certain practices right going to various
teachers retreat programs workshops and so forth to really investigate
this stuff it would be a deep mistake to just
kind of sit back and speculate about and say oh
yeah i sat there I speculated for a few hours
and I came up with some answers and now I
know that's not going to grow you in fact that's
just going to delude you so the choice is yours
what you do with these questions all right that's it
I'm signing off go ahead click the like button for
me post your comments down below I do read them
share the steps with friend and lastly come sign up
to my newsletter right here actualized or eats free newsletter
it'll keep you up to date with everything that I'm
releasing on a weekly basis and in the future I
will talk more about existential matters because actually the thing
I'm most interested in now in my life is these
existential matters not because I like to sit around and
just philosophize but actually because I'm very practical and what
I've discovered is that my life grows the most when
I explore the deepest existential questions of who I am
what my consciousness is what reality is and how do
I know what I know and even though I'm not
just going to give you all the answers first of
all I don't know all the answers second of all
these answers cannot just be communicated through words because they're
much deeper than that they have to be directly experienced
what I will give you the future is I'll give
you hints I'll give you techniques I'll give you strategies
I'll present important distinctions and concepts and I'll provide you
with powerful resources that will help you on your quest
to answering some of the deepest questions in life so
I hope you're excited by that and you stick around
and stay tuned and I'll see you soon with more
you
