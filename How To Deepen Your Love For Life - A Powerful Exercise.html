Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this video
I want to talk about how to cultivate a deeper
love for life What do you love about life? That's
the basic, most essential question I have for you today.
In this video, I want to take a deeper look
at this. Life is a beautiful thing. And I don't
know, if you are in touch with that. It's one
thing to know this intellectually, it's another thing to actually
be in touch with it. And you know what, I
lose track of it myself, which is kind of what
got me thinking along these lines, and led me to
the idea of shooting this video is because, you know,
life, this word life, let's think about that for a
second. Actually, to me, the word life is, is kind
of like a sacred word. Most people I get the
sense of they use the word very, just like very
mundane usage of the word like, Oh, my, this is
my life. You know, this is life. We're living in
life, life, love life, that it up. And I use
that word myself like that sometimes. But to me, life
is also very synonymous with, with the word reality. And
I really love that word reality. To me, that's a
really sacred word. And I feel like when people talk
about reality, they don't talk about it nearly as often
as, as life. But when they talk about reality, they
also don't, don't take it with the same kind of
seriousness and reverence that they should take it with. Because
reality what is reality reality is this is, is the
ultimate matrix that we're living in. Right? We're living in
some sort of thing. And that is reality. It's also
like, they're, they're really synonymous things. And it's like, it's
amazing when you think about what this reality as a
thing is. Because it's one thing to ask yourself, Oh,
well, like it. What's, what's this object, a car? What's
this object over there? It's a human being this object
over there. It's a tree. And those can be very
fascinating objects to study. But perhaps the most fascinating object
of all is just the matrix of all the objects
or the collection of all the objects, which is reality,
and life to right, because it's just this like very
wonderous, magical, mysterious, grandiose, complex, just mind blowing, baffling thing.
And I think that sometimes we have these moments in
our lives when we're very connected to that. That's when
we feel spiritual. When people talk about spirituality, by the
way, I think that's what a lot of the mean,
is this connection to this kind of eternal truth. It's
not, it's nothing religious, it's just this connection to this
idea that, wow, it's like, it's, it's amazing. And you
get that sense when you're looking at a beautiful sunset.
Or if you go to the Grand Canyon, or you're
out in nature somewhere, or you have some other kind
of like peak experience in life, you feel very connected
to reality, you feel like you're a kind of one
with it, you're part of it, you also feel like
it's very beautiful, and that it doesn't need to be
changed in any way. See, a lot of us we
spend a lot of our time in our life, calling
around trying to change life trying to change reality on
I'm certainly guilty of that myself. So but you gotta
you gotta watch yourself on that. Make sure that you're
not going overboard with that kind of stuff. Because especially
as high achiever types, and people who love self improvement,
and self actualization, you know, we want to go out
there, we want to change the world. But sometimes we
forget that the world is pretty good the way it
is. Maybe it's just like, it's actually pretty marvelous and
amazing exactly the way that it is. And it's easy
to forget that stuff. So what I have here for
you today is just a very simple exercise. In this
exercise goes like this, I want you to sit down
right now, in the middle, that's when you're gonna pause
this video, and you're gonna ask yourself this question, I'm
gonna pull out a piece of paper and you're gonna
jot down 10 items for this list. Here's the question,
what are the top 10 things that I love the
most about life? So go ahead and pull out a
piece of paper right now, pen or pencil, write this
at the top of your sheet. What do I love
the most about life? What are the top 10 things
and you're gonna pause this video and you're going to
generate the items. It might take you 1015 20 minutes
to do this, however long, that's fine. Then come back
and you'll click the play button, and we're going to
discuss your results. We're going to also discuss what you
can do with these results. Because this can be very
revealing to do this exercise. If you've done a gratitude
exercise before, I think that this exercise is a little
bit different than regular gratitude exercises, because I'm not asking
you here. What are you grateful for? I'm asking What
do you love the most about life? Now, be careful,
as you're answering this, that you're not answering for somebody
else. And you're not answering for your family or for
the way that you were raised, or for your religious
group that you're a part of, or for your school
are for your boss or for your company, or for
anybody else. But just for yourself. It's difficult to separate
the two sometimes what's your self? And what's all the
social conditioning that you've been fed for your entire life?
It's hard to separate those two sometimes. The reason this
is different from gratitude is that when when you ask
someone, what are they grateful for? Usually what they tell
you stuff like, oh, well, I'm grateful for my parents.
I'm grateful for my nice childhood. I'm grateful for the
house that I live in. And I'm grateful for my
health. Well, like this kind of stuff. No, that's good.
Gratitude can be a good exercise to do, and I'll
shoot videos on that. But here, it's different. It's like,
what do you really love about life? What do you
love about it? What are the top five or 10
things? Okay, so pause the video now go ahead answer.
And then when you come back, I'm going to share
my list with you. And also some insights. Alright, so
go. Alright, so I hope you did that exercise. If
you didn't, go ahead, stop and do it. By the
way, doing these kinds of exercises. This is how practical
personal development is done. This is how just sitting on
your ass and watching videos all day, that's not going
to be enough to get you the results that you
want. If you're serious about self actualizing, you got to
start to get active, doing exercises, reading books, and when
you're reading a book, do an exercise. They tell you
they're going out there practicing this stuff. These exercises, they
seem simple. This seems sometimes like, Oh, I know the
answers, I know what I would write down and then
you just don't write anything down? Well, actually, you don't
know. It just did this exercise on myself recently. And
I was surprised with the list that I came up
with. So speaking of which, here's the list. And I
mean, I wasn't totally surprised. I mean, I basically do
this stuff. I'm pretty self aware guy. And I've done
a lot of very deliberate, self aware type of exercises
over the last couple of years to help to bring
that up from my subconscious into my conscious awareness. But
even still, putting it in a way that you articulate
it into words is important. Sometimes you have revelations as
you do this. So here's my list. And you can
compare it with your list. But I want you to
do your exercise first. So that my list doesn't cloud
your judgment. And it doesn't, you know, give you like
biases and different basically skews your results. So make sure
that you do the exercise before you listen to my
list. Here's my list. I think one of the things
I really appreciate and love about life so much is
color and vision. Like I love interacting with life through
color. Like it's just amazing, like what is vision and
how it works. And perception. To me, that's amazing. And
this also goes into appreciation of art. I love art
history. Also appreciation of graphic design. I did a lot
of logo design in the past. I'm a pretty good
web, front end developer. And I can do lots of
lots of graphic design on that front. So I've done
a lot of front end graphics and user interface designs.
So I love that stuff. I love looking at that
stuff. To me that's just very satisfying, right? It's very
satisfying as it's like very mysterious to like what are
these things called colors? Where do they come from? Another
thing that I really love is thinking concepts and understanding
reality. To me, one of the ways, one of the
most profound ways that I interact with reality, besides my
visual sense senses, which I love is with my mind,
with my ability to analyze to look to see how
things interconnect. I love drawing connections between different ideas and,
and subjects and concepts. That's why it's part of the
reason why I started actualize that org is because I
love connecting the dots between stuff. To me that's really
interesting. It's fascinating. And it's also it's like it's like
spiritual work doing this kind of stuff for me. Because
when I can connect one idea over here with one
idea over here, to me, it's almost as though like
I'm I'm discovering reality, and to me, that's amazing, because
what else is there but reality right? Reality is the
ultimate thing. And here I am. understanding it. That's like
that's amazing to me, that's sacred to me. So a
lot of my my love for life comes from that.
Another thing on my list is the love of doing
work and then accomplishing something through effort. I love that.
I love that sense when I work really hard towards
Something that I'm able to succeed at it. And I
don't always succeed, a lot of times I fail. But
those moments when I do succeed, when I kill it
in the gym, when I go out there, and you
know, maybe I read a couple of amazing books, or
I clean up my diet, or I do something, make
a really great video, or do some other kind of
creative type of activity like that I produce something into
me that pride and satisfaction from having produced, it's almost
almost like giving birth. It's also like a sacred thing,
you know, I get to give birth to all these
different ideas and things. Like that's a cool thing. For
me, I get a lot of kicks from that. I
don't think that I love is planning for the future.
I love sitting down and organizing my notes, having big
plans for the future that's really inspiring to me. I
love also being connected with reality. I don't know if
you ever get this feeling of like contemplation where you're
like this kind of contemplative mood. A lot of times
I get this when I'm in the car, and I'm
driving somewhere a long road trip. And I love driving
somewhere just by myself for hours, like no one to
talk to, no emails, nothing just like me, the empty
road, maybe it's even dark out. So it's nighttime, just
like no distractions, I got a little bit of music
playing. And I'm just like in this very contemplative mood.
And I'm kind of like thinking about larger things, you
know, I'm thinking about the big picture of my life,
or I'm thinking about my past, or I'm kind of
just like, reflecting on recollecting, or maybe I'm, again, drawing
connections between ideas. But when I'm in that kind of
mood, very contemplative, very kind of solid mood. I love
that. That feeling to me is one of the greatest
feelings in life. I love being productive and creative. So
we also I just mentioned, the thing about being proud
of my work. To me, that's a little bit different.
So you know, I love being proud of my work.
But then I also love being productive throughout my whole
day, like getting a lot of stuff done. I also
love being creative. So whenever there's like a something that
needs to be put together, or constructed in some way,
I love that too. I love that I get to
be creative in life. Another one that I love is
sex. Sex is amazing to me, I love it. I
think that I enjoy sex a lot more than some
other people do. At least guys, I don't think guys
enjoy sex as much as I do. Not that I
watch a lot of guys having sex, but just from
the way that I talk to my friends and I
kind of get their opinions on sex. It feels like
it's very different. It's not as rich for them. It
feels so much richer to me, I love that. I
love making a girl come over and over again. Like
to me that's amazing. I love that like deep connection
and sex, love coming inside of a girl. Like it's
so amazing. It's the most amazing feeling. I love deep
intellectual conversations. And I don't have that many of them.
Because I don't find people who I can have really
deep connections with that often. And part of that is
my anti social nature. So I think that I could
be better at that, or something I can work on
is finding those types of people. But when I find
someone that I can have a really nice, like deep
nuanced conversation with about life or about something like that.
Yeah, that to me is really satisfying. I love that.
I also love efficiency and organization. I love organizing stuff,
I love finding tools and working on my workflow to
make everything my life more efficient. I also love self
improvement. So anything that I can do to make myself
better and to grow myself, again, that's kind of like
efficiency applied to my person to my body, into my
mind. And then another thing that I love is just,
I love the feeling of being warm and cozy. Like,
to me that's something that I love about life is
that, you know, maybe I can be lying in a
bed real comfortable or lying on my couch with a
blanket, or cuddling with someone like being very close. Like,
to me, that feeling of warmth in the body. Like
that's really satisfying. So I love that about life. So
those are my 10 things. What are yours? You can
compare them with my list? Maybe some of these rang
some bells for you. And you maybe you're like, Oh
yeah, I love that too. But don't let me dissuade
you from your own original unique things that you love
about life. Right? Maybe I gave you some genuine and
honest reminders of the things you forgot. But maybe you
have other things that I didn't mention on my list.
And that's totally fine. Everyone's list should be fairly unique.
So now that you've got this, what do you do
with it? Well, here's a couple of questions that you
can ask yourself to get even more value out of
this list. Just by writing this stuff down. You should
have already felt a little bit more connected to life
into reality into your higher self. Already, you should have
felt that and already maybe some little insights and epiphanies
came out for you. But here's something I will bring
out a few more. I want you to ask yourself
the following question. Look at this list. Sit down and
look at it. And then ask yourself how much of
my time is going towards e Each one of these
10 things in my life on a regular basis. So
for example, let's say that one of your items was
to, I don't know, understand reality and thinking about concepts.
Let's say that was one of your items. That's one
of my items. Well, how much time in a week?
How many hours and minutes? Do you spend doing that?
What kind of activities are you doing? Is it a
lot? Or is it a little? Are you spending five
hours a week, 10 hours a week, or only 30
minutes a week, go down the whole list and just
take a look and be honest with yourself about how
much time you're investing in each one of these areas?
On a regular basis? Then the next question, I want
you to ask yourself looking at this list? How aligned
is my career? And my current job with these items?
Is the job in the work that I'm currently doing?
The eight hours a day that I'm putting into my
job, is that aligned with at least three of these
items on this list at least three? Or is is
it only aligned with one, or maybe it's not aligned
with any of them at all? It's gonna be tough
to admit. And for most of you, I'm willing to
bet that if you're lucky, you're gonna have one item
on this list aligned with your career. For most of
you, it'll actually probably be zero, which is a big
problem right there. That's why I'm so passionate about life
purpose. And I've got other videos that talk about life
purpose. But I want you to start to become more
aware of just how much alignment or misalignment there is,
between your work and the stuff that you love the
most about life? Because if there's a huge gulf there,
I mean, man, how, how are you going to become
happy? How are you going to become successful, you can't
become happy, because all the stuff that makes you happy,
we just put it on the list. And by definition,
now, your job is not there, because you say it's
not so huge misalignment. Also, if you're justifying to yourself
that Well, that's because I'm doing this job, and it's
getting the money and success. It's getting you some money,
and it's getting you some success. But I'm willing to
bet if we aligned you with the stuff that you
actually love doing, you'd have much more long term success,
maybe not short term, successful long term success. Because that's
where your passion comes from your passion comes from this
list. If you're doing anything outside of this list, you
got to really seriously consider cutting that stuff. I mean,
why life is short as it is do the stuff
that's on this list here. Speaking of which, ask yourself
the next question, How about my hobbies? And my relationships?
How well aligned? Are those with the items on this
list? Is there a correlation, or are all my relationships
and all my hobbies somehow different from the subs on
this list? If it is, then that's stuff you got
to change in your life. Any misalignments you're seeing here,
that's all stuff you got to change. This isn't gonna
change in one day, not in a week, it might
take you a couple of years. But in order to
get that process going, I find you have to be
honest with yourself. And I see that a lot of
people aren't honest with themselves. It was really hard for
me to, to realize some of these misalignments five years
ago, I recognized some huge misalignments. And, you know, it
was tough to admit those. And I had to go
and work a lot worked for years and months, and
put in a lot of labor and money and everything
to get these alignments. But now I've got a lot
of stuff aligned, not perfectly, but I got a lot
of stuff aligned, because I've been working on it real
hard. And my life feels so much better. Now this
alignment has taken place. So I'm really big on this
idea of alignment. And finally, what I want you to
do at the end of this video, I want you
to sit down next to each item on this list,
one through 10, I want you to ask yourself up
each item one by one the following question. How can
I honor this activity more in my life? So for
example, for me, thinking about concepts and understanding reality better.
That's something that's really important. I love that. How can
I honor that more? Well, one of the things lately
that I know I should be doing, but I've been
slacking off on I should be journaling more, I should
be jotting down my thoughts, my notes more, because to
me, that feels really good. It helps me clarify things
on paper in a way that I can in my
own mind, it helps me draw these connections. It also
helps me to deliver more content to you to shoot
these videos because when I write that stuff down, it
doesn't get lost. I can then come and discuss it
here more easily. So for me like that would be
one action item is just journaling more consistently developing a
habit of that. If, for example, one of your items
on your list was to to love color and vision
the way that I do and that's one of my
items. And one thing that I could do there is
you know, I don't spend And nearly enough time appreciating
art, I don't spend nearly enough time really studying graphics
the way that I used to in the past. And
that's something that gave me a lot of satisfaction. So
one of the things that I've been wanting to do
lately is there's this game on on the iPad that
I wanted to play that's got like these very amazing
visuals on it. And so I've been holding off getting
that because I don't have an iPad anymore, I sold
my old iPad. And so now, I can't play that
game. But I was thinking like, I should really probably
go out there to get a new iPad and play
this game, just because to me, it's like looking at
those visuals that might give me some like interesting ideas
like that satisfies me on a creative level, in a
way that few other things do. So to me that's
like an inspiration, a source of inspiration and creativity in
my life is, is looking at beautiful graphics or art.
So that's what I want you to do is I
want you to come up with ideas like this. And
they don't have to be massive, right. So this doesn't
mean that if you have some item on the list,
now you have to go climb Mount Everest, you don't
need to do that. In fact, it's better if you
start small, start with a couple of little very practical
things, maybe you could do it right now, at the
end of this video, just some little change you could
make to honor each one of these a little bit
more in your life. And then of course, after you
finish making that list, then you gotta strive to go
out there and actually do it. Alright, so this is
it. This is how to love your life a little
bit more, I think this is this kind of activity
you should be doing on a quarterly or at least
an annual basis so that you're reconnecting, because it's so
easy to get lost nowadays, in the mundaneness of life.
