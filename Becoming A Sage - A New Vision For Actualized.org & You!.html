hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about becoming a sage
the ultimate vision for your life as I'm evolving actualized
gorg must evolve as well and over the last three
or four years that I've been running actualized at org
I've been releasing lots of content about how to improve
yourself and how to self actualize and I'm still really
into self actualization but I want to take it to
the next level because I'm always looking for that next
level vision that will inspire me to work towards my
full potential and that will inspire you to work towards
your full potential in life because I'm really passionate I'm
always really passionate about getting the most out of life
that's just been like a question that's been burning in
the back of my mind since I was a kid
and the stuff that I learned of last three years
you know I've been doing a lot of research and
the more research I do the more of a big
picture understanding I see of what the hell is going
on here in life in society in culture with psychology
with business with politics all the pieces start to fit
together and they all make sense in a very beautiful
sort of way and as you start to see that
picture or at least as I do um I just
kind of get this muse that tells me like okay
here's how I should realign what I'm doing with my
work and my own life in order to get the
most out of my life and so it's time to
refine a little bit what actualize that work is about
and the way that we're going to do that is
let me try to get to explain a little bit
of where I'm coming from with this so ask yourself
this question what's the best life possible what's the best
life possible for a human being now maybe you think
that's a question that can't be answered but what I
would suggest is actually that it can and it has
been answered and it's been answered for thousands of years
the only problem is that most human beings are in
the dark about this you're not taught this school so
what here's what you can do you can go and
you can do the research you can read books you
can study biographies you can study psychology you can ask
this question of yourself for years you can read philosophy
books and stuff like that and here's what you'll discover
you'll discover that the greatest human beings who ever lived
were not entrepreneurs they were not celebrities they were not
athletes they were not political leaders they weren't CEOs they
were not engineers nor academics nor scientists nor artists nor
self-help teachers they were sages and mystics these are the
greatest human beings who ever lived and I'm not using
the word great here in the sort of social sense
we say oh yeah that's great as though that person
has a lot of status like a celebrity all he's
really great he's amazing because he's Tom Cruise or something
no not like that what I mean is great in
the sense of who gets the most juice out of
life that's the question that's really well it should be
at the at the top of the list of questions
we ask in life right how do you get the
most juice out of life I mean we're born we're
not even sure how we're born what we're born into
what the hell is this thing here we are it
seems like this is a fleeting phenomenon this thing we
called life if so if I only have this one
life then I better make the best use of it
um and if that's the case what is the best
use of this one life becoming a sage and that's
the purpose that I want to orient actualised work to
not just self-help not just self-actualization although that's a beautiful
concept and for most people that would be transforming but
even more than that to become a sage and I
want actualize that org to be a how to become
a sage channel or how to become a sage website
where basically I provide you with sort of resources for
how to become a sage because that's an interesting question
once you decide on this idea that I want to
become a sage then it's like well damn that's that's
a pretty tall order to fill how do I fill
those shoes what's the process there and believe it not
you can study this you can study how to become
a sage and then you can do it what's crazy
though is that as kids you know as kids we're
presented with choices like what do you want to be
when you grow up well I want to be like
a firefighter a doctor an astronaut this sort of stuff
right but nobody ever presents you the option as a
kid to become a sage man what I wouldn't give
to have been presented that option when I was like
5 years old I didn't even know that that was
a possibility and really I only found out it was
a possibility just a few years ago from doing lots
of research and I think that most people don't know
but if more people did know I think they would
really be on board because it's an amazing vision what
I want to do here is I want to share
with you the vision of what being a sage is
all about and what it means to be a sage
but as far as actual eyes that are goes I
really wanted to sort of be like sage University if
you wanted to become a sage where would you go
well basically most sage is how do they do it
they just figure it out by themselves they kind of
stumble through it or they find a guru or whatever
you know yeah you can you can find people out
there who will sort of teach you but it's really
hard to like pick up a book that tells you
here's the steps you have to follow to become a
sage here's have to think here's have to talk here's
have to walk here's what you have to eat and
so forth but it's funny you could write a book
like that um I don't know how many people would
buy it though because most people don't even have the
notion that becoming a sage is something that's worthwhile to
pursue and also you know become this age isn't easy
it's hard work so if we do the hard work
to become a sage why are we doing it well
probably because there's some sort of big payoff on the
end right and I'll talk about what that is so
actualize that org is going to be sort of like
sage University and kind of I just want a catalog
like I'm interested in cataloging all the conceptual frameworks and
models and techniques and methods that are necessary to become
a sage and since I'm doing this for myself since
I've discovered this so the reason I share this with
you is because basically I've this what I decided on
in my own life is that I'm becoming a sage
um and so that's what I'm after and now I'm
trying to document that I wish I could just have
like a camera following me around everywhere I go and
sit inside my head and then you could just get
a feed from that and watch it and like okay
yeah this is this is the process right because I
think that um you know sages have been being made
for thousands of years but no one has really documented
the process of making a sage or at least you
know it's little known about and even if there are
techniques and methods and stuff from the past it tends
not to resonate with modern-day people we tend to think
like well sages sages existed 2,000 years ago it's like
they don't they don't exist now that's not possible these
days is it um and yeah it certainly is certainly
is so let's backtrack a little bit and talk about
what it really means to be a sage what does
this word mean I'm going to use the word sage
and mystic here interchangeably even though we could split hairs
and maybe in the future all go in and distinguish
these two but for now sage / mystics sort of
the same thing for me so we can take a
look at the history books and we see people like
the Buddha Christ Heraclitus Socrates Mahavira Piero Marcus Aurelius epictetus
Diogenes Confucius Shuang Hsu rumi Yogananda Gandhi and here now
we're starting to get into the more modern stages so
you can see we have the ancient ones from thousands
years ago we also have more modern ones that are
just like a hundred years old you know like Gandhi
Robin of Maharshi nisargadatta and then we have the really
modern ones which are still alive like the Dalai Lama
Osho Osho is not alive anymore but he died like
in the early 90s fairly recent Sadhguru is a favorite
modern state of mine Ravi Ravi Shankar Ken Wilber I
consider sort of a stage Peter Ralston I consider a
modern sage and I mean this list could be a
lot more exhaustive this is just the tip of the
iceberg but many of these names you probably don't even
know haven't even heard of you need to go research
them and I encourage you to go read and research
about these sorts of people it's inspiring because if you
are going to be becoming a sage while you want
to take a look at what do these people really
do how do they live how were they different than
the average person it's not a matter of success it's
not a matter of achievement that's not what makes these
people great it's a quality of self mastery I would
say I mean there's more to it than just that
but if we just kind of gloss it over it
be something long lines of self mastery I've actually been
very fortunate to meet uh some modern sages that are
alive right now and I've been really blown away and
inspired by the kind of life that they live not
because their life is flashy and the average person would
look at this sage and say oh well what's the
big deal so what does pert this this is your
person who you say I should emulate that's because you're
looking at the surface right and the real juice in
life has gotten on the inside and it's really hard
to gauge someone from the inside but when you do
if you ever are lucky enough to encounter a modern
sage uh you'll get it like you'll just instantly get
it they have a way of speaking a way of
thinking a way of relating with you that's just completely
different than the average human being and it's a subtle
thing it's an ethereal thing it's hard to pin down
what that is you sort of have to have this
intuitive radar inside you to see the other person to
say yeah that's the real deal that guy right there
is the real deal and that's just amazing how did
he do that how can I do that what would
it be like if my life was like that why
wasn't I living my life that way from the very
beginning and why didn't my parents teach me this and
why didn't my teachers teach me this why did my
professors teach me this why didn't my Kawai is nobody
in society talking about this and I mean they are
to be fair they are a lot of it is
talked about in religion the problem is that religious distorts
it and actually turns a turns the virtues of a
sage upside down inside out which is you know one
of the problems because religion originally its aim was supposed
to be to deliver these teachings to you the problem
is of course that once the ego gets hold of
religion and of these teachings it goes downhill real fast
yeah I've just been blown away by some of these
people that I've met just absolutely blown away when you
meet a person like this you get the sense that
this is a true master not of any technical skill
or a technical art not a meditation master that's not
what I'm talking about just like a true master of
being human of being an excellent human being a master
of that a master of understanding reality in life and
it's deeply inspiring deeply and you can see in this
person that this person is actually able to enjoy life
as it is they're able to enjoy life to really
enjoy life and that this is really what um being
a human is all about and yet we're so disconnected
from this if we're the average human being some of
the key qualities that I see in such sages are
a commitment to truth with a capital T a commitment
to consciousness to goodness and to love and a deep
mastery of these things to the point where it's embodied
effortlessly they're not trying at it it's embodied effortlessly and
I also see within them a radical turning inward radical
turning in work to completely transform themselves from the inside
out and when you see the fruits of that transformation
it can be subtle but also shocking on the surface
they look very normal they don't have a halo around
them or anything like that but also you can quickly
see that there's nothing normal about it there's nothing normal
about their relationships or about their were their relationship to
to society or how they think about themselves or how
they communicate and this here goes way beyond just enlightenment
you might think like well Lea aren't you just talking
more about enlightenment if I get enlightened this is what
I'll have no no you won't there's a big difference
between being enlightened having one or two enlightenment experiences and
being a sage proper a masterful sage big difference so
that's something we'll talk about more in the future uh
for now let me share my vision with you of
what I want you to kind of focus on if
you want I'm not saying you have to do this
this is just something that I think you would want
if you knew about it becoming what I envision as
the modern mystic sage what does that mean exactly that
means basically we're taking Eastern non-duality and we're pairing that
with a source sort of like ancient Western Greek philosopher
so take like the Zen master yogi from the East
paired with an ancient Greek philosopher from the West combine
them together maybe with a little bit of - of
scientist and a - of artists thrown in there and
now you've got this kind of like Renaissance man Renaissance
woman and this person is both a master of consciousness
but also has a very vast and deep conceptual understanding
- I see sometimes people swing the pendulum too much
in one direction or the next so it's like some
people are overly intellectual to the point of being closed
off to awareness and consciousness those are like the academics
and scientists on the other end of the spectrum you
have these people who are the New Agers who are
really into consciousness and stuff like that but then aren't
really grounded and don't have much conceptual knowledge and they
somehow see that as being a hindrance or spirituality no
really what you want is you want both you want
to be a union of left brain and right brain
and you want to do this in such a way
where you don't go live off in a cave but
more likely what you do is you will apply this
mastery of yourself and understanding the world to real world
problems so you're in the world you're living in the
world you're part of the world and you're also highly
creative and productive because one of the fruits of mastering
yourself is that you also master your own creativity and
you master all the blocks that you have to unleashing
your full creativity and all the blocks you have towards
being productive so those become more and more effortless for
you and they become more more magical and more fulfilling
so that's kind of my vision for you now it's
also important to Singlish what a sage is not don't
confuse this a sage is not a cold smart-aleck intellectual
or academic who just lives in theory land and just
studies a bunch of stuff and knows a bunch of
stuff but then has no knowledge of himself his emotions
no mastery of relationships no mastery of of his body
his energy and all the sort of stuff there's a
big difference there and also um a sage is not
an ideological Crusader sometimes I run into these sorts of
people like they call them they like to call themselves
skeptics or rationalists or libertarians or whatever and they're there
on some sort of ideological crusade to convert the world
to their point of view whatever it happens to be
and there they also seem to be intellectual right so
they like to intellectualize a lot and so in practice
the end of being stuck in their own head and
then this sort of ideological crusade actually is a pretty
ugly thing when you look at it doesn't have much
compassion love or really understanding and it shows little self
mastery these people are mostly oriented outwards at converting others
rather than really looking inwards in themselves there's no radical
turning inward in these people not really so at this
point you might wonder well leo okay how do I
become a sage let's say I buy into this vision
how here we have to be a little careful because
the vision is more important than how this is always
the case with a big ambitious vision when you have
a giant ambitious vision you don't know the how imagine
a kid who's like seven years old and he tells
you you know daddy I want to be a an
astronaut and then you ask him well how how are
you going to become an astronaut that would be the
wrong question right because it's not important for the kid
to know the technical steps of how to become an
astronaut right now what's important is for him to have
the vision or you know maybe if astronaut sounds too
far-fetched yeah maybe he wants to be a doctor so
and then if if he asked okay so I want
to be a neurosurgeon how do I become a neurosurgeon
what would you tell him well you could give him
a very rough outline you could say okay so if
you really want to be a nurse or here's how
it's gonna work you're gonna go finish elementary school then
middle school make sure you're doing good in your academics
because when you get into high school you really want
to ace all your tests and all the hard classes
get a really good portfolio and resume sort of going
so that you can get accepted to a nice university
go to the best university you can do you know
undergrad get into medical school do six eight years of
medical school then do your rounds as a doctor then
get an official position in a hospital then maybe take
some more classes and stuff and go to these seminars
and learn this and read all the technical journals study
all this stuff learn all the medicine learn all the
surgery techniques practice on cadavers and stuff and then finally
you become a neurosurgeon now there's even that I mean
that's helpful to know right that's a broad outline but
that's still so generic it's gonna be hard for you
to use that to really become a neurosurgeon you ultimately
are gonna have to figure out every single technical step
and there might be 10,000 technical steps Brad to become
a neurosurgeon so that's the same kind of approach you
want to take here with the how to become a
sage don't turn it into simplistic of a of a
question this is really what I want to be talking
about for hundreds of hours going forward with all my
work and all my content is how to do this
I want to be sharing techniques and resources and intellectual
understanding that you need and um sharing stories of other
sages and stuff that I doing in my life and
so forth it's like so through that you will understand
the how okay but what's more important than knowing the
how is the vision don't underestimate how powerful a strong
juicy vision is for moving you towards something if you
have a strong enough vision and you're committed to it
the how will solve itself people with a weak wobbly
vision need a lot of reassurance that the how is
practical and realistic and it'll actually work they need a
lot of guarantees they need a one two three step
formula for how to do everything people with a strong
vision will motivate themselves and they will find a way
and they are the ones who are going to succeed
so if serious about this I encourage you to first
start by working on deepening your vision for this of
why this is important to you what this could mean
for your life why you want this consider all the
other possible alternatives and then drill it into your mind
but let me give you a broad outline of the
how anyways because I know you're curious firstly you're going
to want to set your top value as truth because
that's fundamentally what a mystic or a sage is about
truth and understanding its truth for truths sake not truth
as a tool towards something you see truth for truth
sake you have to be curious really curious about the
truth even at great cost and inconvenience to you so
that if you're presented with a choice like well should
I go out tonight and party with my friends and
maybe get laid or should I sit home and maybe
meditate to find out what's true you choose to meditate
rather than go out party of your friends and get
laid the only way you can make that choice is
when you really want truth rather than sex or fun
or something else see so that's important also a radical
turning inward as I've said is necessary so this requires
a rejection of culture and society freeing yourself of materialism
which is I mean you're you're knee-deep in materialism maybe
even neck deep in materialism based off our modern culture
and society and you have to free yourself of all
that in order to become a successful sage and then
really what begins is the bulk of the work which
is the purification of your body your mind your emotions
and your habits the spiritual purification of your body mind
emotions and habits that's the bulk of spirituality true spirituality
that's the bulk of consciousness work it's not having an
Enlightenment experience having a few enlightenment experiences is not the
hard part that's actually the easy part the hard part
is then taking that insight or that understanding that you
have during one of these and you know in alignment
experiences and then embodying it and living it in your
everyday life in your relationships and your career with your
family with your children with with your nutrition with your
fitness with all this stuff right that is the process
of spiritual purification that takes decades takes decades and to
really become a master of that is to become the
sage to have mastered that process I mean it's an
ongoing process it'll continue for the rest of your life
but after a few decades if you do it properly
you will reach a point of mastery you know 10,000
hour rule sort of thing well that applies here you're
not going to do it with just one or two
enlightened experiences you're not going to do it that way
also as your attica turning inwards you're developing a strong
energy body what does this mean this is a super
important concept which I'll cover separately in it I'll cover
separately in another episode but developing a strong energy body
basically means that you can take emotions that are sort
of coming at you from the outside and then you
can you can take them and I'm especially talking about
negative emotions here you can take a strong negative emotion
that's coming from the outside and you can Alka Mize
it and convert it and just kind of like it
moves through you as if you were made out of
like a cloud of gas you become imperturbable and impenetrable
not in the sense that you reject or deny emotions
or that you're unemotional no you've got plenty of emotions
you feel emotions more than most people do but you
have developed such a strong energy body that for example
when someone says something mean about you or someone unfairly
does something cute like like steals your car or you
know hurts you in some way or maybe steal something
from you or you know divorces you something like that
that would really sting or someone close to you like
a friend of yours dies that would really stink but
your energy body is so strong that you can take
that on and you can actually convert it transmute it
into love and truth and you can embody and you
can feed off of that that's one of the hallmarks
of a true master in this domain is that they're
able to do that that really shows your mastery because
that's not something that happens on the level of understanding
or intellect but that happens on the level of your
entire body and how energy flows through your whole body
I'll talk more about energy in the future also what's
required is massive theoretical learning Oh show one of the
sages on my list is reported to have read over
a hundred and fifty thousand books sometimes you start to
study about enlightenment and it's like all enlightenment and lightness
tells us that thinking is wrong thinking is bad and
all conceptual knowledge is false all beliefs are false it's
not true all of it is illusion so books are
stupid I shouldn't read books anymore I shouldn't watch videos
any Martian learn anymore I should just sit and meditate
and that's the only truth ah this is a really
misguided notion of non-duality that's not what true non-duality is
about Osho is right over 150,000 books so I think
that um you could stand to benefit from reading a
few more books in fact you're not going to succeed
at becoming a sage without having a very strong theoretical
foundation of understanding what the path is what the challenges
are you're gonna have to read and study biography and
history and philosophy and psychology and this is it I
encourage you to to study and read and master all
that because you want to develop the biggest understanding possible
um actually not even because it's necessary but because you
as a sage your top value is truth and understanding
so what you're after is you're after a deeper understanding
and you know what enlightenment it reveal everything to you
there's much more understanding to be had beyond enlightenment also
you're going to need to seek uncommon knowledge to become
a successful sage uh you have to sift through a
lot of [ __ ] knowledge to find they're really
juicy tidbits and that's what I've been doing lately over
the last three years I've been sifting through a lot
of stuff a lot of is great but some of
it you know isn't that relevant to me becoming a
say just off the highest wisdom and that requires a
sifting process you know thousands of hours of of listening
and reading and note-taking and all this sort of stuff
this is necessary but the difference is that you're not
doing it like an academic who's just like learning and
filling his head with ideas and theories that are ungrounded
but the emphasis here is on application so everything you're
learning you're you're seeing how does this help me to
master myself to raise my consciousness to embody love and
truth more in my life also raising of awareness is
going to be necessary so you need in your getting
meditation habit probably multiple meditation habits are going to learn
many different meditation techniques self inquiry contemplation techniques are going
to do a lot of that that's kind of your
bread and butter as a sage and not just about
what you are and who you are but about many
other things what life is what people are what animals
are what sentience is what language is what truth is
what falsehood is what illusion is what society is what
politics is what human beings are these are all questions
for you to ponder for many many many many many
hours to get to the real bottom of them to
really understand them also exploring non-ordinary states of consciousness will
be very important for the sage this is one of
the things that distinguishes a sage from an academic or
an intellectual and academic or intellectual is just operating on
the same level of consciousness just ordinary consciousness he's just
feeling ordinary consciousness with a bunch of facts and experiments
scientific experiments uh that's leaving out the entire domain of
non ordinances of consciousness right this is stuff you can
experience through psychedelics through special breathing techniques through meditation techniques
through contemplation techniques and so forth however you want to
do it it's important that you do do it so
that you realize that this ordinary state of consciousness waking
state of consciousness that this is um this is one
of many many many different states of consciousness that are
possible and not the highest by any means also being
creative is important I think for a sage listening to
that music side of you and then living that out
and not just being someone who knows a bunch of
stuff but who's creative who's using that to some positive
benefit for the world however that will manifest for you
you know whatever your favorite method is and I have
a whole course my life purpose course which specifically addresses
how do you be creative in the way that's most
meaningful to you and how do you turn that into
a career that's a deep topic also to become a
sage you have to be a big-picture thinker a holistic
thinker that's another thing that distinguishes a sage and a
mystic let's say from an academic or scientist an academic
recite is concerned with one little narrow field and they
try to master that in a very technical way but
they don't really connect that field to all the neighboring
fields and then to larger life they don't really have
a big working understanding of life just their little field
the opposite is true for the sage also you're going
to need to develop unconditional love and compassion indiscriminate love
and compassion compassion for human suffering this is a very
important thing otherwise you're not really a masterful sage one
of the things I heard on my forum just today
someone would put a topic up there and said something
like oh yeah you know I've been pursuing this enlightenment
stuff and raising my consciousness and now I've realized it's
all an illusion it's all a [ __ ] dream
life is just a [ __ ] illusion you know
[ __ ] this let it burn to hell I
don't care anymore don't give a [ __ ] now
I just I'm just I'm walking around and being obnoxious
to my family because I don't give a [ __
] about anything anymore no no no no that is
a newbie trap on this path that's not what I'm
talking about that shows an utter lack of consciousness and
a lack of self mastery you could have a little
bit of awareness but we're talking now to be a
sage you know we're talking about orders of magnitude more
awareness to the point where you really have deep compassion
for the suffering of others you have a deep understanding
for how all the aspects of life work and you
don't get triggered by them you don't get angry at
them you don't criticize them you're not ideological about them
you're actually embodying and you're taking all of it in
as you and you're developing indiscriminate love for reality that's
a very difficult thing to do I hope you can
appreciate how difficult that is going to take a lot
more than a little bit of meditating or a few
enlightenment experiences to get there and lastly I would say
to become a sage you're going to probably want to
help others raise their awareness as well that's going to
somehow figure into your life purpose one way or another
um but don't take that to mean just the very
obvious ways in which where awareness can be raised like
I'm not saying that you're having to have to now
become a meditation teacher or a Zen master or a
someone like me we know shoots videos for a living
or something no those are like the most obvious ways
to help raise awareness there are millions of ways to
raise awareness and to help people develop consciousness you could
do it in technology you can do it in the
medical field you can do it in entertainment you can
do it with comedy you can do it with art
you can do it with science I mean there's no
end to it in fact one of the greatest challenges
that we face in the 21st century is nowadays we
have a lot of fields from history to philosophy to
science to medicine to politics to all this stuff to
art but there's a lot of lack of consciousness in
all these fields take a look any field give me
any field and I'll point out the huge gaping lack
of consciousness in that field from art to entertainment to
politics to science to history to all of it right
we are intellectually far more developed than we are spiritually
or emotionally developed as human beings and this might lead
to the entire radication the human race maybe or even
the entire planet who knows they can get pretty bad
so the the world is at a point where we
really need people to infuse all these different fields and
careers and businesses with a lot of consciousness and awareness
that presents opportunity for you so that's the broad outline
of how to become a sage now that's the vision
now this vision isn't for everybody even though from my
point of view I think that if you forced people
to become sages once they did become sages they would
look back and say oh my god I'm so glad
that you forced me to become a sage because my
life is like incomparably better than it would have otherwise
been no matter what I did but of course you
know we can't do that we don't want to really
do that this is something that you have to want
to do you have to be excited about this this
has to be like a calling for you and you
know I know that it's not for everybody this is
a narrowing of actualize I work a specialization of actualize
that organ eating right so for those people who really
want to become sages you'll find some amazing content here
in the future and for those who don't you'll still
find useful content but also it will probably be a
little less maybe practical than you were otherwise hoping for
then you might want to turn to some regular self-help
advice that's what stuff and that's fine you know different
people have different desires different values different genetics different upbringing
so we have to account that some people don't want
to be sages but for those who do I think
that there's a lack of resources out there when you
agree I mean you don't like turn on the TV
in the morning it's like hey how to become a
sage here's a commercial become a sage just order this
product or go to this store and you'll become a
sage we'll show you how no right it's unthinkable it's
funny it's unthinkable and yet that's what society should be
like if you think about it what's just society be
you're born and then it's like every [ __ ]
thing you do you go to the store you go
to the supermarket you go meet your friends really it
should all be about like here let me help you
to become a sage we should all be becoming sages
together that would be the most amazing life but life
doesn't work that way does it now let me address
a couple of questions and objections so one might be
Leo but what about your life purpose course so you're
talking about becoming a sage and it seems like this
is now better than the life purpose thing what do
I do with my life I just found my life
purpose or I'm thinking about taking your course and now
it seems like all that is called into question no
not really don't take becoming a sage or enlightenment as
stopping you from having a life purpose that would be
failing to really embrace the paradox of it yes enlightenment
tells you that there is no purpose to life and
that it's an illusion but you know what take a
look at the most enlightened people they are also the
most life Purpose Driven people ever ever take a look
at Buddha take a look at Jesus take a look
at Gandhi take a look at him Oh show you
know these people are very driven people very passionate people
their life is their work and their work is their
life so here's what I would say to you if
you're considering life purpose course or if you're already taking
it or if you already took in it here's how
to reconcile this little paradox the life purpose course is
helping you to find your career and the way in
which you want to be creative that's a good thing
find that you don't want to be enlightened working at
a 7-eleven all right because that's otherwise what you'll have
you'll be enlightened at 7:11 um you don't want that
you want to be enlightened and doing creative artistic stuff
that you love to do self expressing and getting paid
for it this vision I'm presenting to you here about
becoming a sage what this is about is sort of
like your personal purpose so think of it as having
you have a career purpose than a personal purpose your
personal purpose is that even if you didn't work a
day in your life ever again you would still have
the aim of becoming a sage and self actualizing and
self mastery basically but given that you probably will be
working for thousands and thousands of hours in your life
you probably want to make that work nice and meaningful
to you rather than just working at a 7-eleven so
if you want to do that well check out the
life purpose course that's what that's for right so there's
no real contradiction here the contradiction is on the surface
believe it or not it's possible that all of life
is an illusion but you still have a purpose because
you create the purpose the purpose is not something that's
inherently true the purpose is something you construct okay it's
a construction now just because it's a construction doesn't mean
it shouldn't be constructed if it if it you know
floats your boat if it tickles you if you enjoy
it then do it that's all the reason you need
it doesn't need to be true in some sort of
existential sense for you to do it the next objection
is but leo all of this is an illusion this
is an illusion so how can you be talking about
becoming a sage isn't that all just illusion more illusion
Lyman tells us that all this stuff is ilusory we
shouldn't be pursuing spirituality like this because that's just part
of the egos thing you know it's spiritually enough don't
get this wrong don't get this wrong to master yourself
to become fully conscious of everything that's possible as truth
to become a sage or a mystic you need to
take this enterprise very [ __ ] seriously this is
not a joke the people who are the most advanced
stages and mystics they have devoted their entire lives to
this and you think they did this what on a
[ __ ] whim you think they just said oh
it's just yeah it's all an illusion so I'm just
gonna sit back and do what I'm going to [
__ ] eat Oreos while watching cartoons you think that's
what they did no they were very [ __ ]
serious about it against one of the paradoxes of it
right is that you're very [ __ ] serious about
self mastery even though you realize that it actually in
a sense is part of the illusion but you need
that you need a temporary objective right your objectives will
change on this path a lot but you need something
to get you motivated inspired in the first place because
without this vision what are you going to do I'll
tell you what you're going to do you're going to
do nothing you're going to do exactly what you've been
[ __ ] doing for the last 20 years of
your life which is basically just pissing your life away
diddling around with your family your friends and your co-workers
doing [ __ ] work eating [ __ ] food
watching [ __ ] media entertainment and contributing to a
[ __ ] culture that's what you're going to get
if you don't take some radical action so if you
have to use a little bit of allusion to combat
the greater illusion then [ __ ] do it yeah
you're in the matrix and now you're starting to change
the matrix that's what great sages have always done even
though while they do that they realize that the matrix
is the matrix and that ultimately doesn't really matter one
way or another and yet they still have this sense
of purpose and they are still very goal-oriented about their
spirituality that's important not to get wrong because otherwise you're
not going anywhere you're going to have what you have
now and you ain't going to be spiritual you're going
to be [ __ ] materialistic and very unwise and
you're going to suffer for it all right so that's
my ranting about that now let me sum up by
just talking about what all this means for actualized org
content going forward in the future so here's what it
means it means deeper topics it means meta topics topics
about topics topics about how to learn on topics about
how to understand topic topics about how to think it
means bigger picture thinking topics it means um connecting more
diverse dots what I really want actually eyes that work
to be is to bring in many perspectives from many
different fields not just traditional self-help I want to bring
in philosophy history science and all this other kind of
stuff right there's so many interesting fields to bring in
I really want to take a look more at personal
growth from a historical perspective I think there's a lot
to learn there it's going to be this is going
to mean that the top is going to be more
abstract and more philosophical in nature and on the surface
they'll seem less practical there's going to be less hand-holding
less of me saying okay now you should do a
b c d e f g and now you got
your result less of that because that's the trade-off when
topics are bigger picture they're more abstract fact there's less
room and time for hand-holding that means more initiative and
intelligence and effort is required on your part to then
take the abstract stuff to get the understanding from it
and then to piece together a plan for how to
enact it and embody it in your life it also
means more focused on understanding me teaching you understanding versus
me teaching you success most self-help focuses on teaching you
success because that's what sells results in success but understanding
is more powerful because when you have understanding now you
have the flexibility to create or manipulate reality in whatever
way you want whereas of all your afters success you
can get success in a limited field but then you're
still not fulfilled by it you're still really chasing your
own tail in life you still don't see the bigger
picture of reality and why fulfillment doesn't come from success
you're still stuck in materialism you haven't really turned inward
it also means a longer time horizon is required from
you which means you can't think of the self-actualization thing
as like oh yeah I'll do it for a few
weeks or three months I'll get some results and that's
it no no it's like I'm investing 10 20 years
into the future by putting in the labor the time
the investment reading the books going to seminars meditating doing
all this stuff you know you got to have a
long time horizon here you're making a big investment to
get a big payoff but not next year but maybe
in five or ten years that requires wisdom on your
part because most people the way they invest is a
stupid sort of investments like all invest now only if
I'm guaranteed a return tomorrow and with that kind of
investing strategy you're never going to earn a lot also
this means that topics will be more spiritually oriented less
materialistically oriented of course they're going to be more advanced
and more nuanced less mainstream and more niche now um
don't get too excited or too worried because this is
not going to change overnight I'm kind of outlining a
plan again I have a long time horizon for what
I want to do with actual eyes that work so
this would be a gradual transition that you will see
me making over the next six months over the next
twelve months because honestly in my life I mean becoming
a sage is what there's like there's no alternative what's
the [ __ ] alternate what else you gonna do
name me one other thing that's more worthwhile to do
with your life what I'm at the point where I've
studied enough stuff I've seen enough stuff I understand psychology
enough that I can see that there's no really um
better alternative so this is the way it has to
be for me and for my content right and my
content has to be a reflection of what I know
and what I'm studying myself because honestly there's [ __
] that I could talk about that I would have
talked about a year or even two years ago I
could have talked about some topic but I can't talk
about it anymore it's like still on my to-do list
but now I have to cross it off and not
talk about it because it's like I've outgrown that there's
like bigger things that have come to the forefront because
I've put many of the puzzle pieces together I can
kind of get a sense of the big picture of
what's happening here right and I'm excited to help you
to get that kind of big picture yourself so that
you don't need me or anybody else telling you what
to do so you're self-sufficient and you can sort of
figure this stuff out for yourself you don't have to
learn you know how to learn how to learn all
this stuff that you don't know to figure this out
and to become a sage alright that's it I'm signing
off if you like this idea post me a comment
down below um with whether you want to take this
on as a vision I'm still testing the waters here
I don't really know how many of you are into
becoming sages or not maybe this is something that's like
nobody [ __ ] wants this and then maybe I'll
have to change my mind about it but I think
we'll give this a shot so yeah click the like
button for me post your comments down below share this
up with a friend and come check out actualize that
order right here my website sign up to the newsletter
stay tuned for more videos in the future about how
to become a sage and we're going to really break
it down into many many interesting really profound insights about
how life works how reality works your role in all
that and then how to master yourself so that you
