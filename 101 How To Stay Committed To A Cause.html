            <ul>
    <li><b>Commitment as a Practical Act</b>: Leo discusses the concept of commitment, using the example of buying a pack of batteries to demonstrate its tangible meaning. He explains it's not only about saying you're committed, but showing it by taking actions aligned with your goals.
</li><li><b>Struggle with Limiting Beliefs</b>: Leo shares his experience of hesitating between buying a bigger pack of batteries, despite having the resources, due to subconscious limiting beliefs about money and scarcity. He highlights the subconscious resistance one might face when trying to internalize commitment.
</li><li><b>Keeping Options Open vs Making Decisions</b>: Leo talks about how sometimes, keeping options open might seem attractive, dubbing it as succumbing to resistance from the lower self. However, he emphasizes that there are times where one must make a firm decision and stick to it in order to demonstrate true commitment to their path.
</li><li><b>Internalizing Commitment</b>: Leo discusses the need to not only logically understand one's commitment but also to internalize it. He highlights the necessity of consistency between one's actions and their commitment, even when facing resistance.
</li><li><b>Practical Example of Commitment</b>: Leo uses the act of buying a big pack of batteries as an example of his commitment to producing more content. He shows how something simple as this can represent a major commitment, which he delays due to still working on fully internalizing his dedication.
</li><li><b>Resistance to Commitment</b>: Leo acknowledges that one might face resistance to commitment, both externally and internally. He suggests recognizing this resistance is part of the process and must be overcome in order to stay focused and committed.
</li><li><b>Committing and Recommitting</b>: Leo shares that commitment is an ongoing process. It's not something you just do once but continually reaffirm. He emphasizes that setbacks, lows, and negative thoughts are common, but you should resist the urge to quit or pull back on your commitment. He sees such resistance as tricks of the mind to keep you where you are, and thus you should use those moments to push through.
</li><li><b>Practicality of Commitment</b>: Leo demonstrates practical commitment through the purchase of 60 double-A batteries. In his case, this tangible act symbolizes his commitment to continue creating content. He urges others not to see these actions as abstract but as practical applications of commitment to their cause. Each person's way of showing commitment will vary, but the guiding principle is the same.
</li><li><b>Application of Abstract Principles</b>: Leo emphasizes that while his teachings may sometimes seem abstract, they are meant to be applied practically. Listeners need to interpret for themselves how to effectively implement these principles. In doing so, they gain a sense of power and start to see transformative, tangible results in their lives.
</li><li><b>Appreciation of Wisdom</b>: Providing further insight on abstract principles, Leo encourages listeners to value wisdom not just for its potential benefits but for its inherent power. He believes that understanding these principles can help align people with their higher selves, making them resourceful.
</li><li><b>Self-Mastery and the Self-Help Movement</b>: Leo sees self-improvement as a continuous process that aids in personal and professional development. He advocates for the idea of self-mastery, asking listeners to cultivate an appreciation for wisdom and apply it to their lives. He guides his listeners to his website, Actualized.org, for more exclusive content and self-improvement resources.
