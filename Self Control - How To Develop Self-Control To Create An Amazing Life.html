hey this is Leo for Ashe lized org and in
this video I'm going to talk about the concept of
self-control okay so self-control what is self-control why is it
important how do we get more of it in our
lives and what can it really do for us and
what are maybe some some strategies and techniques that we
can use to really boost the amount of self-control that
we have I'm glad that you're taught that you're listening
to this video and that you search for this because
self-control is one of the most important concepts to understand
in your life it's the one of the most important
contributors to your success and happiness in life and that's
why I found it actualized at Oregon that's why my
my motto is mastering your own psychology because I really
do believe that when you master yourself the whole world
opens up to you and by mastering yourself is creating
more self-control it's being able to discipline yourself it's being
able to direct your own life I'm pretty sure you
can understand without me going into all the nuances of
what kind of ramifications that can have for you if
you had more self-control if you had more self-control you
could have stronger relationships better love life you could have
much better health you could have a ridiculous level of
success with your finances you could have a really powerful
contribution that you leave behind and that you kind of
impact that you make on the world through the work
that you do this all starts with self-control and then
of course just how you feel in your life getting
rid of all the depressive episodes all the negative thinking
all the worry all the pessimism all the anger frustration
overwhelm getting rid of all that getting all those emotional
things handled and feeling excited and positive and proud and
joyful and peaceful well that is all the difference between
those two states and those two conditions though two types
of life is self-control is how much of it you
have so I would submit to you right now that
your life's work is self-control to develop self-control to develop
self mastery that is it and if it's not right
now for you then make it so it should be
this should be your life's work everything else is secondary
and everything else will fall into place once you have
self-control like I said your health your relationships your business
your money situation if you just work on yourself that
stuff will handle it stop looking for solutions in the
outer world start looking for solutions in the inner world
now this is the next point that I wanted to
make this is an incredibly powerful distinction and you will
need multiple exposures to grasp the significance of this but
I hope to make a dent in it right now
and this is the distinction between inner and outer world
this is so powerful what does this mean this means
that we really live simultaneously in two worlds on the
one hand you have the outer world of circumstances that
is right here right the outer world is the computer
that you're looking at the chair that you're sitting in
the house that you have or don't have how much
money you have in your bank account the relationship that
you're in or you're not in the country that you
reside in the city that you're in the kind of
shape that your body is in that is the outer
world what's the inner world the inner world is the
world of feelings emotions thoughts or to use one simple
term for all of it psychology it's your psychology it's
what's going on in here and this is powerful because
on the one hand it seems kind of obvious but
it's powerful on many deeper layers here's why it's powerful
is that we are constantly we're constantly concerned with what's
going out in the outer world so much so that
we are mesmerised and paralyzed by outer circumstance and it
destroys what's going on in here and of course what's
going on here is ultimately what you care about because
whatever you're chasing out there you only care about it
because of what it does to you in here think
about it that million dollars that you want to earn
yes you want to have a million dollars but in
the end you want to have a million dollars because
it does something for you and here it literally sends
out some chemical in here that's making you feel good
which is why you're pursuing it the same thing with
your relationship if you want to get married or you
want to find that awesome girlfriend or boyfriend why do
you want that yes you want it in the outer
world but ultimately it's going to come back and hit
you in the inner world it's that sense of love
that you want to feel it's a sense of happiness
that intimacy whatever you want that right so that is
the connection there and the problem is that we tend
to think that all the solutions and all the challenges
in life are out there they're out there right it's
the boss my boss is not as good as he
should be it's my spouse my spouse is doing crazy
things behaving in irrational ways it's the guy at work
who is not doing the job that he's supposed to
be doing it's the guy on my in on my
commute to work that cut me off and he was
being an right it's the fact that I have I
have no money in my bank account that's a problem
it's the economy the economy the politics the policies of
this country are not allowing me to do the things
that I want to do that's the problem well that
is the biggest trap that you can get caught in
in your life is to become a victim to outer
world and not pay enough attention to your inner world
because the people that are successful and have the kind
of life that they want and these are the people
that exercise self-control because I'm tying all this back to
self-control I'm going to tie it together really soon here
is that what they're doing is they're reversing the process
here notice the process outer world me being so focused
on the outer world that the outer world mesmerizes me
I am reacting to the outer world I am NOT
creating what I want I am a victim that's one
way that process can run here's the opposite way the
process runs I am a creator I have belief in
myself I have self-esteem I have resourcefulness I have Drive
I a vision I have goals I have self-control I
have discipline I have emotional mastery and now my inner
reality my inner world is so strong that I impose
it on the outer world and I change the outer
world to whatever I want it to be creator mindset
vs. victim mindset notice the difference there you feel that
power I get a sense of I get a surge
I get chills running up my spine when I even
say it because of the difference in power they're totally
different most people are stuck in the victim mindset most
people are too concerned about the outer world so let's
tie this back about self-control to be able to influence
the outer world you need to have your psychology mastered
when you master your own psychology becomes easier to influence
the world otherwise world is always influencing you now let's
talk about the next point which is why control is
really hard because developing self control self discipline is not
easy and this is why most people do not do
it and most people lives are is because they do
not take the proper steps to develop a self-control and
that's because there is emotional labor involved there is struggle
involved we building self-control here's why just really think about
it think about who you are as a biological entity
you are this this body and this mind let's say
you're this organism basically that's made up of trillions of
cells trillions of cells do you understand the complexity that
is happening there how many chemical and biological processes are
happening in your body right now just so you can
sit there and breathe for another five seconds just so
you can think just so you can interpret what I'm
saying to you just so you can see me the
complexity is involved there and think about the environment that
you're in in a sense you are in a hostile
environment you have differences in temperature you have threats your
survival you need food you need oxygen you need water
you have all these different needs you have psychological needs
you have physical needs if something goes wrong in the
outer world all the sudden this organism disintegrates you die
right this is a matter of life and death so
you are this complex organism and your brain is a
system for regulating you to make sure that you're balanced
and that the forces of life the forces of the
universe that you're in right the forces here right now
so that these forces do not kill you and so
that you are able to reproduce and create the next
generation so literally right now your brain is looking out
for things that it perceives might kill you right you're
walking down the street it's looking out that you don't
step out in the middle of the road and get
hit by a car the reason you're worried about paying
your bills because you linked that to becoming destitute and
living in rags on the street and catching some disease
there and then dying prematurely right the reason that you
care about your relationships is because you want to reproduce
and you're worried about finding a good a good partner
and you're finding a good match making sure that you
can have kids and making sure you have a nice
family you're looking out for those things and it's hard
to do that just think about what has to happen
it's almost like imagine your brain as being a thermostat
right a thermostat is a self-regulating system and what's happening
there is you have a negative feedback loop when it
gets too hot the air conditioning kicks in and it
brings the temperature down when it gets too cold the
heater kicks in it brings the temperature up to maintain
this equilibrium well your body these these trillions of cells
that you've got they all need to maintain equilibrium your
psychology needs to maintain its equilibrium and so to bring
this deep point home this equilibrium is difficult to maintain
inherently this is not an easy challenge to solve this
is actually a physical challenge think of yourself as a
thermostat except your brain is not controlling one factor its
controlling a million factors its controlling its control it has
to account for all the forces in your life so
much more complex and thermostat now think about the network
of connections that your brain has all these mini thermostats
thousands of them in your brain that are controlling for
your survival your reproduction the air that you're taking in
the success you're having whether you're approved at at work
your social status how hungry you are all these factors
are coming into play and all the need to be
somehow reconciled balanced out and turned into a course of
action that you're taking you know you're moving your hands
you move your mouth you're moving your lips you're moving
your body you're thinking certain thoughts that is guided by
this complex essentially thermostat that you have in your brain
that is trying to maintain a sense of balance and
so yeah that's that's hard I'm surprised that were as
good maintaining balance as we are but of course a
lot of us are not as good at maintaining balance
as we want to be and so that is why
you're following through on your gym that is why you're
following through on your diet plans that is why you're
following through on starting your business that is why you're
following through on your relationships is because you've got this
complex thermostat and it's doing it the best that it
can but that that self control it's difficult to develop
the way to develop it is through work you have
to develop emotional until you have to go out there
and you have to start thinking start introspecting start watching
yourself start building up a consciousness what happens is that
when you do this literally I mean I don't have
scientific proof for this but what I think is happening
kind of physically inside your brain is that you have
these various networks of neurons that are vying for control
and you notice this for example when you have a
decision to make and you don't know which way to
go you're kind of a split between option A and
option B and you have maybe one voice inside your
head saying well you should go do that it's going
to be great and you have this other voice inside
you're saying inside your head saying no that's not going
to work out it's gonna be horrible and you don't
know how to decide that's literally like you have you
have different forces that's that thermos that I'm talking about
is that you have these opposing forces one is saying
it's too cold the other saying it's too hot how
is it going to pan out well there has to
be a ward it has to be a clash going
on inside that's literally what's happening your brain that you
have clashing neural networks and they're vying for control some
of them sometimes went out other times others went out
but if you do personal development and you start to
bring more awareness into this you start to learn you
start to build knowledge you start to go out there
and you start to experiment and notice what happens when
you experiment and register that feedback really take it in
you start to get extra layers of control built in
your mind so you actually literally build up your prefrontal
cortex right here which is able to control for example
the different impulses that you have it controls whether you're
going to splurge on that doughnut that you know you
shouldn't be on splurging on it controls whether you're going
to keep up with your with your gym routine it
it controls where they're going to start that business you're
gonna have enough courage to start that business it controls
whether you're going to explode at your spouse in a
fit of a rage when they do something that that
bothers you or that you even want them to do
right so that is ultimately personal development is it actually
takes place on a physical level where you have these
neural connections being built and if you do this and
you build this up then you're always actively engaged right
you're always actively engaged in looking for opportunities to improve
yourself to grow what happens is that you start to
peel these additional layers and those build extra self-control into
you and you start to notice that you get more
and more ability to control your feelings more ability to
control your emotions more ability to control your behaviors more
ability to persist in spite of the fear to have
courage more ability to to learn more ability to introspect
to be very honest with yourself and this is a
great thing and it just kind of snowballs and you
sure to build more and more self-control on the other
hand if you're being undisciplined if you're not observing the
practices and you're not doing the things that you need
to be doing in life then what happens is you
kind of have the reverse process is that your brain
turns to mush your prefrontal cortex becomes weak and you
are not able to execute on the things that you
your Higher Self wants to execute on and so what
happens is that your lower self takes control over your
higher self and that is a very bad place to
be in in life because even though that lower self
got what it wants it got comfort it feels good
that higher self is still there it's not dead and
it wants you to be living to your full potential
and when you're not letting to your full potential you
feel guilty you feel horrible you feel like your soul
has been drained and that's one of the worst feelings
to have in life I definitely don't want that for
you so what are some things you can do to
build self-control because this was a deep kind of philosophical
almost metaphysical conversation we just had let me give you
some practical stuff one disciplined practice have disciplined practices that
means if you're getting up in the morning get up
at a certain time when you want to be getting
up that means if you have the intention to brush
your teeth and floss your teeth all the time you
know twice a day or whatever do that that means
you have intentions to meditate do that if you have
intentions to journal do that if you have intentions to
show up on work on time all the time do
that if you have intentions of of eating healthy do
that if you have intentions of going to the gym
do that and be very disciplined and consistent about it
that practice with whatever area of your life you point
it in if you're just discipline and you're executing consistently
that trains your brain it requires the build-up of prefrontal
cortex just to do it it's like going to the
gym and pumping your your your biceps it builds them
up that's what happens with your brain so have disciplined
practices and stay on top of those that's the bottom
line quickest way to build self-control is to follow through
on your discipline practices set a few new ones every
once in a while and build those up into habits
next unhook from media and stimulation you are over stimulated
right now most of you are over stimulated with television
radio gossip from your friends advertising negative influences from family
from friends all over the place you're over stimulated by
that stuff you need to unhook yourself from it get
back to your source spend some time by yourself in
solitude think about things be introspective raise your level of
consciousness when you do this you start to develop a
level of self control that's just amazing you cannot have
self control when you're plugged in when you're plugged into
the grid because what happens is that you're like that
you become your mind becomes a lazy slug and it
plugs into the grid and what you're looking for is
you're looking at for that cheap source of energy that
you can just plug into you just want to plug
into that TV and let go you just want to
plug in to that that chocolate ice cream and just
let go right you want to plug into that relationship
that comfortable relationship and just let go and you want
to you want to plug into to sitting there on
the internet all day and browsing forums and flaming other
people and leaving comments or browsing Facebook and chatting up
with your friends gossiping about the latest celebrity news you're
just plugging in you're letting your brain turn to mush
how can you have self-control and you do that you
can you got snip that stuff off cut it all
off spend some time thinking being alone introspecting coming up
with goals coming up with visions coming up with ideas
for what you want to accomplish in your life that
is how to start to get your self-control back all
right so I'm going to end it there that's going
to do it for self-control please like this share it

you and I want to go out there I want

all the nuances of the psychology of success and Happiness
as I research all this stuff and I bring it
to you your life can transform if you just listen
to it if you follow up with it and you
take some action on it so right now I want
you to take some action don't just let this video
fly by you and then go off watch the next

everything else will fall into place once I get that
handled
