hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about how awareness alone is
curative I'm going to show you a secret for how
to autocorrect any unwanted behavior more action isn't always the
answer despite what you might hear in self-development circles in
fact neurosis can be defined as the excessive use of
will force and action to try to change your own
behaviors and what this leads to is self sabotaging patterns
where you try to change something part of you wants
to change it and part of you resists changing it
and the net result is that you're kind of stuck
and you're dead in the water and you're not getting
the kind of results that you want in life and
then you're feeling guilty and bad about all these behaviors
that you have in your life that you don't really
want but then secretly you actually do want them which
is why they are still there in your life so
one way to overcome this is to really experience a
reframing about this this idea of how change is created
in your life and I want to share a very
deep insight with you a very powerful insight that can
totally transform your life as simple as it is if
you just start to apply it and what this insight
is is simply that awareness alone is curative let me
repeat that awareness alone is curative what this means is
exactly what it sounds like it means that you don't
necessarily need to plan and work really hard to let
go of unwanted behaviors in fact what it means is
that any unhealthy behavior that you have will autocorrect in
time merely through the process of observation which is what
awareness essentially is it's simply observation so we need to
draw a distinction here between you trying to actively change
some aspect of your life like maybe you're trying to
quit smoking or overeating or you're trying to become more
confident or you're trying to be more responsible with your
finances something like this right whatever your issue is doesn't
matter but usually it's like when you have this problem
you're looking for an active solution to it well there's
an interesting alternative and the interesting alternative is just to
take the light of your awareness and to shine it
on the problem trusting that with sufficient awareness the problem
will simply dissolve and that's it now what's really cool
and powerful about this method is that it doesn't require
you to really do anything it's extremely versatile it will
apply across the board to many many many many problems
you currently have in your life and you will have
later on in your life so this is a super
versatile technique and I'll show you all the different areas
in your life where you can apply it right some
really cool areas but first let's talk a little bit
about why and how this works and in fact a
an additional point I want to make about this this
principle right it's really a principle of advanced self development
work is that awareness alone is curative I want to
like program that into your mind so that when you
have a problem this principle comes up it's like oh
yeah Leo told me awareness alone is curative maybe I
can rely on that principle rather than relying on my
old neurotic knee-jerk reaction desire to try to change it
through force the additional kind of corollary to this principle
is that it's actually not possible to engage in an
unhealthy behavior while you're fully conscious this is a mind
blowing state and I want to give credit to Bill
Harris from Centrepointe who I learned this from I really
love this this corollary principle think about this actually if
you are trying to engage in unhealthy behavior whatever you
deem that to be so smoking drinking partying porn gambling
whatever and you can't seem to help yourself you can't
seem to stop it right what this principle is saying
is that the reason you can't stop it is because
you're doing it without awareness if you were to do
it with full awareness the behavior could not be continued
it would have to stop on its own accord now
that's a powerful principle don't just take me on my
word for it try it out for yourself this is
something you have to really test out now there's a
catch of course here and the catch is that for
this to work it requires constant awareness right a certain
duration of awareness you can't just be aware for a
second or a minute you have to be aware throughout
the whole thing so what this principle is saying in
practice let me give you an example is it saying
that if you're smoking and usually you and everyone around
you consider smoking to be on healthy activity so you
probably are aware that it's unhealthy but when you smoke
you're not really fully aware of it so with this
principles telling you is that if you were to smoke
without trying to change anything about how you're smoking without
trying to force yourself to stop if you were just
to smoke with full awareness fully consciously over and over
and over and over again you would not actually be
able to continue to put that cigarette in your mouth
at some point it would just hit you like a
lightning bolt to the head it's like wait a minute
what am I doing here what what am i doing
what am i thinking what am i doing and you
would just put it down because the awareness would reveal
the damage that this is doing to yourself to such
an extent that you couldn't really authentically genuinely continue the
behavior but for that to happen like I said the
catch the catch is that it requires constant awareness it's
not enough just to say oh yeah I know smoking
is bad for me and then just to continue to
smoke unconsciously that's not going to work the other catch
here with the the broader principle that awareness alone is
curative is that awareness isn't as easy as you think
it is you might think awareness oh that's that's easy
I got that handled I can do awareness leo ah
no you don't realize yet how little awareness you have
and in fact even though the principle is solid and
it works it works it's kind of like the law
of gravity it always works the problem is is that
you just don't have sufficient awareness to be able to
actually follow through on it that's the real catch here
and also it requires patience so this awareness it doesn't
work in five seconds and it probably won't work for
you in five minutes it requires a constant application over
time which you might not have that sort of patience
or that sort of consistency so that's the catch now
let me show you how this would work with a
real-life example so the example I want to use here
is going to be eating junk food but I want
you to realize that this is just an example and
that we're talking about a much broader principle and that
any other example you can think of that's sort of
along these lines will work just the same right so
take whatever problem you have whatever unwanted behavior you have
and just substitute it in your mind with the example
that I'm using so eating junk food how does this
work usually what would happen if like let's say I
have this bad habit of eating junk food and in
fact at one point in my life I did have
this habit so let's say I have this habit and
I really want to stop because I know it's not
healthy and I like how fat is making me so
normally what would happen normally I would go I maybe
watch some videos I'd read a book I take a
nutrition class or something and there they would tell me
no how bad it is that I'm eating this junk
food and so then I would guilt myself into like
oh well I shouldn't eat that cheeseburger and I shouldn't
eat that chocolate and I shouldn't eat that candy and
so forth right and normally what I would say to
myself then is I'd say okay I gotta really put
the screws to myself I gotta get serious here I
gotta take massive action I gotta go on a diet
I can't eat this stuff and I can't eat that
stuff it's all this is wrong I gotta eat like
healthy vegetables I got a really restrain myself I got
a like some and massive willpower and I gotta watch
myself like a hawk so I don't screw up that's
the usual a solution that we try and what happens
well it might work for a little while but then
what happens is that your willpower eventually erodes and you
give in and then the whole thing just gets shot
to hell and you're back in your old patterns within
a week or a month or something like that now
what would happen if you tried this alternative method that
I'm suggesting if you realized Oh awareness alone can be
curative now let me apply that to this situation and
what would that look like what it would look like
is something like this you're sitting at a nice restaurant
your favorite restaurant with all your friends on a Friday
night and you really want to splurge tonight so you
ordered the that you know the double extra greasy a
one and a half pound cheeseburger with double cheese and
double bacon and ranch dressing and barbecue sauce and a
big thing of fries and onion rings and you got
a thousand calorie milkshake and this is like your favorite
meal and you're just you know you're gonna splurge yourself
tonight because you worked hard all week so you're sitting
and you're you're going to eat this thing so what
you do is you let yourself order all this stuff
you don't prohibit yourself but you do it consciously so
as you're sitting there and you're ordering and you're telling
the waitress hey you know I'd like double bacon and
double cheese and extra ranch dressing and give me some
onion rings and all this stuff as you're ordering that
you're just doing it fully consciously with awareness and you're
trying to maintain an awareness throughout as you're placing your
order knowing full well what its leading to you know
what its leading to then when the waitress brings over
your your burger you're going to sit there and going
to eat it now you're going to do it not
like you normally would you're going to do it with
full awareness so here what you do is you you
look at this burger and just sit there and you
look at the grease dripping down from and you just
look at it with full awareness now as you're doing
this you're not judging yourself nor are you judging the
situation so you're not telling yourself this is bad I
shouldn't be doing this no just the opposite you let
yourself do it no judgments at all but you do
it with awareness right you see the grease dripping down
the burger and then you take your first bite and
you notice that bite going down and you already notice
that that bite there's something a little bit dirty about
it it doesn't feel quite right but anyways you know
it's also enjoyable so you notice that - and then
you take the next bite in the next bite and
you're just noticing how this thing is making you feel
and then you know as you're eating more and more
and more and you feel like all of a sudden
you're you're full now but still you're you know you're
taking more and more bites and so you just sit
there and you you mindfully watch that you observe it
and then you notice yourself starting to feel nauseous starting
to feel sick starting to feel heavy and sleepy and
achy and bloated and maybe you're having heartburn or indigestion
or whatever and you just watch that you don't judge
yourself you don't tell yourself this should be this should
have not happened this is wrong that whatever that this
is going to make you fat you don't do any
of that you just watch in silence and then when
you go home after you've consumed this giant meal you
watch yourself on your drive back home you watch yourself
how am I feeling with this giant meal in my
stomach and you just observe that and then two hours
later when you're sitting at home and you're so sleepy
you got to take a nap because of this giant
meal and you can't do your work or whatever you
just notice that - and then when you're going to
sleep and you're not feeling very good you have a
stomach ache you notice that you don't judge it you
just notice it and then when you wake up in
the morning and then you have to go to the
shower and you undress to go to the shower and
you notice that you have a big gut sticking out
you notice that and you're just fully aware of it
without judging yourself and then if you do that day
after day after day after day at some point will
happen is that you will become so aware of the
absurdity of the situation and how much damage you're causing
yourself that you're not going to have to force yourself
or guilt yourself into not eating that burger anymore what's
going to happen is that your friends one day will
invite you hey let's go out Friday night and you
know go to our favorite restaurant and order some greasy
food and you'll just say oh you know I don't
feel like doing that today because your mind would will
have by that point become fully aware of how much
suffering you're causing yourself so that's an example of how
you apply this see one of the really shocking things
you'll learn if you start to practice this principle in
your life is just how unaware you ordinarily are especially
when you're doing these unwanted behaviors really the only way
you can engage in unwanted and unhealthy behaviors is by
not being aware and usually there's actually mechanisms you have
that facilitate this right there's things you do when you're
doing something unhealthy to distract your awareness from the fact
that you're doing something unhealthy so when you sit down
at the television with a gallon bucket of ice cream
and your favorite TV show and you're gonna watch six
hours of it while eating ice cream well it's like
you kind of just get sucked into the TV show
you just kind of like totally let go you become
totally unconscious you surrender to it and that's the only
way you can do that that's the only way you
can sit through that highly unhealthy behavior right because if
you sat there for six hours fully conscious of how
much you're wasting your life how much you're wasting your
health all the other things you could have been doing
with your time and how higher consciousness you could have
been feeling then it would have been too painful for
you to continue that behavior you would have just had
to push the off button at some point so I
want you to start thinking how you could apply this
in your life where could you use this let me
give you a couple of qualifications and a couple of
pointers for how people make mistakes with applying this principle
so one big point of confusion that people make here
is that they assume that awareness is the same thing
as logical knowing it's not so a smoker logically knows
that smoking a cigarette is bad for them but that
doesn't really do anything that doesn't change their behavior and
you might know that eating a greasy cheeseburger that has
3000 calories of bacon in it probably isn't good for
your health you know that but that's not awareness awareness
is something very very different awareness is a in-the-moment observation
of what's happening knowing is something like a memory you
can just know a fact and store it in the
back your mind and you can then pull it up
once in a while that's not awareness awareness is right
now are you aware right now as you're engaged in
whatever activity whatever the activity is as you're engaged in
it are you aware of what you're doing and that
is a skill you have what we might call an
awareness muscle in your mind and this muscle is flexed
every time that you are being consistently aware and then
when you stop flexing the muscle your awareness just kind
of true goes away dies off and you go unconscious
for a few minutes or a few hours or a
few days or a few years you go unconscious right
and then it comes back again but this is a
muscle this the muscle can be trained ended to be
developed and it's very different from logical knowing so even
if you're a very smart person you know very smart
people can still have very bad behaviors because smarts don't
count for very much here what really matters is your
awareness muscle if you want to eliminate the deep underlying
neurotic needs that you have which are the sources of
these unwanted behaviors the only way to do that is
by shining and penetrating those with the light of your
awareness observation awareness here don't take it as some you
know fruity new-age woowoo concept it's really not it's just
observation it's kind of like you know if you went
outside and you wanted to observe the birds and you
just wanted to observe the mating pattern of birds in
the neighborhood what would you do you have to go
outside just like grab a lawn chair sit on the
lawn and just watch birds all day it would be
kind of boring it would not be very interesting but
as you were doing that eventually you would learn you
actually learn like oh that bird I've seen that bird
before that specific bird you know it has a little
feather sticking out of its head in a weird way
or it has like a broken foot or something I've
seen that bird before that happens just because you're observing
a lot after a lot of observation you become familiar
with things you start to see the patterns of how
things work that's the power of observation right that's very
very different than just reading in a book something about
a bird very different another qualification here is that being
aware is not the same thing as moralizing not at
all so remember that in this example that I gave
you with the eating junk food you're not sitting there
I'm not telling you to sit there and say oh
I shouldn't eat bad and this thing is super bad
for me no this bacon you know I've read in
a book that bacon is is terrible for my heart
and you know this is gonna make me so fat
and I don't want to be fat all of that
stuff that's not awareness that's actually unawareness moralizing is actually
one of the major unwanted behaviors that you should be
concerned about with unwire and one of the ways that
you can unwire moralizing is simply through awareness you don't
on wire moralizing through more moralizing you just observe yourself
moralizing until after a while after enough days of moralizing
and moralizing and moralizing you see wait a minute this
moralizing it's actually hurting me oh it's hurting me oh
maybe I should stop doing it and your mind will
release it will release the release will be beyond you
it will transcend you see the power of awareness is
that awareness comes from someplace deeper than just you you
as an ego sitting there as an ego you want
all these things in your life you're trying to set
up the perfect life for yourself you're trying to be
happy and you're trying to avoid misery and suffering you're
trying to do all this stuff but paradoxically what's happening
is that because you're trying to micromanage everything with your
ego the ego gets in its own way it's kind
of like a micromanaging boss that doesn't let a good
employee do his job right right a good boss has
to actually let go of control and just kind of
sit back and watch and once in a while he
steps in and gives a little bit of advice here
and there and basically he trusts the employee to do
the work that he's supposed to do but see you're
not doing that you're micromanaging as the ego that you
are because it gives you a sense of power in
your life it's just sense of control and you thrive
on that the ego thrives on that what has to
happen here is you have to let go of that
and just be aware and that's a foreign notion too
many people also another qualification is that awareness is not
suppression so I'm not telling you to suppress anything here
I'm not telling you to suppress your desires even the
bad quote-unquote bad or evil or shady desires that you
have I'm not telling you to suppress those so what
I'm telling you is actually quite the opposite if you
have a real desire to have sex or to watch
some porn or watch I know a six hour marathon
of your favorite show while eating a bucket of ice
cream do that do it don't hold yourself back as
you're doing it be aware though you see don't try
to stop yourself the mistake the very a big mistake
that people make when they're trying to be aware is
that as they're being aware they're also at the same
time manipulating their behavior to try to come uh to
the best outcome possible so it's like if you sat
down you know Kayleigh oh I'm gonna do what you
said so I'm sitting here with my gallon of ice
cream and uh I'm eating it a little bit and
I'm washing my TV and now Leo told me that
you know aware and slowed is cured so I'm going
to be aware of this but as I'm aware you
know wouldn't it also be nice if I just actually
like resisted it leo should I just resist it and
like tell myself to put it away and what I'm
telling yours no don't do that do what you naturally
want to do so if you naturally want to eat
the whole bucket eat the whole bucket but be aware
while you're eating the whole bucket notice that awareness here
is very hands-off activity it's like it's very passive it's
very passive it's almost scientific like I said if a
scientist was observing Birds outside and trying to describe accurately
their mating behaviors the scientists wouldn't go and run up
to the birds and try to interfere and force them
to mate by hand right that would beYOU that would
be totally against the scientific method because it's just it's
so artificial no the scientists would sit back he would
hide himself and he would try to make himself totally
transparent and invisible to the birds so that the birds
could do their thing and he could just bored these
the actual situation you just records it that's what I
want you to do I want you just to record
in your own mind exactly what's happening and that would
be you following this principle and then all you got
to do is you just gotta keep doing it consistently
and just trust the process trust that this principle works
and over time what you'll do is you'll prove it
to yourself now let's talk about how this can be
used in your life different areas of application basically it
works for any unwanted behavior or bad habit that you
have so of course over eating drugs drinking smoking porn
television internet Facebook social media this kind of stuff video
games procrastination shyness guilt perfectionism workaholism depression anger anxiety fear
OCD see it works for all this stuff and more
this is just a small list let me pick out
a couple of these and talk about them in a
little bit more detail so let's say for example you
have a shyness problem and maybe you were bullied in
school so you're kind of shy now ah and you
say you say Leo how do I solve my shyness
problem well rather than going out there and forcefully trying
to solve it in a desperate neurotic manner how about
we apply this principle so the principle is awareness alone
is curative so when you're being shy the next time
it happens to you in the moment actually just watch
yourself being shy notice the thoughts coming up in your
mind notice what those thoughts are doing to you to
your behavior notice the emotions that come up notice your
sweaty palms notice what's happening notice the people how they're
reacting to you notice what happens after the shyness disappears
so try to be fully aware through that shyness process
and what I would suggest is going to happen what
I would predict is that if you do that day
after day after day after day eventually you will reach
the pole where you will no longer be shy that's
pretty powerful pretty powerful but you have to be consistent
with it you have to actually practice awareness and you
have to not fall into all those traps that I
talked about what about depression Leo how do I cure
my depression what do I do what kind of forceful
neurotic action should I take well how about you apply
this principle and the next time you're depressed you just
sit there and you'll be fully aware of your depression
without trying to change it without trying to run away
from it without without trying to become happy somehow through
some kind of chemical and mechanical stimulation just be aware
of your depression be aware the thoughts that come up
while they're coming up notice all that it's not easy
to do you got to actually do it you got
to apply awareness to it that's challenging because if you're
depressed your awareness muscles are very weak but what I'll
guarantee you is the following if you do do it
and you become or stay aware longer and longer and
longer throughout every depressive episode that you have in your
life after a certain point the depression will become impossible
it will simply become impossible because what'll happen is you'll
become aware of how you are creating the depression as
crazy as that might sound to you but you are
creating it and you can become aware of it but
it will take patience and consistency on your part you
have to actually have a little faith in this process
and so on with things like fear if you have
fear about something like let's say you have a fear
of your kids doing drugs what do I do about
that Leo how do I stop my kids from doing
drugs well instead of getting them to stop doing drugs
what I would suggest is that you actually work on
your fear of them doing drugs and the way that
you do that is just to be fully aware of
the fear as it comes up so the next time
you have this fear just be aware what's happening what
thoughts are you thinking what images are going through your
mind be fully aware of that and over time this
problem will autocorrect and you won't need to force things
to happen so I hope you can see the power
of this right extremely versatile technique very foundational principle let
me wrap up a little bit by just kind of
going deeper into what's really happening in your mind with
awareness you got to realize that your mind is like
a thinking machine it's a complex very vast network of
thoughts thoughts and beliefs I've talked about this in other
episodes where I talked about the knowledge graph or another
phrase that I like for is this web of beliefs
that you have in your mind you have hundreds and
thousands of different beliefs in your mind thoughts these thoughts
are being triggered every single moment throughout your life you
can't really control it and this is one giant very
complex system this entire system is what creates your personality
and is what fuels many of the actions and behaviors
you take in your life so basically if you want
to start to create changes in this web of beliefs
what starts to happen is you have to notice you
have to start to become aware of how the system
works notice that that is different from trying to change
the system the system is so huge and so vast
that it's beyond your capacity to change this system tries
to maintain homeostasis it tries to maintain kind of a
status quo and it doesn't like when you go in
there and try to change stuff in fact what's happening
is that there is not a you who's sitting outside
the system who's trying to change the system what is
really the case is that you are the system so
how do you change yourself well that's really tricky if
what you try to do is the most kind of
like nine an intuitive thing is that you're going to
try to act from within this web of beliefs to
change the web of beliefs and if you try to
do that you're very likely to fail because thoughts will
not deeply change other thoughts if you want a real
deep change in this whole system what's required is awareness
the raising of awareness as awareness is raised this web
of beliefs starts to restructure itself naturally because actually the
reality of it is and now we're getting into some
very deep stuff but the reality of it is is
that this web of beliefs is sort of floating in
a giant sea of awareness the awareness is the only
thing that's outside you might say the web of beliefs
there's nothing else outside of it so the deepest thing
you can appeal to and the most fundamental thing you
can ground yourself in is awareness but notice that that's
not thinking that's not knowledge that's not belief that's not
moralization that's not ideology that's not dogma it's awareness and
to confuse awareness with any of these other things is
to get stuck in this network of beliefs that you
have and this network of thoughts and then it's really
difficult to create change in your life because the function
of this network is to maintain homeostasis and homeostasis is
not change change really truly comes from awareness and we
have a tendency naively to want to force a change
and we think that if we just apply enough force
in one part of the web of beliefs that that
will somehow make a dent but with what we don't
realize is that this web of beliefs is actually the
place from which the force is coming so the force
isn't coming from some outside magical location the force when
you're trying to apply force it's actually coming from a
part of the web of beliefs so what happens is
that it's like this self referential like twisted phenomenon right
this is where self-sabotage comes from it's like one part
of the Weber believed tries to turn against the other
part and then this part reaction turns against that part
and so you just have this like swirling vortex of
homeostasis in the end what happens is that the this
this web is so complex that every part adjusts itself
to maintain a certain balance and status quo which is
why the harder you try sometimes the less you succeed
the counterintuitive thing is to let go of that whole
enterprise and to just work on raising awareness and to
have faith that the change that you seek will come
as a natural byproduct of the raising of awareness and
not through some force applied within the system the system
is really helpless to change itself without awareness but this
requires a radical new way of thinking your web of
beliefs has to actually conceptually first grasp oh yeah I'm
not the only thing at work here there's something beyond
me here at work let me surrender to the thing
beyond see that has to enter into your network of
thinking which is why an episode like this can be
valuable to you because even though as I'm speaking to
you I'm giving you concepts and thoughts and beliefs and
you might say well Leo this is just more adding
more stuff to my network and it's not giving me
more awareness yes that's technically true but we have to
start somewhere right we have to get a little bit
of leverage somehow so ah the way we do that
is by feeding a little bit of the right kind
of beliefs and thoughts into your network and then hoping
that that will be enough for you to then trigger
that awareness and maybe aha right you have an aha
moment so a thought can lead to in a-ha moment
it can lead to an insight and those aha moments
are those insights that's what creates change those insights do
not come from thoughts those insights come from awareness that's
some deep [ __ ] I don't want to go
into too much detail on that I'll talk about that
later in other episodes because we get a little deep
here but I did want to give you this kind
of like deeper understanding of what's really going on here
when you're trying to change some of these unwanted behaviors
and why it's so difficult for you and why you
keep backsliding and while you keep sabotaging and why it
seems hopeless and it's like Oh Leo I can't you
know I can't cure my depression I I just can't
seem to lose weight and I can't seem to get
my finances in order and I I just keep procrastinating
over and over again and it seems like nothing will
help well if you've been stuck in that cycle try
the alternative try adopting the principle that awareness alone is
curative and just have faith in that process believe that
the deepest change will come from awareness of the damage
that you caused yourself and from a natural desire for
reality and truth all real change comes from alignment with
reality and truth at the most fundamental level that's what's
going on when you're growing when you're developing when your
self actualizing but for that to happen you need to
develop some awareness so you might say well Leo how
do I have developed this magical thing called awareness well
there's really no shortcut for it it's simply by sitting
there and be by being aware but there are a
couple of very simple things you can do probably the
most powerful is to set up a meditation habit daily
meditation habit I have many episodes to talk about how
to do that so you might want to check those
out and start experimenting with that but all so a
lot of my other videos you know they talk about
what awareness is in more depth what truth and reality
is how the mind plays tricks on you the illusions
created by thoughts so as you watch all this stuff
what's going to happen is that you will get the
right concepts into your web of beliefs that will allow
you to create a little bit of clearing for the
awareness to start to arise and really take effect and
then over time you know over months and years as
you train that up and you flex your awareness muscle
it will become so strong that a lot of the
problems that you've had in your life they'll just simply
melt away and dissipate so doesn't that sound like a
better alternative to the stuff you've been trying that's been
failing give it a shot let me know how it

deceives you and how to raise awareness I'm going to

work how consciousness works what awareness is what being is

that you have of life is going to transform and
I'm really excited to have you to start to taste
that in your life that's what excites me about this
