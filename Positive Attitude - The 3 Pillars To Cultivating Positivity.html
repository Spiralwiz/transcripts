hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about positive attitude all right
let's talk about how to develop positive thinking and what
I really want to tackle in this video because I
have other videos that talk about positive thinking and optimism
equally entitled positive thinking and optimism I want to check
those out but what I want to talk about here
is how do you actually cultivate a positive attitude because
it's very easy I find to talk about positive thinking
to wax philosophical about positive thinking to extol the virtues
of positive thinking and we all know that we want
to be more positive but then we just kind of
fall back into our groove and we remain the negative
selves the critical selves the judgmental selves the worrying selves
the stressed selves that we've always been so how do
you actually do this what I'm going to say in
this video is actually that this is a very very
advanced topic very few people in life I would say
actually have a true positive attitude and of those people
that do many of them have it maybe because they
were very fortunate with the way that they were raised
or because they had very good genetics and genetics is
a factor in and actually your happiness and your mood
set point that 50% of it is genetic so that
can be an important factor as well but ultimately all
we care about is what we can control so the
genetics I decide you have to play with the cards
that you were dealt and so whatever cards you were
dealt how do you make the best of them how
do you create a positive attitude and no matter how
shitty your genetics are or where you come from with
your family background or any kind of incidents and trauma
that you've had in your life it is possible to
create a very very strong positive attitude but ultimately I
got to be honest with you it's not something that
you're just going to get from watching one video stop
bullshitting yourself alright positive thinking people say well positive thinking
it's so Airy fairy and it's just wishful thinking actually
positive thinking can be a very hard nosed tangible thing
the only problem is that almost almost nobody approaches it
that way and nobody is very rigorous about their positive
attitude so here I'm going to talk about what it
really takes to start to develop this and I really
started to realize it just in the last in the
last six months because I've done so much personal development
work studying all these theories all this stuff and a
lot of times I'll be able to put into place
a lot of nice things for myself in my life
externally uncle I'll get my money situation handled I'll get
the gym handled I'll get a relationship handled but then
what I find is that I'm still not really positive
on the inside and the reason that is is that
because no external circumstance will ever make you a positive
thinker that's inner work you have to do all right
so this is ultimately what's going to take is going
to take time it's going to take months and years
of work so time and work inner work to do
this no external circumstance is going to do it if
you think that you're just gonna set your life up
nicely around you you're going to get a nice house
a nice car a nice wife and some other things
you're gonna have in your life I mean that'll be
nice maybe that'll even make you feel good for a
while maybe it'll make you even feel good for a
long time but it's not going to make you a
true positive thinker it's not going to get you a
positive attitude because your attitude it might it's just positive
simply because you're in very comfortable surroundings but as soon
as I take away or your wife or your car
your house or something else or your job all of
a sudden you're not going to have a positive attitude
you're going to have a very very negative attitude so
true positive attitude means that you're positive no matter what
it's not a fragile positivity so how do we do
this here are the core pillars of how to do
this and this is a very deep topic so I'm
going to go in other videos and cover these other
pillars and more depth but here's the overview number one
is that you really have to buy into this idea
and accept that the present moment is inevitable as it
is all right you cannot be a positive thinker you
cannot have a positive attitude if you do not accept
this the present moment right now what you think about
the present moment is that yeah the present moment is
nice but there's something that could be better about it
well the present moment could be nicer if only I
had blank fill in the blank with whatever you on
a thing or a situation or a person or even
something about yourself that's different but in the end to
have a positive attitude no matter what to have a
robust positive attitude you have to come into this realization
this connection with with reality with truth and the truth
is that in the present moment this moment right now
nothing could be different than the way it is no
matter how good or how bad you perceive it to
be right now nothing could be different than the way
it is it's inevitable right the current moment so the
future could be different but the present moment cannot be
different it is what it is this seems simplistic and
you might wonder well that kind of makes sense but
what does this really have to do with anything how's
this going to change my life that's because you haven't
really penetrated into the depth of what this principle really
means when you're really penetrating the depth of it and
you live from this place and you can do this
what you're going to find is that if you just
accept the current moment as inevitable a lot of your
tensions will kind of melt away and a lot of
the things that are bothering you right now that are
making you unhappy are going to sort to melt away
you're going to be accepting of them not in the
sense that you have to tolerate them for the rest
of your life or that you don't have to do
anything about them but in the sense that for right
now in the current present moment this tiny millisecond that
we're living in then now that time is like locked
in and there's nothing you can do about it and
the stress that you're creating the resistance that you're creating
to it the fact that you don't like the present
moment and you want to rip yourself out of it
right this is creating unnecessary struggle which is creating a
lot of negativity and warning and anxiety within you that
is unnecessary in fact not only is it unnecessary but
it's diametrically opposed to having a positive attitude you can't
have a positive attitude by definition if you're anxious and
you're worried and you're having negative thoughts so you need
a way to drop those and one of the best
ways is to adopt this principle very very deeply in
your life the next principle is another thing that you
have to accept and this is something that also people
do not want to accept is this idea that worry
is useless this is a very tough one even for
me to accept that worry is useless somewhere in the
back of our minds and even in the front of
our minds we make all sorts of arguments for why
the worry that we do throughout the day throughout the
week throughout the year throughout our whole lives that that
worry is somehow justified and that that worry is somehow
natural and that that's actually good and then that worry
is what's getting us the results that we're getting in
our life so it might go seems like this well
Leo you're telling me not to worry and you're telling
me that worry is useless but wait a minute the
other day at my job I was so worried about
the report that I had to submit to my boss
that that worried kind of lit a fire under my
ass and so I went off and I I worked
hard on the report and then I finished the report
just in the nick of time and I made it
by the skin of my tooth and I turn down
that report and that report just somehow it got me
by and my boss was happy it held it held
the situation over but you know if I look back
at that situation and if I if I take all
the worry out of it and if I wasn't worried
about that situation then I would never have gotten ever
poured out in on time and maybe I would have
been fired so how can you tell me Leo that
worry is useless all right so I can relate with
this right I can make this argument myself oftentimes I
do the problem is that this is kind of a
very disempowering way to think and ultimately the more work
you do on yourself and the more worried you start
to kind of let go in little places what happens
that you're so afraid and you're so attached to you're
worried that you're like no I need this worry you're
like a little child with a blanket who thinks that
this little baby blanket that he's grown been growing up
with that this is somehow protecting him from the dangers
of life and that's what you're doing with your worry
is that you're using at this little blanket and you're
saying well you know what I need it if I
drop and let go this worry then my life is
going to turn to and yeah I mean it definitely
seems that way but you're going to find is that
once you start let go of that worry it's actually
not quite as bad as you thought it was and
in fact we're going to realize that as you're letting
go of more and more worry your performance is improving
right it improves and improves I what you can start
to find is that those situations like turning in this
report with your ball that wouldn't have even been a
problem if you weren't a warrior in the first place
because the reason you probably got into that situation was
because you were worried about it and you started procrastinating
and you started building it up in your mind you
start having negative visualizations you started having resistance towards it
and so you didn't do the work until the very
last minute whereas if you weren't a worrier then you
would have just done it oh you know days ahead
of time and you would have done it even better
than you did by doing it the last second so
that's one way to start to combat this but ultimately
again this is a very very deep idea that worry
is useless ask yourself do you really believe that even
I don't believe it at a subconscious level yet I
know it logically I know I should believe it I
know that I need to in order to get the
performance that I want my life but still it's difficult
for me to believe and actually practice I'm retraining my
mind every single day as I'm noticing myself worrying that
worry is useless because I know that this is a
core principle that needs to be put into place to
have a positive attitude and why is that well because
if you're worrying then you can't be positive and worry
happens on a micro level every single minute and second
of your day if you are a worrier and if
you believe that worry has value then of course you're
going to keep worrying so it's not going to work
in order to shed all your worry you have to
honestly believe truly believe that worry is not serving you
in any positive way so that's the second pillar the
third pillar is to accept again this is a pillar
of acceptance you have to accept that really cheerfulness is
the best attitude and the best strategy towards solving problems
in life I really think about this one too do
you believe that that's true do you believe that being
happy no matter what the circumstances are no matter how
bad the situation is do you believe that being happy
is actually your best way out of that situation see
most people would like to say yes but then in
practice they behave as though they believe it's a no
because what happens is that as soon as something catastrophic
happens in their life and all the happiness and all
the cheerfulness goes out the window it's like that becomes
a luxury and see with this kind of mindset you
can't really have a positive attitude not a consistent one
it's going to be a fragile one if you want
a rock-solid consistent positive attitude then you can't let negative
circumstances come and dictate how you're going to feel and
again if you think that being scared is actually helpful
to you when a negative situation happens or panicking is
actually helping you to fix the situation then you're going
to keep doing that right because you're going to think
well that's the best strategy I mean if something horrible
happens to me obviously I should be sad or fearful
about it because that's helping me to survive that situation
you might say that yourself actually that's not the case
that's not true at all but your brain will certainly
trick you into thinking that it certainly will that's your
kind of survival instinct mode kicking into gear but that's
not conscious see to have a positive attitude means you
have to be conscious all the time this is a
challenge it's challenging to be cheerful in a tough situation
it's easy to be cheerful in a nice situation but
it's hard to be cheerful in a challenging situation so
this is a this is an important pillar to accept
now strategy strategy is an important point we need to
talk about because a lot of people get mixed up
about strategy and what strategy is some people will think
that well I'm going to take some sort of strategy
towards the situation that I'm going to encounter tomorrow right
I'm going to I'm going to make some sort of
decision I'm going to deal with my problem in some
sort of way and if the result of that interaction
between my strategy and the problem if the result is
positive and it's to my liking then my strategy was
correct and if the result was negative and it didn't
go the way I wanted to then my strategy was
incorrect that's actually not the right way to approach tragedy
that's that's a mistake see proper strategy is correct regardless
of the outcome you might wonder well how can that
be well take an example for example like poker right
in poker there are very clear do's and don'ts for
what kind of hands you should play and what kind
of hands you shouldn't play because ultimately poker is a
pretty simple model it can be modeled mathematically and so
you can run the percentages and you can always if
you have a computer or if you're got a really
sharp mind you can always take a look at the
hands and if you see all the player's hands you
can always take a look and kind of analyze it
run the numbers and say well ok you should clearly
fold right now even though you have a strong hand
you should fold because the odds are against you or
maybe you calculate it the other way around so there
are actual like odds right that you should be doing
you should be playing but then sometimes if you watch
like the World Poker Tour or something like that poker
on TV you'll see that some players are kind of
like Mavericks and they'll rebel against the odds and even
though the odds are against them they'll still kind of
play against the odds and sometimes will actually win now
what does that mean does that mean that they are
smart that they're intelligent that they have a that they
have a a proper strategy in place no they just
got lucky right and so that could be happening in
your life is that you could be getting lucky with
various decisions and strategies that you're applying you could be
getting lucky that doesn't mean it's the right strategy so
what's the point here how does this connect back to
took the positive thinking well the way it connects back
to that is that this idea that cheerfulness is the
best strategy right that's what I'm trying to convince you
of is that being cheerful no matter what is happening
your life that means if someone dies in your family
you still remain cheerful all right think about that this
is not this is not I'm not kidding I mean
like imagine that in your life that if someone died
that was close to you and you could still remain
cheerful what would it take for you to do that
right that takes like serious internal self-control and discipline to
do that not on a force way but actually to
genuinely be cheerful not that they died but still cheerful
in the moment because I mean what's the sadness going
to get you what's the fear going to get you
is it going to actually help you is it's the
best strategy to live through that life problem if someone
dies it's close to you is is getting upset about
it or sad about it is that the best way
to live through that problem or is the best way
to man cheerful see we know logically that the best
strategy remain cheerful but in practice how many of us
can actually execute that very few right this is where
self controls comes in this is where training and discipline
comes in building yourself up and convincing yourself of these
pillars the more you practice them the more you implement
them the more solid and grounded you get in them
and actually take root in your life and you can
actually use them in tough situations so this is why
this is an advanced idea right you can see why
this is advanced now because very very few people truly
have a positive attitude in life and now you might
also have this objection or this thought that goes something
like this well Leah okay positive thinking I hear you
it sounds nice but isn't positive thinking actually dangerous I
mean I'm a realist isn't it isn't it better to
be a realist in life rather than to be this
starry-eyed optimist and approach everything optimistically isn't realism the best
approach I mean what if you're optimistic and then you're
all that optimism that you have all those goals and
dreams and the outcomes you set for yourself all those
just come crashing down when it comes to kind of
collides with reality what if you're cheerful and you're telling
us not to be all happy then someone close to
you dies and then you're not able to maintain that
what happens then Leo isn't that reckless isn't that dangerous
aren't you setting yourself up for pain and the answer
is this you are setting up yourself for pain if
what you're doing is you're setting these hard expectations and
you're very attached to the outcome but it doesn't have
to be that way right see this is where discounters
and naysayers of positive thinking will get it wrong is
they'll say well positive thinking that's going to set me
up for failure that's going to set up to disappointment
well the problem is that they're being positive and they're
telling yourself well I'm positive and I need the outcome
to be positive and if it's not positive then everything's
going to hell but see true positive thinking is like
be more relaxed be more chill being outcome detached you're
a positive thinker you're thinking positive about the situation that
doesn't mean that situation won't turn bad that doesn't mean
that you can foretell the future and you can get
everything that you want to happen in your life to
happen in the way that you want it never going
to happen on the contrary it means that you're going
to have ups and downs you're going to have things
unexpectedly happen you might have some sort of lofty ambition
or goal for your business and then it comes crashing
down and you know the market comes and it it
crashes and your business crashes with it or maybe you
have some nice expectations and you're thinking very positive about
your relationship and then your relationship ends in a divorce
that could happen so I'm not saying you can necessarily
prevent that in all situations but the idea here is
that if you're a positive thinker you remain positive and
you're not attached to it see if you're a realist
or a pessimist then actually what you're doing is you're
like like okay if I'm thinking positive that I need
it to actually pan out I need it to be
positive all the time and of course that's not going
to work that's a neurotic way of doing positive thinking
true positive thinking is like being cool and chill and
like you know what if it happens good and if
it doesn't happen you know still good heads I win
tails I win that's what a true positive attitude is
about all right so I'm going to wrap it up
here this is what cultivating a positive attitude means is
really about acceptance you have to accept what do you
have to accept one gift accept the present moment as
it is completely inevitable number two you have to accept
that worry is completely useless and of no value to
you number three you have to accept the cheerfulness is
the best strategy to go through life with and you
have now strive to live up to that right I
know it's hard this doesn't mean it's easy it's going
to be very hard but if you're like me then
you see the long-term potential here I mean how awesome
would it be to develop yourself internally so that you
could have a true positive attitude about life so that
no matter what happens to you you can remain cheerful
so that you're not worrying and you're not feeling like
you have to worry because you know that the worry
is not helping it and that you're in the present
moment and you accept the moment as it is if
you can achieve all those things and you basically accomplish
nirvana you've got heaven on earth you can't not like
nothing can hurt you you're untouchable so this is a
very powerful goal to set for yourself is to cultivate
this attitude over you know over the months and the
years as you're growing yourself and you're doing other stuff
try to move your way and ensure way up towards
having a true positive attitude about life alright this is
