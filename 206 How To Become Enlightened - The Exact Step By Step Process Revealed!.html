            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/GfqLdOgoB98' target='_blank'>How To Become Enlightened - The Exact Step By Step Process Revealed!</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Enlightenment is Attainable Within 3-24 Months Through Focused Inquiry</b>: The exact process of enlightenment, according to Leo, can indeed be approached as a process which involves rigorous inquiry into one's own consciousness. This focused inquiry aids in peeling away layers of personal belief systems, and the objective is becoming aware of existential reality as quickly as possible. Mere meditation exercises and focusing the mind are not sufficient in isolation. The process is straightforward but complex, packed with traps and false assumptions that require careful navigation. 
</li><li><b>You are Not an Entity in your Body, but the Field of Awareness Itself</b>: Leo brings attention to the illusion of the self as an entity residing within your body. This belief is described as fundamentally false. What you truly are, according to many interpretations, is essentially the entire field of awareness itself. This is a fundamental, existential fact of our being where everything within the grasp of your awareness is inherently you.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment is the Realization of No Self</b>: The core intention of pursuing enlightenment is the realization of no self. Leo explains that every second of life there's a reality happening, but most people aren't consciously aware of it. To achieve enlightenment is to become reality itself consciously, shedding away the illusion of the self as a separate observer or participant in reality. This is seen as a spontaneous process, paradoxical and uncontrolled, as enlightenment fundamentally is about understanding there is no personal entity striving to achieve it. 
</li><li><b>Practical Process to Raise Awareness for Enlightenment</b>: To practically work towards enlightenment, Leo suggests a cycle of focused sessions of introspection. This involves allocating 30 to 60 minutes every day to sit in an undistracted, quiet location, ideally upright and thoroughly alert mentally. The objective of these sessions is identifying the real-time sense of personal identity and observing it as an unconscious, shifting sense inside the mind.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Consistency in Enlightenment Work</b>: Consistency and perseverance are stressed by Leo as very important for achieving the state of enlightenment. The consistent habit of performing enlightenment work via focused introspection is encouraged, while understanding that enlightenment is about raising awareness through observing, not thinking. This process might initially be disheartening, but with persistence and the readiness to fail multiple times, you increase the likelihood of becoming more consciously aware of your existential reality.  
</li><li><b>Enlightenment is Not Philosophy, It is Beyond Beliefs</b>: Leo elaborates that enlightenment isn't philosophy or a belief system. It is about going beneath the beliefs held in life which we seldom deliberately attempt to do. It involves understanding that the 'person', per se, does not exist, but is a fabrication of the mind. The process of enlightenment involves a deliberate reframing of the conventional understanding of the sense of self. 
</li><li><b>Questioning Your Perception is Important in Enlightenment</b>: Enlightenment work involves questioning your perception of reality itself. Your awareness is directed not merely externally, but internally as well. The 'me' or 'I' that the mind instantly registers when addressed is examined closely. The movement and shifting nature of this internal sense of identity is to be noted during the introspective sessions.  
</li><li><b>The Journey to Enlightenment is Filled With Traps and False Assumptions</b>: The path to enlightenment is filled with multiple false assumptions and traps that can lead one astray. Leo discusses the numerous false assumptions one tends to enter the process with. The goal of the enlightening process involves dialoguing with these false assumptions, ensuring to steer clear of potential pitfalls and ego deceptions.
</li><li><b>Process of Introspection in Self-Identity Discovery</b>: Leo Gura explains the necessity of present moment awareness and introspection in examining one's sense of self. The aim is to navigate personal beliefs and feelings about self-identity and distill this sense of self to the most accurate pinpoint. He suggests questions like "Who am I?" and "Who is perceiving?" to stimulate deeper inquiry.
</li><li><b>Importance of Inquiring into Self-Identification</b>: Leo expresses the need for specificity in identifying oneself. Initial notions of self-identity may be focused on physical elements like the body. However, he suggests that upon deeper introspection the most profound belief held about oneself tends to be that of being a perceiver, a point where all sensations converge. 
</li><li><b>Speech and Thoughts Do Not Define True Identity</b>: Leo distinguishes the voice and thoughts in one's mind from true identity, explaining that they are merely cognitive activities, not representations of one's true existential nature. He suggests going meta on the voices (being aware of and objectifying the voices), instead of taking them as identities.
</li><li><b>Expanding Awareness to Discover True Identity</b>: Leo recommends the practice of open-minded introspection to challenge existing beliefs about one's identity  specifically, the notion of being a perceiver. By questioning where perceptions are coming from and going to, one can explore the possibility of holding a false belief about the "self", thus opening up to the idea that current conceptions about identity may be inaccurate. 
</li><li><b>Emphasizing Experience over Philosophy in Enlightenment Process</b>: Leo discourages allowing philosophical thought to interrupt the discovery process, urging an emphasis on experience. The goal is to become experientially aware of one's existential being rather than logically attempting to define it. Demystifying these thoughts and beliefs creates room for the authentic self to emerge.
</li><li><b>Understanding Perceptions and the Perceiver</b>: Leo discusses the concept of perceptions and the perceiver in depth, insisting that the perception or thought of oneself is not actually who we are. He makes it clear that perceptions are not the perceiver and invites us to deeply investigate our direct experience of what we perceive to be ourselves.
</li><li><b>Importance of Open-mindedness</b>: Emphasizing the need for an open mind, Leo explains that any progress in understanding the true nature of being requires a willingness to question deeply held views of oneself and to discard familiar but unhelpful thought patterns. Only with an open mind can real discovery and understanding occur.
</li><li><b>Intention to Discover True Self</b>: Leo reiterates the necessity of having a strong intention to unravel the reality of one's true self. This intention is vital in bridging the gap between the perceived self and the reality of being, to make the "quantum leap" from the illusion of personal perception to the truth of existence.
</li><li><b>Distractions and Challenges in the Process</b>: Acknowledging potential distractions and challenges in this process, Leo advises consistent determination and refocusing of awareness on the true self when the mind is tempted to wander. Staying aware of the present moment and having the courage to let go of familiar thoughts and beliefs is key for progress.
</li><li><b>The True Nature of Thoughts</b>: Leo brings attention to the idea of the true nature of thoughts, emphasizing that they are mere sensations that contain content or stories, not actual reality. Using the example of a movie, he illustrates that just as viewers get absorbed in the story of the movie and forget they are just watching light on a screen, people often get engrossed in their thoughts and lose touch with reality.
</li><li><b>Practicing Awareness and Observation</b>: Leo recommends regularly practicing focused awareness and observation, directing one's consciousness towards examining the nature of thoughts and separating it from the content or story created by the thoughts. This practice of "looking" with one's awareness helps in recognizing the illusory nature of thoughts and the true reality. 
</li><li><b>Thoughts and Reality</b>: He culminates the discussion with an experiment, asking viewers to imagine a thought of having a million dollars and then question the reality of that thought. This example demonstrates the distinction between the actual reality of thought and the fictitious story it creates, emphasizing the significance of separating these two to understand the true nature of the self.
</li><li><b>Understanding the illusion of thoughts</b>: Leo explains that the real substance of a thought is the sensation or feeling it creates rather than the narrative or content it comes with. When we get caught up in the narrative, we lose touch with the reality of the sensation. The danger is when we think who we are (the perceiver) is also a thought, we are only recognizing it by the narrative it brings rather than the underlying sensation.
</li><li><b>Reality is only in the present moment</b>: Leo emphasizes that reality only consists of what is happening right now in the present moment. Anything beyond direct experience in the current momentpast memories, future anticipations, or objects not within our immediate sensory perceptionis not real but a story created by our mind. 
</li><li><b>Beware of the self-propagating illusion</b>: When the mind starts to open up to see the illusion of thoughts, more thoughts arise and distract us, reinforcing the illusion that the narratives are real. We need to constantly exercise awareness to break this self-propagating illusion cycle and help us stay in touch with reality.
</li><li><b>Avoiding common traps</b>: Leo cautions about the common traps on the path to enlightenment. One should not take any idea, framework, belief, or instruction as the absolute truth, as these are all part of the illusion created by the mind. Pure existential, metaphysical truth can only be discovered personally, and this discovery goes beyond scientific or religious explanations.
</li><li><b>Reality and enlightenment from a personal perspective</b>: Leo admits that he, too, falls into these traps and stresses that understanding these principles does not equate to enlightenment. Real understanding can only come from a personal awakening that goes beyond intellectual comprehension. 
</li><li><b>Tips for the journey to enlightenment</b>: To achieve enlightenment, it is essential to maintain a high sense of awareness and dedication, navigating through and avoiding the common traps, continually challenging one's perceptions of reality and selfhood, and never taking any ideas, beliefs, or instructions as absolute truth. Persist despite challenges, and keep focus on deciphering what is real from the illusion created by thoughts.
</li><li><b>Leo's Personal Struggles with Enlightenment</b>: Leo acknowledges his daily struggles with enlightenment, emphasizing his vulnerability to various distractions and traps. He admits to getting particularly caught in the trap of 'nothingness' due to extensive studying and learning about enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Conceptualization of Enlightenment and Self</b>: Leo illustrates the futility and counter-productiveness of trying to conceptualize enlightenment and oneself. He explains that no belief or idea equates to the absolute truth and highlights the impossibility of thinking one's way into or out of enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Learning from Observation, not Thought</b>: Leo advocates for raising awareness through observation, not thought. Using the analogy of a dog trying to learn calculus, he underscores the need for moving beyond simple, habitual actions (like thinking) to open up to the opportunity for advanced understanding (observation akin to calculus).
</li><li><b>Persistence is Key</b>: Stressing on the necessity of massive persistence, Leo outlines the extreme mental effort and resilience required to reflect on oneself consistently. He cautions about the common feelings of disheartenment and the multiple fails that one may encounter.
</li><li><b>Spontaneous Awakening in Enlightenment</b>: Leo describes enlightenment as a spontaneous awakening occurring unexpectedly without any particular process, though following his suggested process may increase the probability of this awakening.
</li><li><b>Being as Reality</b>: During the spontaneous awakening, Leo illuminates that one becomes the reality itself, unrestricted by any specific coordinates in space. Being isn't a perceivable entity, but the pure existence where one incorporates every reality.
</li><li><b>Enlightenment as a Constant Pursuit</b>: Enlightenment, according to Leo, is a constant endeavor involving cyclic awakenings and falling into ignorance. He emphasizes its profound transformative power and the sense of gratitude it instills.
</li><li><b>Importance of Watching More Videos</b>: Leo recommends persistently watching his videos for further guidance on enlightenment and address challenges that may arise. He cautions against viewing enlightenment as philosophy and indulging in unfounded objections and excuses that waste time.
</li><li><b>Clearing Belief Systems</b>: Leo advises that before delving into enlightenment practices, a clearing of one's belief systems is essential. He stresses that this dismissive work is integral to the process of enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Final Words</b>: Leo highlights the value of enlightenment work surpassing its difficulty. He concludes by urging viewers to subscribe to his channel for more advanced topics and provides a reminder against mistaking his teachings as absolute truth.
