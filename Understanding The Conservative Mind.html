[Music] thank you [Music] understanding the conservative mind this is
going to be a two-part series part two will be
called understanding the liberal mind this two-part series will explore
the foundations of conservativism and liberalism we're beginning with the
conservative mind but this is going to be a very
even-handed approach and then next week we'll look at the
liberal mind the goal of this series is not to
Advocate any kind of political positions or to teach you
any kind of ideology but it's to get you the
deepest possible most genuine sense of the opposite of whatever
your worldview is so if you're a liberal this is
the episode for you because as a liberal you do
not understand the conservative mind and if you're Conservative then
next week's episode will be the one for you because
you don't understand the liberal mind our aim in this
series is epistemological it is not political I will not
be advocating for any ideology or any worldview here I
will not be telling you which one is better than
the other one that's just not what we're interested in
here this is going to be a spiral Dynamics kind
of tier 2 perspective this will be non-partisan and I'm
going to try to make it as non-judgmental as possible
I will be presenting the most charitable and steel manned
position for both worldviews this is what is missing right
now I feel like in our political discussions is that
what we have is we have both sides straw Manning
each other to death and neither one really understanding what
the other worldview entails and what's appealing about it it's
almost laughable to tell a conservative that there's something appealing
about liberalism and to tell a liberal that there's something
appealing about conservativism but of course obviously there must be
something appealing about both of them otherwise people wouldn't be
so ideological and so passionate about their World Views so
the goal of this series is to show you the
value of both World Views now a couple of warnings
are in order here if you're a liberal or a
progressive you do not understand the conservative worldview you have
a straw man of it you don't understand the emotional
appeal of conservativism you don't really understand why people subscribe
to it you just dismiss them as stupid or ideological
or as grifters or whatever kind of excuses and justifications
you have for not really going deep in and studying
the conservative mind and of course vice versa if you're
conservative now it's arbitrary which we're going to talk about
first I just chose to talk about conservatism first because
most of my audience is pretty liberal so I feel
like this is a good way to start off this
series but I could have started the other way around
so if you only watch one of these episodes you're
going to get a skewed perspective of what I think
about politics because you're going to say oh Leo you're
being so biased I'm not being biased it's just I
have to cover them in a linear order and we
have to start with one of them right so you
got to watch both of them to see uh the
balance that will take place here I'm gonna really try
my best to be balanced and to not inject any
of my own personal biases into these descriptions the way
that I've done in the past when I talk about
politics the key here is to understand that both of
these World Views are not logical even though they masquerade
as being the most logical one they're emotionally held at
the core they function emotionally and so we have to
look at what's the emotional appeal of these World Views
what makes them juicy because they are juicy people get
lost in them people turn these World Views into a
kind of religion so let's get started on that now
a couple of notes Here I'm going to be saying
conservative a lot and I'm going to be saying liberal
a lot what do I mean by these terms I'm
using them in a very broad sense by conservative I
simply mean anyone who's right of Center the far right
the alt-right neocons Republicans Libertarians classical liberals ethnonationalists nationalists Nazis
fascists religious fundamentalists theocrats anarcho-capitalists paleoconservatives and the like and
by liberal I simply mean anyone left of center including
neoliberals Democrats progressives socialists marxists communists Democratic socialists social Democrats
hippies tankies greens social justice Warriors postmodernists anarchists utopians and
the like so very very general here uh we're just
kind of drawing the distinction between the liberal and the
conservative mind and what does that really entail and why
does the Mind bifurcate in this manner you might wonder
like is there a Common Thread between all of the
different strands of conservativism that exist around the world because
there's so many different countries there's there's China there's Japan
there's Russia there's Iran you know there's Brazil and there's
conservativism in all these different countries which is different from
the specific flavor of conservatism that exists in America so
this makes you wonder like why is that what's the
common thread there because if you just Define conservativism in
a sort of American narrow sense of like um you
know being pro-gun and being uh anti-abortion and some of
these sort of like policy positions that are just specific
to America or specific to this era or Century that
we're living in this doesn't get you a deep enough
understanding of the conservative mind because the conservative mind as
a sort of a theme as an attitude goes back
thousands of years it's not something that's modern and likewise
for the liberal mind there were liberals who existed thousands
of years ago and there were conservatives too and so
what distinguished them because it wasn't issues like gun rights
or abortion obviously it was something broader and deeper than
that that's what we're going to be looking at uh
a lot of the political discussions that we're having today
on YouTube and on social media they're so narrow they're
so short-sighted um they're focused on like you know what's
the what's the hot outrageous thing that was said yesterday
and we lose sight of of the deeper foundations of
what's really going on with uh politics uh also we
should note that political ideologies and parties are fluid relative
and they evolve over time which was why narrow characterizations
of liberal conservative are problematic because they're going to change
throughout your lifetime uh political realignments happen every 50 years
or so and we're sort of going through a political
realignment right now especially in America with conservativism that's what's
been happening over the last five or ten years so
make a distinction between narrow and Broad formulations of right
and left here we're interested in the broadest possible formulation
not any specific policy proposal not any specific party or
flavor of the of the year or of the decade
uh we're interested in transcending country era and party and
today's conservativism is really giving people a distorted idea of
what conservativism is American conservativism this Maga movement that is
been happening over the last six or seven years or
so um a lot of it is hardly even conservative
that's what's so Twisted about it it's just disconnected from
many traditional conservative tenets for example that the defense of
traditional institutions a lot of the Maga movement is actually
anti that it's anti-establishment it's um anti many institutions and
on the other hand it's Pro other institutions so it's
a very kind of a mixed schizophrenic bag of stuff
and it's really not an intelligent formulation of conservativism and
this is a problem because you you listen to this
and either you subscribe to it or you're looking at
it from the sidelines and wondering like how can these
these people have lost their minds it's so unintelligent and
then you start to think that all conservativism is equally
unintelligent and that's just not true I think that's been
lost in the last 10 years or so of what's
been happening with American conservative politics is that it's just
like like the conservativism that has been so popular in
the last decade has been so grossly unintelligent that it
makes genuine conservatives feel and look bad I don't envy
these genuine conservatives I mean I'm not one but if
I was one I would be ashamed and embarrassed for
what has happened to conservativism over the last 10 years
so just keep that in mind be careful here um
how did I reach this point in my thinking about
politics well basically as a liberal and Progressive myself that's
kind of like what I naturally skew towards that's the
kind of uh family that I grew up in uh
we were mostly pretty Progressive and pretty liberal uh you
know one day I just sat down and I simply
asked myself why do people subscribe to conservativism I wanted
to genuinely understand conservatives how does anyone find this appealing
I mean because obviously people find it appealing but like
why that's the question we're really interested in here and
we're going to be asking the same question in the
next episode about liberals as well you know why does
anyone find liberalism appealing for many conservatives this doesn't make
sense well it all starts with wanting to genuinely understand
the answer to this question so let me ask you
do you actually want to know do you this is
where we get the real answers this is where we
get genuine understanding from because most people in the political
sphere most political commentators they don't genuinely want to understand
why anyone finds liberalism or conservativism appealing they're just spouting
ideology at you and they're just engaging in basically a
partisan food fight but this doesn't lead to genuine understanding
so my question to you is do you genuinely want
to know and if you do then you have to
set aside easy answers such as at all well people
they're just stupid people find appealing because they're just stupid
no that's that's not a serious inquiry that's not a
serious answer half of the world's population does not subscribe
to this worldview simply because they're stupid or because they're
grifters or because someone's paying them money or because they
just been have been brainwashed into it there's something much
deeper going on but you have to want to understand
it and the reason people don't want to understand it
is because if you actually open your mind to what
I'll be teaching you here to this genuine inquiry what
you'll discover is that your ideas about liberals and conservatives
are very wrong what you have is you have brainwashing
group think and you have ideology even if you're a
progressive and you're very advanced in in your Consciousness and
in your thinking you still have a lot of political
ideology that's running you running your mind preventing you from
really understanding half of the world's population when it comes
to politics but there's no way to go beyond this
unless you genuinely want to understand most political actors would
rather stick to their ideology then genuinely understand the other
side and from this basically all of our political problems
stem and if you don't want to genuinely understand this
then how can we move forward how can we have
a healthy politics when you don't understand half the country
or half the world so the key to making some
progress here as a liberal or a progressive is to
realize that there exists an intelligent formulation of conservativism the
question is what is that formulation if you're telling yourself
that there doesn't exist an intelligent formulation of conservativism that's
how you know you're fooling yourself so I'll be presenting
that formulation to you right now to get us going
I have a few quotations quote number one quote to
be conservative is to prefer the familiar to the unknown
to prefer the tried to the untried fact to mystery
the actual to the possible the limited to the unbounded
the near to the distant the sufficient to the super
abundant the convenient to the perfect present laughter to utopian
Bliss end quote that's by Michael okay shot and the
second quote is quote people Embrace political conservativism at least
in part because it serves to reduce fear anxiety and
uncertainty to avoid change disruption and ambiguity and to explain
order and justify inequality among groups and individuals end quote
that's from the University of Virginia website now I'm going
to go through a very long list of features of
the conservative worldview and attitude I sat down for several
weeks and brainstormed this list of features I studied various
conservative thinkers to really get to the to the bottom
of what's what's fueling their mind why are they subscribing
to this worldview here's what I came up with it's
going to be a very very long list uh it's
it's surprisingly deep and comprehensive so number one is the
conservative mind is more sensitive to fear and threat than
the liberal mind it reacts more strongly to risk and
danger this is not merely an attitudinal thing this is
actually there's been scientific research that has been done on
this there's actually Neuroscience that shows that the conservative brain
structures the actual structures and Neurology of the brain is
different in the conservative mind than the liberal mind centers
of the brain that react to fear like the amygdala
are enlarged or interconnected in deeper ways than they are
in the liberal mind that's pretty amazing to consider so
this goes way deeper than merely some ideology or some
set of narrow political positions like on abortion or gun
rights or freedom of speech or whatever this has to
do fundamentally with how your brain is wired if you're
more sensitive to fear and threat for example some brains
are wired in such a way that they're more sensitive
to loud noises now if you're one of these types
of brains and Minds that's more sensitive to loud noises
then think about how you're going to be reacting to
loud environments and noises for the rest of your life
you're going to behave differently when it comes to going
to loud parties and nightclubs and bars you're going to
behave differently when your neighbor and their children are making
a bunch of noise you're going to react differently and
your friends around you may not understand why you're reacting
in the ways that you're reacting they might think that
you're overreacting that you're nuts constantly complaining about the noise
because to them their brain is literally desensitized they don't
have as good hearing or as good processing of that
signal of the noise you see it sure helps to
know that about people to understand how they're reacting well
this similar situation is happening with conservatives and liberals the
conservative mind also grew up generally speaking now again these
are going to be generalizations right we're generalizing so all
these points that I'm going to be going at there's
going to be like 100 different points on this list
um not every single one of them is going to
apply to every conservative there's going to be exceptions of
course but generally speaking the conservative mind grew up in
a harsher stricter environment than the liberal mind more rural
less developed areas of the world or the country generally
poorer less resources available or the Mind grew up in
one of these harsh survival environments but it benefited from
the status quo right so imagine for example growing up
in Nigeria very difficult survival situation for most people in
Nigeria or in Iran or even in Russia these countries
it's a lot harder to survive in these countries than
it is in America or Western democracies so there's a
lot more survival pressures put upon the mind in those
environments it's a harsher more brutal area to survive in
and now imagine you grew up in one of these
environments but you happen to be born just by luck
into a wealthy family because every country has wealthy families
even the poorest countries have wealthy families you just got
lucky and you roll the dice and you were born
into a wealthy family in Nigeria that wealthy family is
benefiting from the status quo because if we equalized all
the wealth in Nigeria that wealthy family would lose its
benefits and in the harsh survival conditions that it's growing
you know up in uh it needs those benefits those
benefits are not just always luxury a lot of times
it's a matter of life and death it's a matter
of sending your children to school or not sending them
to University or not giving them opportunities to leave the
country in the future or not and these are tend
to be limited opportunities not everybody in the country can
benefit from this if it's a underdeveloped country especially but
you know what even in America there are still limited
resources there's still limited opportunities not every child in America
is going to go to the best schools there's not
enough good schools not enough good teachers not all of
them are going to get to the best universities not
all of them are going to get you know uh
all the video games they want and all the best
healthiest food and the best clothing and so forth so
we're dealing with limited resources here fundamentally any country it's
just you know there's relative degrees of it um but
even in the wealthiest countries this is a problem so
if you're benefiting from the status quo there's a survival
interest your mind is going to be biased of course
towards justifying the status quo liking the status quo how
much you like the status quo very much just depends
very simply on how much it benefits you if it
doesn't benefit you then you're going to be against it
you're going to want change and if it does benefit
you then you're probably going to be for it and
you're going to justify it that's how the mind works
that's self-biased go see my episode called Self Bias that
explains that so this is generally what's happening with the
conservative mind now of course this doesn't mean that the
liberal mind doesn't also do these things right so again
be careful in this episode I'm only focusing on the
conservative attitude in worldview there's a lot of the same
dynamics that also apply to the liberal mind and we'll
cover those in the next episode so I promise you
this is going to be very balanced as balances I
can make it the conservative worldview also correlates with conscientiousness
and closeness these are two of the five Big Five
personality traits so the traits are conscientiousness openness versus closeness
neuroticism and there's a few other ones I'll have an
episode about the Big Five personality um traits in the
future Jordan Peterson talks about it a lot it's it's
a popular model within psychology that explains lots of different
differences in human behavior so um the only traits oh
introversion extroversion is also one of those traits so like
for example introversion extroversion does not correlate with liberal or
conservative there's not a good correlation there but when it
comes to conscientiousness and closeness or openness which is just
the opposite of closeness um there is a strong correlation
there so Liberals are more open-minded conservatives are more closed-minded
this is not a bias of mine there's actually been
scientific studies on this you can go find right this
is not just an opinion that I have as a
liberal um this is a core feature of what explains
the conservative attitude is closeness and be careful closeness is
not even though you know I talk about radical but
mine is a lot and I talk about it as
a very positive trait and generally it is especially when
it comes to the spiritual work that I talk about
and the philosophy that I do but closeness by itself
is not not just a pure negative there are positive
aspects to closeness there are negative aspects to open-mindedness which
we'll discuss in the next episode when it comes to
liberals um and then conscientiousness is basically a measure of
well let me explain what what is the the measure
of openness versus closeness this is a measure of how
open your mind is to new ideas basically and the
measure of conscientiousness is basically um how dutiful is your
mind and your personality type are you a sort of
a rebel and you like breaking rules and norms and
being an iconoclast and contrarian or do you like to
fit in and to follow the rules and the norms
because you genuinely value them so conscientiousness is that aspect
of the mind that likes to follow the rules and
then the Liberals are more like the rule Breakers they're
more transgressive uh another aspect of conservative worldview is in
general the conservative mind takes life more seriously it's more
anal so you can think of it as sort of
like lacks versus anal anal retentive they call it in
psychoanalytic tradition the sort of Freudian tradition um think about
it like this if you grow up in a harsh
environment where survival is difficult you don't have a lot
of leeway to live life willy-nilly any way you want
there's a very specific way you have to live life
in order to survive the attitude there is that life
is not just a fun game life is a matter
of life and death and if you don't live it
properly according to the proper principles and rules you're going
to die again if you look at third world countries
this becomes more Stark it's a little bit less obvious
in places like America but still a factor in America
you could still live a miserable life and die very
easily in America if you don't live life according certain
principles and rules and if you just treat Life as
a silly game so the conservative mind tends to be
stricter with itself it has to work in a strict
way in order to survive that's its survival strategy the
conservative mind is grounded in pragmatic versus idealistic it has
a strong need for order consistency and stability in life
imagine that you lack the order and consistency and stability
in your life such that you just feel uncomfortable you
feel anxious and scared you don't know what to do
that's how life is for many conservatives if they're missing
that order and consistency that rules and institutions provide to
them these rules can come from family they can come
from government they can come from a boss they can
come from various kinds of leaders maybe in the army
or in your sports team they can come from teachers
and mentors they can come from religious leaders and authorities
the pope or the priest the rabbi the Imam the
spiritual Guru and so forth so just think about it
as a progressive or as a liberal think about the
difference of living life just like a sort of a
free spirit where you don't listen to anybody you just
do whatever you want right you just kind of like
live there's no rules you don't have to go to
work you don't have to pay your bills just kind
of like willy-nilly go you know do whatever you want
you wake up in the morning there's no routine there's
no schedule just go and do whatever you want for
you as a liberal and Progressive this might sound like
the ideal life you might be like Leo tell me
how to create this life this sounds like heaven for
you that sounds like heaven but for many conservatives understand
that this is actually hell and you yourself might not
properly understand your own mind you might think that this
is heaven but that's just because you've never actually lived
this way for a long time you know it's nice
to have that kind of infinite freedom for a week
or for a month you know like you remember going
to school and you'd get the summer vacation it would
be so amazing after all the rigors of school especially
if you studied hard at school you would get the
summer off you'd get like two or three months off
in summer and it would be so amazing there's there
was like no rules no homework do whatever you want
wake up whenever you want go to sleep whenever you
want you know if assuming your parents were very permissive
the way that mine were like literally my parents were
so permissive I could do anything I wanted um like
during the summer breaks especially and that that felt so
amazing right but uh maybe you felt this is that
like by the end of that summer you're starting to
get all sloppy you've been eating terribly you've been going
to bed at weird times and it like your your
life is just sort of like it's um it's going
from this well-structured machine to this this floppy like slug
that's like slug that's just been gorging on food right
and it's just like laying there like Jabba the Hutt
lifestyle um and then you actually start to hate yourself
you don't feel good about yourself you stop going to
the gym you stop doing your homework you stop brushing
your teeth you stop um organizing and cleaning your room
you stop washing your clothes you've had moments like this
in your life where you just kind of like let
everything go and it can feel it can feel very
good when you do that from a place where you
know you've been very ordered and strict with yourself but
if you live that way for too long it can
get really problematic it can lead to addiction you get
addicted to porn to food to drugs to sex to
masturbation um and eventually you become depressed you lose all
your motivation for life life becomes meaningless for you and
then eventually it can lead to suicide so be careful
assuming that just having infinite freedom is actually the highest
good there needs to be a balance between the freedom
in your life and also some structure order and consistency
waking up on time having a morning routine going to
the gym eating healthy these kinds of things this is
what genuine conservatism is about it's not about gun rights
and freedom of speech and some Mega nonsense right it's
really about this this is what the foundation of conservativism
boils down to the conservative mind finds comfort in order
and routine I was actually just listening to an audio
version of the history of Russia the entire history of
Russia from um from like Ivan the Terrible all the
way to to Gorbachev so I was listening to this
and uh um it's interesting because in Russian history there's
this very interesting sort of like schizophrenic movement between um
utopian liberalism on the one hand and then like strict
authoritarianism on the other hand and so there's there's this
one story of Tsar Nicholas the first um there were
there were there was like a line of Russian tsars
some of them were very LAX like Peter the Great
he was very uh Cosmopolitan he traveled to Europe he
imported a lot of European culture into Russia he tried
to modernize Russia and make it more European so in
this sense he was like very Progressive even though he
was still you know an authoritarian Tsar um that was
uh Peter the Great and then um there was there
was a line of various SARS that were as liberal
as him and as Progressive as him as Cosmopolitan and
open-minded as him but then there were other tsars because
you know people in the in the royal family were
born with different temperaments different personalities their brains were wired
differently so Tsar Nicholas who was a much later tsar
of of that Royal Line um he was very much
the opposite of this he was closed he was very
orderly very consistent he would wake up on at the
same time he would um he would have all the
servants arrange everything around him to like to perfectly match
the order that he wanted everything to be in you
know the room the the military dress when he would
go um to inspect the Russian military every Soldier had
to wear the uniform that he designed he would design
the milk so he was so anal that he would
sit and he would spend hours and months designing military
uniforms for every Soldier and he would take great pride
in the uniforms he designed and then he himself would
wear these uniforms he had you know a bunch of
different uniforms for all these different occasions he would go
on parades this was like his favorite part of being
um a Tsar is working with the military and organizing
the military and just like you know being very very
like micromanaging meticulous about it and he found um he
found peace in that structure and Order and that's actually
why a lot of people find the military appealing you
know to many progressives and liberals to us the military
doesn't seem very appealing because it's so regimented it's so
strict like there's no room for improvisation and creativity and
Artistry and poetry in the military right like you got
to do everything by the numbers and somebody's giving you
all the orders but what you have to understand is
a progressive is that for many people for probably half
the world population they actually enjoy that regimentation because honestly
you can find peace in that you can find stability
in that um and Tsar Nicholas the first um he
was a tar during the later stages of the uh
Russian Empire which then you know collapsed um it was
basically collapsing under his watch and all the chaos that
was happening with the collapse of serfdom the freeing of
the serfs um in the in the late 1800s that
was happening in Russia and the early rise of of
marxists communist and socialist thought that was happening right around
that time which ultimately led to the um to the
Bolshevik Revolution and to the overthrow of the tsar and
um the end of the monarchy basically and then you
know the the beginning of the whole Soviet communist era
um he was dealing with that transition it was a
very very chaotic transition many people were killed many people
were jailed and imprisoned and so forth and he was
trying to keep a lid on that whole you know
powder cake to keep the whole country from just exploding
into chaos and so for him dealing with assassination attempts
and all these you know saboteurs and marxists that were
trying to take down the the the tsard at the
time at the time the monarchy um he was dealing
with all this and just think about how stressful that
was for him from his point of view imagine you're
him dealing with all that chaos what's the antidote to
chaos his order it's routine it's structure and that's what
he found appealing so think about examples in your own
life where this happens to you think about maybe some
of your friends who are just kind of like very
sloppy in the way they live life they don't have
a routine they don't wake up on time they don't
go to the gym they can't maintain a habit they
eat garbage you go to their house and there's pizza
boxes all around their house it smells there's dirty laundry
that's two months old they haven't made their bed in
a month this kind of stuff think about these kinds
of friends that you might have think about when you
enter a room like that that's just disorganized there's pizza
boxes everywhere think about how that makes you feel about
the person and yourself do you want to be in
that environment what's your tolerance for Chaos versus order in
your own life for example how long can you go
without cleaning your house can you go six months can
you go a year how does that make you feel
on the other hand how does it make you feel
when you organize everything your closet is organized your office
space is organized it's not an accident that Jordan Peterson
tells you to clean your room that's literally how a
conservative mind thinks everything is about order and structure and
that can be powerful for some people just starting to
clean their room that can be a baby step that
leads you to then putting the structures in place in
your life you know you clean your room you start
there then you go from that to start going to
the gym lifting some weights then you go from that
to cleaning your car then you go from that to
getting your your business finances in order you know doing
your taxes and all that kind of stuff and then
you just kind of build on that and build on
that and build on that and 10 20 years later
you have an amazing life you're a millionaire from doing
that that's possible other features of the conservative mind the
conservative mind is more safety oriented rather than adventurous the
liberal mind wants to go out there on an adventure
the conservative mind doesn't want that he wants Safety and
Security it values that more than interesting experiences and fun
adventures because Adventures can be dangerous and risky you know
has a friend of yours ever told you that to
do something like just kind of like on a lark
on a whim like hey let's go to Colombia I
had a friend of mine a pickup buddy of mine
who's like hey Leah let's just go to Columbia and
like spend a month there banging women and I'm just
like Colombia like that's kind of dangerous um but he
actually did that he went he lived in Columbia for
several months just having sex with women in Colombia you
know that's adventure and it's dangerous Colombia can be dangerous
there's reports nowadays of westerners being you know kidnapped in
Colombia held for ransom who knows what will happen there
but hey I'm sure it was fun too right I
missed out on that Adventure if I went to Columbia
for six months and just had sex with a bunch
of women that would be like that would probably be
like one of the most memorable experiences in my entire
life that would be one of the most adventurous things
I've ever done I didn't do that I was I
was conservative in that moment I was safety oriented I'm
like I don't know I don't know it sounds kind
of sketchy number one number two you know I got
I got like actualized I don't work to work on
if I go to Columbia that's going to distract from
my business that's going to distract from my personal development
work other work that I'm doing you know my meditation
and so forth whatever uh the conservative mind has a
lower tolerance for exploration how much do you value exploration
or are you the type of person that just eats
the same food and goes to the same places talks
to the same people and you don't like change for
example are you able to eat the same food for
a month straight every day and not get bored of
it or do you need more variety see this is
a this is a feature of your personality this is
wired into your how your personality works this is not
something you choose about yourself this is just how you're
how you're wired the conservative mind values confidence certainty convention
and sureness in one's beliefs the conservative mind does not
like having its beliefs undermined questioned it doesn't want uncertainty
he wants confidence which connects with that kind of closeness
the mind is closed when it's closed it's confident in
its sense of reality it's certain about what it knows
now of course there's huge downsides to that but there's
also upsides to that if you're always doubting yourself it's
hard to make any progress in your life if you're
constantly doubting yourself it's hard to run a business successfully
it's hard to begin a project and to stick with
that project because you're going to begin a project and
you're going to doubt yourself and then you're going to
quit and a lot of progressives and liberals have this
problem people who are overly adventurous overly um thrill seeking
need lots of variety uh they love Artistry and so
forth you know for many artists and I struggle with
my myself as an artist is that it's hard to
just begin an art project and then to finish it
to see it through to completion and so what you
have in your life is just a string of of
art projects that you began and never completed anything and
then you have nothing to show for it and also
you're broke because you can't deliver and sell a project
to somebody or a piece of art to somebody that
isn't finished isn't polished but the problem with some of
these art projects that they can take a long time
it can take you a year to finish an art
project whether it's writing a book or making a video
game or making a piece of music or whatever can
take you a year or more to do that making
a film for example um but then you get bored
with it halfway through you don't like the grind of
it you don't like the discipline it takes to actually
make a film making a film on the one hand
is a very artistic endeavor but on the other hand
making a film is a very technical Endeavor you have
to wake up on time you have to work really
hard you know people in the film industry work long
hours on these film shoots under grueling conditions in order
to make films same thing with making video games so
there is value in being able to discipline yourself and
to be strict with yourself and to be consistent and
to follow through on something that you plan for yourself
and if you're not able to do that you're just
not going to be successful in life which explains why
a lot of the most successful people are conservatives not
progressives because progressives tend to be so idealistic chasing adventure
and Artistry and just open-mindedness and philosophy and this kind
of stuff that um they don't have what it takes
to just do the work necessary to produce a finished
product that can be sold for money that will actually
benefit somebody you know all of your poetry and your
philosophy and um your fancy you know art projects and
all this what does it amount to does it actually
help somebody in the world so in this sense the
conservative is more pragmatic and there's value in that for
the conservative mind its sense of identity is deeply tied
to Family Heritage tradition culture subculture tribe nation and fitting
in so imagine actually experiencing Joy from fitting in to
these larger systems and structures that are already pre-made for
you when you're born in society some of us love
to challenge all these norms and systems but imagine that
you get a kick out of fitting in rather than
being a contrarian and your whole sense of identity is
actually tied up with that tied up with your bloodline
with your race with your ethnicity with the cuisine that
your culture has invented with traditions and then you try
to honor all of those and to execute them as
good as as well as you can rather than inventing
your own right see for the for the progressive we
want to invent our own traditions and experiment with all
sorts of different ways of living and odd subcultures invent
our own cultures and this kind of stuff for the
conservative it's the opposite they get the joy in fitting
in with all that stuff the conservative mind has its
roots in the past and seeks permanence the conservative mind
has higher levels of dogmatism Conformity and less openness to
new experience and uncertainty the conservative mind is Traditions is
Traditional Values oriented the conservative mind experiences anxiety and intimidation
from situations of uncertainty and ambiguity that's a very deep
point all elaborate upon a little bit later in this
episode the conservative mind has a smaller sphere of compassion
it's less empathetic again this is not me demonizing the
conservative mind it might sound like this is a negative
thing don't look at it that way this is actually
a rather objective metric you can measure the extent of
one's empathy by measuring the circle of compassion I call
it the sphere of compassion the circle of compassion that
one has who do you apply your empathy and compassion
to for example do you apply it to animals do
you apply to only cats and dogs or do you
apply it to Insects too do you apply it to
um what races of people do you apply to white
people black people Asian people too um do you apply
to people who are in the opposite of your political
party so do you apply empathy to conservatives if you're
a liberal and to liberals if you're conservative do you
apply it to um to criminals do you apply to
Nazis so how large is your circle of compassion so
for the conservative relative to the liberal it's smaller it's
tighter it's more constrained there's a stronger Dynamic of in-group
versus out-group My Tribe versus the others out there the
core potentially dangerous and must be uh defended against and
look sometimes other tribes out there will kill you sometimes
they are dangerous and sometimes you do have to protect
your tribe against you know the Nazi tribe next door
so it's not just all paranoia um don't classify the
conservative worldview as just paranoid it can be paranoid in
its extremes but you have to understand that there's healthy
and unhealthy formulations of both the conservative and the liberal
or Progressive worldview right so being very sensitive to threat
this is a problem when you're in a safe environment
it's dysfunctional but if you're in a dangerous environment if
you're in a war zone if you're dealing with a
dangerous deadly virus if you're dealing with Nazis compassion and
empathy can get you killed you understand that because you're
going to have compassion for the Nazi but the Nazi
won't have compassion for you he'll send you and your
family to the gas Chambers so you have to be
careful about that because the conservative mind grows up in
a tougher harsher survival environment life is just more difficult
and therefore there's less room for compassion if you are
a cheetah on the African Savannah you need to hunt
gazelles and rabbits or whatever to stay alive there's no
other option there's no option to have empathy for the
gazelle you have to go hunt it and kill it
and rip its guts out and eat it that's how
you survive now as a as a liberal you might
look at that you might say oh my God that's
so awful what an awful way to live what about
that poor little gazelle you know that poor baby gazelle
limping along and then some cheetah comes and eats it
you know isn't that cheetah being an [ __ ]
yeah that's Survival see he doesn't have the luxury of
what you have what you have as a progressive and
as a liberal is you have your survival taken care
of that's the only reason that you're able to have
the compassion you do is because your life is not
in danger appreciate that the way the conservative mind thinks
is like this I grew up in a very harsh
environment it was very difficult for me a lot of
people could have killed me abused me exploited me and
so forth I had to fend for myself so now
you know now that I've succeeded in that why should
I have a bunch of empathy for others who are
looking for handouts they have to go through the same
difficult survival Journey that I went through they have to
discipline themselves create structure in their life work really hard
and overcome all those challenges that's how you Master life
that's how you succeed in life not by asking others
to feel pity for you and to give you handouts
and to give you money and go begging for quarters
you know um and for for sympathy from others so
why should I have empathy for people who are lazy
and don't want to discipline themselves don't want to work
hard why should I have empathy for them why should
I give them things when nobody gave me anything when
I was growing up nobody helped me I had to
help myself I had to pull myself up by by
my bootstraps so that's just how life works and if
you start giving people handouts and stuff they're going to
become soft and you're not actually going to build the
character you need to succeed in life you see it's
not just that I went through a very difficult life
and dealt with all this [ __ ] and didn't
get didn't get any empathy or handouts is that not
only did that happen that actually made me who I
am that built my character that tempered me like steel
that made me strong and if we just give everybody
everything if the government just has this amazing welfare system
where uh kids don't even have to worry about getting
good grades in school because they know that when they
graduate you know there's going to be free college and
they don't even have to worry about getting into college
because it's just like everyone can get in anywhere there's
no rigorous standards you know if you want you can
go to any college you want it's going to be
all free for you you don't have to think very
hard about what your major is going to be you
don't have to be very careful about your money and
so forth then you're going to grow up very sloppy
and you're not going to have the skills it takes
to be good at anything that's the argument that's the
argument I'm not saying that this is true I'm saying
this is this is a world view there's alternative World
Views alternative perspectives which we'll cover in the next episode
but you have to admit that there is some truth
to this worldview think about situations in your life where
going through difficult ordeals survival situations has toughened you and
has grown your character and you wouldn't trade that for
anything in retrospect you know at the time maybe it
was difficult and nobody gave you any handouts or empathy
but you somehow you you made it through that you
worked through it you pulled Yourself by your bootstraps remember
how good that feels and also how that grew you
and how that made you who you are and now
you're able to do things you wouldn't have otherwise been
able to do think about how it works in the
military you know in the military there's not much room
for empathy if your gun jams in the military nobody's
gonna help you out the enemy is going to shoot
you in the head so you're responsible for fixing your
own gun Jam in the military in the military nobody's
going to come and give you food or assistance when
you're you know Behind Enemy Lines you got to figure
all that out for yourself you got to be self-reliant
you got to be very disciplined and strict with yourself
in the military you can't just wake up anytime you
want you got to wake up when you gotta wake
up because the enemy is coming to kill you if
it's in the middle of the night it's in the
middle of the night you can't just be like hitting
the snooze button on your alarm in the military for
obvious reasons because if it worked that way you'd be
dead all the people in the military who behave that
way they were killed or they were expelled and all
the all the countries who had sloppy militaries they were
all conquered by the countries that have very strict militaries
so this circle of concern is smaller for the conservative
mind which leads us to the next point which is
that the conservative mind has a lower capacity for unconditional
love and acceptance again this might sound like a negative
thing if you're a progressive or a liberal listening to
this you might say well Leo that that just proves
my point that conservativism is bad and wrong because isn't
the whole point of life unconditional love and acceptance isn't
that what you teach therefore conservativism is objectively wrong not
not so fast you see um because um there's actually
nothing in the universe that tells you that you should
be unconditionally loving sometimes I speak of it that way
when I do spiritual topics but actually there's no reason
to be unconditionally loving versus conditionally loving and in fact
survival demands that you that your love is limited and
conditional not unconditional so you have to really distinguish here
between the spiritual stuff that I talk about and then
the survival stuff in politics when we're talking about politics
we're talking about survival we're not talking about God realization
and Awakening and infinite love and all it no politics
is about survival how are you going to survive there's
a very good reason why most human beings are not
very loving at all it's because survival is much much
more difficult when you're unconditionally loving in fact maybe it's
impossible consider the possibility that if you're initially loving you'd
be dead so which are you going to choose the
conservative mind chooses survival over unconditional love the the liberal
mind might might um choose unconditional love over survival but
again of course most liberals don't do that I'm talking
about like the most extreme extreme radical form of of
liberal open-mindedness most humans are so closed-minded and so unaccepting
and so judgmental and so conditionally loving that they cannot
even understand that something like Nazism is a form of
love they can't understand that the conservative mind can't understand
that even though Nazis are conservative but you see what
you have to understand is that conservative and liberal these
are not just a binary there's many degrees of conservative
and Main degrees of liberal it's a spectrum and what
even the most liberal and Progressive people today subscribe to
is still such low levels of acceptance and open-mindedness and
um and Consciousness and conditional love that the things that
I talk about the very damn spiritual stuff that I
talk about is so far out there that it's like
it's transhuman it's not even practical for a human to
believe these things or to think about these things because
they're so antithetical to human survival even for the most
Progressive of humans never mind the conservative ones see so
I want you to understand no matter how you identify
whether conservative or very Progressive um even as a very
Progressive person you still draw lines there are still areas
in your life where you're behaving in a conservative manner
for example I could tell you that Nazism is love
right and you as a progressive would say no Leo
that's wrong in that instance you're being conservative relative to
me you're being conservative see relative to what's possible so
just understand that okay moving on um the conservative mind
is more moralistic it has a stronger sense of absolute
Good and Evil it tends to be very judgmental and
have an objective morality there's clear Rights and Wrongs things
you should and shouldn't do also because it's more moralistic
it's more self-righteous look if I'm gonna adhere to a
strict moral code which most conservatives like to do and
I'm gonna actually not be a hypocrite but do all
of the work necessary to adhere to the code I'm
not going to cheat I'm not going to steal I'm
not going to kill I'm not gonna lie I'm not
gonna do all the Ten Commandments stuff that you're not
supposed to do and I'm going to work really hard
to be in Integrity with that if I see somebody
who's violating my moral code I'm going to get very
self-righteous about it I'm going to get very judgmental of
them very critical of them and I'm going to hold
myself as above them because that's the whole sort of
motivation that I had to stick to the moral code
in the first place is because I want to be
good and for the conservative being good means sticking to
an objective moral code for the progressive this doesn't make
a lot of sense in certain ways um but um
again life can be a lot easier when you just
have a simple moral code to follow see you might
say well Leo isn't morality all a gray area isn't
all kind of subjective what is good what is evil
sure we've talked about that in the past um but
think about how much more difficult it is to live
life in this morally ambiguous uncertain way remember the conservative
mind wants order and structure and Clarity and certainty there's
a certain comfort that you get from knowing that uh
uh murder is evil and wrong and therefore you should
never do it theft is evil and wrong and you
should never do it abortion is evil and wrong you
should never do it and so on and that if
you do any of those things you're going to hell
it's very easy in that case to just follow the
rules right think about how hard it is to be
a moral relativist or a nihilist where you're living in
this morally ambiguous world where everything is kind of gray
there's no black and white everything is gray and you
don't know whether you should do this or do that
you know you're at work should you steal some paper
clips uh who's it gonna hurt right but then you
start to doubt yourself you know where do you draw
the line if I'm allowed to steal some paper clips
at work am I allowed to you know steal some
software steal some video games am I allowed to you
know steal some porn you know where do you draw
the line and then it's difficult because then you have
to draw the lines yourself whereas for the conservative the
lines are already pre-drawn for them it's like the difference
between drawing freehand and painting inside the lines or by
the Numbers it's a lot easier to paint by the
numbers and you get enough much nicer image in the
end unless you're extremely skilled you know you're extremely skilled
at Artistry and and drawing and painting then you can
just do a free hand drawing and it'll look nice
but for most people they're not good at drawing and
the best drawing that they can come up with is
painting by numbers and that's easy it simplifies your life
conservativism simplifies life that's why it's so appealing I told
you it's appealing um now if you're a true artist
you know you don't like painting my numbers you look
at that and you're like painting by numbers that that
defeats the whole purpose of life and art the whole
point of art is that I can come up with
whatever I want I don't have to paint within the
lines well there's trade-offs there trade-offs the conservative mind has
an absolutist metaphysics epistemology and morality there is a fixed
objective way that reality is and humans can come to
know that reality through a fixed certain epistemology and also
they can live in alignment with that reality through a
fixed moral system morality is not black and white I
mean morality Is Not Great morality is black and white
and therefore all you have to do is just live
by those rules and you'll be good you'll be in
alignment with god with truth with love and everything else
the conservative mind believes in moral order and moral Authority
moral order means an intimate hierarchy of just authority figures
I'm sorry not an intimate an innate an innate hierarchy
of just authority figures and moral Authority means that moral
Authority exists and is itself just moral and beneficial so
ask yourself this do you believe in moral order and
moral Authority do you believe that there's a certain way
that humans can act that leads to Justice do you
believe that certain human beings have authority over other human
beings because of superior character because they live their life
according to certain codes of morality and justice this will
determine whether you're liberal or conservative the conservative mind believes
in objective dualities and binary opposites it likes clear distinctions
clearly demarcated order versus disorder so I have a three-part
series called understanding duality part one part two part three
where we talk about hundreds of different dualities such as
Man versus machine child versus adult life versus death mind
versus matter self worship versus World humans versus animals Man
versus God and so on so for the conservative mind
these are fixed static clearly black and white distinctions and
for the liberal mind these distinctions are blurry they're gray
they're fluid and they're ambiguous this is a huge fundamental
distinction between the conservative and the liberal mind the more
you start to blur these distinctions the more liberal your
mind's going to get the more open your mind is
going to get and the more static these distinctions become
for you the more you objectify and reify these distinctions
for example the distinction between man and God if you
believe that this is a fixed objective static distinction and
if there's no way that a man could ever become
God you have a very closed conservative mind also think
about how this applies to for example gender the whole
trans debate um conservatives don't like trans for a very
simple reason because it's blurring these boundaries and um it's
not really about who you're having sex with and so
forth It's it goes fundamentally to the core of your
world view and your metaphysics is your metaphysics such that
all these boundaries are just blurrable and changeable willy-nilly or
is your world view that these boundaries are fixed rigid
and that to play with these boundaries is very dangerous
for the conservative mind playing with these boundaries even if
they can be played with is very dangerous playing with
the boundary between man and woman is a very dangerous
game that could cause a lot of harm and the
conservative is going to err on the side of caution
when it comes to playing with those boundaries whereas the
liberal is going to say oh well what's what can
go wrong I want to I want to change my
gender to whatever I want I want to be a
man or a woman or I want to invent my
own gender or I want to be an alien or
I want to be an animal I want to do
whatever right today I want to be this way and
then tomorrow I'm going to change my mind and be
somebody else again for the conservative this is [ __
] Madness this is madness this is dangerous this is
going to hurt um and it's going to lead to
confusion and ambiguity in society not just for the individual
but for Society for children for adults for everybody it's
going to blur distinctions within seconds it's gonna it's gonna
transgress sexual norms and then who knows what comes next
homosexuality bestiality pedophilia who knows right now as a liberal
you might say oh Leo well there's no danger of
pedophilia there's no danger of bestiality these are these are
these are just ways of demonizing trans people you're not
understanding the death of this problem the reality is that
the conservative is actually right if you truly open your
mind radically radically probably beyond the levels that uh that
the typical Progressive has opened their minds to if you
radically open your mind then actually you will start to
blur distinctions between for example having sex with adults and
having sex with kids after all what is a kid
and what is an adult you're going to blur that
blur that line um you will even even blur the
line between having sex with with humans and animals uh
for example like think about like this let's say aliens
come and make contact with humans so here's a question
for you let's say that they're anatomically humanoid um and
we're sexually compatible in a certain sense is it is
it okay for a human to have sex with one
of these aliens I mean you know this is going
to be an issue in the next you know thousand
years this is going to be an issue it's going
to be a huge controversy there's going to be half
the population that says this is disgusting evil and wrong
and morally abhorrent and also dangerous and then half the
population is going to say that hey man relax it's
going to be cool you know free love and all
that and they're going to go have sex with with
these aliens um but remember sex is a dangerous thing
having sex with children can be very dangerous can be
very harmful to Children um having sex with animals can
create diseases and viruses there's a theory that the AIDS
virus was actually um created by people having sex with
monkeys I don't know if that's true or not it's
kind of a maybe an urban legend I don't know
but um but I mean we know that like just
from from covid we know and from other viruses that
many of the deadliest viruses come from um humans either
eating animals or having inappropriate contact with animals in an
unsanitary way right um and AIDS was more prevalent amongst
the gay community than it was in the heterosexual community
right so um it actually is true that homosexuality is
more dangerous than heterosexuality given that aids is much more
prevalent and transmits much more easily through anal sex than
it does through vaginal sex right so um again be
careful not to dismiss the conservative perspective as just paranoid
it's not simply paranoid it can be paranoid now do
conservatives overplay the dangers yes they do um but um
those fears and insecurities do have certain you know legitimate
um factors to them for example having sex with aliens
you don't know what kind of dangers this will lead
to it might create a new virus it might create
some sort of animosity between the aliens and the humans
you know what happens when a human and an alien
fall in love and then they break up maybe it'll
start a you know a new world war who knows
right um what happens if if a human impregnates an
alien what kind of baby is gonna happen is it
gonna be some sort of distorted um you know uh
Mutant baby that's going to be in pain and suffering
you don't know these are all legitimate concerns that a
conservative would have and you yourself if you're not a
bit squeamish or you know apprehensive about having sex with
an alien well you're rather foolish because you don't know
what's gonna what's gonna come of that because anytime you're
entering into unknown territory it's potentially very dangerous and that's
fundamentally what the conservative mind is about it's about um
stressing and emphasizing the dangers of the unknown whereas the
liberal mind is about um saying you know to hell
with it throw caution to the wind it'll probably be
okay let's go have an adventure let's go exploring the
unknown it'll be cool it'll be fun well a lot
of times it's fun but sometimes it's dangerous sometimes it
could cost you your life you know curiosity killed the
cat as they say that's what the conservative would tell
you so for um you know um for the conservative
mind the belief that human nature the belief is that
human nature is fixed it's not fluid it's not flexible
it's not subjective it's not relative think about for example
what will be happening in the next Thousand Years with
you with Humanity when we start mixing human and animal
DNA through genetic engineering and also man machine interfaces through
neuralink and stuff like this uh we're entering into potentially
very very dangerous territory with cloning with genetic engineering with
um uh computer augmentations what's going to happen again if
you're not worried about the potential risks and dangers of
that you're not thinking straight you're being a fool um
which was why when it comes to genetic engineering being
very conservative is the best approach when it comes to
modifying human DNA you want to be very very conservative
on that front see when it comes to implanting microchips
into your brain you want to be very conservative too
because what's going to happen to humans if we implant
Twitter and Facebook at Instagram directly into our brains maybe
that'll be the end of mankind so the conservative would
say you know don't mess with things that already work
don't mess with the natural order of things so conservatives
have a strong sense of the natural Order of Things
for them that's not just a construction that's that's god-given
for the conservative mind the idea of natural law and
god-given rights is very strong they don't see these things
as just willy-nilly inventions of man whereas liberals tend to
just see these things as just oh just arbitrary inventions
of man you know we invented culture this way we
could invent it that way tomorrow but you have to
be careful about your inventions even if something is an
invention that doesn't mean you can just uninvent it easily
or just change it willy-nilly social constructions have a power
and a life to them of Their Own they become
as though nature as though god-given for the conservative mind
the highest good is Duty in the name of Good
by conforming to the ideals of the status quo so
there's a list of Ten Commandments or moral principles by
which one should live and then the highest good is
to understand study and subscribe dutifully to this list and
to obey it and to make sure that everybody around
you does the same thing in the conservative's mind this
is how we construct a good healthy Society we don't
do it by everybody just willy-nilly doing whatever they want
whatever they come up with it's not just all relative
there's right and wrong ways of doing things if you
want to make a good pizza there's a right way
and a wrong way of making a good pizza if
you just take a a pound of sugar and dump
it on the pizza that's not going to make for
a good pizza and if what you care about is
making the best pizza then you become a stickler about
following the recipe of a good pizza that's what the
conservative will say you know the conservative will say don't
go Reinventing the pizza the pizza is already great it
doesn't need a bunch of Innovations whereas the liberal will
say ah but you know what about making some cool
exotic new pizza let's make some alien Pizza let's make
some pizza with ostrich meat and with you know exotic
fruits we found in the Amazon jungle why don't we
make that kind of pizza the conservative would say that's
only going to make the pizza worse classic pepperoni cheese
pizza you know New York style that's the best pizza
you don't want an ostrich meat pizza that's not going
to taste good crocodile Pizza what kind of what kind
of nonsense is this but to the cons to the
liberal mind this is actually appealing the liberal mind wants
to go and explore different kinds of pizzas with exotic
ingredients now the risk is that you're going to make
some sort of awful Pizza and in fact that's usually
what you're going to get when you start just innovating
and throwing stuff into a pizza you're going to make
it worse not better but what the conservative is missing
is that you might discover that ostrich pizza or crocodile
Pizza is even better than pepperoni pizza but there's risk
there's risk in exploring that so for the conservative following
these rules is how you be good and defeating evil
doers and those in your out group those that are
not in your tribe that's also how you be good
because those who are not part of your tribe they
don't subscribe to your moral list of how to be
good that means by definition they're being bad right like
because if if other people were good they would be
following your list of principles and rules but since there
and then they would be part of your tribe because
part of what determines whether someone's in your tribe or
not is whether they subscribe to your moral principles rules
cultures customs and institutions and if they don't then by
definition they're bad that's the logic the conservative mind is
more faith-based more ideological more fundamentalist more religious spirituality for
the conservative mind is more Orthodox religion than it is
being a new age free spirit believing in whatever you
want practicing however you want for the conservative mind there's
no problem mixing church and state they should be mixed
because after all if you have the one true religion
and your religion has the best moral code and everybody
then should be following this moral code it only naturally
makes sense that the government should be a state sponsor
of this moral code it should be promoted in schools
at the workplace um in government holidays in government um
law in the courtroom and elsewhere because this this is
the way how you be good and what we want
as conservatives and as all people as we want to
create a good Society see both conservatives and liberals want
to create a good Society uh it's just that they
they have different ways of going about it so the
conservative likes to mix church and state and from the
conservatives point of view if you don't mix church and
state that means that your state is going to be
Godless and your state is not going to be forced
to subscribe to the rules and moral code that makes
anyone or anything good and therefore your state is going
to be evil so obviously you don't want an evil
state and the conservative will say that any time in
human history where um the state has gotten too separated
from morality it has become evil and so that's just
not just paranoia these these can be legitimate concerns you
know look at Soviet Soviet communist Russia look at Nazi
Germany look at maoist China and so forth many of
these states were sort of Godless atheistic or had their
own like weird Pagan like for example um some people
say well you know Chris Hitler wasn't an atheist Hitler
wasn't an atheist but Nazism was like paganism basically and
what the Conservative Christian would say is that the reason
Nazism happened is because um you know paganism is dangerous
that's what happens when you allow people to invent their
own spiritual traditions and religions and just kind of like
pick and choose whatever they want in the way that
Hitler did you know Hitler picked some stuff from from
Hindu spirituality and from from Viking um spirituality and from
sort of like Germanic Pagan spirituality kind of like mixed
and matched whatever he wanted and came up with his
own like hodgepodge of of thing and it was a
travesty it had no moral Center to it that's what
a Conservative Christian would say now of course there's counter
arguments to this I'm not going to get into all
these counter arguments because it would just take too long
we have to keep moving so I'm not I'm not
presenting a fully balanced picture here if you're conservative I
know you want to you want to like debate and
debunk each one of these points that I'm making just
try to resist that urge and just kind of take
it in take in the conservative world you without immediately
judging it and trying to debunk it this is not
serving you if you want to debunk it you can
do that later after you spend a long time deeply
understanding it and feeling its appeal anyways moving on the
conservative mind wants personal religious values beliefs and ideals to
be directly codified into law it seeks to increase religion
in public life but of course not all religion just
their religion the the conservative mind tends to be less
well-traveled less worldly and more isolated less educated Less open
to science and objective rationality again you might say well
Leo this proves that in the conservative worldview is deficient
or worse than the liberal one um no not strictly
speaking it's not worse it's just different you could even
say less developed but be careful not to confuse less
developed with worse or with bad or with wrong or
with objectively false right um less developed is a nuanced
notion when I say something is less developed I'm not
demonizing it for example when I say that a first
grader is less developed than a fifth grader I'm not
demonizing the first grader right you have to be very
careful about that it doesn't make the first grade or
wrong and this development is is relativistic so just because
something is less developed now it'll develop over time and
then just because something is more developed now relatively it's
still less developed than something that comes after it right
but generally speaking it's true that conservative folk are less
educated they're less well-traveled they're less worldly and because um
they tend to be religious I mean of course there's
some conservatives who are not religious at all there's atheists
who are conservatives um you can find those exceptions but
um generally speaking the conservative mind is going to be
less open to science and objective rationality because actually science
requires quite a lot of open-mindedness to do well and
one of the problems within science which I've talked about
elsewhere is if the sun if the scientific mind gets
closed down into some Paradigm gets locked in then it
turns into bad science um so to really be able
to do high quality rationality and science you have to
be extremely open-minded which it's a problem for conservatives the
conservative mind cares about national identity symbolism and patriotism it
cares more about defending the status quo because the status
quo is a source of security and safety to the
conservative mind questioning the status quo can feel like betrayal
or disloyalty and conservatives value loyalty very highly so this
is one of the big differences between conservatives and liberals
liberals love questioning trashing and shitty on the status quo
only seeing the bad parts of the status quo ignoring
all the good parts whereas the conservative tends to do
the opposite ignore the bad parts and emphasize the good
parts and those who trash the status quo they seem
like Heretics um or they seem like they're betraying something
good for example when I speak about the problems within
science the epistemic metaphysical foundations of science there's problems there
I've talked about that in the past uh people who
are really subscribed to materialist science when they listen to
that to me criticizing science they perceive that as me
being anti-science and being uh disloyal and betraying science whereas
when I do that I see myself as being pro-science
and actually trying to improve science by removing its Corruptions
right see so the progressive thinks that by trashing the
status quo he is improving it by pointing out its
laws whereas the conservative thinks that by criticizing the status
quo too harshly for example some people think that Leo
the way you criticize and trash science is actually very
dangerous and bad because it makes it seem as though
nobody should be studying science that science is bad and
horrible and irredeemable of course that's not my position I
don't say that science is irredeemable and horrible it's important
and necessary but it's got problems this is exactly what's
happening when it comes to government in various kinds of
institutions is that conservatives see the good in the institutions
and progressives only Tennessee the bad because they care about
reforming it and changing it the conservative mind defends culture
it has a strong identity with its culture the more
you identify with your culture or subculture the more conservative
you're going to be because a threat to your culture
is a threat to your survival by extension to the
conservative mind the greatest threat is deterioration of moral of
the moral fabric of society therefore the conservative mind is
worried about social decadence and going soft the conservative mind
is easily threatened by the decay of society and simply
new habits routines Lifestyles new types of art new types
of dress new types of music new types of sex
drugs pornography these things are seen as threatening uncivilized crude
corrupting foolish frivolous ungrounded and even evil the conservative mind
fears that without strict adherence to rules order and tradition
Society will fall apart and people will turn into degenerates
and Savages the conservative mind believes that people need strong
external structures and constraints to behave well sometimes as a
Progressive or a liberal you look at a conservative and
you think like well do you really need some commandment
from God to tell you not to rape people I
mean isn't this just kind of obvious can't you can't
you derive not raping people from your own inner moral
compass rather than having to listen to some Pope tell
you that it's wrong uh and the conservatives response is
yeah if you're a good decent human being you can
but most people are sheep most people just do what
everybody else is doing and if there are not these
structures that teach people that rape is wrong then we're
going to have a bunch of rampant rape as a
progresses you might think well no that's crazy that's not
going to happen there's no risk of that but then
go to a country like India where gang rape is
a very common problem and in general rewind the clock
a few thousand years and rape was very very common
it still is common but compared to what it was
a few thousand years ago so what you need to
understand as a progressive is that the idea that rape
is wrong that it should be outlawed this is a
human invention humans had to invent that idea because in
the animal kingdom there is no laws against rape humans
had to invent that not only did they have to
invent it they had to cultivate the Norms that it's
wrong right see it's not enough to just invent the
law that rape is illegal and punishable by whatever penalties
you then have to spread to millions of people in
your community that it's wrong and you have to judge
it morally condemn it make people feel ashamed of doing
it make feel people feel bad about it convince people
that they're going to go to hell for doing it
and then you can get a handle on rape to
an extent I mean it's still going to happen but
for the majority of people they'll be convinced through this
process right but what you're not appreciating as a progressive
or liberal is that that's something that had to be
developed over thousands of years Society had to develop that
to the point where today if you rape somebody you're
going to feel ashamed of it you know most people
will um uh but um that's not quote unquote natural
there's no no such thing as you know some natural
law um that makes you feel ashamed for being a
rapist no like humans had to invent that and then
they had to enforce it and the way the way
they enforced it is through stuff like the Ten Commandments
the stuff that conservatives defend because if they didn't defend
it humans would be Savages and the reality is that
humans are savages go look at what's happening in the
war in Ukraine rampant rape by Russian soldiers why is
that because when survival gets tough humans turn into savages
the conservative understands that the progressive is actually pretty naive
about that the progressive thinks that just empathy alone will
keep people from being Savages but of course human history
has shown that that's not the case empathy alone is
not enough you need institutions you need police you need
judges you need courts you need religious systems you need
the Pope practically that's what humans needed now in the
future maybe we won't need that but today or in
the past realistically that's what we needed so the conservative
believes that people need strong external structures and constraints to
behave well this is why the conservative is so concerned
and goes into a moral Panic about the breakdown of
these structures for example you know the conservative mind might
believe that if we don't have strong heterosexual Norms then
people might start to experiment with homosexuality they might actually
discover that they like it and enjoy it and then
there will be a lot more homosexual sex now the
progressive says well so what let people have sex however
they want well the conservative might say well it's going
to lead to the spread of disease and AIDS and
also it's going to lead to a breakdown of the
family unit and there's going to be less children how
are we going to sustain the population if half the
population is having gay sex see now as a progressive
you'll say well we'll we'll solve that problem when we
get to it if it's even a problem the conservative
says no it's going to be too late to solve
that problem by the time we get to it we
got to be concerned about it now we gotta preempt
it therefore let's be conservative and let's enforce heterosexual norms
and let's not have gay marriage and so forth now
I'm not saying which is right I'm just I'm just
showing you different World Views try not to think of
these things as right or wrong these are different trade-offs
these are survival trade-offs right you might have a preference
for being more LAX or being more anal more liberal
more conservative these are trade-offs there's not some right answer
there's not a right answer on gay sex there's not
a right answer on abortion trade-offs there will be pros
and cons to any of these different policies or World
Views and if you go too far in either direction
there's going to be problems you know if humans you
know decide that the next hot trend is having sex
with with monkeys um that can become toxic dysfunctional unhealthy
and lead to many problems on the other hand if
humans decide that the only kind of sex we're going
to have is heterosexual sex and any other kind of
sex will be punished by Death that's also going to
lead to problems so be careful with both extremes the
conservative mind wants to reject behavior that does not conform
to some social Norm the conservative mind has a fear
of new technology and the potential disruption that that could
have on social order this is a constant problem throughout
human history is that new technology is developed and then
it disrupts the old social order whether it's the printing
press whether it's steam engines Cotton Gins a nuclear weaponry
social media the internet pornography whatever it's always disrupting and
creating problems now of course it's creating a lot of
benefit but it's a mixed bag it's a benefit it's
there's always pros and cons and trade-offs with all new
technology so the progressive is going to tend to throw
more caution to the wind and a more embracing of
new technology whereas the conservative is going to be more
uh insecure and protective against new technology and hey you
know that's not necessarily wrong again like I said you
know nuclear technology genetic engineering um social media these are
dangerous Technologies look at what social media has done to
society in the last 10 years some pretty nasty ugly
stuff suicide rates are up people are having less sex
people are more lonely um girls are feeling [ __
] about horrible about themselves because of Instagram and all
this kind of stuff so like um people are getting
sucked into rabbit holes of conspiracy thinking and toxic ideology
through algorithms on YouTube and social media Facebook potentially very
dangerous stuff the conservative mind is more concerned about pleasing
others and fitting um and fitting in with the in-group
it's more of the conformist stage of ego development so
go check out my series The Nine stages of ego
development part one two three where one of the stages
is the conformist stage that's a lot of where conservativism
comes from conservatives seek to preserve culture and ethnic identity
they see themselves as the Guardians of an endangered civilization
they're less tolerant of disorder the conservative mind values obedience
to Authority with an emphasis on respect for authority allegiance
to the group and purity of self the conservative mind
is more authoritarian more strict and more domineering it's less
critical of authority it's more patriarchal more hierarchical more nationalist
more ethnocentrist and more monocultural the conservative mind has a
deep love for its culture above all others it sees
its own culture as Superior morally and in other ways
the conservative mind has a fear and discomfort with alien
cultures the conservative mind practices a sort of paternalistic love
which means that the leader the powerful authoritarian leader has
a duty to safeguard the weak among his flock and
then the weak among his flock have a duty to
obey and respect the authoritarian paternalistic leader this is what
I call paternalistic love the conservative mind favors the masculine
versus feminine form of compassion I have an episode called
masculine versus feminine compassion go check that out a masculine
compassion is more tough-minded whereas feminine compassion is more tender-minded
so the progressive is going to have a more tender-minded
form of compassion this is one of the key differences
between these two minds the conservative mind sees the dangers
of idiot compassion feminine compassion and over empathy empathy can
be dangerous from the conservative point of view the conservative
mind tends to express love as tough love if you
really love your child are you going to let your
child eat a bunch of junk food and Candy his
whole life is that how you raise your child or
do you toughen the child up do you discipline the
child do you give the child certain rules of do's
and don'ts that make it simple for the child to
be good otherwise the child is sort of just lost
in a moral relativism and ambiguity and doesn't even know
what the right and wrong things are and then the
chances of the travel figured out for himself are quite
low because he's just going to be following all the
other stupid kids and what they're doing getting himself into
trouble so um one of the ways to to just
kind of gauge yourself how liberal or conservative are you
think about it like this do this thought experiment if
you're going to have children how do you prefer to
raise your children are you going to err on the
side of being too strict or are you going to
err on the side of being too permissive which do
you think is the greater Danger do you think the
greater dangers that your kid is just going to be
um have no rules and gonna be out there doing
whatever doing drugs having sex and then getting himself into
trouble and eventually he's gonna horribly ruin his life do
you think that's the greatest danger that your child needs
to be protected from or do you think the greater
danger is that uh you're going to be so strict
with your child that you're going to traumatize your child
with all these rules and the child is not even
going to feel like you love them because you're strict
with the child all the time and therefore the child
is going to rebel against you and um and then
just to spite you go out there and do dangerous
things and take risks and become dysfunctional which is the
greater Danger do you think that if you're going to
be too strict with your child you're going to end
up brainwashing your child and that's going to be bad
or do you think your child needs to learn these
things for himself or herself and generate the answers for
example are you gonna give your child a moral code
to follow or are you going to allow your child
to derive his or her own moral code and then
are you worried about what kind of moral code they're
going to derive are they going to derive the right
moral code or the wrong moral code what if they
derive a moral code that that says that having sex
with animals and children is good what if that's their
moral code are you gonna be okay with that or
are you going to trust them to derive the right
moral code the conservative mind has a disdain for weakness
because weakness is dangerous conservatives don't like coddling the weak
they like telling the weak to toughen up the conservative
mind favors a harsher form of Justice with less empathy
towards those who break the rules because breaking the rules
is a serious violation and it's bad and it could
lead to the collapsed Society therefore we need to be
strict about enforcing the rules therefore an eye for an
eye a tooth for a tooth less leniency less Mercy
if you break the laws suffer the consequences don't go
asking for breaks you know what the laws are you
know what the consequences are therefore don't ask for leniency
the conservative mind is more prone to violence this is
not a smear or a straw man of the conservative
mind it's simply that the conservative mind is more down
to earth more engaged in survival at that sort of
animalistic level at the animalistic level a lot of disputes
are resolved through violence in a prison a lot of
disputes are resolved through violence not through empathy not through
therapy not through sitting in a drum circle And discussing
our differences and conscious communication and free love no you
punch someone you shank someone that's legitimate foreign but of
course the conservative makes a distinction between oral violence versus
immoral violence so there's times when violence is Justified and
moral and other times when it isn't the conservative mind
responds to threatening situations with more aggression and um it's
more reactive to perceived threats because it's more insecure fundamentally
more fearful the the conservative mind is less sentimental about
war it's more willing to fight and use violence due
to having less empathy war is legitimate when it's the
in the name of good in the name of morality
and also war is legitimate because sometimes repressive force is
necessary to suppress chaos to maintain order and sometimes the
greatest danger is not the war itself or uh too
much order but too much chaos the breakdown of order
so again keep in mind that these are just generalizations
right not every conservative is going to subscribe to all
this these are just generalizations now here's another way to
think about the conservative mind in a very fundamental way
the general outlook for the conservative mind is that the
world is a dangerous place there's no time for frivolity
so follow the strict father leader to learn discipline obedience
respect and self-reliance then follow the rules and don't get
sloppy about it stay disciplined or else something bad will
happen don't get too artsy don't get too creative or
else don't innovate too much or else don't explore too
much of the unknown or else keep to your kind
because others out there other tribes are selfish and dangerous
and you don't know what you're dealing with when you're
dealing with others so keep to your own kind stay
loyal to your own kind your kind will protect you
and defend you and you have a duty to protect
and defend them against others from the outside who threaten
us this is the general conservative worldview the details will
change who the leader is will change what the rules
are will change what the religion is will change who
the tribes are will change but this is the general
structure you were under such pressure to survive that you
cannot afford to be loose and Lacks so again the
strict Father Figure versus the permissive mother the conservative sees
the liberal as the permissive mother and the conservative sees
the permissive mother as more dangerous than the restrictive father
conservativism is an attitude towards change that views change as
necessary but cautious and prudent you need to be cautious
and prudent about doing change because what exists has stood
the test of time and what you're changing into who
knows what that's going to bring for example this will
drive the point home think about cutting out organs from
your body what if you're naive enough to think that
you know I know better than then the nature that
Evolution you know I don't need a second kidney I'm
just going to cut out my kidney um do I
really need my gallbladder maybe I'll cut that out too
see you have to go in to biology assuming that
every organ in your body is there for a reason
there are no extraneous organs in the body it's all
there serving a function the conservative tends to hold that
same line of logic towards society as a whole and
culture and Mankind as a whole it's all there for
a reason right so you have to be very careful
changing it because you might change something in this complex
system which will have unintended consequences you know you might
think that changing the institution of marriage and redefining it
to include gay people that this is just it's just
a minor change nothing no big deal it's not going
to lead to any problems but then unintended consequences happen
and that's what the conservative is worried about and trying
to protect against to the conservative mind tradition represents the
wisdom of the species and community and social harmony are
more important than idealistic social reforms so if we can
make a reform that's gonna create social disharmony even if
that reform is going to improve Society in some other
way the net negative is going to be worse in
this case because of the disharmony it creates therefore we
shouldn't pursue this reform the liberal thinks exactly the opposite
way the conservative mind prefers patience and gradualism over Promises
of utopia and revolution the conservative mind sees Revolution as
far more dangerous than the status quo the attempt to
make the world perfect can cause more harm than good
The Cure can be worse than the disease the idea
that there are that there is um let me rephrase
that the conservative mind subscribes to the idea that there
is something intrinsically good about what already exists as our
ancestors built it the conservative mind has a certain realism
to it it has a suspicion of utopian schemes they
sound too good to be true so when the Liberals
and progressives promise US free health care and free college
and a great welfare state and a socialist Utopia the
conservative thinks that's too good to be true what's the
catch because the conservatives has a fundamentally negative view of
human nature and our ability to social socially engineer Utopia
the progressive thinks that humans can all live in peace
and Harmony if we just work together and love each
other a little bit more and we're just a little
bit more open-minded and a little bit less hateful and
racist the conservative says no there are rapists out there
are Nazis there are um communists and there are criminals
and God knows what else there are revolutionaries and they're
going to lead to the collapse of all of society
if we don't keep them in check and that something
like empathy and love alone are not going to be
enough to make this work Society doesn't run on empathy
and love it runs on laws and force and police
the conservative knows and understands that new fads come and
go quickly out of fashion and that most Innovations fail
which is why we should be suspicious of them fundamentally
conservativism is about feeling secure securing your identity and your
survival with the people around you with your culture feeling
comfortable and familiar building your own personal little community your
own little personal Paradise of those who you can trust
in your tribe and then those who are not in
your tribe you can't trust those people and they can't
be part of building your Paradise because they have different
values different Norms different moral schemes and you won't be
able to get along the conservative mind has a more
realistic view of the brutality of human nature therefore it's
more realistic it's also more pessimistic and therefore it's more
defensive and protective which was why for example conservatives like
to spend more on military defense because the conservative generally
thinks that there's bad countries and actors out there who
are going to come and rape and pillagers if we're
not extra protective whereas the liberal says oh we can
get along with them just with diplomacy and the conservative
says no diplomacy is not going to be enough when
Putin comes knocking on your door for example the liberal
might say let's give everyone free speech and the conservative
might say let's not because if we allow everyone to
say whatever they want then we're going to have a
bloody Civil War because people are not going to get
along they're going to be fighting and that's going to
be worse than the situation we have now so instead
let's execute a few of these revolutionaries who want free
speech Kill Them All in the end this is going
to be a net positive we're going to maintain peace
and harmony and Life Will Go On well now you
might say Leo this is this doesn't make sense because
aren't conservatives for free speech these days and Liberals are
against free speech and for censorship look things have gotten
Twisted traditionally conservatives have never been for free speech um
because free speech is dangerous so the traditional conservative position
is to prohibit Free Speech look at any conservative um
third world country Russia Iran Saudi Arabia China Brazil these
countries are very conservative relative to America to American Standards
look at the Taliban in Afghanistan very conservative relative to
Americans the Taliban or even the Chinese government I mean
the Chinese Communist Party these people nominally they might seem
like they're very liberal you know Communists are liberal no
the the Chinese Communist party and the the Taliban these
are so conservative that they make America's most conservative um
political commentators look like uh bleeding heart liberals so look
at the Taliban in the Taliban they don't allow you
free speech they don't need to allow you free um
choice of clothing to wear for women right so why
is it that women are not allowed to wear whatever
they want in Afghanistan because the survival conditions in Afghanistan
are so brutal that if women just wear whatever they
want if you have women walking around in a [
__ ] mini skirt in Afghanistan they're going to get
raped and everyone in the Taliban understands this the only
people who don't understand this are [ __ ] American
liberals and progressives because they're [ __ ] so stupid
so um restriction of speech dress freedom of religion freedom
of sexuality all of these restrictions are conservative values and
they make sense when you're living in in an environment
where having that much freedom and flexibility uh becomes dangerous
and threatens the survival of this of the state the
tribe the people the culture the religion um or the
individuals see um authoritarian dictators do not allow Free Speech
why not because if they do what's going to happen
is that their power will get questioned and there will
be a bloody Civil War where all the different tribes
that they have unified will be fighting against each other
this is exactly what happened in Saddam Hussein's Iraq when
Saddam Hussein was deposed Iraq devolved into a bloody civil
war between the Shiites the sunnis the um the various
political parties and factions that existed the Kurds and so
forth and they're still fighting to this day and they
still can't get along right so what Saddam Hussein was
doing by limiting free speech and so forth is he
was conserving the the unity that was developed through Force
yeah he had to use Force to unify all those
people but he did unify them and so that's the
danger of too much freedom see in America today's conservatives
are like preaching Freedom they're not really for Freedom they
don't understand what freedom is they're bastardizing the notion of
Freedom conservatives are never for Freedom conservatives are terrified of
freedom true freedom is really scary so a lot of
times conservatives will say that they're for freedom but they
don't really understand what they're talking about it's traditionally liberals
that are for freedom and conservatives are right to criticize
liberals for too much freedom because too much freedom is
dangerous too much Freedom with who you have sex with
is dangerous too much Freedom with um um you know
where you go on vacation is dangerous you don't want
to go on vacation to Somalia that's dangerous you want
to restrict where you go on vacation you want to
restrict the freedom of your children allowing your children to
have sex with whoever they want do whatever kind of
drugs they want go hang out with whatever friends they
want put whatever tattoos on the on their face they
want this is dangerous if you're a conservative recognize you
don't like Freedom you're scared of freedom things have gotten
a little twisted up today in our in our very
uh polarized and Twisted 21st century world of politics in
America especially also try to see it this way if
people are selfish and cruel as a just as a
baseline to each other that justifies you not having too
much empathy for them and not being too nice and
too gullible for example if you're in a prison environment
people there are rough selfish and cruel empathy is not
going to get you very far in prison being too
nice is not going to get you very far you
want to make sure you're not being gullible only be
as empathetic as others are empathetic towards you and most
people are not very empathetic therefore you shouldn't be either
here's another example the conservative mind will say rather than
risking us being invaded by our neighbor let's invade our
neighbor first the liberal mind says no no no let's
just use diplomacy our neighbor's not going to invade us
don't worry about it be nice to them and we'll
get along fine now is that true well it depends
what kind of neighbor you have if you have Hitler
he'll he'll invade you even if you appease him famously
and then the liberal is going to call for a
disarmament a foolish kind of disarmament the liberal says let's
cut our military budget down to 10 of what it
is the conservative says that's crazy if you do that
you're just going to invite every dictator in the world
to come bully you the liberal says but if we
disarm uh and everybody disarms we can invest all that
money into public education and creating a better Society Better
Health Care and so forth yeah but that assumes you
won't get invaded and enslaved which you could who's right
well there's not a clear answer to this it all
depends on the situation in some situations for example would
Saddam Hussein have invaded America no um could the Chinese
start a war with America if America disarms possibly yeah
that's that's legitimate threat or could Putin yeah possibly from
the conservative point of view the economy has to be
organized around self-interest because people are fundamentally selfish democracy at
the workplace doesn't work because the average worker is lazy
and stupid and simply has no vision and no sense
of direction workers need an authoritarian boss to tell them
what to do and to make sure that they do
it in the same way that children need an authoritarian
parent to give them structure without which they'd be lost
very different than how the liberal things being a conservative
makes sense when the margin of error is very small
for example if you're doing brain surgery it's good to
be conservative err on the side of caution if you're
launching a spacecraft be very conservative if you're using a
chainsaw be very careful and you know don't don't go
um getting all artsy with your use of a chainsaw
there's a right and a wrong way to use a
chainsaw and if you don't follow the rules you're going
to cut your foot off and when it comes to
protecting your children you want to be conservative right you
want to err on the side of caution because you
care about your children so much you have so much
invested in them however for example if you're talking about
something that's not so sensitive and delicate and so life
and death then it makes more sense to be liberal
for example when you're cooking food or you're ordering new
food at a restaurant should you be anally conservative and
order the same thing every time or should you be
in veterans to take a risk well what is the
risk the risk is you're gonna order something that you
don't quite like it's not a big risk it's not
the same risk as misusing a chainsaw or doing brain
surgery incorrectly so see depending on the situation it makes
more or less sense to be liberal or conservative it's
very context sensitive you don't want to adopt a singular
monolithic strategy for survival like I'm going to be conservative
in all situations no that's unintelligent likewise I'm going to
be a liberal in all situations be open to everything
no that's not that's not smart either your survival situation
dictates how much space and room you have for freedom
frivolity and exploration also it's a matter of your risk
tolerance you know brains and Minds and personality types have
different risk tolerances some people can tolerate a lot more
risk than others most people are not very good at
tolerating risk here are some more aspects of the conservative
worldview the conservative mind respects strength discipline and order it
does not respect softness weakness frivolity and for the conservative
mind respect is very important as a value for the
conservative mind when life gets tough you must get tougher
the solution is not to whine and cry and go
seeking sympathy from others or sharing your feelings the solution
is to suck it up get smarter get tougher and
deal with it the conservative mind finds a lot of
security and family values traditional gender roles the conservative mind
is more neurotic more anal more insecure it's more sexually
repressed sexual Cravings must be strictly controlled deviant sexuality is
viewed as sinful and very bad and immoral the conservative
mind employs sexual shaming and guilt to control his sexual
cravings because sexual Cravings if you just let them free
can lead to a lot of harm and damage to
others and to yourself therefore they need to be controlled
and repressed which was why all fundamentalist religion controls and
represses sexuality and basically that's been happening throughout all of
human civilization sexuality has been repressed and controlled the conservative
mind is more prone to guilt shame anger and disgust
it's preoccupied with sin and displeasing God not sinning the
conservative mind is more squeamish looking at vomit feces and
blood this is a scientific um study that they did
the conservative mind fears not only the dangerous outer world
but also the dangerous inner world hence the avoidance of
deep introspection again this is going to seem like I'm
demonizing or straw Manning the conservative world you I'm actually
not again this is one of those instances where they've
done scientific studies and they have found that the conservative
mind is less capable of deep introspection than the liberal
mind this is not something I'm just making up they've
done studies on this the conservative mind actually has fear
of radical new thoughts if you think of the external
environment and also the internal environment the mindscape in the
external environment there are dangers there are crocodiles lions and
volcanoes and all sorts of dangerous stuff out there that
could hurt you if you're not careful so venturing out
into the unknown is dangerous we've established that but there's
now a parallelism between that and the inner mindscape in
the mindscape think of it like a jungle of Consciousness
the Consciousness jungle you can think all sorts of impure
thoughts immoral thoughts crazy thoughts weird alien thoughts and some
of these thoughts can be very dangerous if you think
the wrong thoughts you might become a murderer you might
become a rapist you might become a pedophile you might
um you know become insane and lose your mind or
you might become depressed or whatever or you might have
to face your own internal contradictions which is scary and
difficult you might realize that you've been lying to yourself
you might realize that the religion you subscribed to was
actually just propaganda or brainwashing you might realize that the
political ideology you subscribed to is wrong and this is
all going to cause cognitive dissonance and um um that's
something to genuinely fear and conservatives fear that so you
as a progressive need to understand that the conservative the
conservative really struggles to open his mind to radical new
ideas not just things but ideas ideas themselves can be
threatening and dangerous and before you pooh-pooh that and dismiss
that and laugh at that what I want you to
understand even if you're the most Progressive person in the
world I want you to understand that if you explore
Consciousness as deeply as I have you're going to realize
that there are things that conscience is capable of conceiving
and imagining and thinking that are so radical and so
threatening that they will make you curl up into a
fetal position in in the bathroom um you know crying
for Mommy that's what a bad trip is if you
ever had a bad trip you understand the dangers of
the Jungle of Consciousness that is that is out there
if you ever had a nightmare you understand um how
scary your own mind can be exploring your own mind
can be scarier than exploring the outer world this is
what people don't appreciate and I guarantee you no matter
how liberal you are there are things in your mind
that you do not want to explore I've explored recesses
of my own Consciousness that include um hell Realms insanity
um alien dimensions of consciousness um evil that you can
barely imagine very very challenging to explore and to integrate
and to confront and open your mind to these possibilities
so don't just think that conservative struggle with this problem
this problem is something that you struggle with even if
you're very liberal I guarantee you you're underestimating the depth
of this problem conservatives have a lower cognitive complexity they
have more ordered rigid thinking patterns and less intuitive in
their insight conservatives are generally just less intuitive people on
the Myers-Briggs personality type they have the sensing versus intuiting
function you're either a sensor or you're an intuitor I'm
an intuitor um conservatives tend to be more sensors than
intuitives as a result of this and the things I
said above conservatives have a difficulty with multi-perspectivalism the conservative
mind really struggles to see in multiple perspectives because this
introduces ambiguities uncertainties gray areas and paradoxes and it creates
a sort of a relativism that their mind doesn't know
how to cope with conservatives are therefore less understanding of
other points of view now that doesn't mean Liberals are
perfect at it liberals also struggle understanding radical new points
of view but conservatives are generally worse at it because
conservatives fear uncertainty uh ambiguity and they have a need
for closure more of a need for closure this uh
can create some strong disadvantages the conservative mind has a
disregard for the subjective the imaginative or the abstract it's
more concerned with the tangible unambiguous the real versus the
ideal the conservative mind has a deep fear of insanity
losing control of one's mind and sense of reality and
therefore is extra defensive against this things like weed psychedelics
and even alcohol is seen as dangerous to the conservative
mind even things like music partying or colorful clothing can
be seen as dangerous now here you might say what
Leo I mean I understand wheat and alcohol I mean
wheat and psychedelics but alcohol music partying colorful dress how
what does that have to do with it look at
for example the sh um the Shakers and the Quakers
these people are so conservative they don't use cell phones
these people are so conservative they don't allow playing music
or only certain kinds of music they don't allow partying
they don't allow colorful dress they're so conservative look at
underdeveloped Middle Eastern countries they don't allow alcohol Islam doesn't
allow alcohol why not because alcohol is intoxicating and it
leads to such a freedom and a loosening of self-discipline
that then who knows what you're going to do who
knows who you're going to rape who knows who you're
going to kill if you allow that kind of intoxication
you see now here in the west we say well
big deal you know in the west we drink alcohol
all the time and nobody rapes anybody or kills anybody
well is that actually true think of how many people
get raped because of over consumption of alcohol think of
how many people get killed from drunk driving but in
a less developed culture that would be even more of
a problem which is why women are not allowed to
walk around in bikinis in the Middle East see liberals
tend to think oh that that's just because it's so
backwards over there there's such there you know they're so
medieval and if they just allowed women to do whatever
they want everything would be fine they're just oppressing women
it's just like the patriarchy is just oppressing women because
they get a thrill out of it and men just
like to oppress women in the Middle East no that's
not what's happening what's happening is that the men are
protecting the women from other men and the women there
are thankful for that protection not all though but many
of them those Norms are there to protect women they
are not there just so that men can exploit women
although there's some degree of that as well the conservative
mind tries to control the world through ideology it prefers
traditional simple realistic art and less abstract art and music
it's very interesting how the difference between the conservative and
liberal mind between the closeness and the openness between the
concreteness and the idealism of the liberal mind also reflects
in your taste for for music and art which is
why conservatives bemoan and criticize abstract art their mind literally
is uncomfortable with it they want art that has a
specific concrete picture or story or meaning to it like
they want a painting of Jesus or something they don't
want a painting of just some random splotches and squares
that could mean anything to anybody and interpret it however
you want they want to clear one interpretation that's how
deep this goes the conservative mind is more grateful to
the status quo the status quo is seen as pretty
good yeah there's problems there's problems with everything you can
nitpick everything but fundamentally the status quo is pretty good
therefore the conservative mind justifies existing systems it tends to
defend existing social hierarchy and class structures caste systems monarchy
capitalism oligarchy Elites nobility aristocracy and classes if they exist
conservatives have traditionally defended all these the conservative mind is
less bothered by inequalities in society and simply happier with
the status quo it has a tendency to believe that
some groups of people are innately better than others and
those are the ones who rise to the top of
this caste system or hierarchy humans are seen as innately
hierarchical humans are not naturally equal there's deep inequality amongst
humans this is perhaps one of the biggest factors that
distinguish the conservative and the liberal mind the liberal mind
tends to believe that all humans are equal and the
conservative mind says what are you talking about humans are
so grossly unequal in their capacity to generate value business
work to do combat to um care for children and
many other things and there are many mediocre people in
society that that it would be dangerous to put into
positions of Power by equalizing them some people deserve to
be on the bottom of society some people don't deserve
to be in charge of things and to be leaders
because some people are really effective leaders and other people
are not the majority of people are not effective military
leaders for example or effective CEOs therefore they should just
work at McDonald's or Starbucks where they belong and uh
you know to put everyone on the same playing field
would be a mistake and would lead to a worsening
of society it would actually endanger Society the conservative mind
glorifies the nobility of man rather than seeing just man
as a cancer on Mother Earth as an exploiter there's
a certain nobility to human civilization in society and therefore
the conservative mind reveres and respects that the conservative mind
also tends to believe that man because of this nobility
has the right to pillage nature and animals the conservative
mind is more sensitive to evils threats and dangers from
the outside of one's tribe other tribes diseases foreign forces
and influences that's why there's a xenophobia there a fundamental
xenophobia fear of the unknown a fear of foreignness you
see the conservative mind tends to favor one's in group
versus out-group it's more tribalistic since resources are scarce they
should be reserved for one's tribe or in-group if you
believe we have unlimited resources then you don't need to
be stingy with how you allocate them and that's what
the liberal tends to believe it's like we have enough
for everybody we have enough food for everybody why do
we got to be stingy about it the conservative says
the reality is that we don't have enough food for
everybody and therefore not just food of course but other
resources as well housing and beachfront property and so forth
therefore the resources need to be controlled and allocated to
those who deserve them the most who worked the hardest
who are the most moral people the people who do
the most uh to conform to the tribe to help
the tribe survive those are the people who we reserve
the resources for and we reserve it for our group
not the out group for our tribe that's who the
resources are for the conservative mind is in general less
tolerant and appreciative of diversity diversity is seen as dangerous
because the mind struggles to deal with diversity and diversity
of people races Norms culture languages sexual behaviors um A
diversity of religions and spiritual techniques A diversity of ideas
and philosophies this is all overwhelming for the mind to
deal with and it can even be confusing to the
point where people get lost the liberal tends to poo
poo this fear and this concern as though it's not
legitimate understand that there is some legitimacy to this fear
and concern diversity can be dangerous if you have a
lot of diverse people coming together into one room there's
going to be more chaos there's going to be more
Divergence of perspectives and you're not going to be able
to build a cohesive unit or a community out of
those very diverse groups or if you will it's going
to require a lot more work this is why the
conservative mind is generally anti-multicultural it has a fear and
discomfort with foreigners and immigrants immigrants tend to be seen
as dirty disgusting unworthy sub-human or other or a corrupting
influence on the in-group it goes much deeper than just
xenophobia or racism or tribalism you have to understand why
tribalism is so prevalent in the human mind it's because
it's necessary for survival it has been for thousands and
thousands of years and it still continues to be today
as ugly as it is sometimes the conservative mind tends
to have a hostility towards minorities who deviate from Traditional
Values that sure explains a lot to liberals isn't it
it also has a tendency to seek to control others
behaviors through the use of punishment laws authority figures and
strictness the conservative mind values clear rewards and punishments for
Behavior one of the things that infuriates the conservative mind
which the liberals do is that the Liberals want to
give amnesty to people who break the laws for example
liberals want to give amnesty to and have mercy on
uh immigrant illegal immigrants or you know people who get
put into jail for a weed possession or minor violations
you know minor crimes that are committed liberals tend to
want to have mercy and empathy for all these people
whereas for the conservatives they can't allow that because if
they allow that that's too permissive then the whole structure
of laws gets undermined and then anybody can do whatever
they want in a certain sense Pandora's Box is opened
and then this destroys Society so for conservative is it's
very important for conservatives that if somebody breaks a law
that they are punished for it appropriately they're not given
special treatment now of course in modern times with what's
happening with Donald Trump this has all been thrown out
the window which is why Maga and modern Trump supporters
are not like really true conservatives it's just a a
bastardization of conservatism but like uh true conservative is going
to be a stickler on the punishment for crimes a
true conservative would want Donald Trump punished for all the
crimes he's committed and all the rules he's broken next
point is that the conservative mind has a strong attachment
The Nostalgia and love for home tribe country culture and
tradition it's hard to really communicate um how attached one
can get to these things and how nostalgic one can
be for these things and how much love one can
have for these things liberals tend to not understand this
aspect of the conservative mind another point is that the
conservative mind has a mythological sentimental craving for the glory
of the good old days that's a lot of what
the appeal of fascism is fascism appeals to hearkening back
to the good old days when our society was morally
pure and strong and not as decadent and corrupted as
it is today so there is a desire for the
restoration of that moral fabric which has been undermined thinking
that that will lead to the highest good which was
where you see movements for the restoration of National Historical
greatness the restoration of Russian historical greatness Indian historical greatness
Chinese historical greatness Japanese German Iranian historical greatness all these
countries were once great Empires and the conservatives in all
these countries lament the fact that we've lost our way
in recent times we've lost our power we've lost our
Prestige and they attribute that to the breakdown of the
moral fabric of those societies of being undermined from the
outside by foreigners and so that's what they're reacting against
and their ultimate vision is a revitalization of Mother Russia
or mother Germany or the Chinese Empire or the you
know the glory of ancient India or Japan or the
Persian Empire you know consider where Iran is today and
where the Persian Empire was in the past think about
how how bad it must feel for Iranian conservatives to
like to know that we had this great Persian Empire
that was at one point one of the most developed
and cultured and civilized uh parts of the world and
now it's fallen into this disarray that we see today
and now we're being out-competed by the Americans you know
the Godless Americans and the Chinese and the Godless Chinese
and and so forth this really uh stings the ego
of the of the radiance they still think of themselves
as Persians any of them do of course there's the
appeal of fiscal conservativism which is the idea that the
government does not have a right to run up large
debt to then burden future Generations so that's the list
of various attitudes and characteristics of the conservative world view
here is a list of the top conservative values family
tradition ancestors bloodline Duty order following clear rules of right
and wrong obeying Authority serving one's tribe and Nation loyalty
honor fighting evil serving God defending tradition serving traditional roles
country race and ethnicity religion strong work ethic discipline personal
responsibility marriage Chastity Purity sexual propriety decorum security safety patriarchy
toughness stoicism strength status quo rugged individualism pulling yourself up
by your bootstraps being grounded and realistic tribal Pride domination
over nature Conquest over evil doers here's a characterization of
the conservative personality it's persistent tenacious stable consistent hard-working reliable
trustworthy faithful loyal careful practical methodical dutiful conventional ordinary straight
laced Square obedient conformist concerned with Norms trying to be
a good boy or girl trying to fit in Less
open to experience closed-minded rigid intolerant threatened insecure and worried
I want to say a little bit more to help
you appreciate the conservative world to you some more the
conservative worldview has a legitimate function imagine if you grew
up in a war-torn country imagine you were recently born
in Ukraine and you're seven years old growing up in
Ukraine with this war that's going on now your whole
country has been devastated and destroyed that's going to shape
your whole worldview you will grow up much less optimistic
about human beings when someone teaches you about love or
about God or about empathy or about helping others you're
not going to care about these things because for you
to survive in this war-torn environment you have to care
about yourself and your small circle of friends and family
your tribe and your nation this is what's necessary for
you to not get exterminated but if you grew up
in a good family in a safe part of the
world then you can afford to be much more optimistic
about human nature you're going to tend to believe that
people are nice fundamentally that the we can resolve our
our differences without violence that we can just use diplomacy
and empathy we can talk things out we can use
democracy and this will solve all of our problems but
you see that is only true within the privileged environment
survival environment that you grew up in you could not
hold those beliefs as you grew up in a war-torn
country that was getting Savage and devastated the way that
Ukraine is right now and when you grow up in
a place like Ukraine where the resources are scarce you
know there's only so much food to go around you're
gonna have to act tougher to get your survival needs
met you're going to maybe have to steal some food
Ben some rules bribe somebody in order to get a
Visa out of the country in order to secure a
firearm to protect your family in order to get enough
food for your family and so on in this way
the conservative world you is a reaction to survival conditions
and is way hyper more hyper-realistic and pessimistic it's worried
about protecting against danger and threat it takes danger and
threat seriously in a way that many liberals don't life
in a certain sense the conservative's life is closer has
a closer appreciation of the possibility of death this is
why ironically conservatives start more Wars the reason conservatives start
more Wars is because they're paranoid and preemptive if you're
fearful you're going to attack your neighbor before your neighbor
gets a chance to attack you this might seem kind
of Twisted and perverted but this is exactly how it
works when your life is in danger being empathetic and
caring is a luxury you cannot afford if most of
your neighbors are psychopaths and rapists then it doesn't make
sense for you to just sit by and wait for
them to come threaten you you're going to preemptively go
out there and threaten them this is why conservatives love
to act tough their ideal is to survive through toughness
they have little respect for empathy or empathy for the
weak don't go crying to somebody to solve your problems
solve them yourself that's the conservative ethos act tough so
people don't [ __ ] with you so people don't
bully you if you act weak that's just going to
invite bullying this is why conservatives glorify violence guns battles
Sports manliness masculinity strength military the police and various authority
figures here's an example about how arms races works for
example if you have an arms race there's two solutions
to solving an arms race there is the toughness approach
and there's the apathy approach the diplomacy approach the diplomacy
approach says that you know we can come together and
realize that you know I'm building up my Nuclear Arsenal
you're building up yours we're wasting a bunch of resources
doing this and in the end these nuclear weapons they're
just going to destroy the world we can't even use
them so it's just a massive waste of energy therefore
let's disarm and have peace and invest those resources into
education Healthcare and society and it's going to be a
win-win that's the liberal Solution that's the Diplomatic the sort
of empathetic solution can't we just have enough empathy to
realize that we don't want to kill each other okay
the conservative solution is to just win the arms race
by out fighting the other we're not going to defeat
Soviet communism by sitting down and sharing our feelings and
empathy we have fundamentally Different World Views communism and capitalism
is incompatible and the solution is not to compromise the
solution is to defeat the Soviets and you do that
by building better bombs more bombs to the point where
you are so far ahead of them that they just
get demoralized and they quit the game themselves which is
the right solution well it very much depends there is
no one right solution it's very context dependent every situation
is going to be different the conservative sees empathy and
diplomacy as too weak the liberal sees toughness in the
sort of Macho out fight the other side attitude as
too dumb and cruel it's like you know it's like
we're living like cavemen so to the conservative is stupid
I mean to the to the liberal what the conservative
the conservative attitude seems stupid because it's so crude but
on the other hand if you're living amongst cavemen you
need to do as the Romans you know as they
say when in Rome do as the Romans uh if
you're living amongst cavemen cavemen only understand Force and brutality
they don't understand diplomacy they don't understand empathy they don't
understand love they don't understand peace so the mistake that
the liberal can make is that if you put one
liberal into a tribe of 50 cavemen that liberal is
going to approach those cavemen she's going to approach them
as though they're all liberals too when they aren't she's
going to try to reason with them and have pity
on them and take the soft feminine approach and they
won't understand that they're just going to rape her because
that's what cavemen do so in that situation you need
another caveman who's going to defend her caveman who understands
how cavemen operate who has a realistic appraisal of the
situation another example of conservativism is actually within science most
scientists are very conservative people by their temperament I don't
mean that they're conservative in the sense that they're uh
you know pro-gun rights and anti-abortion or something like that
no I mean most scientists are conservative in the sense
that they are conservative with respect to the way that
they do science the institution of science they want to
preserve it they're very protective of it and they're terrified
of ruining their reputations and authority and the way that
most scientists do science is in a very conscientious manner
they dot all their T's and since they dot all
their eyes and cross all their T's um and they
get locked by by that they get locked into a
into a system into a bureaucracy into an institution and
into a paradigm and this actually prevents science from making
new groundbreaking discoveries so there are pros and cons to
this one of the pros of conservative science is that
if you do science in a very sort of technocratic
uh way and sort of well not technocratic what I
mean is in a sort of very technical rigorous way
with attention to to detail you can do that but
you lose sight of the big picture that's the problem
with materialism for example um on the other hand if
you do science or investigation of reality in a very
loose manner where you're not very rigorous then you make
more mistakes and then people will trust you less you're
going to be less of an authority because you know
the more mistakes you make the less trust people place
in you so one of the differences you might have
noticed between me versus a a traditional scientist is that
I have a much more sloppy approach to my way
of understanding reality I talk about things in a much
more loose manner a much more liberal with my Explorations
and reality which allows me to access Things That No
scientists will ever understand or access but what's the downside
the downside is that I make more mistakes I'm not
as rigorous so if you're going to compare actualize the
body of work of actualize.org to the rigors of of
science um obviously science is going to be much more
rigorous and accurate but that's because it's also much less
ambitious it doesn't explain very much um and it tackles
subjects which are much easier to explain less abstract less
paradoxical less interesting less mystical all right so these are
the trade-offs between having a sort of a liberal epistemology
in metaphysics versus a conservative epistemology in metaphysics there's trade-offs
there here's a list of the top conservative fears this
is really what triggers and controls the conservative mind right
so it's all about what you're fearing and then liberals
have their own set of fears that controls them so
the conservatives are controlled by the fear of disorder chaos
change emotions and feelings sin being bad not fitting in
with the tribe loss of power loss of control foreigners
alien cultures the feminine homosexuality loss of objective reality relativity
Paradox ambiguity abstraction uncertainty confusion not knowing insanity and Hell
here's a list of conservative blind spots the conservative mind
overemphasizes the dangers of change and underemphasizes the dangers of
the status quo sometimes change is more dangerous than the
status quo but other times status quo is more dangerous
than change and that is very situational there's no algorithm
for knowing which is which when also another blind spot
is that the conservative mind fails to empathize with those
oppressed by the current system its circle of empathy is
too narrow and usually the conservative mind only understands this
when it itself becomes oppressed or victimized um for example
the conservative a typical conservative might have little empathy for
people who are drug addicts condemning these people as being
Sinners and immoral and so forth and wanting maximum Criminal
penalties however win this conservative mind itself gets addicted to
opioids because of some back surgery that went wrong or
whatever it's addicted to opioid pills um now all of
a sudden the conservative mind starts to empathize with drug
addicts because it itself has experienced drug addiction or for
example a typical conservative might not empathize with the poor
until that conservative becomes poor and then it starts to
empathize with the poor so this is one advantage that
liberals tend to have over conservatives is empathy another blind
spot for conservatives is uh that fear can become a
self-fulfilling prophecy if you're run by fear and insecurity we've
talked about this in the past is that fear tends
to recreate itself even if the thing you fear isn't
very likely by fearing it you can make it more
likely what's an example of this for example with cheating
if you're an insecure man in a relationship with a
loving woman but you have some bad experiences in the
past you're paranoid and you think that every woman is
going to cheat on you so all the time you're
with her she's not thinking about cheating on you but
you're always thinking that she might cheat on you so
you're paranoid all the time to the point where now
you're controlling you know she wants to go out with
her friends so you don't let her she has a
a guy friend you tell her to stop texting him
she has an ex-boyfriend she talks to you tell her
to cut it off and so forth well you become
so controlling that eventually she loses attraction for you and
she leaves you for another man and then you say
well I knew it I knew she was going to
cheat on me all women are cheating [ __ ]
no it's because you created it you see your fear
and paranoia brought it about that's how fear tends to
work or for example here's some more a political example
is like let's say America fears terrorism therefore what we
do is we decide to preemptively invade Iraq because we
believe that there are harboring terrorists and that future terrorist
attacks will come from Iraq well by doing that though
uh we actually end up creating more terrorists than there
were in Iraq in the first place destabilizing the whole
region destabilizing neighboring countries like Syria and perhaps Iran and
um whatever else is around there and um this leads
to more terrorism this is a great example of fear
as a self-fulfilling prophecy so you have to be very
careful about that that's what happens when you're paranoid you
know you might be so paranoid you think the police
are going to come get you in reality no police
are after you but if you're so paranoid you start
acting so suspicious around the police they might actually come
and arrest you just because you're being so weird uh
this tends to be a problem for conspiracy theories as
well as conspiracy theorists tend to sort of create self-fulfilling
prophecy effects another blind spot of the conservative mind is
excessive conformity to man-made constructions the conservative mind has to
not understand that human Norms are pretty much all arbitrary
human cultures are very arbitrary and just blindly conforming to
them and treating them as though their objective reality this
leads to all sorts of problems and speaking of Conformity
the other blind spot that conservatives really suffer from is
since they like obedience to Authority they tend to follow
authoritarians off a cliff they find some authoritarian leader fall
in love with him and then he ends up being
a [ __ ] madman or a criminal or a
narcissist like Trump and then you follow him off a
cliff and he leads you off a cliff and you
just because you're just blindly following Authority and you believe
you have to follow all the rules to be a
good boy or girl you end up following a Hitler
or Mussolini or a trump off a cliff another blind
spot for conservatives is what I call the Lesser Jihad
fighting evil with evil the idea that evil can be
defeated through violence or through physical confrontation stuff like you
know torturing terrorists in Guantanamo or whatever that the Bush
Administration did this kind of stuff thinking that you're going
to solve the problem of terrorism by torturing people it
doesn't work this way you cannot defeat evil with evil
the solution to evil is not more evil the solution
to evil is love conservatives don't understand this and speaking
of which conservatives have a blind spot when it comes
to a fundamental misunderstanding of evil God love religion and
freedom conservatives really don't understand these things almost their understanding
is almost the opposite of the truth when it comes
to these things so it's very difficult to teach the
conservative mind because it's so closed it's difficult to teach
the conservative mind about the proper understanding of evil God
religion love and freedom now here's a list of what
the conservative mind struggles with it struggles with relativity blurred
metaphysical and moral lines this is a huge one it
struggles with construct awareness and subjectivity also a huge one
it struggles with emotionality being touchy-feely being vulnerable femininity being
playful and spontaneous the conservative mind has to be too
robotic lacking in requisite variety to algorithmic in its approach
to surviving and this counter-intuitively ends up undermining its survival
so the conservative mind is acting very rigid and strict
because it needs to justify because that's how it has
been able to survive to this point but then future
more advanced Avenues of survival are closed off to it
because it's so attached to this particular way of surviving
right here but in the future as environment and Society
changes survival changes therefore survival to truly be good at
survival to be really intelligent survival you need infinite requisite
variety a topic that I talked about in the past
on my blog see my episode called requisite variety for
that um but uh yeah the bottom line is that
you can get so attached to one way of surviving
that it actually ends up undermining your survival and ends
up killing you you got to be smart enough to
see that and to preempt that from happening the conservative
mind struggles with letting go surrender and self-control by softer
means than just strict self-discipline it also struggles with empathy
and opening of the heart this is seen as dangerous
and threatening and it struggles with opening of the mind
to radical new ideas perspectives habits and cultures I want
to quickly take you through now an application of the
conservative worldview I'm going to go through about eight different
topics here and I'm gonna put on my conservative hat
and I'm going to speak to you about this topic
as though I'm a arch conservative now keep in mind
these are not my necessarily genuine positions on these points
I'm just going to be speaking as a conservative so
you can get a feel for what it's really like
to embody the conservative world you and speak from it
and you should be able to do this as well
right so I'm modeling this for you if you can't
do this then you haven't really understood the conservative worldview
all right so for example how does the conservative view
feminism feminism is dangerous because it undermines the structure upon
which all of human civilization has been built on for
hundreds of thousands of years which is strong men leading
and organizing Society that's how mankind has always lived mankind
without strong Noble moral leaders uh always falls into disarray
and Evil and women suffer from this as much as
men do humans by their nature are um pretty brutal
and they will do brutal things to each other and
the reality is that when [ __ ] hits the
fan you need a strong man to protect you against
other strong men women are not capable of doing this
and so by giving women too much power by equalizing
men and women we fall prey into this utopian idea
that men and women are all equal when in fact
we're not equal when it comes to defending you from
a rapist you need a strong man that's the reality
of the situation when it comes to Leading the military
you need a military full of strong men not women
women can serve some supporting roles as caretakers nurses administrators
and so forth but they're not going to be in
the trenches Manning a machine gun and if they are
our civilization will collapse and we'll get taken over by
Nazis we need to be realistic about this this is
not because we want to dominate women or because we
hate women or because we want to oppress women this
is simply our biology this is how man as a
ape species has evolved some ape species have women in
charge and are more matriarchal and some ape species are
more patriarchal and humans just happen to be one of
the ape species that is more patriarchal this is not
good or bad it just is what it is we
need to be realistic about that because if we're not
then bad things will happen and the reality is that
most women like being feminine most women don't like being
put into positions of authority and Leadership where they are
forced to act like masculine men some women want that
but the majority of women don't so feminism can take
things too far by over equalizing uh and kidding ourselves
about the structure of uh of healthy human societies okay
there we go next topic transgenderism the conservative you transgenderism
is dangerous because identifying as a man or a woman
this is very fundamental to who you are to your
psyche to your mind and also to the morality and
structure of society it's also fundamental to the family unit
and our ability to have children upon which all of
human civilization hinges we need to have a replacement rate
of humans of something like two point one children per
woman in order just to maintain civilization otherwise civilization will
collapse and right now in many Advanced Western democracies women
are having children way below replacement rates this could become
a serious problem in the years to come despite concerns
about overpopulation what transgenderism does is it tends to blur
boundaries between these very traditional classic categories of man and
woman masculine and feminine and it creates a lot of
confusion for people especially for young people and young people
are pretty foolish and they just get on whatever latest
trend is happening in society and there's a significant number
of transgender people that are just being confused just by
the fact they're growing up in a LAX culture that
permits them this source of confusion and ambiguity in traditional
cultures where gender Norms were more strictly enforced you didn't
have all these options and a lot of times these
options are not giving you uh the happiness that you
desire what you desire from life is happiness and stability
and certainty and Direction not infinite freedom sometimes the more
choices you're given the less happy you end up being
sometimes when all you have is two ice cream flavors
your life is better you're happier than when you go
and you have 30 different ice cream flavors you don't
know which one to choose and you're just standing there
you're kind of like lost rudderless without a direction without
an identity what you want what these transgender kids want
is they want a strong firm identity but that becomes
impossible when you can just invent your own genders and
you can change genders from one day to the next
day and you can have all sorts of different kinds
of sex and inventing things left and right there's a
danger to this kind of relativism next topic atheism and
secularism the conservative View the problem with atheism is that
it leads to secularism and the problem with secularism is
that it leads to a sort of materialism where we're
no longer living for something higher Beyond man there's nothing
Beyond man there's no order in the universe beyond man
becomes the measure of all things man gets to invent
whatever man wants and then it's just what earning money
having sex going to parties inventing new crazy technology and
that's all that our life becomes there's nothing higher to
live for there's no moral code because secularism tells you
that hey every culture has their own relative moral codes
and basically do as you wish and it's all the
same but it's not all the same some cultures and
moral codes are better than others are more Superior are
more aligned with Consciousness and with love and the net
effect of secularism has been that people just get lost
in Endless materialism and nihilism they have nothing Noble nothing
higher nothing Transcendent to Aspire towards it's just business Money
video games sex and this is leading to the degradation
of our society our society is becoming dumb and weak
as a result of this next item is socialism Marxism
the conservative View socialism and Marxism is great in theory
but only in theory because it has a utopian view
of human nature the idea that we can all roughly
earn the same amount of money and all be in
roughly the same positions of power is it's nice I
wish mankind worked that way but it simply doesn't the
reality is that mankind is very hierarchical the reality is
that some humans generate much more value than others and
they deserve much more reward than others the reality is
that co-ops don't work very well the reason most businesses
are not co-ops and most governments are not co-ops is
because you need leaders at the top setting the vision
and setting the tone and the direction for the entire
institutional organization if co-ops worked there'd be a lot of
co-ops there aren't that's because they're out competed by hierarchical
corporations this is not some scheme to keep humans oppressed
the way that Marxist claimed this is not exploitation this
is simply the natural order of of human communities and
societies for for thousands of years they're very hierarchical and
so marxist's idea of leveling all these hierarchies and making
everyone equal it simply doesn't work look at what happened
in Soviet Russia under communism the reality is that when
you implement socialism and Marxism it get it gets implemented
in very selfish ways it never gets implemented in the
utopian ways that the liberal or the progressive thinks it
should or would in reality to enforce this very unnatural
um scheme utopian scheme upon all of mankind requires totalitarian
and authoritarian means as we see or have seen in
communist Russia and communist China and even then with all
this brutal totalitarianism it still doesn't work look at North
Korea it still doesn't work in North Korea they still
have to have black free markets despite trying to pretend
like they're communists so maybe in a thousand years or
in five thousand years mankind will evolve to some sort
of point where we can have a socialist Marxist system
but today it's completely foolish and idealistic and utopian and
it's not going to work it's completely impractical and by
trying to implement it you're actually going to make things
worse and more unfair which is exactly what happened in
the 20th century in China Russia Cuba Korea other places
the next item is immigration the conservative view of immigration
it would be nice if anybody could just immigrate anywhere
they wanted to in the world if all countries were
equal but the reality is that all countries are not
equal some countries are much more developed than other countries
and if we allow anybody to just immigrate anywhere they
want to then everyone would flood to the best countries
and the infrastructure and social safety nets that we have
in place would not be able to handle it moreover
not just that but a community and a country is
it's not just a collection of people it's a culture
it's a collection of people it's a tribe organized under
a cultural identity a Common Language a common religion sometimes
a common ethnicity and so forth that binds people together
that creates a shared value system under which we can
then operate when you let in a lot of immigrants
it creates so much diversity so many different World Views
languages cultures Cuisines races ethnicities government Styles you know you've
got capitalists and Marxist all living together trying to make
things work and then what happens is that we're not
able to create a competitive government that's able to compete
with other governments around the world who are cohesive and
have a singular vision for example we need to compete
against China we compete against Russia and so forth where
they are very homogeneous culturally and ethnically and as a
result of that they're able to find a common vision
and work together whereas in a very diverse country like
America for example we have so many people pulling in
so many different directions under democracy that nothing gets done
government is completely dysfunctional we're polarized everybody is fighting everybody
else all these different special interest groups and so forth
and not to mention which the resources that our community
develops need to be first and foremost allocated to the
people who are most loyal to our community not to
Outsiders otherwise this is just unfair and it creates resentment
and also many people in our societies and communities they're
simply uh uncomfortable with too much immigration and too much
foreign influence in our culture it degrades the culture which
we love the way that it is that we're trying
to defend and protect and all this immigration dilutes that
culture which is like a betrayal of our ancestors next
item punishment of criminals the conservative perspective criminals need to
receive harsh punishment because the only thing that is preventing
disorder and Chaos from running loose in society is our
police our military our legal system and our enforcement of
it if we start being lacks about our enforcement of
punishments on criminals then this is going to create a
general atmosphere of leniency and this attitude of do whatever
you want and things will be okay this will lead
to more crime and the last item environmentalism the conservative
perspective the environment is important but human suffering is more
important and the reality is is that most humans on
this planet live in such dire material conditions that they
don't have enough to survive and from this they suffer
greatly by making environmentalism such a top concern and priority
the way that liberals do this is going to put
economic pressure this is going to cost people jobs and
ultimately this is going to lead to more suffering than
having to endure and retrofit some of our um infrastructure
over the next hundred years you know as the temperature
rises one or two degrees in the end mankind is
technologically Innovative enough to deal with any kind of environmental
disasters and um our technology will be able to solve
this problem in the future but in the meantime our
priority needs to be on increasing the material and economic
conditions of the majority of mankind which means that we
don't want to over regulate on environmental issues where the
costs are low we can do that but when the
costs are too high we need to have as our
top priority the economy not the environment because ultimately what
you have to understand about the economy it's not just
the economy in some abstract sense a bad economy means
children are starving a bad economy means you can't afford
to go to the doctor therefore you die from a
disease a bad economy means that you can't give your
children Christmas presents because you can't afford it and so
on and then a bad economy means that governments can
collapse and Wars can start which could lead to the
deaths of millions of people so this issue is much
more complicated than simply whether you care about Mother Nature
or not the way that liberals sometimes presented as you
have to also take into account of who suffers the
most on this planet is it the trees or is
it the children of some hungry people in some third
world country so there you go you should be able
to do that this is a straw man of conservativism
on all these different positions now I'm not saying this
is 100 right and that there's not alternative perspectives just
um be able to see things from the conservative point
of view here's some personal examples of where I've been
conservative in my own life even though generally like socially
speaking I'm very liberal politically I'm very Progressive but actually
when I started out off my life I was quite
conservative specifically in my personal life not politically but in
my personal life for example I was very conservative when
it came to my education and my development when I
was young I was extremely disciplined I disciplined myself in
a strict way to study really hard in school and
to be very serious about that not just flake around
and screw around and go to parties and have sex
indiscriminately and do drugs and all this kind of stuff
no I was very straight laced and square because I
knew that the first 20 years of my life would
set up the rest of my life so I was
very disciplined about my education I got very disciplined about
Fitness I applied enormous discipline when it came to learning
attraction dealing with girls relationships pick up stuff I became
very disciplined in order to succeed in my first few
businesses and even with actualize.org I for went socialization going
to parties having fun so that I basically worked for
a couple of Decades of my life to set up
the rest of my life and uh what I saw
with all the other kids around me is that they
were in a sense very liberal about that they didn't
do any of that and today their life is mediocre
if not garbage um and I'm extremely glad that I
was so conservative when I was young I had a
very realistic assessment of human nature I had a very
realistic assessment of what my life would be like if
I flaked around and screwed around and just played games
and didn't take it seriously didn't develop myself and then
didn't discipline myself also I've been very conservative financially not
wasting money saving money not getting loans not using credit
cards not buying [ __ ] I don't need this
was very important for me without this I wouldn't have
been able to have the funds I needed to do
something like actualize.org and to stay financially independent and that
came from the fact that when I was growing up
the survival situation in my household when it came to
money is that money was very fleeting it's not that
we didn't have it it's just that it came and
it went it was lost very easily my dad lost
lots and lots and lots and lots of money he
lost so much money he traumatized me have nightmares about
how much money he lost and I could fall into
the same um situation if I'm not careful that made
me extremely conservative with my money and I'm glad about
that because most people just pissed their money away most
people if they had the money I had they would
have pissed it all away years ago especially at my
age another place where I was conservative is um was
with spirituality actually believe it or not when it comes
to pursuing enlightenment Awakening and Truth in God I was
extremely conservative what does that mean exactly what that means
is I was conservative in the sense that I knew
that if I didn't take this issue seriously I would
never achieve it so from the very first time when
I heard about Enlightenment I took it very seriously I
was very disciplined about it I was also uh very
honest with myself about what it would take you know
sometimes I say stuff like it's going to take you
a thousand hours to reach Awakening or to God realization
or something like that and then people say well Leah
why are you putting a number on it why are
you making it sound so difficult like aren't it's not
just a limiting belief why are you limiting your audience
this way and my response is that I'm airing on
the side of being conservative I would much rather you
think that Awakening and God realization is going to be
really really difficult than you thinking it's going to be
really easy or you thinking that you're already enlightened or
something like that so I'm being conservative on your behalf
when you when I tell you how hard some of
these things are it's because I know that the greatest
danger is that you're going to slack off you're not
going to take the things that I say seriously you're
going to underestimate the depth of these issues when I
tell you how advanced something is that's a conservative statement
because see most spiritual teachers they tell you like oh
don't worry just kind of take it easy you know
pursue Awakening on your own terms at your own pace
you can do it in a single weekend or just
you know follow some some simple Buddhist path or something
like that and I'm telling you no none of that
shit's gonna work if you really want to understand what
God is none of it's going to work like you
got to be I want you going to bed at
night sweating and having nightmares about how all of your
spiritual methods are just delusion and are gonna lead you
nowhere you're gonna waste 20 years with Buddhism and never
realize God that's what I want you to be afraid
of you might say well Leo that's dysfunctional well um
ideally you'd find a middle ground there somewhere but if
we're going to err on the side of somewhere I'm
going to err on the side of making you more
paranoid about that than to loose and Lacks see again
this is just my bias I'm not saying this is
necessarily true or right or the one way of doing
spirituality or the best attitude to have this is just
my attitude because I'm anticipating kind of like where the
audience is at what the traps are what the most
common obstacles are and then how to inoculate you against
those uh also I noticed myself being conservative sometimes when
I think about my family sometimes when I think about
where I grew up like sometimes I'll take a trip
to Orange County which is where I grew up and
it's amazing I I take a trip to Orange County
it's as though I travel back in time I get
this like wave of nostalgia it's almost like a psychedelic
trip of nostalgia hits me I think about all the
you know good times I had with my family there
I'm bad times too but you know in retrospect you
remember all the good stuff you delete all the bad
stuff um and you get this like deep Nostalgia for
your home for your family Christmas time with the family
you know sometimes I I miss that and uh you
can extrapolate from that you can say that's sort of
like the conservative attitude towards family towards culture towards um
defending one's Nation defending one's tribe is this deep love
and Nostalgia for your roots where you came from your
heritage your bloodline your home your mother country this kind
of thing I rarely experience that but occasionally I'll experience
it like once a year twice a year I'll experience
that if I travel back home and um it just
makes me think like oh this is how a conservative
usually feels what I feel once a year conservative is
feeling like every week that certainly explains a lot maybe
you can relate to that um and also where I've
been conservative is with my is with my work with
actualize.org and um with psychedelics actually I've been very conservative
in the sense that with psychedelics you know I treat
them so seriously most people they treat psychedelics as something
something frivolous I treat them so seriously you know like
I do 100 or 200 trips and still I treat
it as though I don't understand what it is I
still treat it as though I'm taking them for the
first time I'm still treating it as though there's something
new to learn that there's so much depth to consciousness
there's so much I still don't understand about reality whereas
many spiritual people you know they they take a little
bit of psychedelics here and there and then and then
they're like okay yeah you know Leo I've done that
I'm over it now I've transcended it I'm beyond it
no you're not beyond anything you haven't even begun you
haven't even begun um so in this sense I'm super
conservative you know I'm very conservative when it comes to
self-deception when it comes to epistemology to metaphysics it might
seem the opposite it might seem like I'm so loosey-goosey
I talk about alien intelligence and alien Consciousness and God
and love and crazy [ __ ] like this and
you might see Leo that that's so crazy and far
out there but you have to understand like how seriously
I take this I'm extra conservative not to underestimate Consciousness
the depth of Consciousness the complexity the trickeries of consciousness
whereas most spiritual people I see them doing the opposite
of that most Buddhists and stuff like that no I
see them not being conservative to me a Buddhist just
subscribes to some stupid Buddhist um you know series of
techniques thinking that that's going to be enough to understand
what Consciousness is are you [ __ ] kidding me
you have to be so foolish to believe that that's
not conservative to me that's not airing on the side
of caution that's what I mean by conservatives airing on
the side of caution when it comes to con understanding
consciousness the most likely thing is that you're not going
to understand it because you're completely underestimating it you're going
to undershoot not overshoot so I would aim to overshoot
when it comes to consciousness I want to take you
through a series of visualization a little very quick visualization
exercises to help you to see the emotional appeal of
conservativism okay here we go imagine having such a difficult
upbringing that you have no time for games or frivolity
you have to work hard and be strict with yourself
for years just to survive next imagine having deep pride
in your city country family company team or cultures achievements
like you really feel proud about the achievements of your
tribe and you want to respect and honor that not
to undermine it next imagine a revolution that happens in
your country that overthrows the government but it makes things
ten times worse than they were 10 times more violence
ten times more disorder and chaos ten times more inequality
should make you think twice about a revolution supporting one
next imagine your children grow up to be spoiled brats
who just drink play video games eat pizza do drugs
go to parties have sex and don't develop any serious
skills in life no work skills no discipline and they're
just constantly whining and entitled they're soft and they're weak
they can't take care of themselves and then you have
to take care of them for the rest of their
life you have to pay for them you have to
solve all their problems because they're too weak to do
it themselves because nobody taught them any discipline nobody taught
them to treat life seriously and now they're like domesticated
Lions who don't know how to hunt they need to
be fed food how do you feel about that situation
are you happy with that next imagine you have a
son who cries and wants to kill himself because he
lost in a video game and he can't approach approach
girls or get laid and now he's depressed and miserable
and all of this because he's just too afraid to
go to a nightclub and talk to a girl or
he's so undisciplined he can't even motivate himself to leave
his house leave the basement and go into a social
environment and deal with the difficulty of doing that and
facing his social anxiety he's just too emotionally weak to
do that and as a result he's never going to
have a family he's never going to have a good
sex life and he's going to subscribe now to some
kind of toxic in cell ideology which is going to
make him want to kill himself he's going to hate
himself when on the other hand if he disciplined himself
and he was more serious about life and someone taught
him how to do that then he could be very
successful with girls and he could have a great family
life have children and all that find himself a great
wife through this process instead he just plays video games
and [ __ ] and moans about um how unfair
life is on in-cell forums next imagine our culture degrades
to the point of Idiocracy this one might be pretty
easy to imagine I I already feel we're there but
just imagine how bad it could really get if we
have a complete degradation of our culture where we lose
sight of God and love and Consciousness and hard work
and discipline all those classic virtues and values honesty Integrity
truth Beauty goodness helping others we lose sight of all
that instead we just become whiny entitled constantly divided tribe
of people who can't get along and can't solve the
real challenges of life and we all just get addicted
to our phones video games and Netflix and porn next
imagine a world that is purely materialistic technocratic secular rationalist
homogeneous a global a globalist dystopia with no spirituality in
it where life is just about material acquisition and nothing
deeper next imagine a case where young people are jumping
on some foolish new trend like some new crypto Ponzi
scheme or eating Tide Pods rather than sticking to the
tried and true principles of our ancestors they're engaging in
this childish immature frivolous Behavior rather than pursuing virtue next
imagine the culture shock and discomfort that you feel when
you travel someplace foreign and then the relief and comfort
when you return back home so maybe you travel to
China or to India it's exciting it's interesting but then
when you come back home how good it feels to
come back home how comforting you feel how secure your
fear you feel how good that feels next Imagine The
Pride you feel in fighting for uh for your country
with your brothers and sisters to defend from Nazis next
imagine how good you feel when you follow a solid
morning routine every day for months until it becomes effortless
you don't even think about it you just get up
every morning you do your morning routine it sets you
up for the day you get so much accomplished at
the end of the day you go to bed feeling
proud of yourself about um everything you've achieved that day
next imagine that warm fuzzy feeling you get spending Christmas
time with your family everybody getting along sharing presence sharing
stories next imagine how good you feel when your whole
house is clean and perfectly ordered what if you could
make society that way next imagine how good you feel
saving up money to buy a house when your stupid
friends waste all their money on Diamond Jewelry champagne and
strippers that's it those are the exercises let's get to
a little bit of a taste of um the genuine
value and appeal of conservativism here are some questions I'd
like you to contemplate and ask yourself to help you
in this regard number one where in your life are
you conservative what you'll discover is that it's not really
a matter of are you liberal or conservative it's more
a matter of in which domains of your life are
you conservative I guarantee you there are some domains even
if you're very liberal and Progressive I guarantee there are
some domains where you're conservative maybe it's with your money
maybe it's with psychedelics maybe it's with spirituality or whatever
the way you raise your children Maybe next question where
are you hyper realistic and pragmatic as opposed to idealistic
and utopian that's a key question next question where are
you cautious to make changes in your life because the
risks are so great to getting it wrong sauce making
you conservative next where do you stick to tried and
true principles in your life rather than innovating or Reinventing
the wheel maybe it's what the way you cook your
lasagna or something next question where are you set in
your habits and old ways you just have a way
of doing something it works you like it and you
don't even want to think about changing it your mom
tells you to do something different your friends tell you
to do something different and you just stick with the
old habit next question where are you closed to radical
new ideas next question where are you pessimistic about human
nature and the last question where do you shake your
head in shame at the weakness and degeneracy of the
young you see the Young Generation of Zoomers doing something
stupid some stupid trend whether it's crypto or Pokemon or
Tide Pods or whatever it is whatever the kids are
doing these days you know getting tattoos nose rings some
god-awful thing listening to some god-awful music you look at
it you just shake your head in shame you cringe
at it and you say you know if this continues
Society is going to hell maybe it's with Instagram or
with pornography whatever it is within cells foreign so obviously
online you're going to find a lot of examples of
dumb conservatives this is really a shame because like I've
demonstrated to you here today hopefully there are intelligent formulations
of the conservative worldview Beware of the left-wing straw mans
there are so many left-wing straw mans out there that
you guys are being brainwashed with I strongly encourage you
I challenge you to find the most intelligent articulations of
conservative thought that are out there you can find some
some of this stuff I've shared some of this on
my blog and elsewhere Jordan Peterson represents some of that
Dennis Prager funnily enough you know some of his prageru
videos are just pure propaganda and garbage but if you
actually listen to Dennis Prager like his long-form interviews he
actually presents um I was I was amazed he actually
presents some pretty intelligent defenses of conservativism uh it's just
that the Prager U videos are so awful that it's
hard to recommend listening to him but I actually I
do recommend it it'll it'll grow you a few other
episodes you should watch if you like this series my
conscious politics series part one part two part three part
four go watch that it'll change your whole understanding of
politics also my episode called how Society evolves go check
that out also my spiral Dynamics series spironamic stage blue
well it starts with red stage well actually it starts
with purple purple red blue um orange green yellow and
so on also see my series The Nine stages of
ego development part one two three that'll be helpful and
check out my episode called understanding democracy versus authoritarianism all
of these episodes are combining the Consciousness stuff that I
teach in spirituality and some of the advanced philosophy combining
it with developmental psychology models and combining it with Society
social issues political issues issues of governance and so on
you know practical way so if you watch all that
you're going to have a completely recontextualized understanding of of
our political situation and then the last thing you should
do is make sure you stay tuned for part two
of this series next week where I'm going to talk
about understanding the liberal mind
