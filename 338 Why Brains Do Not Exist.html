            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/5N9xARPfJYY' target='_blank'>Why Brains Do Not Exist</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Human belief in the existence of the brain</b>: Leo Gura points out that individuals, especially those adhering to the materialist paradigm, strongly believe in the existence of the brain and how it holds control of all reality. This belief often acts as a significant barrier to delving deeper into the spheres of consciousness and understanding the metaphysical aspects of reality.
</li><li><b>The issue with unquestioned belief in the physical brain</b>: Leo emphasizes the problem with believing in the physical existence of the brain, which is often taken for granted. Upon opening a skull, one may observe a pink fleshy substance, yet this observation does not necessarily confirm the existence of a metaphysical brain.
</li><li><b>Brains, neurons, and atoms as first-person appearances</b>: The concept of a brain extends beyond its physical appearance. Brains, neurons, and atoms are actually first-person appearances and concepts that ultimately boil down to sensations. The problem of circularity arises when trying to determine where these appearances occur. 
</li><li><b>Where do first-person appearances occur?</b>: Leo challenges the notion that first-person appearances, including the vision of the brain itself, are happening inside the brain. According to him, the idea of the brain acting as a metaphysical substrate behind all appearances is an assumption that has never been proven by science.
</li><li><b>Incorporation of first-person experiences in science</b>: The only evidence of reality we have is first-person experiences. Science uses these experiences and segregates a part of it, calling it "third-person objective facts" based on consensus gathered from a group of individuals, which still falls within the realm of subjective experience.
</li><li><b>Understanding of an external world</b>: The materialist belief in an external world is based on explanations for our subjective experiences, but there is no evidence for such a world. Therefore, everything, including existence itself, is anecdotal evidence. 
</li><li><b>Metaphysical illusions of reality</b>: Leo argues that appearances exist within nothingness, not within space or time. He suggests every real substance, including the brain, is simply an assumption based on one's first-person experiences.
</li><li><b>Effect of brain on other appearances</b>: The brain is an important appearance that affects other appearances. However, this does not prove that all appearances are happening in the brain. Even the neurons in a brain are appearances not confined to the brain.
</li><li><b>Limitations of Science</b>: Science focused on empirical data analysis is incapable of explaining metaphysical existence. It operates based on certain metaphysical assumptions, often defaulting to materialism, which crumbles in areas like quantum mechanics and cosmology. 
</li><li><b>Alternative to Materialist Paradigm</b>: Leo suggests an open and honest investigation into the mystical nature of reality, instead of sticking to the materialistic approach which explains phenomena but fails to understand their essence.
</li><li><b>Materialists and the denial of mystical phenomena</b>: Leo criticizes materialists for denying the essence of reality and being, leading to a loss of understanding and suffering. By acknowledging immaterial levels of existence allows for a broader understanding and opens new possibilities.
</li><li><b>Being Open to Immortality and Paranormal phenomena</b>: Emphasizing an open investigation into subjects like past lives, out-of-body experiences, paranormal phenomena, and immortality, Leo encourages people to read, listen, and practice without blindly believing in whatever they encounter.
</li><li><b>Paradigms limitation and the shift needed</b>: Leo Gura encourages viewers to question materialism and deeply examine their own metaphysical beliefs. Realizing the self-defeating nature of the materialistic paradigm can potentially open oneself up to the mystical nature of existence leading to personal and intellectual growth.
</li><li><b>Materialistic view of objective reality misconstrued</b>: In this section, Leo Gura argues that what materialists perceive as objective reality exists within first-person subjective experiences. He asserts that the third-person objective perspective is a concept and arguably less real than first-person experiences, which are directly perceived and not inferred via a consensus, as science tends to treat objective facts.
</li><li><b>Everything is subjective and anecdotal</b>: According to Gura, everything, including the existence of oneself and physical universe, is anecdotalknown primarily through personal experiences. While materialists question the validity of mystical experiences because they are subjective and anecdotal, Gura points out they fail to see that everything one accepts about reality is also anecdotal and subjective only.
</li><li><b>Mechanism to justify reality</b>: To justify the reality of these first-person experiences and appearances, materialists tend to ascribe them to an external world. However, Gura opposes this reasoning, stating there is no empirical evidence for an external world. He reemphasizes that everything in existence, including skepticism and science, is contingent on one's first-person experiences. 
</li><li><b>Illusion of an external world</b>: For Gura, the notion of an objective external world, within which a brain operates and generates experiences, is an illusion. Everything within one's experience is a form of hallucination, redefining the term "hallucination" as a perception or appearance without substance. He explains that hallucinations can vary widely and can be governed by a set of rules, similar to physical reality.  
</li><li><b>Failure to acknowledge subjective reality</b>: Leo Gura criticizes the materialist paradigm, suggesting that many rational individuals, including scholars, fail to fully appreciate these metaphysical assumptions. They view metaphysics as philosophical nonsense, failing to realize that the belief in hard objective facts is itself a metaphysical claim. 
</li><li><b>The difficulty in accepting reality as a hallucination</b>: Despite Gura's arguments, he acknowledges that it's challenging for individuals to accept existence as a hallucination due to the entrenched materialistic paradigm. He introduces a phenomenon he calls 'paradigm blindness', implying that once inside a paradigm, it becomes extremely difficult to see outside it or recognize its flaws.
</li><li><b>Assumptions Limit Perception of Reality</b>: Leo Gura explains how a person's paradigm, which is a set of beliefs or assumptions about the nature of reality, can limit their understanding of the world and what they believe is possible. Using the existence of ghosts as an example, Gura discusses how materialists reject the possibility of ghosts because they believe everything is material. He emphasizes that such assumptions limit open discussions and investigations into the nature of reality. 
</li><li><b>Reality as a Hallucination</b>: Gura argues that reality, including the brain, is a hallucination and not grounded anywhere. He likens the belief in a physical reality and the brain to past scientific beliefs in entities like the luminiferous ether, phlogiston, caloric, and miasma. These entities were created to explain phenomena, but were later dismissed as unnecessary. Similarly, Gura suggests that the brain and a physical reality might be unnecessary explanations for our experiences.
</li><li><b>Materialism as a Form of Fundamentalism</b>: Leo compares the belief in the materialistic paradigm to religious fundamentalism. He argues that materialists, like religious fundamentalists, cling to their conceptions of reality, with the brain and the external physical reality acting as their "god." Despite the lack of proof for the existence of these entities, materialists firmly believe in them due to the consistent and orderly nature of their experiences.
</li><li><b>Breakdown of Consistency Challenges Materialism</b>: According to Gura, the main reason people are materialists is that their personal experiences are generally very consistent and orderly. However, this perceived consistency can be disrupted through certain experiences, such as using psychedelics or intense meditation. When the consistency of first-person experience breaks down, it shatters the illusion of the solidity of appearances and the validity of materialist assumptions. 
</li><li><b>Metaphysical Superstition</b>: Gura argues that, although materialists reject traditional superstitions, they still engage in their own form of superstition through their beliefs in an external reality and the brain. He suggests that most people unknowingly hold deep ideological positions and urges viewers to question those ideologies and expand their understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Materialistic Worldview and Its Limitations</b>: Leo Gura explains that most individuals hold materialistic views because they are born into, and socialize in, a predominantly materialistic society. From childhood, we are conditioned to believe in the material world. This conditioning makes it challenging to conceive of alternative worldviews. Materialists often object to the idea of everything being a hallucination without a grounding substrate. However, Gura argues that this objection lacks validity, pointing out that the idea of a substrate causing appearances is equally perplexing and leads to infinite regress. The perceived absurdity and weirdness of reality stem from limited cultural perspectives and conditioned systems of thought, not from intrinsic properties of reality itself. 
</li><li><b>Paradoxes in Understanding Reality</b>: Leo argues that attempting to address the ultimate nature of reality and its grounding will invariably result in paradoxes. When talking about fundamental metaphysical topics, the encounter with paradox should be seen as a characteristic feature rather than a problem. Our intuitions work within the constraints of our everyday lives and are not designed to address the complexities of the universe. What may seem weird or absurd are notions formed by cultural norms and biases of individual societies. He points out that conclusions derived from one's sense of weirdness and absurdity are simply measures of how well aligned one is with his or her local culture.
</li><li><b>Questioning the Materialistic Paradigm</b>: Gura suggests that to understand reality, we need to question our ingrained beliefs and the materialistic paradigm. He asserts that everything is a hallucination that arises from nothingness, not even time or space. The Big Bang or any potential theory scientists might propose do not conclusively explain the nature of appearances or the source of reality. He states that even if science were to discover something beyond the Big Bang, it would not explain the source or nature of all appearances happening now. All such theories would ultimately support the view that reality is essentially an infinite hallucination.
</li><li><b>The Brain and Its Relation to Appearances</b>: Gura discusses the impact of brain damage on the perception of reality. While agreeing that physically damaging the brain would undeniably alter the appearance of reality, he argues that this doesn't prove that appearances are happening inside the brain. Instead, it shows that the brain, being an appearance itself, can be affected. The interaction between different appearances, such as a hammer and the brain, results in altered experiences but doesnt necessarily imply a physical substrate for these interactions.
</li><li><b>Hallucinatory nature of reality</b>: Leo argues that reality consists solely of appearances that are interconnected and interact with each other, forming a self-interactive system. He highlights that appearances include everything witnessed in our existence, such as the obvious physical manifestations and the intricacies of the mind's workings. His point is that since we can only experience appearances, it does not prove that these experiences are happening inside the brain or an external world. 
</li><li><b>The brain's role in this system</b>: While not discounting the brain's importance, Leo emphasizes that it being a significant appearance affecting other appearances does not prove its metaphysical existence. The brain, he contends, is crucial in generating the rich array of appearances we experience as human consciousness, but this is just its role in our perceptive framework rather than proof of its physical existence.
</li><li><b>The magic of reality</b>: Leo suggests that reality's very existence is "magical." By describing reality as magical, he refers to the uncaused and mystical nature of existence. His argument is that the mechanism for generating reality is direct manifestation or "magic." He underlines that reality isn't limited by physical laws but instead is unlimited and can do whatever it wants, leading to the appearance of phenomena seemingly from nothing. 
</li><li><b>Limitations of Science</b>: Leo criticizes the assumption that scientific progress can strictly demystify existence. He believes that science, focusing on interpreting appearances, never touches on why appearances themselves exist. Furthermore, he considers that science can be self-restricting in its reliance on materialist metaphysics, not questioning its own assumptions and thus overlooking elements or forms of existence not fitting into this framework.
</li><li><b>Infinite discoveries and the mystical source</b>: Projecting that even with millions of years of continued scientific discovery, science would only unravel an endless trail of appearances. Despite that, the question of their very existence or being would remain untouched. A major criticism he levels on science is that while it dismisses metaphysical questions, it is unknowingly based on unfounded metaphysical assumptions, i.e., materialism. He emphasizes that there must always be a mystical source of reality, smack dab in metaphysics, something that science cannot explain and would still require despite its endeavors.
</li><li><b>Materialist Paradigm Misunderstands the Nature of Reality</b>: Leo Gura stresses that the materialistic approach fails to understand the true mystical/unlimited nature of reality. He argues that materialistic thinkers and scientists ignore the mystical aspects of phenomena, reducing them into mechanical explanations, leading to a loss of understanding of the essence of reality. This denial of the mystical nature of reality causes suffering and a lack of true understanding, as it forces individuals to see reality through an artificially limited lens.
</li><li><b>The Danger of the Materialist Paradigm</b>: According to Leo, individuals adhering to the materialistic paradigm become resistant to exploring topics considered beyond their limits of understanding, such as past lives, out-of-body experiences, paranormal phenomena, and immortality. This denial labels such topics and their followers as nonsensical or crazy, limiting the potential for exploration and radical shifts in understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Challenging Materialism</b>: Leo encourages viewers to question and challenge their own metaphysical beliefs, particularly materialism, in order to open themselves up to the mystical and limitless nature of existence. He highlights the importance of personal discovery and exploration, urging viewers to drop the belief in external physical elements and view reality as direct manifestations or hallucinations, leading to a profound understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Exposing the Limits of Science</b>: Leo criticizes science for operating on metaphysical assumptions and defaulting to materialism, focusing mainly on empirical data and calculations, and avoiding metaphysical queries. Despite its ability to explain physical phenomena using mechanical explanations, science fails to explain the essence and direct manifestation of phenomena which Leo argues, is achieved through consciousness.
</li><li><b>Materialism as a Straitjacket</b>: Adopting a materialistic perception, according to Leo, creates a narrow and rigid worldview. It prevents individuals from acknowledging the immaterial and mystical levels of existence, preventing potential growth and understanding.
</li><li><b>Undertaking Open Investigation</b>: Rather than outright dismissal, Leo emphasizes the importance of an open investigation into various phenomena by reading, listening, and practicing. While some may fear the possibility of falling into false beliefs or superstitions, Leo stresses that the priority should be seeking truth over clinging to rigid beliefs. He highlights the importance of questioning, exploring, and experiencing significant shifts in understanding and consciousness as a journey toward enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Open-mindedness</b>: Leo Gura encourages viewers to have an open mindset, free from any rigid frameworks or ideologies. He emphasizes the need for truth-seeking as opposed to reacting to fears or adopting positions that can tend to close one's mind to new perspectives or paradigms.
</li><li><b>Dogmatism and Materialism</b>: He criticizes materialists, scientists, rationalists, and atheists who consider themselves superior to "superstitious people", arguing that they too harbor their own superstitions. He demonstrates that materialism is a form of religion for these individuals, and encourages them to break free from their paradigm to explore deeper truths.
</li><li><b>Leaving Materialism</b>: According to Leo, leaving the materialist paradigm is similar to exiting a jail cell that one has lived in their entire life, leading to a liberating and enlightening journey of self-discovery. This journey is not only intellectual but also advantageous to personal development and deeper understanding of spirituality.
</li><li><b>Direct Experience</b>: He advises viewers to directly experience the truths that defy materialistic understanding rather than simply believing him. He urges individuals to drop the belief in brains and see reality as a hallucination which can lead to a profound and beautiful understanding of existence.
</li><li><b>Questioning Materialism</b>: Leo encourages viewers to question materialism and deeply examine their metaphysical beliefs. He provides his own experience as an example, sharing how it took him decades to break free from the paradigm of materialism and invites viewers to follow his journey through his website, Actualized.org.
</li><li><b>Documenting Enlightenment</b>: Leo expresses his commitment to document his own enlightenment journey through videos, to provide viewers with a rare opportunity to observe someone gradually becoming enlightened over a number of years. He also encourages viewers to actively participate in the work to grow with him and understand advance teachings.
</li><li><b>Transformation and Growth</b>: Leo predicts that he will become a completely different person within five years, and encourages viewers to witness his transformation and growth. He warns that those who are not actively participating might not be able to relate to his advanced teachings in the future due to significant differences in their paradigm.
