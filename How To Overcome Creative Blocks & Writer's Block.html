hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about how to overcome
creative blocks especially writer's block with practical solutions to get
you unstuck right now the solutions are going to get
right here are going to work for any type of
creative person you might be an artist a designer a
writer and inventor and entrepreneur doesn't matter who you are
if you're creative then you do face blocks sometimes with
your creativity and you get into this mode where you're
procrastinating or you really feel stuck well I got some
good tips that I'm going to give you here for
how to permanently deal with this thing so there's really
two basic ways that you can deal with this problem
one way is the not ideal and the second way
is the ideal what's the not ideal that's way number
one way number one is to brute force it simply
brute force it way number two is the ideal way
which I'm going to talk a little bit more about
later after I talk about number one but basically it
involves pacing yourself and reconnecting with your source motivation that's
the ideal way to handle this now here's the problem
is that if you're sitting there right now and you're
under some tight deadlines like you have a project to
do tomorrow or next week or just some time really
soon because you've been procrastinating now for so long that
now you have to be creative because your boss demands
it or your job demands or your school demands that
or whatever then you don't really have time to pace
yourself and to really get in touch with your source
motivation so option number two isn't really available to you
let me talk a little bit about option number 1
which is just brute forcing it what does that mean
brute forcing it means that you just sit down you
literally pick up your ass from the chair you sit
down at your computer or wherever your doing your work
and you just force yourself to get to work you
force that habit that you've been resisting you build yourself
that habit that you need to build and you just
get to work now what can happen in this situation
is that sometimes you could actually spark creativity right now
you might be feeling lazy and you don't really want
to get to work and all this I know how
that feels in fact I was feeling that way today
when I was supposed to shoot a few videos here
so you know I was feeling that way but I
just kind of went through the motions I just kind
of enforced my habit and I just kind of force
myself to do it anyways and just see what comes
out sometimes what comes out is a little crappy because
you're forcing creativity to come you're kind of forcing the
muse but sometimes you know what happens is like you
actually start getting into it like oh and my crazy
mic riveting tivities all back just because I started taking
action so you might get lucky and that might happened
to you but even if you can brute force it
let me tell you why it's not a good idea
in the long run it's not a really good solution
here's why you're a creative person for you to generate
value in the world and to live your life purpose
you need to be a solid creator that means you
need to understand and match the psychology of creating and
there is such a thing there's a whole study to
this being an effective creator is difficult work the problem
is when you put yourself under the gun under the
deadline it means you've already failed at being a good
creator actually you're a bad creator bad bad bad bad
bad creator right the reason you're back Creator is because
you fail to do what you should have done earlier
and you waited and waited and waited waited till last
minute and now it's kind of too late Stephen Covey
has a concept he says that's a really really effective
and successful in life what you have to do is
you have to do the important things which are non-urgent
things and most of us are terrible at this what
most of us do is we do the urgent things
which are not important and the things that are really
important but that are not urgent that don't have to
be done today or tomorrow we leave those for some
long distant future which never comes and that's what you
did here so what you now are going to have
to suffer is the cost of that and the cost
of that is that your work is now compromised even
if you do sit down and you pull an all-nighter
and your brute force it your work is not as
great as it could have been if you would have
went with option number two which I'm going to talk
about here in a second so just accept that if
you're in that situation accept it right and learn the
lesson this is a painful lesson if you're going to
be an effective creator you have to go through the
pains of becoming a really effective creator and all effective
creators before they got effective they were ineffective and when
they were ineffective they were feeling what you're feeling right
now and then they but what they did is they
learn their lesson so that next time they make sure
that they do the important things that were non-urgent you
know what I'm talking about it's when you've got that
project you've been given a month to complete this project
and you've been procrastinating for for 29 days and then
on the 30th last day now it's like [ __
] now I got to do it how do I
be creative and get it done well you've already [
__ ] up you've already [ __ ] up you
should have been being creative that whole time so learn
your lesson right understand that you're the cost of this
is that your work is getting compromised your life purpose
is getting compromised and you as an artist your creator
you're an artist even if you're not a traditional artist
if you're a designer or inventor even entrepreneur I still
consider you an artist when you're an artist you really
want to put out the best work you can possibly
put out so it's really important that you get this
problem handled in the long run all right now let's
go on to the ideal way to handle this situation
here's the ideal firstly what I want you to do
is I want you to recommit yourself to your art
and to your craft whatever that is if you're a
musician if you're a painter if you're a singer if
you're a writer if you're a composer if you're a
film director if you're a poet if you're in if
you're an entrepreneur you have chosen a certain discipline in
a field for yourself in which you want to achieve
something artistic right okay good so you're trying to be
a creator in that field now what happens with you
is that you have ups and you have downs sometimes
you're riding high and you're in that flow state and
everything's coming to you really easily when you're really creative
you have these brilliant ideas and that feels awesome but
then of course you hit rock bottom or you hit
a plateau where it's like you need some original ideas
but nothing's coming to you everything you have is just
lame and it's boring and it's derivative that's okay if
you're in that place right now that's okay what I
want from you though especially if you're in that rock
bottom or if you're on a plateau and you're not
at your high I want you to recommit to your
craft recommit to your art right now this is extremely
healthy to do because your career will be filled with
ups and downs and what you need to do is
you need to get really good at recommitting especially on
the down parts it's easy to be an artist when
you're on up part the hard part is when you're
on down part to not quit to not browbeat yourself
to not go into some depressive funk to not start
to have all these doom and gloom scenarios like oh
my god I'm never going to create anything amazing anymore
ever again like no this is where you become a
really powerful artist is you commit yourself and recommit yourself
every single time that you struggle and you get in
touch with your source motivation I'm going to put you
in touch with your source motivation right now in a
few minutes but even before I do I want you
to just make a commitment right now and just say
you know what even when the shitty even when it
sucks I still want to be an artist I still
want to work in this field there's a reason why
I come into this and I'm going to recommit right
now even though I feel bad so take five seconds
right now and just go through that process in your
mind and make a recommitment make it solid okay good
now let's get you back in touch your source motivation
there's a reason you went into this field why did
you get into this field in the first place can
you even remember or are you so jaded you forgot
you need to reconnect you need to get good at
reconnecting over and over and over again because in your
whole career there's getting many times where you fall off
track and you feel down and you start to beat
yourself up so think about this think about your childhood
or think about your early adulthood when you first really
got passionate about this field and this art and this
craft what got you into it why were you interested
in the first place try to remember that maybe it
was a beautiful thing that you saw or somebody really
influenced you or you read something or you saw a
beautiful piece of art or whatever and somehow you got
inspired by that try to think back to that you
need to get back to that rather than just trying
to be productive there's a big difference being creative and
being productive productive is just putting stuff out creative is
like coming up with really original things inspired things and
those are the things that probably got you into this
field in the first place so to help you do
this right now I want to put you through a
little guided visualization so take a seat get comfortable sit
with your back up straight in your chair and relax
and this visualization will take five or ten minutes here
do it with me and we'll put you back in
touch into your creative flow all right good so you're
seated now what I want you to do is I
want you to close your eyes and just listen to
me throughout this visualization and follow along and do the
things I'm going to tell you to do so the
first thing that I want you to do is I
want you to just get in touch with the present
moment get in touch with the feelings and sensations in
your body right now how does your body feel what's
actually going on inside your body get in touch with
all five senses sigh sound taste smell feeling get in
touch with all of them right now in the present
moment take a nice deep breath in and then exhale
slowly and as you exhale just feel your body and
allow whatever feelings are there without judging them or wanting
them to be different good keep your eyes closed and
take another really deep breath in at your own pace
and slowly exhale it and as you do that get
even more into the present moment and focus on the
sound of my voice good what I want you to
do right now is I want you to put yourself
into the most depressed lazy and unmotivated state that you
can possibly imagine maybe you feel like you're there already
but I want you to take it to the max
think right now whatever thoughts or images you need to
think of to really make yourself feel completely unmotivated stuck
and uncreated what do you have to imagine to yourself
put yourself into that state and really feel it emotionally
throughout your whole body and in your mind maybe if
tell yourself that you're never going to produce anything great
ever again or maybe you have to fear losing your
job because now you can't produce anything great or maybe
your ego and your self-esteem or shatter maybe you picture
yourself being a washout and a deadbeat and totally unoriginal
completely lazy never going to make anything great ever again
in your life really feel that stuckness that laziness that
sadness like you're totally weak and ineffective and can't get
anything done at all can't even lift your ass out
of the sofa and just soak in that feeling and
soak in all those images running through your mind feel
them fully good now shake yourself out shake your body
shake your arms keep your eyes still closed but just
kind of shake yourself out to get rid of that
feeling and get rid of those images from your mind
now with your eyes closed take another deep breath and
this time what I want you to do is I
want you to imagine yourself in the most creative and
inspired state that you've ever been in think whatever images
or thoughts you have to think to put yourself in
this state right now maybe think about what got you
interested in art or in being a creator in the
first place think about the work that's inspired you throughout
your life think about maybe you the one or the
two top most inspiring moments in your life or you
were really impacted by some beautiful piece of work or
a piece of art or were you really kicked ass
and you created something amazing that you were proud of
maybe imagine yourself as one of your role models or
heroes if you have a role model of some artist
or creator that you think is really amazing like a
Picasso or a Steve Jobs or something like that or
a Leonardo da Vinci imagine yourself as that person right
now and just get yourself completely energized and creative and
like feeling like you're in the flow and that just
these amazing ideas are coming out of nowhere into your
mind and you're just getting all these creative ideas and
you're totally inspired and it's just flowing for you it's
just easy and effortless you're completely in the zone if
you don't know how to create that state for yourself
do it right now don't wonder about it don't ask
me well how do I do it just do it
and enjoy it savor all the thoughts and images in
your mind and the feelings in your body right now
if you need to think back to a time in
your past where you were extremely creative and embody that
right now good all right we're gonna wrap that up
so go ahead and take one nice deep breath in
and as you exhale you're going to open your eyes
and come back alert and refreshed ready go okay good
welcome back so what I really wanted to show you
there is I wanted to show you that creativity is
a state when you feel good about your creativity you're
in a specific state and that state it's not something
that just happens randomly it might feel like it happens
to you randomly but actually it's something that can be
created and engineered that's exactly why having a strong creative
process is necessary to be an effective creator notice I
want you to notice that you went and did a
complete 180 where you were totally depressed and lazy for
one moment and then 20 seconds later you felt creative
and alive and energized and inspired within 20 seconds you
made that shift nothing really changed in your environment but
you were able to make that shift if only just
for that moment while I was talking you were able
to shift your state isn't that cool so just recognize
that you do have this ability and you in theory
do this at any time you want if you really
want to so I just wanted to show you that
because it's powerful to recognize that you can change your
state and it's important to recognize that you do control
your own state you do have that ability it's not
like up in the hands of God you have that
ability so take that power if you desire it and
stop playing victim now what I want to do is
I want to give you five practical techniques that you
can use right now to get rid of any creative
blocks that you have these are very practical techniques so
what I did first is just put you in touch
with your source motivation that's kind of like the ultimate
overarching technique but I want to give you five more
little practical ones so here's what you can do number
one is to slow down the pace of your work
a lot of times as creative people what we do
is we get into this into this kind of like
hamster in a wheel syndrome where we feel like we
need to produce more and more work all the time
or on a strict schedule and it's so demanding what
happens is that we rob ourselves of creativity because we
keep going faster and faster and faster we're trying to
do more instead of doing more do less if you
have the luxury of not having a tight deadline which
is due tomorrow or next week then what you can
do is you can slow down your pace if you
normally write twenty pages a day slow down your pace
to just two pages a day slow down your pace
but still work just work much slower work twice slower
work five times slower work ten times slower but still
work so if this means doing more research or reading
a book here and there or whatever go do those
things in between doing your work to be creative it's
not just like you're sitting down and just typing away
creativity involves more than just typing or more than just
doing the thing of actually creating the the end result
it also involves research it involves thinking it involves brainstorming
it involves maybe collaborating or talking to other people inspiring
yourself by going on into nature or whatever else you
need to do to inspire yourself that's all part of
the creative process so do give yourself permission to slow
down that's technique number one technique number two is explore
fresh mediums and sources so maybe take a break entirely
from your writing or your art or whatever you're trying
to do or your business and go spend a few
days or maybe even a week or maybe even a
whole month exploring new mediums and new sources what do
I mean by this well let's say that you're a
writer okay that's great so one thing you can do
is you can probably go read a lot of other
writers and that might inspire you reading some good writers
that you're passionate about but even better than that to
inspire yourself completely anew like to rejuvenate yourself go find
some other medium besides writing that you could incorporate into
your work potentially you don't even need to see a
direct connection immediately but for example maybe what you do
is you go read some graphic novels and you get
inspired by the graphics and in the graphic novels or
maybe what you do is you go look at some
beautiful gardens and go look at some like masterly cultivated
gardens and you'll see art and beauty in the gardens
and maybe those gardens will inspire your writing see it's
a totally different medium and you would normally think like
well Gardens have nothing to do with writing it doesn't
matter inspiration is inspirations inspiration likewise you know if you're
if you're an entrepreneur and you're trying to be creative
entrepreneurially go to a museum and look at some beautiful
art now you might think well leo beautiful art has
nothing to do with building my internet business well doesn't
matter the beautiful art can inspire you if you're a
web designer and you want to be inspired maybe go
look at some form of art that you've never looked
at before like pottery or dance or music or some
new form of music that you haven't listened to before
look for totally fresh sources sources that normally wouldn't feel
like they fit the medium that you're working in go
outside your medium and go outside the kind of box
that people usually within your medium think through and try
to look for new sources what are new writing styles
that you haven't even read before if you're a science
fiction writer maybe go find some weird poetry about um
you know about middle-aged women who are dealing with with
extramarital affairs look at that and see what that does
to you and just kind of explore what's out there
art is a very big field creativity is a very
big field you need to get really good at this
mast referral world-class creators they know how to mix and
match otherwise weird mediums and weird sources that you normally
wouldn't have thought of being good combinations the third technique
is to focus on perfecting your technique so as an
artist of course there's a lot of different ways that
you can improve and increase your skills whether it's painting
or writing better sentences or sentence structure or any business
skills that you have speaking skills communication skills poetry skills
uh music musical skills composing skills and so on and
so forth site so you have a lot of technical
skills within your field whatever they are what I want
you to do is I want you instead of thinking
about how do I create the next masterpiece how do
I record the next you know best-selling novel or something
instead of thinking about that that's the end result think
about okay let me switch my attention for the next
week or for the next month just on working and
improving my technique let me just master how to right
better sentences better sentence structure let me match your how
to write longer sentences or shorter sentences or let me
master how to write more poetically or use allegory or
use metaphor more or use more colorful in descriptive language
let me go learn some new words that I haven't
ever used before and see how that goes for me
right so it's you're focusing on the technique instead of
the output you're taking the pressure off yourself here and
likewise you know you can you can do this and
you feel that you're in and just spend time improving
your technique that's really good the fourth technique that I'm
going to give you is to create a sandbox for
yourself what is the sandbox a creative sandbox where you
can mess around and experiment and just have little side
projects where you're just doing stuff and just screwing around
and no shippable product is getting created this is getting
created in this sandbox so let's say that you're a
web designer and you work at some big company and
you've got some important projects that you got a ship
and you spend eight hours a day doing web development
and web design okay great that's kind of like your
nine-to-five job what you also need is you need a
sandbox maybe on the weekend you come home and you
just stick around on your computer in Photoshop at home
or you dig around on some online forums or some
galleries where you can look at art and you can
look at different designs it just kind of screw around
and maybe make mock-ups and designs of things that normally
you would never do for your regular clients because they
would never care for it or would never pay for
it but this is just you screwing around with stuff
little experimental stuff maybe you created a logo or you
come up with some new style of button that would
never fit on any project that you're currently working on
but you know hey school is just a new form
of button maybe you'll get popular in ten years but
right now it doesn't work maybe doesn't work for this
client but it'll work for a client a year from
now who knows you need to be in this kind
of experimental mode if you're an effective creator you need
to have a sandbox you just screw around and experiment
this is really where your creativity going to shine and
from there you can really develop yourself and also you
can develop some confidence that a I do have some
creative muscles and then you can carry that over into
your 95 job so to speak so that's what I
mean by creating sandbox and the fifth and final technique
is to create a catalog a catalog of inspiring ideas
you can do this for almost any field if you're
painter if you're musician if you're a writer if you're
an entrepreneur you can create a catalog of inspiring stuff
like maybe it's a folder on your desktop or maybe
it's a file a physical file that you have on
your desk and your file cabinet somewhere where you have
for example let's say that you're an artist then you
would have photographs in there of stuff that inspires you
you would have all sorts of images you might have
videos in there that inspire you you might have scenes
of nature you might have even pictures of your family
in there so basically you're just creating a catalog of
things that are inspirational to you and that kind of
source you wanting to be the artist why did you
become an artist in the first place probably because you
saw some beautiful painting in a museum somewhere or you
know you have some something that happened to you as
a child where you really got inspired to be an
artist so get some photographs of those get some pictures
of those or maybe there's some music that inspires you
to paint so get some of that music in there
and basically create a file or a catalog of this
stuff so you can go and you can look at
it anytime that you're feeling low or anytime that you're
feeling uninspired and make it a big catalog keep expanding
it add to it on a weekly basis for years
until you get just a giant thick-ass file with thousands
of image I'm talking about like ten image I mean
like thousands of them one thing that I used to
do when I was a a front-end web designer I
used to do a lot of front-end web design I
would create a catalog like a file on my computer
where whenever I saw a beautiful website that I really
liked or even some element of website like a button
or a navigation bar or footer something that just I
liked even like a contact form like oh I like
that contact form and what I did I would take
a screenshot of it and then I would put it
in that file and I would do that just a
couple of times a week but since I was interested
in web design for like years and decades over time
that file grew and grew and grew and grew until
there were hundreds if not thousands of different images in
there and so anytime I wanted to create a new
website for example and I'm like well [ __ ]
I don't know uh what should the new website look
like what I do is I just open that file
I look at all the different stuff in there I
just kind of click through the gallery and I look
at every single one and then just my mind starts
to put different things together and just start tapping automatically
it's really a beautiful technique now you can do this
with web development you can do this with art you
can do this with writing it doesn't have to be
just visual stuff you can do with writing and you
can also mix and match media so just because you're
a writer doesn't mean that all your stuff in your
catalog has to be written you could have images too
and likewise if you're an artist doesn't mean you have
to have all pictures and images you can also have
you can have also you can have poems in there
and you can have short stories and excerpts from your
favorite books and quotes and whatever you want so make
that catalog that's the fifth technique so that's it you
got all the techniques these are all very practical things
you can go implement right now and in fact if
you want to be a strong creator you need to
implement stuff like this you can work on improving your
process getting in touch with your source motivation don't confuse
this with lack of discipline and as an excuse to
not build a creative habit these are ways that I
share with you for how you can reinstall your self
and rejuvenate yourself but don't expect inspiration to carry you
all the way through you still need discipline you still
need to build the proper habits so go ahead and
do that powerful creative person he's not just operating purely
on discipline or purely on inspiration he's doing both simultaneously
and that's what you want to do alright that wraps
it up let me give you a couple of quick
pointers here so I have a lot of other videos
that talk about how to overcome issues that creative people
face I have a video called how to stop being
lazy which is one you'll probably like have another one
called how to stop procrastinating which is slightly different than
what we've talked about here that one you will also
like I have videos on mastery I have videos on
understanding resistance these are all very important concepts that you
need to understand you need to start learning the psychology
of being an effective creator this is critical this is
something that I've I'm really passionate about because I've been
trying to be a creator for the last 20 years
and it's a real struggle sometimes it's a real struggle
so I'm going to post some of those those links
down below go ahead and check them out click on
them watch some of those other videos and really commit
yourself to the process of becoming a more effective creator
work on your process not just on the end result
and not just on your craft and not just on
your art but the process and the psychology behind it
all and ultimately you want to work on your life
purpose you want to be very clear about your life
purpose that's why I created the life purpose course so
the final thing I'll say is that you should check
out my life purpose course unless you're just completely rock-solid
on what you want to be doing in your life
even if you think that you're an artist and you're
successful and you've got it all locked down I guarantee
that in my life purpose course you'll learn stuff that
will just totally blow you away and take you to
the next level of your creative potential it's a over
twenty five hour course of all sorts of material to
really get you solid on your authentic self and what
the most meaningful thing for you to be creating in
your life is it's super important to align yourself with
that otherwise you're going to be also an ineffective creator
alright that's it I'm signing off go ahead post your
comments down below please click the like button for me
share this video with a friend and lastly come check
out actualized at work right here this is my website
I have a free newsletter on there I release new
videos on self-actualization topics every single week I want to
help you to master your psychology and you know the
thing that really got me into this originally into personal
development was trying to become more effective as a creator
because I really struggled since my youth to be a
consistent creator I always found myself up and down and
up and down sometimes I was very creative and I'd
produce a lot of stuff but it was usually just
for a short window of time and then I would
lose it and then I would be uncreated and unproductive
for months and I didn't really like that I wanted
more consistency with that so I started studying psychology and
so here I am today cheering a lot of very
advanced concepts that I spent thousands of hours discovering right
so if you want to really mass your life purpose
and you will really be an effective creator you want
to produce amazing art then you can't miss this opportunity

and passion so I hope you sign up stay tuned
