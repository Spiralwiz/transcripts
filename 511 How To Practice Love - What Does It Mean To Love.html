            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/EzTEzav5l20' target='_blank'>How To Practice Love - What Does It Mean To Love</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding the Nature of Love</b>: Leo Gura discusses the profound metaphysics and practical aspects of love, acknowledging that understanding and embodying love remains a struggle. Consciousness is identified as the fundamentally underlying nature of love and neglecting love can lead to physical and psychological dysfunction.
</li><li><b>Practical Ways to Express Love</b>: The video talks about showing love to another person through actions. This could mean giving attention and awareness, maintaining physical proximity, building connection, and taking care of their needs. It implies recognizing and valuing the existence of the loved one.
</li><li><b>Importance of Love in Survival</b>: Leo further highlights research citing the essential role of love in the survival and healthy psychological development of infant monkeys, rats, and humans. He suggests contemplating why consciousness needs love to function optimally and suggests viewers to practice expressing love in their day-to-day interactions.
</li><li><b>Expression of Love through Actions</b>: Leo demonstrates how to express love on a day-to-day basis through a list of actions. These include giving attention, spending time, maintaining physical closeness, forming connections, offering care, survival support, encouragement, acceptance, understanding, collaboration, and validation. He emphasizes the need to practice these actions to truly understand what it means to love someone. 
</li><li><b>You are Consciousness</b>: The lecture emphasizes that we are consciousness within a larger consciousness, which is the universe. He suggests people should treat consciousness as the explorer, and the larger reality as the thing to connect deeply with so as to understand love better in practical terms.
</li><li><b>Importance of Physical Proximity in Expressing Love</b>: Physical contact, holding, touching, hugging are identified as fundamental ways to express love. They create a physical connection which is an essential aspect of love. Even simple physical proximity can evoke feelings of love.
</li><li><b>Connection at Different Levels</b>: Love involves forming a connection at different levels - physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual; the spiritual connection being the most profound. Emphasizing connecting in every way possible, Leo notes that real love is about complete connection.
</li><li><b>Taking Care of Loved Ones</b>: Another practical way to express love is through taking care of the person. This implies helping to meet their needs and ensuring their survival. Leo explains that when one genuinely loves someone, they appreciate the existence of the person and would support their continued existence.
</li><li><b>Potential Attachment Formed through Love</b>: The act of expressing and receiving love could lead to attachment, creating a bias because one becomes invested in the survival and well-being of the loved one. This might present a challenge, as the loved one is a finite being, and their existence could potentially be threatened.
</li><li><b>Incorporating others into our sense of self</b>: Love involves extending personal sense of self to incorporate others, making their survival and experiences tied to our own. This opens up individuals to vulnerability as harm to loved ones is perceived as harm to self, but enhances depth of love.
</li><li><b>Limitations of focusing love</b>: Focusing love on specific entities in consciousness limits its potential. Attaining deeper and universal love involves transcending attachments, including the instinct to help people survive.
</li><li><b>Protection of loved ones</b>: Protecting loved ones from suffering and trauma is integral to love. Parents, for instance, gauge how much suffering and challenge a child can take, providing a protective shield without over shielding to allow room for personal growth.
</li><li><b>Taking on a loved one's agenda</b>: An aspect of love is taking on the agenda of a loved one and considering it an extension of personal agenda. Incorrectly imposing our agenda on loved ones is a common mistake.
</li><li><b>Reciprocity within love and care</b>: Loving individuals should treat others in the manner they would want to be treated. Genuine joy in the success of loved ones indicates the existence of a deep connection.
</li><li><b>Acknowledging differences</b>: Love includes respect for the individual's specific wants and needs. It involves championing the highest aspirations of others, even when it differs from personal aspirations. 
</li><li><b>Importance of loyalty</b>: Loyalty, such as having someone's back, forms a crucial element of love. Lack of faith in a friend or partner's loyalty weakens the sense of love and trust.
</li><li><b>Respecting the individuality of others</b>: Leo Gura stresses the importance of respecting the individuality of others in a love relationship. This means acknowledging their unique needs, passions, and visions, and supporting and encouraging them in these, without trying to impose one's own desires or expectations on them. This also involves viewing them as equals and not trying to manipulate, control, or dominate them. 
</li><li><b>The value of sacrifice in love</b>: Gura discusses the value of sacrifice in a love relationship, explaining that if you truly love someone, you would be willing to work for them and make sacrifices on their behalf. He mentions the negative attitudes existing in certain communities and the need for mutual willingness to sacrifice in a balanced relationship.
</li><li><b>True acceptance and appreciation</b>: For genuine love to exist, Gura indicates that there must be total acceptance of the other person as they are, without judgment or a desire for them to change. In this context, love involves appreciating the individual for their own sake and seeing their intrinsic beauty. 
</li><li><b>The concept of 'sovereignty' in love</b>: A significant facet of love involves respecting the 'sovereignty' of the other person. This means acknowledging their individual consciousness and treating them neither as superior nor inferior, but as equals. This fundamental recognition prevents manipulation, control or exploitation.
</li><li><b>Encouragement aligned with the other's interests</b>: Gura elaborates on how encouragement in love should align with the interests and passions of the loved one, especially in the context of self-exploration, self-expression, and self-actualization. Encouragement should not be based on ones own priorities or expectations but rather support the passions of the loved one.
</li><li><b>Significance of sacrifice in love</b>: In the context of love, Gura emphasizes the significance of sacrificing for the benefit of the loved one. He points out that being willing to work and make sacrifices for the one you love is essential in a genuine love relationship. This is applicable for both in their unique ways and based on the needs of each other.
</li><li><b>Presence of beauty in all consciousness</b>: Gura asserts that everything is beautiful as all forms of consciousness hold intrinsic beauty. This requires a deeper connection and willingness to appreciate the existence of the object or individual for its own sake.
</li><li><b>Appreciating Things Deeply</b>: Love is about intensely appreciating the thing you love. Just like how one would appreciate every detail, every brush stroke of a Van Gogh painting, love lies in appreciating the tiny details of another person.
</li><li><b>Beyond Needs</b>: In love, the other person is not a tool to satisfy your own needs. Real love lies in not needing anything from the other and appreciating their existence.
</li><li><b>Respecting Other's Perspective</b>: Love also means respecting the other person's point of view. When you love someone, you want to understand their perspective, even if it varies from yours. This is an essential component of love as every individual has unique experiences and perspectives. 
</li><li><b>Embracing Diverse Points of View</b>: Being open-minded is key to deeply loving someone. You have to be mentally flexible to accommodate the varied points of view, appreciate the diversity of their experiences, and not impose your perspective onto them.
</li><li><b>A Deep Understanding</b>: Love is about understanding the deep subjective experiences, consciousness and spirit of the other person. This understanding goes beyond their physical body and works to deeply connect and bond with their mind and spirit.
</li><li><b>Validating the Other</b>: One important aspect of love is validating the other person's point of view and showing them respect. Caring about their interests and sharing similar interests builds a strong connection and is the basis of love.
</li><li><b>Being There for Others</b>: Love tests the depth of a relationship during times of hardship. Being there for the other person when they are at their lowest, showing them support, and helping them not to feel lonely are signs of true love. 
</li><li><b>Validating Feelings</b>: Love also requires validating the feelings of the other person and empathizing with them. A powerful way to build an emotional connection is to frequently ask them how they are feeling and validate their responses.
</li><li><b>Connection and Collaboration</b>: Love fosters a sense of togetherness, companionship, and collaboration. It's about being there for each other, working together, and providing support, especially during challenging times. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Emotional Connection</b>: Emotional connection in love can be as important as physical, intellectual, or spiritual connection. For a fruitful and genuine relationship, a deep understanding of the other's emotions is crucial. This understanding is achieved by actively listening and empathizing with them when they share their feelings. 
</li><li><b>A Deeper Path to Love</b>: The ability to handle diverse points of view, appreciate differences, and empathize with the emotions and experiences of others, lead to a deeper understanding of love, and can help strengthen relationships.
</li><li><b>Validating Feelings</b>: Understanding and validating feelings, even if seen as irrational, helps build emotional connections. It is critical to avoid enforcing personal viewpoints, as this might not cater to the emotional needs of the other individual.
</li><li><b>Empathy and Patience</b>: Being patient and empathetic with someones suffering, pain and feelings are signs of deep love and respect. The person suffering should not be regarded as an annoyance that needs to be fixed immediately.
</li><li><b>Meeting Others Where They Are</b>: In order to communicate effectively, it is important to meet others at their level. Understanding and connecting with what they are going through ensures appropriate communication.
</li><li><b>Understanding, Forgiveness, and Patience</b>: Practicing understanding and forgiveness, especially when others make mistakes, cultivates love. Patience is vital as love necessitates tolerance and endurance.
</li><li><b>Recognizing Goodness in Others</b>: Seeing the goodness in someone, regardless of their flaws or wrongdoings, is a powerful form of love that contributes to transformation and healing.
</li><li><b>Recognition of Uniqueness</b>: Recognizing and honoring an individuals uniqueness asserts their worth and builds deep love. It is vital to avoid enforcing personal fantasies or ideals that may diminish their individuality.
</li><li><b>Generosity, Kindness, and Verbal Approval</b>: Love flourishes in an environment of generosity and kindness. Verbal approval and compliments can significantly impact and build feelings of love.
</li><li><b>Keeping Promises and Peace</b>: Keeping promises builds trust in relationships. Maintaining peace, even in conflict, is a significant sign of love as unnecessary conflicts can damage and interrupt the growth of love.
</li><li><b>Connection between love and truth</b>: Love should be built on truth and honesty. Love in a relationship cannot exist if it is founded on lies and deception. Love involves appreciating a person for who they truly are, including their flaws and imperfections.
</li><li><b>Importance of safety and trust in love</b>: In any loving relationship, trust and a sense of safety are essential. Love involves maintaining trust and not exploiting it for personal gain. A trusted bond is particularly crucial for children, who require dependable and trustworthy figures in their lives. 
</li><li><b>Acceptance of selfishness</b>: Accepting the selfishness of a finite consciousness, such as another human, is a challenge in expressing love. People are naturally selfish, and the ability to love someone despite their selfishness truly tests the strength of one's love. Love involves loving a person as they are, not as their potential enlightened version.
</li><li><b>How to express love</b>: Love can be shown through attention, time, physical closeness and connection. It involves understanding, forgiveness, patience, generosity, kindness and honesty. Performing acts that fracture trust and safety, such as violence, abuse, deception, manipulation, are counterproductive to love. 
</li><li><b>The embodiment of love</b>: Becoming a more selfless individual is essential for embodying and expressing love. Love equals selflessness, making loving others challenging due to inherent selfishness in people. However, acknowledging this selfishness and working towards being more selfless can strengthen a person's capacity to love. 
</li><li><b>How to understand if one is loved</b>: Recognized through behaviours ranging from attention, care, understanding to forgiveness and kindness. Negative actions, such as violence, abuse, neglect, lying, manipulation can cause an individual to feel unloved. 
</li><li><b>Comparing one's ability to love and receive love-</b>: By reflecting upon their childhood, individuals can recognize actions that made them feel loved or unloved. They can analyze these actions to understand how to better love others, and accept love. 
</li><li><b>On abusive relationships</b>: Individuals in abusive situations should prioritize their safety over the notion of blind love for their abuser. Love does not warrant staying under abusive circumstances. Even while leaving, hatred towards the abuser is not necessary. They should instead aim to create a secure and peaceful environment for themselves.
</li><li><b>Practical demonstrations of love</b>: Leo Gura discusses several practical ways to love another person, which include giving attention and understanding, maintaining emotional, intellectual and spiritual connection, caring for their needs, and providing physical and emotional security. 
</li><li><b>Support and encouragement in love</b>: It involves supporting, nurturing, and cheering for them in their endeavours and encouraging self-exploration, self-expression, and self-realization. 
</li><li><b>Respect and acceptance in love</b>: Loving a person entails respecting their individuality and not attempting to control or dominate them. It necessitates total acceptance, non-judgment, and genuine appreciation of their intrinsic beauty and uniqueness. 
</li><li><b>Understanding and connection</b>: Truly loving someone requires seeking to understand their point of view and interests, sharing similar interests, and fostering togetherness and collaboration. It involves empathizing with their feelings and meeting them at their current developmental level. 
</li><li><b>Patience, kindness, and truthfulness in love</b>: Love encompasses patience, kindness, and truthfulness. It's creating a safe space where trust can thrive and being accepting and appreciative of the other person's true self. 
</li><li><b>Understanding childhood experiences of love</b>: Leo Gura suggests an assignment to create a list of specific actions or phrases that made one feel loved or unloved during childhood as a means of understanding the fundamentals of love. 
</li><li><b>Motivation to love others</b>: Even in situations where individuals did not experience love during their childhood, such experiences can serve as motivation to love and treat others better in their adult relationships. 
</li><li><b>Love and relationships</b>: Entering relationships from a selfish perspective can lead to conflict as people attempt to mould their partners into their ideal versions. For a relationship to thrive, love should be genuine, selfless, and based on mutual understanding and support. 
</li><li><b>Challenges of intimate relationships</b>: The nature and challenges of intimate relationships are briefly illuminated, pointing towards a future discussion dedicated to understanding and nurturing conscious relationships.
</li><li><b>Importance of selflessness in love</b>: Love is difficult and can ultimately test individuals. A capacity to love is one of the most honest signals you can give. People who are selfish or self-absorbed are largely incapable of love, so if genuine love is sought in relationships, its important to engage with individuals who are emotionally, cognitively, morally, and spiritually developed. 
</li><li><b>Finding high development individuals for relationships</b>: Highly developed individuals are rare, which makes finding compatible partners challenging. Engaging in communities or places where developed people are likely to be can increase the chances of meeting such individuals. Although physical attraction is important, spiritual and emotional development should also be primary factors to consider. 
</li><li><b>Love in parenting and marriages</b>: In regards to childrearing, one of the most essential needs of a child is love. Parenting techniques become secondary to the display of love from parents to their children. The same principles apply to developing a successful and fulfilling marriage. Love must also extend to oneself, which includes refraining from self-criticism and judgment. 
</li><li><b>Two aspects of mastering love</b>: There are two facets to learning and mastering love, one includes harnessing absolute love through awakening and god realization, with tools such as meditation or potentially psychedelics. The other facet includes practicing love in daily realities and relationships and extending love to specific people and things in the world.
</li><li><b>Becoming a good lover</b>: Becoming a good lover, grounded in truth, requires serious work and commitment over decades. Life should be viewed as a training ground to become a good lover, it's not about the pursuit of materialistic achievements or nihilistic perspectives. Instead, it's about deepening connections and avoiding behaviours, actions, or thoughts that sever these connections. 
</li><li><b>Application and extension of love</b>: Genuine and selfless love can be applied to various aspects of life, from intimate relationships, friends, family, co-workers, to strangers on the street, animals, and the environment. It's a universal principle that applies regardless of the context and is ultimately the point and purpose of life.
</li><li><b>Love as Connection</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that love equals connection, a process where two separate entities come together to form a unified whole. It's about re-establishing a connection between two disjointed parts of consciousness, leading them to merge into a unity. 
</li><li><b>Deepening Love/Connection</b>: Deepening connection with something or someone you love yields a more profound and meaningful life experience. Spirituality, according to Gura, is essentially about forming deep connections with reality. The question of how to deepen these connections should guide actions and decisions throughout one's life. 
</li><li><b>Investing in Connections</b>: Developing deep, meaningful connections with the things we love requires continuous investment. It goes beyond shallow pursuits and you need to devote significant time and effort to nurture these connections. This dedication is crucial to creating a meaningful life.
</li><li><b>The Scope of Connection</b>: Gura adds that reality is infinitely deep, providing limitless opportunities for deep connections. The extent to which you want to connect with the universe or specific aspects of it is an individual choice. 
</li><li><b>Development of Love through Connection</b>: Building upon personal interests or likings can lead to cultivating deeper connections and love over time. For example, a basic interest in dinosaurs could evolve into a study of paleontology, requiring years of development and investment. 
</li><li><b>Link Between Love and Personal Development</b>: Gura posits that love can be seen as a fuel for personal development. As individuals grow, expand and develop, they also increase their capacity to love.
</li><li><b>Love as Acceptance and Appreciation of Beauty</b>: Love involves accepting a thing's inherent perfection and appreciating its beauty. Everyone has unique interests and passions, and love expresses itself through the appreciation of the beauty in these diverse aspects of existence.
</li><li><b>Understanding of love's deep aspects</b>: Love is the opposite of rejection, hate, judgment, and other negative behaviors. Loving properly involves accepting reality and not wanting it to be different. The hindrance to extending love to other people is bias. 
</li><li><b>Concept of God is love</b>: The core realization in spirituality is recognizing God as love where God acts selflessly for the collective good of existence. This selflessness gradually expands as God awakens to the consciousness that it is infinite love.
</li><li><b>Practicing love</b>: One should practice love without setting unreachable standards of perfection for oneself. The goal is to be a little more loving each day, leading to less conflict, fear, and anxiety, and more happiness.
</li><li><b>Practical application</b>: Practicing love includes setting boundaries where necessary, leaving abusive situations, and respecting your sovereignty and values. Loving an abuser does not mean staying with them; it means holding compassion and empathy for them from a distance.
</li><li><b>Navigating love vs. selfish needs</b>: As you fulfill your own needs, life becomes more about helping others satisfy their needs, until eventually you reach a point of selflessness, then your life just becomes about being of service to others. Understanding one's limitations and practicing self-respect is important. 
</li><li><b>View on relationships</b>: If you're in an abusive situation, you must prioritize your safety and well-being. You can continue to have compassion and empathy for your abuser, but it is advisable to do so from a safe distance.
</li><li><b>Applying love to life ambitions</b>: The Life Purpose Course is a blueprint on how to develop a career you love. It aligns one's life with their values and shows them how to follow through on that alignment. It fits into the concept of falling in love with your life.
</li><li><b>Self-awareness and growth</b>: Acknowledging personal imperfections is vital while practicing love. Like others, no one can be perfectly loving. Recognizing personal selfishness can be challenging but necessary for growth and understanding others' selfishness.
</li><li><b>Balancing ideals with reality</b>: Although the aim is to become more loving, it's crucial to remember that everyone, including oneself, is a finite form of consciousness and cannot always meet the highest standards of love. Patience, understanding, and self-compassion are essential on the journey towards becoming a better lover.
