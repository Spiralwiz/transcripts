            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/ypSinz7WB3I' target='_blank'>The Paradox Of Developing Self-Trust</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>The Paradox of Self-Trust</b>: Leo Gura from Actualized.org discusses the paradox of developing self-trust in personal development work. This paradox lies in the advice to doubt and question oneself, while also trusting oneself completely - a difficult concept especially for those new to personal development. Human minds, like computer systems or biological immune systems, need to discern what to trust and what to doubt. This becomes challenging as one may trust limiting beliefs, fears, and egos, leading to misdirection in life.
</li><li><b>Importance of Doubting Aspects of Oneself</b>: As part of personal development, one must critically doubt the deceptive and misleading parts of themselves and their worldview. It becomes a problem when individuals do not doubt their limiting beliefs, fears, emotions and ego as much as they should. They also often fail to trust their intuition and their so-called "higher self."
</li><li><b>Concept of 'Ego', 'Intuition' and 'Higher Self'</b>: Leo points out that these abstract labels can be confusing for a newbie in personal development. A newbie may struggle to figure out what these concepts mean and what part they play in personal development. They may blindly trust their mind and beliefs, while holding doubts about their intuition and higher self.
</li><li><b>Understanding Trust and Doubt in Personal Development</b>: Newbies often face the problem of misplaced trust and insufficient disbelief in one's intuition and higher self. The balance between trusting and doubting different aspects of oneself is key. For example, one might have unwavering trust in their mind and beliefs and doubt in their intuition and higher self. This pattern of behavior often leads to emotional instability and dysfunction in life.
</li><li><b>The Need for Self-Doubt</b>: Doubting aspects of oneself such as the ego, which is the belief in being separate from others and the world, is essential. Key aspects of self-doubt involve recognizing and questioning one's biases from self-deceptive characteristics. Achieving a healthy balance of doubt and trust is critical to avoiding misplaced trust and promoting personal growth.
</li><li><b>Doubting Despite Temptations and Pressures</b>: It's common for newbies to trust their fears, emotions, and egos blindly. The newbie might also fail to trust their intuition and their higher self. As one continues their personal development journey, figuring out which parts of the self to trust and which to doubt becomes a crucial challenge. 
</li><li><b>Dealing with Neuroses in Personal Development</b>: Neurosis, or the inability to trust oneself, can arise in personal development work due to misplaced trust in false beliefs and fears. The process of untying these "neuroses" involves recognizing and doubting self-deceptions, thereby reducing needless stress and drama in life.
</li><li><b>Discovering Self-Deceptions</b>: Essential to personal development work is the ability to identify and overcome subtle and sneaky self-deceptions that have existed for years or decades. Doubting the narratives and belief patterns that contribute to these self-deceptions can lead to more authenticity in life. 
</li><li><b>Principles to Doubt in Personal Development</b>: Gura suggests that individuals should doubt different aspects of themselves including their ego, the belief that they are separate from others, and their motivations influenced by societal norms. Deep doubt and self-inquiry are key to recognizing destructive biases, beliefs, and fears. 
</li><li><b>Doubting Self for Authenticity</b>: Part of developing self-trust involves recognizing and questioning one's biases, especially those that prioritize self over others. One also needs to examine the motivations behind certain behaviors and beliefs, such as why one might follow societal expectations more than their own desires. Self-doubt aids in improving self-awareness, leading to a more genuine and fulfilling life.
</li><li><b>Examining Self Biases and Double Standards</b>: Leo Gura highlights the importance of acknowledging self biases and double standards. He uses an example from relationships to illustrate how individuals often favor themselves over others, creating a bias that does not hold them to the same standards they expect from others.
</li><li><b>Questioning Deeply Held Beliefs</b>: Leo asserts that all deeply held beliefs need to be doubted and questioned, regardless of how certain they seem. This includes beliefs about God, science, atheism, and societal norms. He posits that every belief, regardless of its content, is false and the real issue lies in whether one is enslaved by it or free from it. 
</li><li><b>Doubting Rationality, Logic, and Science</b>: He suggests questioning the structures of rationality, logic, and science themselves, as they are often taken on faith and can limit access to deeper states of consciousness and growth. Leo argues that traditional beliefs in these areas can form obstacles to personal development and exploring higher states of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Inward Skepticism and Questioning Emotions</b>: Leo advises viewers to redirect their skepticism inward, even doubting skepticism itself. He also encourages questioning both negative and positive emotions, as they can potentially be tools of one's ego, manipulating one's actions and reactions. He suggests that being a slave to any emotion, even the so-called 'good' ones, can be damaging.
</li><li><b>Questioning Religious Beliefs</b>: Similar to beliefs about science, logic, and rationality, he highlights the importance of questioning religious beliefs, which can often impede growth and discovering higher states of consciousness. He implies that traditional religious beliefs can often prevent individuals from truly understanding the concepts their religion speaks about. 
</li><li><b>Need to Look beyond the Surface</b>: Just as he advises questioning beliefs and rationality, Leo urges viewers to question the underlying justifications for their beliefs, to really understand their origins and validity. This involves a process of deep questioning that goes beyond surface-level understanding.
</li><li><b>Questioning excitement and emotional motivations</b>: Its important to critically examine excitement and emotional impulses, which can lead to self-delusion and damaging life decisions. Its advisable to question motivations linked to commonly exciting pursuits like sex, making money, or starting a family, in order to determine whether these are suitable directions for personal growth.
</li><li><b>Projections and criticisms</b>: All criticisms one makes about others often function as projections of their ego and insecurities, having nothing to do with the individuals theyre criticizing. By understanding and questioning these projections, one can become more self-aware and significantly reduce the tendency to criticize others.
</li><li><b>Influence of cultural preferences and norms</b>: People unconsciously adopt many cultural preferences, norms, and beliefs which significantly impact their desires, motivations, and actions. It is crucial to question and understand these cultural influences to identify truly authentic desires.
</li><li><b>Avoidance of "should" statements and obligation driven motivations</b>: Any moralizations or 'should' statements can be limiting and need to be questioned. Further, motivations driven by a sense of obligation or duty are often not authentic and can contribute to the development of neurotic behaviors.
</li><li><b>Doubt towards beating oneself up</b>: People who harshly discipline themselves often believe its necessary for personal growth. However, this approach leads to neuroses, unconsciousness, lack of groundedness, and consistency in action-taking. It's crucial to question such behavior, focusing more on self-acceptance and love.
</li><li><b>Significance of questioning beliefs and identities</b>: Ones entire model of reality, referred to as a "web of beliefs," is likely more fictional than reality-based and must be challenged. As part of this, it is important to question one's identity as it is largely a construction. Unpacking and examining these constructions can provide a deeper understanding of one's essential self.
</li><li><b>Importance of self-doubt and self-exploration</b>: Personal development demands years of self-honesty and questioning accepted beliefs, models of reality, and identity. This process, which is guided by skepticism and open-mindedness without an agenda, involves significant self-exploration that can't be achieved through books or through someone else's insights.
</li><li><b>Questioning Cultural Notions and Preferences</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of introspection and questioning the origin of one's beliefs, cultural notions, and preferences. He challenges viewers to consider whether these aspects of their identities are truly their own or have merely been adopted from external sources.
</li><li><b>Trust in Intuition and Higher Self</b>: He advises viewers to trust more in their intuition and their higher self  the spontaneous, open, and playful part of oneself that contrasts the defensive and self-aggrandizing ego. 
</li><li><b>Bombarding Influences and Rediscovering Self</b>: He acknowledges that individuals often lose touch with this higher self due to various influences and traumas they encounter through life. However, Leo Suggests it's possible to rediscover our original self by distancing ourselves from these influences.
</li><li><b>Looking at Childhood Self</b>: Gura encourages viewers to look at their childhood selves for inspiration, remembering what moved and inspired them and how they behaved and interacted. Yet, he also cautions about potential traumas in childhood that might have affected our perception of self.
</li><li><b>Drive for Truth</b>: Leo argues that everyone possesses a deep drive to discover truth, but this drive can often be hijacked by cultural upbringing and ego manipulation. He suggests that this drive for truth should instead focus on seeking direct experiences of reality without allowing beliefs to cloud one's perception.
</li><li><b>Trust in Love, Compassion, and Gratitude</b>: Gura suggests trust in the emotions of love, compassion, and gratitude, being careful to distinguish authentic emotions from ego-distorted counterparts. Unconditional love, empathy towards a stranger in need, and feeling gratitude towards someone who has contributed positively to your life are all highlighted as trustworthy emotions.
</li><li><b>Trust in Silence and Solitude</b>: Leo notes that silence and solitude can also be trusted, as they can provide reliable answers to life's questions. He challenges viewers to regularly make the time for quiet introspection in their busy lives. 
</li><li><b>Interplay of Trust and Skepticism</b>: Despite the guidelines provided, Gura underscores the importance of ongoing skepticism and self-examination to prevent one's ego from twisting these trustworthy aspects to suit its own needs.
</li><li><b>Body as Signal for Emotional States</b>: It is important to understand that our emotions offer powerful and accurate signals about our physical and mental states, and these signals can be relied on when navigating life. However, understanding and trusting these signals requires developing an awareness over time, separating the emotional triggers from deeper emotions.
</li><li><b>Deep Emotional Desires</b>: Deep emotional desires for connection, justice, love, beauty, and contribution are what drive people. These are emotional in nature, associated with the higher self, unlike surface level annoyances. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Trust through Doubting</b>: In order to truly understand what one can trust, a person must engage in extensive self-doubt and inquiry. By doubting and questioning everything, one can refine their understanding of trust, ultimately trusting what survives the rigorous process of doubt and scrutiny.
</li><li><b>Trusting Your Creative Muse, Awareness, and Natural Powers</b>: One can trust their creative muse - the internal source of ideas and inspiration, as well as awareness and direct conscious experience. The natural capabilities as a human given by nature, such as the ability to walk, talk, and procure food, are also reliable indicators of trust. 
</li><li><b>Understanding Faith and Self-trust</b>: True faith does not mean blind belief; instead, it requires discernment between what can and cannot be trusted. Ultimate faith manifests as an emotional surrender, not blind belief. The mind should serve the heart, and the heart is the best tool in making life decisions, such as marriage or career choices. 
</li><li><b>Trust through Emotional Surrender</b>: It is crucial to surrender to one's feelings and deep emotions, which guide one's decisions in life. Making life decisions based on inner feelings and intuition is preferred over logical reasoning or cultural background. 
</li><li><b>Distinguishing between the Ego and Higher Self</b>: The key to self-trust is distinguishing between one's ego and their higher self. This process requires a deep engagement with self, including both doubt and trust. Acquiring trust requires one to immerse themselves in the process, experiencing, questioning, and discovering independently.
</li><li><b>Developmental Stages of Self-Trust</b>: The process of building trust in oneself typically involves going through several stages of doubting and gaining confidence. Initially, for individuals dealing with issues like depression and low self-esteem, it's vital to develop some basic trust in their capabilities. Following that, the stage of doubting all beliefs, ideologies, and self-concepts ensues. This stage is challenging and emotionally draining, but it allows individuals to question the basis of their thoughts and actions. Once these doubts have been addressed, it's easy to become complacent or arrogant, believing that all necessary doubts have been overcome. However, deeper doubts exist and need to be addressed at this intermediate stage. After thorough self-questioning, individuals can start to trust themselves more, integrating both logic and intuition into decision-making. 
</li><li><b>Working on Inner Development</b>: Developing enough to be able to fully trust oneself involves substantial inner work. This development process can be likened to the maturity of a child; an undeveloped individual is like an immature child that cannot be trusted with responsibilities. As one mature, they can trust their judgment more and can manage their responsibilities effectively. Inner development can require anywhere from three to ten years of deep self-work.
</li><li><b>Challenges in the Personal Development Journey</b>: The beginning of the journey of personal development is relatively difficult, feeling like a backward and confusing process. The first three to five years can result in intense self-doubt, possibly to the point of depression. However, after this challenging phase, people begin to experience feelings of self-assurance and can start trusting themselves more. This allows life to become effortless and spontaneous, reflecting hard work and development.
</li><li><b>Achieving Full Self-Trust</b>: The goal of personal development is to gain absolute self-trust. To accomplish this, people must develop full trust in their emotions, cognitions, body sensations, and even their moments of hesitation. Such development creates a sense of integration and harmony within the individual, making life more effortless and flowing. This level of self-trust must be earned through personal growth and cannot be attained instantly.
</li><li><b>Staying on Track with Personal Development</b>: Despite the challenges of the journey, it is crucial to persevere and stay on track with personal development. One effective way to do this is by subscribing to newsletters, like those from Actualized.org, that provide guidance and reminders. Active participation in personal development activities, including taking actionable steps from lessons learned, is also essential for seeing improvements. Sticking to the journey over time would result in significant benefits and an increase in self-trust.
