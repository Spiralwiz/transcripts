hey this is Leo for actualize org and in this
video I'm gonna tell you how to do goal-setting okay
let's talk about goal-setting how do you go about setting
powerful goals and making sure that those goals actually get
realized we've all been at that place after New Year's
resolution time right a week after New Year's and we
set some sort of big ambitious goal and then what
happens we all know what happens it falls through so
how do we turn that around and how do we
make goals work not only for New Year's time but
throughout the whole year and how do we make them
practical it's something that is actually changing our life transforming
your life for the better I mean personally I've struggled
with goals for a long time and that's because they
seem simple they seem obvious but this is deceptively so
you need to go in there and start to look
into what actually makes goals work and what is not
relevant so that you can set proper powerful goals to
achieve your dreams and that's ultimately why we care about
this right the goal-setting process is important only for that
reason if you're like me then you have big dreams
for your life you know that you're capable of so
much more than you're currently realizing and what that means
is that you have some sort of dream you have
some sort of vision you have some sort of grand
castle in the sky for maybe what your relationship could
be like or what your career could be like how
your business might be thriving what your health might be
like what your lifestyle is like so all of those
areas in your life to achieve big things in those
places then you need to have some sort of goals
to get you there right a dream is like a
very big overarching goal but then you need to break
that down into smaller chunks so you can actually go
and implement it so let's talk about how to do
this and where people make mistakes with the goal-setting process
because I have made these mistakes and I still make
these mistakes even though I've studied this stuff because it's
just very obvious it's just very easy to overlook this
stuff it is so let's take a look at that
the first thing I got to tell you and this
is this is a very important realization for you to
have is that right now you probably don't have any
goals at all this is the number one reason that
people are not getting much much much more success in
life is simply because they do not have goals and
now you might be listening to this and you might
be into self-development and you might have done already some
work on yourself and you might be saying well Leo
I know that's that's a that's a bad way to
go about life having no goals so I have some
goals for my life and what I'm trying to tell
you here is that even you if you think that
you have goals right now actually you don't have any
goals so let's clarify what this actually means because this
will be a shocking revelation to you and the reason
that you're not getting more success in your life is
because you don't have goals but you think you do
in order to fix the problem for so you got
to realize that you have one so this is how
we start unearthing all this is that we discover that
there's a problem here the problem is that you're deceiving
yourself about the goals that you're setting so why am
I saying this I mean you might have some goals
even someone who is not into personal development will probably
still say that they have a couple of goals for
their life well here is my definition of what a
goal is relative to what other people think it is
see most people think a goal is a desire a
vague desire of wanting something of wanting something better right
isn't that what a goal is in popular culture it's
just a desire that's what it is like oh you
know I wish I had a nicer house you know
I wish I had a better marriage you know I
wish my business was earning twice as much you know
I wish that I was a little bit healthier I
wish that I lived in a different City I wish
I drove a better car I wish I wasn't so
negative so critical all the time so these kind of
vague wishes and when you have a wish like this
it's I mean you got to start somewhere so that's
all right you can start there but the problem is
that people stay there and they stay there for years
they stay there for their whole life and then they
wonder why they don't get what they want well that's
because what they had was they had a very vague
loosey-goosey desire for something they don't even know exactly what
and it wasn't a goal here's what a real goal
is I would say there's about five points that constitute
a proper and true goal and if you're not hitting
all five of these points then what you've got is
you've got a desire you don't have a goal and
therefore it's not gonna work the way a goal should
work it's not going to get you as motivated as
it needs to it's not going to get you taking
action in the way that you want to it's it's
not gonna it's not going to inspire you and ultimately
it's not gonna get realized it's just gonna remain in
Fantasyland so here are the five points point number one
is that a goal has to be specific specific very
very clear your goal has to be crystal clear I'm
going to go into more depth on each one of
these points right now I just want to throw all
the points out there so point number one is specific
point number two is your goal has to be big
and compelling your goals have to be big point number
three is that they have to be written down it
doesn't count if it's just in your head it has
to be written down point number four is that you
have to review your goal every single day like clockwork
review it every single day and point number five is
that your goal has to be aligned with your highest
values all right so these are my five points for
extremely effective and practical goal setting if you hit all
five of these points with your goal you are gonna
be miles and miles closer towards actually realizing it so
let's go into each one of these points a little
bit and and elaborate specific most people go most people's
goals fail right here is that they're simply not specific
at all you have some vague notion that you want
to live somewhere else but you haven't specified what country
what Street what neighborhood what the conditions are for a
good place to live or a bad place to live
so your chances of getting there are very very slim
or your business maybe you want to start a new
business or you want to take your business and you
want to improve the current one you've got but it's
just a vague desire maybe a vague desire to be
earning a little bit more money or to be a
little bit more financially secure but what does that mean
what does that really mean how many extra dollars you
may be earning per day per month per year you
have to articulate that you have to be very clear
what kind of business do you want what do you
want your business to be doing what exactly not some
vague wishy-washy mission statement something very very concrete and exact
and crystal clear the more clear you can be about
what you want then your chances of having it are
astronomically increased so this is probably the biggest place where
most people fail and I coach so many people and
people come into coaching with me and obviously they come
in because they have a desire to improve their life
in some way but these desires are so so so
vague so a lot of the work that we do
is on clarification and that alone right there it might
seem like it's so simple what clarification you know is
that really important you might wonder it's critically important it's
so important that you would be shocked which is why
a lot of times clients will come in and work
with me for just a few sessions we get so
much clarity they have more clarity about their life than
they've had in decades literally people who have been running
businesses or having successful careers for decades then they come
in and they talk to me for a couple of
hours they have more clarity about what they're doing in
their life than they have for years it's ridiculous just
because you start to dig into it you sort of
ask the right questions they start to see how little
they really know about what they want and then it's
like oh that's why I've been stuck so long because
I don't know what I'm actually going after right so
specificity is very critical the next point is size the
size of the goal the goal has to be big
the best way to explain this is just with an
example do you think it's easier to lose 5 pounds
and keep it off or to lose 50 pounds and
to keep it off it might seem like losing five
pounds would be easier because what does it take to
lose five pounds maybe go to the gym consistently for
a couple of weeks diet a little bit and you
can drop your 5 pounds what does it take to
lose 50 pounds well you got to go to the
gym for months you got to really work your ass
off hard you got a really retrain your diet and
your your nutrition habits and be very consistent with it
for a very long time and then maybe you can
lose 50 pounds but you know what for most people
losing 50 pounds is actually going to be easier than
losing 5 and that's because the goal the aspirational component
of this goal the vision of the goal is more
inspiring and more motivating when there's something juicy to it
something juicy behind it when your goal is incremental when
it's small when it's not very significant then your brain
is not going to get activated to actually start to
make the changes that are necessary to create that goal
and then to sustain that goal that's why so many
people have these little yo-yo diets where they lose five
pounds drop five pounds and they just keep doing that
back and forth because it's very hard to motivate yourself
to lose five pounds you can't register five pounds no
one's gonna see you being 5 pounds lighter you're not
gonna get any compliments you're not gonna look much sexier
by losing 5 pounds if you lose 50 pounds you
can imagine all the sudden wow that that can really
have a big effect on my life you can imagine
whom I'm gonna look totally different in my photos and
I'm gonna I'm gonna be much more energetic and I'm
gonna also have more options with the opposite sex so
my dating lines gonna get better my sex life is
gonna improve so all these factors now start to come
into your mind and now you're you're like wow you
know I can actually do this sure it's gonna take
some work but you know what I cannot I can
see that the the outcome is gonna be worth it
and so that's what a big goal is setting a
big goal so many people make the mistake of of
laying it up and saying well I can't lose 50
pounds or like well I can't start a million dollar
business or well you know I'll set some sort of
goal but I don't want to set a big goal
because if I set a big goal then there's a
chance that I won't be able to to to realize
it and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
size little goal with the hope that I can realize
that it's not so ambitious well the problem with that
strategy is that when you send a little goal you
run an even greater risk of not achieving it because
you're not even get activated to go and try it
it's going to be so and motivating to you the
biggest problem you have is complacency it's not over ambition
so go ahead and shoot for being over ambitious rather
than under ambitious with your goals okay the third point
is right the goal down you have to write it
down if it's just in your head it's too loose
it's too vague it's still too vague even if you've
clarified it in your head you have to actually write
it down when you write it down there's something magical
that happens your brain registers it in a different way
plus it's there on paper so you can always refer
back to it which leads me to the fourth point
the fourth point was to review your goal on a
daily basis this is where people get it completely wrong
almost nobody does this I would say less than point
zero zero one percent of people who set goals will
actually review them on a daily basis and this is
the whole point of setting a goal you write it
down and then you look at it in the morning
in the evening at lunchtime whenever get a chance but
you have to look at it every single day until
it's accomplished you have to look at it review it
in your mind so it's always on the top of
your mind otherwise you're going to forget about it just
writing down some some lofty goal and then stuffing it
in your filing cabinet and never looking at it again
how is it gonna get realized I mean if it's
a very little goal that might work if it's a
goal that takes one day to accomplish that might work
but if it's a goal that takes a month or
six months or a year or five years to accomplish
which are what most significant and meaningful goals are like
then you're never going to accomplish that just by writing
it down once and then stuffing it in your drawer
somewhere you get to read it again and again and
again and the fifth point the last point is that
your goal has to be aligned with your values this
is a bit of a deeper topic that is hard
to go into here because I just want to keep
this focused on the goal-setting process but you have to
know your values I have other videos that talk about
value identification discovering who you really are what is most
meaningful to you in life when you discover that when
you know your life purpose and you know what your
values are I help people do that through coaching but
when you figure that out and you know exactly what
your top ten values are then your goals need to
be aligned with that right whatever your top values are
your goals have to match up with it because if
they don't what's gonna happen I found this a lot
in my own life is that you're gonna go out
and you're gonna start to do stuff and I'm gonna
set various goals for yourself and those goals are not
gonna be grounded in anything important they're mostly gonna come
from just random ideas that you get from society maybe
you see something on TV and all the sudden you
get some idea to go lose some weight or you
see some some friend of yours driving a nice car
and you get this idea that oh I'm you know
I need a nice car too and you go out
there and you start doing this stuff and it doesn't
fulfill you and so then the whole goal setting process
breaks down because you see yourself creating these goals but
then you see that the goals are not fulfilling you
and so you stop setting goals and the reason that's
happening is because you're setting goals that are not aligned
with what you really want in life and the reason
that is is because you're not clear about what you
wanted life so first clarify what you want then start
to create goals that align with it that's gonna be
the last point that's really really critical and as a
as a final wrap-up here before I leave you what
I want to mention as the last real point is
is the fact that your goals no matter how good
you get with this goal-setting process you have to be
okay with the fact that not all of your goals
are going to get accomplished and that's not a failure
on your part per se it's actually a good thing
you don't want every single one of your goals to
get accomplished there's a reason that this goal-setting process kind
of happens the way it does is because if you
could just instantly get everything that you wanted it wouldn't
be actually healthy for your life what's better is to
to go through this process and to set goals set
lots of goals create lists of goals and then as
you're working towards and you're gonna start to see like
okay so to accomplish this goal right here I'm gonna
actually have to go and like put in a lot
of money a lot of energy a lot of time
a lot of effort a lot of emotional labor you
know what I realized that that's not actually something I
want to do so then you cross it off you
don't need that goal anymore that wasn't a really genuine
goal for you then you go on to the next
goal and you say oh you know what this go
yeah it's gonna be I can see how this is
gonna take months of work and it's gonna be very
difficult and it's gonna maybe cost me some money but
you know what even if all those costs are analyzed
I still want that goal that's still important to me
and see there what happened was that you saw the
cost of the goal and you actually maybe even went
out and tried to try to make it happen in
one place or another and then you saw like oh
you know what this is harder than I thought it
was but it's still worthwhile right this is how you
grow yourself to sell you discover yourself is when you
kind of push your boundaries and you start to actually
see the costs of your goals because every goal every
meaningful goal has a cost you're not just gonna go
and build a business with no cost you're not gonna
create a relationship with no cost you're not gonna create
the kind of health you want with no cost you're
not gonna improve your psychology and your it of your
negative thinking with no cost there's always some sort of
cost and don't make them if they mistake of thinking
that that has to be money many times it's not
money and money is actually an easy cost to pay
the harder costs are the emotional labor costs that are
involved you know the emotional labor involved with losing weight
or admitting to yourself that you suck in relationships they
have to improve their or starting to introspect and get
rid of your negative thinking and your anxiety these kinds
of things these are much harder and it would be
so nice if we could just pay a little bit
of money to get that problem fixed but ultimately you
can't pay someone to to do that for you as
Jim Rohn says you can't pay someone to do your
push-ups for you you have to do them yourself and
so realize that if you're making lists of goals and
you're very ambitious person for example me you know I
literally have lists that have 50 hundred goals on them
for the year but invariably you know that your passes
and I realize that only about 20% of them get
accomplished the other 80% they never do even though my
goals aren't specific they're big and they're important to me
I feel like they are at the moment when I
write them down eventually what I find happens is that
there's this kind of sifting process that happens and the
weaker goals they get sifted out and nothing no action
gets taken on them but those top 20% those are
the ones you really want to focus on right those
are the ones that are big and that you're gonna
have motivation to do so as you're making these lists
that's okay don't beat yourself up for not accomplishing everything
you know have to be perfect you won't be in
fact it's a good thing because if you're accomplishing everything
on all your lists that means you're not prioritizing your
time effectively you want to be focusing your time on
those top 20% of the goals that you have that
are really gonna make a big meaningful impact on your
life so that's a totally good way to to work
the goals and to to work them throughout the year
all right so this is what I have to say
about goal-setting follow these points and you're going to have
really really powerful effective goals not just New Year's resolutions
but you can do this throughout the entire year all
