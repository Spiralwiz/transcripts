hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I want to talk about low self-esteem in women
all right let's talk about low self-esteem especially low self-esteem
in women so I have another video that I'm gonna
link down below it's called self esteem that's kind of
my fundamental introductory video about what self esteem is and
I go into a lot of depth there about the
details of self-esteem here I'm not going to do that
I'm more interested in the question of why do women
tend to have more self-esteem issues than men do to
me that was curious and I started to look into
that and ask myself questions about why this is and
I want to share some of my thoughts there with
you so that you can get more understanding if you're
a woman about where this is coming from and maybe
even if you're a man and you have women in
your life that had this problem you can also understand
where they're coming from so to get this discussion grounded
we need to talk a little bit about self-esteem I'm
just gonna do a recap of the definition of self-esteem
self-esteem has two components to it you've got self-efficacy and
self-respect self-efficacy simply means that you have the ability to
think and direct your own life so it's how much
power do you feel you have over the circumstances in
your life that's self-efficacy and some respect is believing that
you have inherent value in yourself and you have a
right to be happy so when you have both of
these components working together then you have high self esteem
if either one of these components is malfunctioning or both
of them are eroded then you have very low self
esteem now what it didn't find is that women struggle
with self-esteem more than men this is a generalization this
doesn't mean a woman can't have high self-esteem this doesn't
mean that there aren't women who have much higher self-esteem
than men it's certainly the case many men have self-esteem
issues but with women it tends to be more of
a problem and for them not only is it a
problem on the inside it does that manifest itself in
a problem on the outside in dysfunctional relationships this tends
to create a certain level of codependency and it makes
you an unassertive doormat and then basically mint and walk
all over you so why is this happening if it's
happening to you how can we get an understanding of
why this is happening with women well I think if
you look at this definition self-efficacy self respect the self-advocacy
part especially this is your ability to control and direct
life well how is that developed well the way that's
developed in boys and in girls is a little bit
different so let's take a look at some of the
cultural underpinnings here I think the culture has a lot
to do with why this this disparity exists so when
a boy is growing up in our culture then he
is told to do what as parents they put him
into sports and other aggressive activities the boys told that
he's gonna have a career in a business and he
needs to make money and he needs to provide for
his future family potentially and so the boys always taught
to compete to fight that's a very masculine type of
energy right that competitive kind of competitive fighting that men
do with each other so that's going on with the
boys with the girls what's happening well it's not quite
the same right you don't have those sorts of pressures
put on them it's more about being nurturing and loving
and being girly and then putting that and investing it
into a relationship into a family so women are more
about relationships and Families not so much about going out
there and conquering the world although there are many women
that are good at that and so I'm in no
way discouraging it or saying that there's anything wrong with
it but that just tends to be the general trend
right well what happens if you're always exerting this masculine
energy and you're always out there kind of pushing the
boundaries of the world what do you think happens to
you well what happens is that you encounter challenge you
encounter resistance and if you've got this kind of motive
to just like bust bust bust bust through it then
you learn a lot and you learn fast this is
how rapid learning happens is you immerse yourself you throw
yourself into a tough situation then you have to just
kind of struggle your way out this is for example
how a military boot camp works right you take a
Grunch recruit who knows nothing about the military has no
discipline you throw him into a couple-week boot camp and
all of a sudden he comes out like a real
like a real go-getter a real soldier right and why
is this happening because he's put under enormous enormous pressure
and he learns very very fast the mine is extremely
good at learning when it's under pressure now the human
being and the human mind is is the opposite when
it's not under pressure he tends to kind of doze
off and be a little lazy and tends to backslide
and so here's what's going on I think this is
what's happening is that with boys are out there competing
all the time so they develop a very strong sense
of self-efficacy because you know they're trying stuff they're failing
they're they're learning how the world works and they get
like a real sense of ownership over the world they
feel like they have the world by the balls with
a woman it's not quite so much I mean women
do that on their own terms and some women are
out there doing masculine type things and that will build
them self-efficacy but then a lot of women aren't doing
that a lot of women are playing second fiddle to
somebody else in their life whether it's to the family
or to the man in her relationship and so he's
all she's always playing second fiddle or taking the backseat
as it were and he's the one driving and so
when this tends to happen and it happens for long
periods of time what happens is that your brain literally
starts to turn to mush it starts to kind of
atrophy it's kind of like muscles if you don't use
your muscles they atrophy and that's what's happening and your
self-efficacy erodes because when you're not out there challenging yourself
and doing stuff if you're sitting at home if you're
locked up if you're cooped up if you're not really
out there in the world living on your edge then
you're like really in your comfort zone and that tends
to build a very very big rut and as that
rut is building your self-efficacy is eroding and eroding and
eroding and you feel like you can't really control the
world you feel like you become a victim so that
is I think that's like the underlying thread here is
that this is what's going on I think also there
are some physiological differences right so this is not just
purely cultural conditioning there's biological differences so it's more natural
for a man to go out there and compete that's
masculine energy for a woman being in relationships and being
submissive that's also more natural that's feminine energy and and
you can see how that can lead to certain disadvantages
I mean guys have their own set of disadvantages that
they have I'm not talking about that here I'll have
other videos about that here we're just focusing on women
so this is the disadvantage with with being with being
very feminine like that and being very submissive is that
you tend to take the backseat they don't have a
lot of control you feel like you're a victim and
stuff if stuff isn't going your way then you just
tend to tolerate it that tends to be your coping
strategy it's just like tolerant tolerating and baring it and
just kind of like suffering through it whereas a man
tends to like not put up with that as much
so part of that is the physiology women are more
compassionate more nurturing and these are amazing qualities but they
also have some disadvantages there's also amazing qualities that men
have that also have their own disadvantages so every strength
tends to have also kind of a little weakness behind
it it's like two sides of the same coin and
so for women I think is especially challenging because they
need to on the one hand maintain their femininity that's
important to a woman a feminine woman feels like authentic
self so that's important but at the same time this
femininity it can't just be like this passive do whatever
you will with me out there and be a doormat
it needs to be more like I'm still on my
edge I'm still doing my own things but I'm doing
them in a feminine way you have to be as
a woman active and confident and out there living your
edge but in a feminine way do it in a
way that feels natural to you as a woman not
the way a man would but if you do that
then you will build up that self-efficacy too you just
need to be constantly pushing yourself a challenging yourself in
your own ways and that might be very different than
they would be for a man maybe for you that's
really like working on the family working on the relationship
doing whatever feminine things that you like to do but
like still pushing yourself in those areas don't just become
very passive when you could become very passive and meek
then that's what starts to make that actually process happen
and when that's happening then that leads to all sorts
of problems most importantly it could lead to dysfunctional relationships
it's gonna create codependency it's gonna create this cycle of
bad relationships so it's going to make you feel very
powerless in your life and that's not what we want
for you here at actualise org it's all about self
actualization and for women self actualization is equally as important
as it is for a man because that's where those
higher feelings you know that's where those higher values of
yours are as woman yours are just gonna be different
than man's and that's alright but you got to make
sure that you're always on the edge always pushing your
comfort zone always growing that is what's the key all
