Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this video,
I want to ask the question of whether personal development
is actually necessary to becoming successful? Or do the most
successful people not even use personal development? The question that's
been on my mind lately is whether personal development is
actually something that successful people use to achieve their success.
And if it's actually not, like, I want to take
a no bullshit, look at this, if it's actually not
the case, that successful people that we see that earns
lots of money, they get the fame and the power
and create powerful lives for themselves that they don't use
personal development, then in what sense? Is it right for
me to be up here, espousing the benefits of personal
development, when these people get their success without using these
techniques without following these, these kinds of principles without studying
this stuff? Because honestly, look, this stuff takes a lot
of your time and effort to be watching all these
videos. And beyond that, to be going out there trying
these different exercises that I have, you do sometimes, you
know, maybe meditating or journaling, or one of the other
exercises in my videos, or going out there reading lots
of books, you know, this is a investment of your
resources, and time and energy and effort. And this is
not always easy work. So in the back of your
mind, there's always this question of, is this really paying
off for me? And is there a better and easier
way to do it? Because honestly, I mean, I'm not
here, proposing self help, just for the sake of self
help. If there's a quicker, easier way to get there,
let's use that approach. So let's take a look at
that. Is self help necessary? on first blush, I mean,
what what comes to mind as people like Justin Bieber,
like Justin Bieber, he's a successful guy. He's got celebrity
status. Now you might live laugh at that and say,
Well, Justin Bieber, he's like a bad example. But I
mean, you have to ask yourself these kind of questions.
You've got a lot of people in society that you
see especially portrayed in the media, celebrities, musicians, actors, famous
business people. So you've got a lot of these people
out there. And they're the ones that we usually say
that, okay, that's clearly a successful person. Now, the question
is, does that person use self help? And I would
have to say that no, probably many of those people
don't use selfhelp. Not in the kind of deliberate sense
that we're using it here, where we're very consciously sitting
down, and strategizing, and like going deep and introspecting. And
doing all this kind of work. I would say that
most of the time, people don't do it. Now, of
course, it's a little dangerous to talk about these people,
because we don't know their lives intimately. And I mean,
what do I know about Justin Bieber, I know very
little about him. I don't know much about him. But
I'm guessing if we just take the kind of stereotypical
idea that we have in the zeitgeist about how Justin
Bieber lives his life, we're probably not thinking that he's
sitting there, studying Tony Robbins books, and meditating, and really
introspecting and, you know, doing all this kind of like
deep inner work on himself. We're thinking that that's probably
not the way that he lives his life. Now, of
course, he's a young guy. So in some sense, maybe
that's, that's something that will come later in his life.
But still, it's interesting to ask yourself and to think
about, you know, well, if he can be successful doing
it his way, why am I spending all this time
doing it Leo's way, or doing it the self help
way, or Tony Robbins his way or whoever else you'd
like to follow in the, you know, in self help.
And beyond Justin Bieber, you know, we can take a
look at people like Elvis, Kurt Cobain, Robin Williams, these
are all very successful people. We can take a look
at people like Steve Jobs. Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Richard
Branson, of virgin. Also, you know, people through history successful
people like Howard Hughes, Pablo Picasso, Walt Disney, Rupert Murdoch.
I mean, you name it, you can rattle off a
list of hundreds of people. And what's interesting is that
if you actually go and study these people, you'll find
out that they had really screwed up dysfunctional lives. A
lot of them did. Not all of them. Like I
don't think that Bill Gates has a dysfunctional life. I
think that he has actually a very even keeled emotionally
mature, healthy, kind of a psychologically healthy lifestyle. But a
lot of the people on this list, they have very
turbulent, inner turbulent lifestyles are turbulent too. That's why you
see a lot of times celebrities, getting into fights, getting
DUIs, getting drunk getting caught withdraw. Dogs or hookers or,
you know, like all this kind of stuff goes on.
And it's well known in the celebrity tabloids. And a
lot of that stuff is true. And that's actually very
interesting because what happens is these people, they achieve success.
And they achieve fame and they achieve power. And they
achieve a lot of recognition status in society. But then
it's like their psychology isn't mature enough to handle it.
Now, this isn't true across the board, there are many
actors and celebrities, and musicians who are very even keeled
and nicely grounded. And you admire those, when you're seeing
an actor being interviewed, for example, you know, on one
of the late night shows, or on Charlie Rose, or
on CNN or somewhere, you can tell if they're kind
of like an all over the place psychologically immature human
being, or they're like a very grounded human being. They
actually go out there, they study stuff, they read books,
they're intelligent, beyond the fact that they got some success
with their movies or whatever. And not just intelligent, not
just book smarts, but also it's that emotional intelligence. It's
the IQ and not the IQ, the EQ, right EQ
for emotional intelligence. Well, it's that have they developed it?
Have they developed mastery over their own emotions, over their
own thought patterns? Have they worked out stuff from their
childhood in their past that holding them back? It's really
interesting. It's interesting, I actually I read a, I read
a whole book that was written by one psychologist who
went through and he profiled, I believe it was like
15, or 18, great, successful, powerful people throughout history. And
he took a look. And one of the and he
gave like a mini, bio quick bio of every, every
one of these people. What was interesting was that a
lot of these people had the most dysfunctional lives, you
could possibly imagine that they were still successful. They were
earning lots of money, they were millionaires, or even billionaires.
How could this be? Well, I think one thing that
we, we just assume we take for granted when we
start this personal building journey is that success and happiness,
that those are correlated. And then if you get success,
happiness will come along with it. Well, in fact, that's
not the case. And in fact, there actually is no
correlation between success and happiness. There are many people in
society who are extremely, extremely successful, but have the most
screwed up lives, the kind of lives that they might
seem kind of cool. On the surface, they might seem
glamorous, when you're not actually in that person's shoes. So
it might seem cool, like, oh, that celebrity, he gets
to go on tour, travel around the world and perform
on stage, like all this stuff. But then when you
actually go and like take a microscope, and take a
look at what's going on in that person's life. And
you actually examine the feelings and the emotions, that person
is feeling the kind of thoughts he or she is
having, you discover that it's like, Oh, damn, like, there
was no way that I would want to be that
person. Even if that meant getting millions of dollars, and
getting to travel around the world, which seemed nice and
glamorous. But inside this person was so dysfunctional, that you
would never want to actually be him. And of course,
this person, if you give him a self help book,
he's going to wipe his ass with it, he's not
going to care, right? Self Help throw it away. Now,
that kind of attitude, that's the kind of attitude that
well, it's the difference between just kind of like, Fly
By Night success, and deliberate and conscious success, the way
that we're creating it here for ourselves. Here's how I
see it. Basically, some people they succeed in spite of
themselves. Whatever it was, you know, we've got a population,
that's hundreds of millions, several billion people out of that
population, inevitably there's going to be a couple of people
that have you know, the right circumstances a line, maybe
they've got a little talent that challenges nurtured when they're
very young, they get a lot of practice and they
become a good musician, good performer, maybe their their parents
really encouraged them, where they really push them to do
whatever they want to do, and they become really good.
Like they master one thing, and that's tends to be
the case with with a lot of these people is
that they, they focus on a master one thing, whether
they become a really good singer, or a really good
musician or really good stock trader, or whatever it is
that they like they focus in and they put all
their chips into that one basket. And success comes sometimes
it's well deserved success, sometimes a little bit accidental, you
know, maybe like with a with like a child actor,
they just kind of get discovered accidentally, of course, they
work really hard for it to I'm not saying that
these people just landed their success by luck. That's almost
never the case. But I think what might be a
lucky factor in all this is that these people are
lucky to succeed in spite of The screwed up psychologist
they have. So maybe they're immature, maybe they don't know
how to handle money. They don't know how to deal
with addictive behaviors. They don't know how to weed out
negative habits. They have bad traumatic childhood experiences. And so
all these things, these are things that we would say
in personal development terms, that this is going to rob
you of your performance in life. Now, that's kind of
naive to say that because you can point to examples,
especially like with musicians, or like really artistic people, where
you can say, well, this person has such a screwed
up life. You know, he's like a, he's a total
deadbeat alcoholic. And he's a bad father. And he's really
mean to people. And he's abusive, and he has fits
of anger. But he writes the most brilliant novels. Or
this musician here, she's really bad with money. And she's
really bad with her relationships. But she's selling like multi
platinum albums, and she's touring across the country. What's going
on there? Well, in fact, if you just want success,
if that's all you care about, and you define success
as money, and fame, which is generally what we think
when you think about success, if that's what you define,
and also maybe like, being really well, well established in
your industry or in your career. So if we decided
the find success is that, well, you can achieve that
and still be really deeply dysfunctional on the inside. So
when you see these kinds of people, your mind might
make the argument that, well, these people are doing pretty
good, even though they're not doing self help. And it's
true, they probably aren't doing self help. But also, you
got to take a look at the longer view and
the bigger view. So when you're looking through that TV
screen, this person for that 30 seconds that you're looking
at him or her, they seem like they've got everything
together. But that's like a very fake, artificial little flame
that you're looking at their life through. In fact, you
don't really know what it's like to be that person.
And I can bet you for these people who have
these dysfunctional neurotic tendencies in their life, and they haven't
worked them out. These people's lives are miserable, you can
be very sure of that. And, you know, take examples,
take a look at someone like Elvis Presley. Take a
look at someone like Cobain. Take a look at someone
like Robin Williams. Now, these people these are successful, known
iconic figures in popular culture. But when you read their
biographies, and you take a look at like what actually
went on in their lives, while you see how dysfunctional
they were. We all know about Elvis is binging and
his inability to control his his addictive behavior. I mean,
he was a really talented person, he earned millions of
dollars. He was he was basically adored by the entire
by the FBI entire world. And yet he couldn't resist.
He couldn't resist eating a 5000 Calorie sandwich with bacon
and cheese and grease and all this like nasty stuff.
And basically he died because of that. He paid for
it with his life. Take someone like Kurt Cobain overdosed
on drugs. Also a very like dysfunctional figure, even though
well respected and loved for his music, and his talents
in music. So see there what's going on. You've got
someone who's really developing a talent and I'm not I
don't like using the word talent because it makes it
seem as like, oh well. Elvis Presley was born a
great singer Kurt Cobain was born a great singer. I
don't think that I think that they worked really hard
to achieve that. But see what they did. They just
put all their chips into that one basket, the rest
of their life was highly unbalanced and dysfunctional, and that
ultimately caught up with them and led to their demise.
Same thing with like someone like Robin Williams, or take
a look at people further back in history, you can
take a look at, for example, read the biography of
Howard Hughes. Or take a look at Pablo Picasso's life.
Or I like to look at Walt Disney. Walt Disney
is a great example of someone who very creative, you
would think he's like a creative genius. And he had
this this imagination that was amazing, the imagination of a
kid. And he was so persistent. He embodied the qualities,
a lot of the qualities that we espouse in personal
development, it at the same time, there were stuff in
his life that just was very dysfunctional. For example, His
relationship with money, he's an ability to, to hold on
to money he was struggling through with money throughout the
entirety of his life, always, even when he was making
millions from his movies and other stuff that he was
doing with Disney because of just the way that he
handled money. It wasn't really good his his basically his
vision and his dreams always outstripped his his funding. So
that led to constant struggle and tension all Always in
his life. Also, he was like a chronic chain smoker
and drinker that ultimately caught up to him. That's why
he died. He died of cancer, I believe. And so
see, it's things like this, when you just focus on
one area of someone's life, it seems like oh, they're
amazing, like this kind of amazing, creative genius. But actually,
if you take a look at his whole life, you
probably wouldn't want to live that yourself. So I see
this tendency, and it's important not to get thrown off
track by this and discouraged by this and tell yourself
something like, well, these people for them, it's so easy.
Why does have to be so hard for me? Actually,
no, it's, it's not like that, because you're comparing apples
and oranges. See that person? It's easy for him because
he's not doing anything to work on himself. So yeah,
and that sounds, it's easy. But where's that going to
lead him ultimately, and he might be super successful now.
But where's that going to leave him ultimately, for a
lot of these people, it literally leads them to their
graves. That's what it does. Or if it doesn't anticipate
that catastrophic. And this is something that's even less visible,
is that they just suffer silently, and live very miserable
lives. And you can see that with a lot of
celebrities. And actors, too, if you read their biographies, and
you read kind of their interviews that they that they
do, and they talk, they talk about more of their
private lives and their details, you see that a lot
of them live very miserable and dysfunctional lives. So, in
a sense, these people are lucky. They're lucky because they
succeed, despite their dysfunctions. Now, you got to ask yourself,
Is that what you want? Is that how you want
to live your life? Is that how you want to
succeed in your life? Do you want to succeed only
in one little, small area that looks really nice on
TV. But when you're actually living it, it doesn't feel
nice? It doesn't feel right, it feels miserable and stressful
and very dramatic. Do you want that drama in your
life? If you're okay with that, that, hey, you know
what, if all you want is money and fame, and
you want to go out there and earn it and
achieve it, you can go do that. And you could
ignore a lot of this stuff. Maybe you'll succeed, I
actually think that there's a good chance that you won't
succeed, but because what will happen is and I think
that's what happens for most people, most people they get
brought down by their neuroses before they can even reach
that high level of success that some of these celebrities
and actors attain. So for every one, Elvis Presley, or
Kurt Cobain, that overdoses at the height of his career,
there's probably 1000s that we will never hear about, you
know, 1000s of artists, performers, singers, musicians, that never even
get to any kind of level of recognition or status
or wealth, because their frailties bring them down much earlier.
You know, and the most common example is that you
know, what, people who don't do personal development are just
so goddamn lazy and complacent in life. They don't even
have the energy to get themselves up in the morning
to go work to become good at singing or acting
or whatever else. They don't have the persistence to do
it. Some people kind of get that naturally from their
environment. I don't know if they're born with it, I
think that what happens is that just you know, Adam,
like I said, the billions of people that exist, inevitably
there's going to be a couple 100 Or a couple
1000 That just, you know, grow up with a with
a good work ethic, or are really passionate about music.
So they go on, they put a lot of their
energy learning music. But see, is that you you got
to ask yourself, Is that me? Because if that's not
you, then how are you going to engineer your own
success, you have to have a plan for yourself. And
this is where I think that self help and personal
development is actually a really good idea. And probably the
best strategy and the best shot that you've got at
becoming successful. You know, if you're as successful as I
mean, if you're as skilled a musician as Kurt Cobain,
you're a talented a singer as Elvis Presley. You know,
go ahead and go and seize the bull by the
horns and take your success. But you're probably not that
are you? You're probably a bit complacent. You're probably not
a master of anything. Extraordinary. In the world, you're probably
not the world's greatest singer. You're probably not the world's
greatest musician. You're probably not the world's greatest mathematician. You
have to work towards that. If you want it. If
you want to work towards it, and if you've got
problems with money, that's going to hold you back. If
you've got problems with anger, that's going to hold you
back. If you've got a problem with bad habits like
smoking or drinking, that'll hold you back. If you're depressed,
that'll hold you back. If you're eating such horrible food,
that you're feeling sluggish and low energy all the time,
that's going to hold you back. If you have health
problems that's going to hold you back. If you don't
know how to run a business, that's going to hold
you back. If you don't know how to maintain relationships,
both intimate ones, and friendships, and business relationships, that's going
to hold you back. If you don't develop a strong
work ethic that hold you back, if you don't figure
out how to cope with procrastination, and waning motivation, that'll
hold you back. If you don't deal with your childhood
issues, with your parents, and your siblings, all that stuff,
all that nonsense from the past, it's still churning around
in your brain, and is causing you to believe all
sorts of weird things about the way life works, that
will hold you back. If you don't understand the difference
between success and happiness, that will also hold you back.
There's a lot of pitfalls that you will fall into
if you don't study this material, which is I think,
why it's really important to study it. And it's almost
like you can imagine this metaphor, like we've got a
landmine ahead of us a giant landmine we'd walk five
miles to a landmine, a landmine field. And, and I
tell you, Okay, go, you're walking five miles for this
field of landmines. Now, if we have a million people,
and I tell them all to go go, inevitably, a
few of them are gonna, just by fluke luck, run
through all the mines and survive. But do you want
to take that chance, because it's your life, you've only
got one of them. You don't care about other people,
you only care about yourself? No, you don't want to
take that chance. So in this case, you want to
get all the metal detecting equipment that you can get.
And that's kind of what I see person development as
metal detectors, you get a bunch of them all different
kinds for detecting all kinds of different landmines that are
potentially out there in the field of life that you're
going to be walking through. And there's a lot of
them, you've got landmines in relationships, you've got landmines, with
your finances, with business with handling success and fame with
happiness, lots of lots, lots of different landmines. And we're
tackling one of them here, which is this distinction, confusion
between success and happiness. That's one big landmine, a lot
of celebrities, it seems like they think they're gonna they're
gonna get success and money. And then that their, their
inner psychology will just naturally take care of itself. Well,
it doesn't. In fact, when you get lots of money
and success, and fame, what that does is it puts
your psychology to the test, because all of a sudden,
you don't have that many limitations anymore. You don't need
to go to work. No one's forcing you to do
this. You don't have to do that. You've got enough
money to literally construct the kind of life you want
a lot of people what they do is they construct
this very shallow, miserable existence, and they just like cage
themselves, and they pursue the things in life that they
think are like amazing, but actually what they are, they're
very shallow and unfulfilling. So this is why I think
that self help is a really good strategy. And I
think that it's important that your strategy is sustainable. And
it's also about becoming a well rounded human being. Notice
that these people that fail catastrophically, people that commit suicide,
stuff like this, they don't have well rounded lives. And
the biggest thing they're missing is the psychology component. Psychology
isn't right, there is neurosis in there, and then neurosis
leads to their downfall. So, self help is really about
fixing that neurosis, pre empting it, not letting it ruin
your life. So I think self help is really good.
And even though it is, I think, artificial, I don't
think it's natural to be doing self help. Most people
don't do self help. You know, people in Amazon, they're
not walking around with the self help book. They're living
life by the seat of their pants. And that's fine.
But I don't like that because it's like, it's out
of my hands, right? Too much chance too much randomness.
I don't like to have too much chance and randomness
in my life. Because I've only got one of them.
I don't care about millions of other people. I care
if I succeed, I don't care if I'm that, you
know, I don't want to be that hoping to be
that one lucky statistic. I want to make sure that
my success is like locked in stone. And so for
me, that's why personal development is so important. That's why
stuff like meditation is so important. And journaling, and eating
right, and working on your relationships and all this kind
of stuff. Because these will be landmines that you will
deal with whether you want to or not, you're going
to come across those. Just be careful not to get
caught in the mental masturbation effect of personal development. I
think this is where there can be a really good
argument to say well, you know what, what about just
going out there and like, acting instead of Instead of
sitting here and theorizing, reading all these books Leo, why
don't I just be a person of action, a man
or woman of action, I'll go out there, and I'll
just act, I'll do it, you know, instead of talking
about, I'll just do it. Whatever needs to be done,
I'll do it. And actually, you know what, I think
that if you can take that attitude, that's a really
great attitude. That might, in fact, be the best strategy.
Because if you just lock yourself in a room, reading
all these self help books that will produce a mental
masturbation effect. And you will feel like you've got all
these amazing ideas, but then you're not getting any success
in your life. Even though you think that you read
all the stuff, you're like, you're knowledgeable, but that knowledge
doesn't guarantee success, because success requires action taking. And that's
one of those things that some of these celebrities and
actors are really good at. Maybe they're they don't know
exactly, you know, all these theories and concepts and principles
and techniques. But actually, what they have is they have
this kind of intuitive ability to go out there and
take action. And they also have kind of an intuitive
understanding of psychology. And that serves them really well. And
if you just compare, let's say, one person, person A,
who locks himself in a room for two years, and
read self help books, and then Person B, who doesn't
read any self help books at all, but just goes
out and takes action every single day, which one of
those is going to be more successful. And by success,
I mean, more money, more fame, more status, it's definitely
going to be person B, not person, a person name,
I know a bunch of good stuff, he might be
able to preach at you. But he's not going to
have anything to show other people to get success and
fame for because it's all in his head. Whereas this
person, he's actually been taking action. And even though he
might have been taking wrong actions, because he's been kind
of fumbling around not knowing the best practices. But in
the end, action is worth about 10 times more than
theory. Which is another reason I think, why we see
that some people become really successful just because they're really
good action takers. So be careful not to get caught
up in this mental masturbation effect. Another point that I'll
mention is that a lot of these actors and celebrities,
you see the arc in their life is that they
start off immature, with lots of problems, they're not able
to handle their success. And sometimes that literally kills them,
or drives them to depression or something really traumatic happens
as a result of that. But also, sometimes what happens
is that these persons be these people, you know, they
commit their mistakes, but they're on this kind of growth
curve. And over time, they're growing and they're learning. Maybe
they go take therapy, maybe they actually do go pick
up a self help book and read it. Maybe they
actually go do meditate, they take yoga, you see these
kind of transformations. And these are the actors, and celebrities
and business people who tend to then actually come out
on top. Because they're maturing, they're learning through that process.
And, you know, I'm sure that if you go and
you interview lots of older Hollywood actors, you're going to
see that actually, they've probably read quite a few self
help books by this point. I can't imagine that they
wouldn't. Because the stuff is helpful, these techniques are really
helpful. You know, practicing meditation is really helpful. It helps
you with your life, eating a healthy diet that helps
you with your life. I'd be surprised if some of
the older actors are eating much healthier than they were
20 years ago. I'd be surprised if they're not meditating.
I'd be surprised if they're not talking to their friends
about some of these psychological concepts and stuff. Because like
it's important, this stuff really helps you it helps to
optimize your life. So keep that in mind when you're
thinking about this stuff. Alright, this Leon signing off, these
are my thoughts about whether self help is artificial or
