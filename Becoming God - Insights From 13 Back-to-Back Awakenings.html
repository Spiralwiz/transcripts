and i am back oh man so conscious so much
more conscious than before 30 days of solo meditation my
30 day solo retreat let me tell you how it
went a lot of stuff has gone by man it
feels like a year really has gone by rather than
just a month and so much stuff happened so many
amazing insights in fact 13 awakenings each one deeper than
the previous one uh life transforming stuff it's hard to
even remember it all because it feels like i'm going
back to another lifetime just remembering all that and then
coming back into ordinary life and then integrating it all
which i've been doing over the last few days man
it's uh this has been the most productive month of
my entire life as far as my growth goes a
lot of amazing insights truckloads of insights you know pages
and pages of notes full of insights that i want
to share with you and in this episode here i'm
not going to be going into full depth on all
my insights it's just not possible there's too many of
them i'm going to be trying to just give you
a summary a nutshell of what happened over the last
month for me during the solo meditation retreat it's kind
of weird to even be shooting videos because i'm i'm
getting used to coming back to my old life my
old unconscious life and it's just if everything feels a
little bit different it's all the same but it also
feels a little bit different because i'm different so uh
what happened well it didn't quite go all according to
plan i improvised a lot but the first 16 days
of my retreat were pretty straight straight forward um like
any meditation retreat basically would be i spent about 10
12 hours a day doing sits uh mindfulness with labeling
technique do nothing technique self-inquiry so a combination of all
those uh struggled a lot uh was frustrated a lot
wasn't really getting the results that i wanted um extremely
bored you haven't you haven't known these levels of boredom
until you've done something like a 30-day solo retreat it's
just like boredom so thick that it's like death it's
like torture it's that bad um but of course all
that is part of the whole process of spiritually purifying
you so um so i did all that i didn't
have any awakenings during that time and then i felt
like i needed something more so i uh i turned
to 5mao dmt and uh and and then what i
did is i sort of resolved to finish the rest
of my retreat by doing back to back 15 days
i had like 14 15 days left of 5meo so
i wanted to really really test it out uh no
holds barred because in the past usually when i did
psychedelics what i would do is i would i would
place constraints on myself such as like well don't do
it too often don't do it too much the most
i did 5 meo um up until this retreat was
like four or five times in a row which means
daily so one per day for five days and that
was during my last uh 30-day retreat uh last may
and uh that was amazing i'd amaze a lot of
amazing uh insights from that and a lot of growth
from that but after the fifth day just it became
too much so i wanted to really put five meal
again to the test because i was trying to and
i was hoping that i could use 5meo to sort
of pioneer a new path towards awakening for people and
to kind of experiment on myself and just see how
far it can be pushed so that's what i did
and so i did uh i didn't end up doing
15 days i didn't i did 13 days back to
back five amio uh roughly in the 20 milligram range
so these were moderate doses they weren't super high doses
although for me i'm very sensitive to psychedelics for me
they were pretty uh pretty substantial doses so what started
happening immediately right off the bat because i was doing
this after already 15 days of uh intense meditation and
mindfulness practice is that my my trips became deeper than
they've ever been these were not like any other previous
trips i've taken and the most amazing thing started to
happen was which was that every trip that i took
produced a shocking profound level of consciousness superhuman levels of
consciousness that i never imagined were possible before and i've
done five amio you know dozens of times already over
the last two years um but even even so i
was blown away because the levels of absolute and totality
and insight that i was getting was just unspeakable and
unspeakable utterly shocking uh levels of of awakening and within
a few days it got to the point where i
was starting to feel like everything i thought i knew
about awakening was was peanuts compared to how deep i
was going now and i was starting to get the
sense that all of the people that i learned about
awakening from all of course all of my prior ideas
all my prior concepts all my prior trips and also
all the teachers that i follow various teachers dozens of
dozens of teachers from different traditions from yogis to to
western eastern you know hindu and and buddhist and all
this christian sufi like that all of that was just
like not at this level it just started to feel
like i was hitting levels of consciousness that very very
few human beings have ever hit and so some of
the insights that i'll be sharing with you here today
uh just keep in mind that they're coming from very
advanced superhuman levels of consciousness which are utterly impossible to
imagine they're completely beyond the mind completely beyond the self
and completely beyond many of the things that you'll read
about in spiritual texts and non-dual books um which is
not to say i'm not trying to say that i
reached some highest level of awakening that nobody has ever
reached i'm not saying that i'm just saying that these
levels of awareness i can just intuit and feel they're
very rare and so one of the most important lessons
that i learned from from these 13 awakenings of mine
is that there is enormous levels of depth and degree
to awakening and that any teacher or teaching that tries
to oversimplify awakening and tries to portray it as a
one-dimensional binary thing or even a thing that has three
stages or five stages or ten stages to it uh
hasn't really gone all the way because there's just so
much there and it's not that the awakenings are different
every time it's just that they have a different kind
of flavor and a different level of totality and what's
so amazing about it is that each one of the
awakenings feels total absolutely total but then the next one
feels even more total and the next one feels even
more total so you see the problem here how do
you know when you reach the end how do you
know when you really exhausted the rabbit hole how do
you know when you've really comprehended everything there is to
comprehend about awakening it's it's very tricky because it's very
easy to trick yourself into thinking that well the last
thing that i had that was total and now i'm
done and now we're good and now let's just kind
of go live with life now i understand everything but
you don't understand everything at least that's what i uh
encountered in my experience so um probably the third awakening
in um the most significant realization that i had was
that i am god i am god and uh of
course i'll be saying that a lot throughout this episode
and it's very easy to to misunderstand this for those
who haven't been doing this work very easy to misunderstand
this is some kind of narcissism or egotism or megalomania
not at all when i say i'm god i'm not
giving myself any special privileged position because when i say
i i simultaneously mean you so i am god you
are god i am you you are me it's all
one but to me i sort of have distilled the
highest essence of what the teaching of awakening is of
what non-duality is really about and it's not about discovering
that there is no self although that's important and that's
that's a big insight but it's about the realization that
you are god full-blown god like full-blown no holds barred
no qualifications you are the entire god not some part
of god not some little figment of god but like
full-on god and everything that the word god means you
are that so i'm not using the word god in
some sort of sneaky metaphorical poetic romantic manner like i
literally mean your [ __ ] god and that's what
awakening really is if you want to distill the essence
of what awakening is it's the realization that you are
god and of course uh i've told you that before
in the past in fact recently i released a few
episodes about what is god where we broke it down
in a lot of depth i answered lots of questions
uh i told you your god i said in the
past that i'm god that i realize that i'm god
and all of that is good and fine but it's
it's how deeply do you grasp it how true is
it really like do you understand it and feel it
at a cellular level is is the question that's the
real thing and i felt it before i've become conscious
of it before in various experiences using psychedelics and not
using psychedelics but not to this degree like i really
became god and i really realized the full mechanism and
structure and logic of god it's not that just you
understand that you're god but you also then can discover
what is god why is god why is it this
way why is reality structured this way all of this
i became conscious of throughout these 13 awakenings to the
point where i became so conscious just sitting here right
now that this present moment right now is eternal and
that i'm sitting here and that i am god and
i am willing the entire moment into being through my
infinite power and my infinite intelligence and will such that
my very hand and body and everything i literally became
conscious of how i'm creating everything how i'm creating my
hand using all of those attributes of god that we
talked about in the what is what is god part
one episode where i told you that god is infinitely
intelligent it's omnipresent it's all powerful it's benevolent it's all
loving it's eternal i told you all these attributes um
and it's it's it's good to know all those theoretically
and you can experience them individually but then to really
like to really have your entire identity shift from being
a human being who was born to a mother and
a father and who has some kind of biological origins
to go from that to understanding that that's not at
all what's going on there that's not at all how
it is and to really fully accept yourself as god
that's profound that's life transforming um and um and to
me any spiritual teaching any non-dual teaching that doesn't teach
you directly and explicitly that you are god is not
the highest teaching it's just that simple to me to
me the highest teaching is composed of i have a
list of notes here because there's way too much stuff
to talk about to to to remember all this to
me the highest teaching is that number one you are
god number two is that god is infinite and number
three is that god is nothingness those three parts comprise
high as teaching as i understand it and then to
explore all the facets and mechanics of god and to
understand how god works and why it works the way
it works that's the cream of the crop to me
because i love understanding stuff and of course people will
criticize me and say oh leo that's just ego you're
just using your mind to uh to talk about god
you can't understand god it's not possible there's no logic
to god there's no reason to god there's no reason
to under to why everything is things just are there's
no reason there's no why you're wrong there is there
is and that's what i've discovered and uh and some
of the things i've discovered i haven't heard anybody talking
about no spiritual teacher that i know of and i've
studied dozens of them perhaps over a hundred of them
has talked about in the way that i feel it
needs to be talked about and i don't know if
that's just because they're playing coy and because this stuff
you know it's impossible to really explain it it falls
on deaf ears so maybe they're just holding back i'm
sure many are holding back a lot of the highest
spiritual teachers do hold back a lot of stuff they
don't spill everything but i think it's a shame that
they hold it back and so i'm going to talk
about it here with you um let's see before we
get into that what else what else do i want
to say so yeah these awakenings they kept getting deeper
and deeper and deeper and deeper each one kept getting
deeper and deeper deeper i actually i had a chart
like a calendar where i was crossing off you know
every day and i was waiting till the 30th day
to complete this thing and so i was crossing them
off and then when i started doing my my 5meo
i started having these awakenings and i started to i
would put an x through the day that i finished
and then i would put a little circle if i
did five meow that day and i had an awakening
that day so there's a circle and then i i
did a couple of those circles and then i started
to to notice that i was drawing the circles bigger
and bigger and bigger because to me the circles were
representing the the size of the awakening so the circles
they were small at first and then they got bigger
and bigger and bigger until they were taking up the
entire square the entire square of that day um until
uh and then and then my awakenings got even deeper
and more profound to the point where the circle was
no longer appropriate so i was just taking the marker
i was using a whiteboard and i was taking the
marker and i was just filling the entire square of
the day just solid black for total awakening and then
even that was not total enough because my awakenings kept
getting more total and more more deep and so then
i started to actually have to go out of the
box and i drew this kind of like solid black
starburst that went outside the borders of the square of
the box and then those kept getting bigger and bigger
and bigger and bigger until i didn't know how to
depict it anymore that just gives you a little bit
of an idea of how this sort of totality works
it's very tricky because each one of them feels total
but then there's there's more and there's different facets that
you're experiencing as it's happening towards the very end the
last three or so awakenings just got to just to
such human levels superhuman levels of consciousness that like yeah
i honestly don't know if any other human beings have
had these levels of consciousness um i'm sure certain yogis
have um but these are the kind of yogis that
would be like sitting in a cave literally for 30
years doing non-stop yoga for 10 hours a day achieving
these stays and then like you would never hear about
them because they would never even go out in public
they would die in that cave in those states you
know they live their whole lives that way um so
another thing that i realized uh very quickly into into
this process with five meow is that there's there's no
way there's no way i'm ever going to be able
to meditate my way into these degrees of consciousness not
even close and self-inquiry just like not even close there's
no way i would have gotten to where i am
right now and realize the things that i did through
conventional uh traditional orthodox spiritual teachings and methods i'm talking
mindfulness meditation i'm talking do nothing i'm talking about uh
even korea yoga i'm like self-inquiry all of this is
fine i'm sure that all these techniques are powerful for
certain people and i'm sure that certain yogis and zen
masters who practice these techniques for 10 hours a day
for months and years um and who are also supernaturally
spiritually gifted from the very beginning they're spiritually talented don't
forget that that's important that they could access maybe some
of these states through these techniques but they're like i'm
just being totally honest um i would never have been
able to do it so if i sat for the
next three months meditating non-stop to the best of my
abilities i would not have been able to to become
conscious of the things that i became conscious of that's
how powerful fiber meow dmt is it is i'm just
stunned i'm just stunned at its power it's it's a
power um it's just amazing it's just amazing and no
other psychedelic um gives you this level of consciousness no
other i like lsd mushrooms whatever else you're doing nndmt
um no no not this level of clarity not this
level of consciousness sure you can realize god on lsd
and on mushrooms i've done that but not not like
this not like what i'm going to be talking about
not with such clarity not with such clarity so to
me it's the ultimate tool to me five of you
know tmt is just like there is there is no
other teaching that's higher you could read hundreds of books
the the buddha or christ himself could come back to
life and personally teach you one-on-one instruct you for 10
hours a day be your personal guru live with you
answer all of your questions for 10 years straight and
it would not be as powerful of a teacher as
a few troops of 5meo dmt done in the proper
way and that's extremely important it's not enough that you
just do some 500 dmt you got to do it
in the proper way and i'll be talking in the
future about what the proper way is because there's a
lot that i learned about what the proper way is
a lot of people do it improperly and that's why
they don't get the things that i'll be talking about
and also they just don't do it enough at this
point in my life i've probably done uh 35 upwards
of 40 trips and i'm not done i'm not anywhere
near done there's way more there to learn so to
me this is the ultimate tool for understanding reality if
you want to understand reality at the existential metaphysical ontological
level i don't know what better tool you could ask
for i don't know what more what more could you
want it's pure magic it's a pure magic pill now
of course that doesn't mean it solves all your problems
it doesn't mean it cures you of all your stuff
um it's it's a lot of hard work and in
fact of the 13 awakenings that i had on 5meo
there were two really interesting ones which were psychological more
than existential and metaphysical most of my insights and trips
are metaphysical and what i mean by that is that
for example i become conscious that i'm god i become
conscious of the the mechanics of how god works i
become conscious of infinite love or something like that these
are all existential metaphysical insights um but you can also
have very psychological trips the psychological trips are more about
personally about you and your own stuff your own shadow
your own neuroses you know the stuff that you might
go to therapy for the stuff that's holding you back
the stuff that you do personal development for that kind
of stuff um the stuff that causes you a lot
of suffering all your devil or selfishness all that stuff
right so all that stuff um well it tends to
be an obstacle for you realizing god so what started
happening is that the first five or six trips that
i did in awakenings that i had i was pure
enough to have those and they were metaphysical ones and
i was able to comprehend more and more of what
god is and that i'm god but then it got
to a point where i sort of i hid an
end to how far i could go with my metaphysical
understanding without addressing some of my psychological stuff and so
i had i had two trips on that front and
during those trips i i was made acutely aware of
my own inadequacies which are preventing me from further realizing
god and so those had to be dealt with right
in the middle of the trip and in fact the
entire trip was devoted just to showing me that and
so the first one of those was i just became
acutely aware of how much i lie and how inauthentic
i am and how untruthful i am and so this
was a trip all about learning about honesty and authenticity
so i had to my ego had to surrender its
its manipulations and lies and i just i became very
acutely conscious of how much i've been lying my entire
life just lies upon lies upon lies upon lies lies
to myself lies to other people and it's not just
i'm not just talking about black and white lies the
way you might think usually when i say lie you
think of something like well did you have sex with
that person you say no i didn't but actually you
did i mean obviously that's a lie but that's a
very black and white obvious lie i'm talking about very
subtle forms of lying that you do which feel and
take the form more of like exaggeration um people pleasing
uh just not being authentic holding yourself back kidding yourself
various kinds of fantasies that you have various attachments that
you have that you just aren't honest with yourself about
various ways in which you scheme and manipulate the machinations
that you that you architect as a devil so all
of that all the ways in which you're kidding yourself
all the sort of pleasant illusions that you cling to
which need to be let go so i became acutely
aware of that and i started to let go of
all those um and that ultimately leads to the path
of true authenticity to be truly authentic and to be
truly honest is important if you really want to realize
god and embody your realization because god is truth pure
truth so for you to be able to embody pure
truth you have to be truthful and honest and authentic
and it became very obvious to me why i lie
why anybody lies the only reason that you lie is
because you're afraid fundamentally you're afraid of death but uh
because all all fear boils down to fear of death
basically but uh but also more practically you're afraid of
all the consequences that telling the truth will have for
you in your ability to survive in the world so
that's why you learn to lie you learn to lie
in school you learn to lie in your family you
learn to lie in business you learn to lie in
marketing and advertising you learn to lie with the opposite
sex interacting with females and males in dating in relationships
and sexuality you learn to lie in all these circumstances
because your survival depends on it the ego depends upon
falsehood and lying to survive and truth is a dangerous
thing truth can get you killed but you see the
problem is that god is truth so you've got this
real kind of a clash between your survival needs and
all the lying that has to happen for you to
survive and all the fear that comes with needing to
survive and then the surrender of all that um and
the the letting go of all that so that you
can become god because god has no fear and so
because god has no fear it doesn't need to lie
it's totally truthful so that was a very big insight
that i had it wasn't just a theoretical insight it
was like at the at a cellular level for me
i was i was writhing around the floor for about
an hour holding my head just cringing uh in agony
at uh at becoming conscious of all all the lies
that i do and why i do it and that
was very cathartic and healing and as all that was
happening you might say well that was a bad trip
um it was immediately obvious to me why it was
happening and that it needed to happen and i didn't
really suffer through it per se i was in a
sort of agony um but there wasn't really any suffering
because i knew that this was just totally natural and
totally needed to happen it was just a purifying process
to to allow me to go to the next level
and sure enough the next day i had my biggest
awakening yet after that because i really sort of understood
at a cellular level that i need to be very
honest and authentic in ways that i that i hadn't
been before in the way that i communicate with you
in the way that i communicate with people all around
me and just even with myself in my teachings in
my thinking about the world about reality even in the
way that i write in the way that i walk
in the way that i talk just in every possible
way um and and so once once i understood that
then the next day i was able to have a
really mind-blowing metaphysical trip again i met going back to
the metaphysical trips where it wasn't personal at all but
i just became so conscious that i'm god to the
point where it was just like you uh i mean
this is just metaphorical here but like i was so
conscious that i'm god that you could have seen a
halo around my head it was that level of consciousness
like it was insane um i became so conscious that
i'm god that i i pulled off i stripped off
all my clothing completely naked and i was just sitting
on the carpet completely naked looking at my body god
looking at its own body for the first time for
the first time god really looked at its own body
and really understood how the entire body was created and
why it was created and the infinite beauty and intelligence
of this body and how it all works and that
was just stunning absolutely stunning and then even after that
i had further further awakenings so uh so that's that
now let me uh talk a little bit about um
about some of the deepest things that i understood about
awakening in god um before i go into that though
a couple of points of warning here so uh if
you're doing yoga korea yoga or meditation or self-inquiry continue
doing it all right so it might sound here like
i'm [ __ ] on those techniques and i'm saying
that they're pointless and bad that they won't get you
here um no i'm just saying that for me personally
for me personally i don't have that level of meditation
ability to reach these levels of consciousness and uh and
we're talking about uh very high levels of consciousness way
beyond simple awakening right like so if you imagine regular
awakening and there's like levels way beyond that um so
uh i'm not saying you should never do meditation i
still think they're important techniques especially for newbies and especially
if you have no alternative because what are you gonna
do i mean doing nothing not meditating not doing yoga
and not maybe having access to five mio dmt as
many of you don't i mean you're better off doing
some form of practice than nothing so keep doing your
practice don't get discouraged i'm just telling you that if
you start to play around with five tmt you'll discover
for yourself just how much more powerful it is than
all those techniques the things i'll be telling you right
now in a minute are levels of of total understanding
of the universe i totally understand the universe um as
arrogance that sounds that um even zen masters of 40
years of training i know zen masters who i've talked
to with 40 years of experience who do not understand
what i'm going to be telling you right now um
which is not to say that they're not awake i
think that they are legitimately awake there's just many degrees
of awakening okay and many degrees of comprehension and understanding
here so um this is not to [ __ ]
on anybody's work or any teachings it's it's simply to
tell you that um you know appreciate how much there
is here how deep the rabbit hole can go and
um and you know um very few human beings will
ever reach this deep unassisted by 5mao dmt so just
keep that in mind also keep in mind that you
know i'm using god the word god and various other
kinds of religious language here my my uh my teachings
are going to be taking on more of a religious
tone and uh for many newbies this is going to
be off-putting and it's going to sound like i've i've
gone batshit crazy or i've turned into some religious zealot
or i've become some born-again christian or something no i've
just become fully conscious that i'm god and and to
say anything less would be false i don't want to
play games with you i don't want to be coy
with you i don't want to play the sort of
zen master game where i'm i'm winking at you and
i'm i'm giving you koans and [ __ ] riddles
to think about no like let's just talk about it
as it is i'm god your god you can become
conscious of it it's not a belief so yeah there's
going to be some religious language here um and you
might wonder why that is well it's because when you
really fully start to awaken to god it feels like
a religious conversion where do you think that idea comes
from it's not like you just realize oh yeah i'm
god okay let's get let's get back to life as
usual no no no no this is completely life transforming
you've been you've been touched by god in a way
that it just like it it touches you to the
core um and it's like a religious conversion reality is
divine it's divine and it's good it's absolute divinity and
it's absolute goodness and you realize that and then you
you want to align your life with that that's what
awakening is really about it's not about becoming conscious of
some no self or some some emptiness i mean yeah
god is emptiness god is no self we'll be getting
that minute but um but uh but no like you
gotta you gotta really appreciate that your god you gotta
really appreciate it so that it touches you it transforms
you and then you'll understand all the religious language and
it'll all make sense you'll understand the passion of the
christ all this will start to make a whole lot
of sense that it didn't make sense before so if
you want to know how the entire universe works why
everything exists what everything is so of course i've told
you in the past that everything is absolutely infinity absolute
infinity so reality is an absolute infinite singularity it's an
infinite fractal right now as i'm sitting here i can
focus my attention on the fact that i am god
sitting inside of a fractal this fractal extends in all
directions to infinity forever the fractal that i'm talking about
is the form and you might say god is the
formlessness within which the fractal is occurring so you can
think of reality all of reality as an explosion frozen
in time because it's eternal it exists eternally so right
now as i'm sitting here i can become conscious that
i am god looking through these eyes there's no eyes
here really i am god looking at all of this
being all of this it feels like i'm literally in
heaven like god sitting up in his throne in heaven
this is just a metaphor so don't take this too
literally but it feels sort of like your god sitting
up in heaven looking down upon your own creation but
what you're looking down upon is not the earth or
human beings what you're looking down upon is precisely what
you're seeing right now this right here i'm sitting here
i'm looking at a couch i'm looking at a lamp
i'm looking at a chair i'm looking at a bookshelf
i'm looking at a tripod or whatever i'm looking at
whatever you're looking at right now that's your creation this
is heaven you're here it's infinite this moment exists for
infinity for eternity but you're not conscious of it right
now so but that's the way it is um and
so yeah so um so this body is your creation
you see and this place that you're sitting in this
room that you're sitting in is heaven this is what
heaven looks like see you've always thought that heaven was
some sort of uh airy fairy realm up in the
clouds with golden gates and and st peter sitting up
there in the with the pearly gates and all that
um see you've imagined this fantasy of heaven but you
don't realize that this right here is heaven this is
literally what heaven looks like but you say leo this
isn't heaven look at all the crap that goes on
in this in this world look at all the murder
and death and war and racism and hatred and mass
shootings and all this how could you say that this
is heaven see what you don't understand though about heaven
is that for you to truly be in heaven it's
not enough that you go to a physical location called
heaven and then everything there is peachy and there's no
murder and no evil that's a silly spirodamic stage blue
orthodox conception of heaven that's not how heaven works you
see the problem is is that your own mind gets
in the way of you recognizing that you're in heaven
so imagine the following scenario imagine that heaven was a
physical place up in the clouds and imagine you died
and you actually did go to heaven and you find
yourself in heaven but imagine that you kept your current
psychology as it is right now you know where you
criticize everything where you judge where you [ __ ]
where you moan where anything someone says offends you and
hurts you and you get uh you know you're trying
to survive and you're trying to get love and approval
and sex and money and all this so imagine if
you took that psychology which you presently have you took
your ego mind into heaven into a physical heaven what
would happen you would be in hell because heaven or
hell is not a physical location it's your state of
mind it's your ego so you see if we took
an egotistical person and put them into a physical heaven
you would think well they would be happy no they
wouldn't they would start to judge and criticize everything you
say no but leo but if everything was perfect there'd
be nothing to judge and criticize no no you don't
understand everything is perfect everything is perfect right now everything
has always been perfect there was never anything to judge
or to criticize it was always you it was always
your ego mind the whole time making all of it
up so you are literally in heaven right now and
you have been your entire life but because of your
ego mind because of your survival needs because of your
judgments and criticisms and your lack of awareness of the
fact that you are in heaven you've placed yourself into
hell you've constructed your own hell so imagine a scenario
where a person is in physical heaven but they don't
recognize it and people keep telling them hey dude you're
in heaven you're in heaven what are you complaining about
what are you crying what are you depressed about what
are you anxious about and the person keeps saying what
are you talking about this isn't heaven this is hell
what could you do with such a person god himself
could not convince this type of person that he's in
heaven because the person would not believe it because the
person is too busy criticizing and judging everything so he
literally feels like he's in hell while he's in heaven
the whole time that's the insanity of it that's the
madness of it that's the tragedy of it see your
mind is so powerful the ego mind is so powerful
and this is the essence of what the devil is
is that it is able to refuse heaven and is
able to refuse god absolutely if you want to delude
yourself you can delude yourself despite all evidence despite all
proof despite what anyone tells you if jesus himself came
down from the clouds and told you that you're in
heaven if you're a devil you wouldn't believe him because
to you in your direct experience life feels like hell
it feels like suffering all this anxiety and depression and
worry and caring about how you look caring about your
physical appearance struggling with your weight with your diet feeling
aches and pains judging everything going on in the political
world in the political sphere all of that is your
ego all of that is the devil in you separating
you from the heaven in which you literally are and
have always been you see that's the tragedy of uh
of our predicament as ego minds so uh keep that
in mind [Laughter] it's not like that's gonna stop you
from being a devil but keep that in mind so
let's talk about why everything is the way that it
is the first thing you need to understand all right
i was talking about the fractal the infinite fractal so
go to youtube type in in the search box type
in fractal zoom or mandelbrot fractal zoom you'll find there's
a bunch of those videos and just watch it watch
the fractal unfolding it zooms into the fractal forever just
going in and in and in um so it's like
that every single object that you look at take your
finger and point at any object or even just look
at your finger it's infinite it's an infinite fractal so
you can zoom to this finger forever it's an infinite
chain of structure and form and causation that goes in
forever and ever there is no end to it forever
forever so what god is is god is the emptiness
that's sitting at the very center of this infinite fractal
i remember i said it was like an explosion think
of the entire universe um or all of reality as
a as a frozen explosion frozen in time in frozen
animation it exists eternally as this giant explosion what this
explosion is is is is a sort of a fractal
of infinite causation such that like take any object right
now in the room take your finger take look at
a book look at a chair look at it lamp
whatever take that object look at it like i'm looking
at this finger and uh and what this is is
this is just one infinitesimally tiny part of the entire
fractal um and any part of the fractal is precisely
smack dab in the middle of the fractal you see
a fractal is a thing which doesn't have a beginning
or an end that's what infinity means that's what totality
means that's what god is it has no beginning it
has no end and it exists outside of time for
eternity eternity is what's conscious of this very moment right
now it appears as though stuff is moving but of
course it is moving but but the fact that it's
moving doesn't change that it's always existing eternally in the
same way that if you have a a real a
film like a movie for a movie projector from one
of those old-time movie projectors you know when you're watching
the film on the theater screen it seems as though
each frame is only showing displaying on the screen for
a fraction of a second and it feels like it
comes and it goes and then it's gone but if
you look at the entire film as a totality the
actual film reel every frame exists there all at once
so the problem is that usually when you're interacting with
reality your standard ordinary level of consciousness your your it's
like you're you're watching frame by frame and so things
seem to flow and things don't seem like they're eternal
but when you get a high level of consciousness you
can realize that no it's just it's like it all
exists all at once sort of like you know think
of your first the first memory you have or the
first time that you were the memory you have of
first grade your first day of school you remember that
so you think well that time has long since gone
right where did it go it died it disappeared no
it exists right now every every moment of your life
it all exists eternally like it's not happening right now
but it all exists because it's just one infinite explosion
it's like an infinite singularity of every of everything that
has ever happened that's what reality is so yeah you
can become acutely aware of this this this this fractal
and so see what happens is that when you become
aware of this infinite fractal you become aware that the
very room you're sitting in right now is this infinite
fractal and that it's infinitely far away from the edge
there is no edge to reality to the universe you're
always in the middle of it no matter where you
are you could travel for a hundred billion light years
to the edge of the universe and you think well
now i'm at the edge no you're just as far
from from the edge as you are sitting here on
earth that's what infinity is in the same way that
for example if we take see don't don't mistake infinity
with numbers infinity has nothing really to do with numbers
numbers are sort of one example of infinity but everything
is infinity not just numbers that chair that lamp your
body everything is infinite the universe um so so with
numbers though like let's say we take the number zero
you would think zero is at the center of infinity
right infinite numbers is like from zero one two three
four five trillions billions billions trillions and all the way
to infinity right um and then you've got the negative
numbers negative one negative two negative million negative billion negative
trillion and so on to infinity so it seems like
zero is right in the middle but what you realize
is that the number 5 trillion 500 billion 8 million
21 that number any random number that you pick is
smack dab in the middle of all the numbers the
infinity of numbers you see so it is with your
body with your house with your car and everything else
so that's that's cool but that's still not the end
of what i have to say we're really just getting
started here the most uh the most important and uh
probably profound thing that i became conscious of is why
the formed fractal that is everything is precisely the way
that it is and not some other way it's not
arbitrary it's not random it's not just patterns it's not
just evolution it's not just physical laws arbitrary physical laws
that happen to lead to the universe being this way
so to understand this you have to you have to
penetrate the very heart of the godhead to realize the
structure of the godhead of god itself and what that
is is uh how do i explain this it's total
lack of limitation see the problem is that we humans
because we're so busy surviving because we're living in this
supposedly physically limiting world we are always dealing with limitation
such that we can't even fathom the notion of something
that has no limits and i'm not just talking about
physical limits as in like spatial dimensions i'm not just
saying that the physical space of the universe is infinite
that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about imagine
an object which is completely unconstrained by anything so this
would be an object that exists prior to there even
being physical laws or logical laws or anything at all
it's completely unlimited unconstrained science and physics would tell us
that you can't have such an object they're wrong because
they're dealing with what's inside of the of the physical
uh of the object that we're talking about rather than
sort of like what's outside so you might imagine like
what's outside the universe well what's outside of the universe
is lack of limitation no laws whatsoever total lawlessness unlimited
it's unlimited in other words god um but what you
have to realize is that this unlimitedness is actually real
it actually exists total lack of limitation there are some
corollaries and consequences of this which most people don't fathom
i don't think even many awoke people fathom this um
this is something you have to become acutely conscious of
so what i became conscious of is that yes it's
unlimited but this unlimitedness is then all-powerful you see you
don't understand you just you it's impossible to explain to
you what unlimitedness really means the full consequences of it
i mean you can get it as an idea but
but the consequences of it you don't understand the consequences
of it the consequences of unlimitedness is everything that's happening
the consequence of unlimitedness is that if you have this
unlimited object if it's truly unlimited it's all powerful it
can do anything really try to understand what this what
this means because this is utterly profound it can do
anything which means it can be conscious which means it
can be totally conscious totally self-aware so usually when you
think of an object you think of a dumb thing
like an atom a molecule a book a table something
dumb but see we're imagining an unlimited object an unlimited
object can be intelligent it can be sentient it can
be conscious it can be alive not only can it
be intelligent it can be infinitely intelligent so imagine an
infinitely intelligent object it has no form so don't imagine
a form just maybe a circle is good enough for
your mind so uh imagine a sphere which is intelligent
but not just intelligent like a human infinite intelligence think
about what this really is allow your mind to really
get traction with what i'm saying infinite intelligence you understand
this infinite intelligence that means intelligence without limit intelligence without
limit without form you might think well the intelligence has
to happen in some kind of brain no no we're
talking about infinite intelligence which means that infinite intelligence means
that you're so intelligent if you just imagine anything you
can instantly will it into existence that's what infinite intelligence
means and that's also what infinite power means all powerful
imagine an object that's all powerful that means it can
create anything with no limitations whatsoever it's so unlimited that
it can also create itself see that's what unlimited means
there are no limits there's nothing it can't do nothing
is impossible for it so i'm describing god here i'm
also describing you as god i'm describing your ultimate nature
and how you came into being so this object is
all-powerful infinitely intelligent and it has a will see normally
when you think of an object an object to you
like a table it doesn't have a will but if
this object that we're talking about is unlimited and has
no limits and nothing is impossible to it it acquires
a will not only that but it has infinite will
which means that it can will matter into being literally
it can materialize a table out of thin air through
sheer intellect and willpower that's what you can do if
you understand what unlimited means if you're truly unlimited there
are no limits there's no way that you have to
be so think about this if there's no way that
you have to be you can be any way you
want if you were all powerful and all intelligent and
you had an infinite will and you could be any
way that you want how would you be if you
were god and you could create anything what would you
create think about that you would create the best most
beautiful most intelligent creation possible you would use your infinite
intellect to run through every permutation every possibility of how
you could structure reality and you would structure it in
the best possible way for the entire whole for everybody
not just for one organism and not for your own
self but for everybody and that is what this is
right here that's what reality is it's infinitely good reality
is the incarnation of infinite goodness and infinite love and
infinite beauty and the only way that that could be
created is through total selflessness you'd have to be totally
selfless to do it and that's what i created that's
what i created that's what you created it's pure love
it's pure love it's pure intelligence it's pure goodness goodness
without an opposite but the ego mind can't understand any
of this because you're thinking to yourself leo what are
you crazy good what are you talking about good what
about the mass shooting that happened the other week what
about what about terrorists what about murders what about rapists
and tyrants and drug dealers and war mongers and all
this is that good yes it is you don't understand
you don't understand you're judging it from position of selfishness
you see you believe yourself as a self you have
survival needs the survival needs blind you you have a
stake you have an investment in life which blinds you
from being able to see it totally objectively absolutely you
can't see the absolute good because there are certain things
you need to stay alive you've internalized those needs so
deeply that you see things as evil or bad or
wrong or imperfect or flawed because you have very real
needs to keep existing but god doesn't have those needs
moreover you're judging the design and it is designed this
is an infinite design there is not a single random
or arbitrary thing in the entire universe every hair on
your arm every particle of dust on every planet around
every star within the billions of galaxies which exist within
this universe all of it has been designed meticulously precision
engineered to work together as a seamless totality for the
greatest good of all see you say well leo but
some some mass shooting that happened last week you know
that wasn't good if god was all loving and so
good and so intelligent he would have designed it so
there couldn't be a mass shooting last week you're evaluating
from such a narrow myopic perspective see from such a
narrow perspective you're not thinking about how everything interconnects with
everything else infinite interconnection because your intellect as a human
is limited i'm talking about an infinite intellect think of
it like a chess game an infinite chess game with
an infinite number of squares and pieces a human can
only think so many moves ahead so you and your
myopia and egotism you look at a mass shooting shooting
on television and you think well that's pretty bad that's
clearly evidence of the imperfection of the universe clearly evidence
that that there is no god and so forth and
that uh you know a good god wouldn't allow such
a thing um but what you don't understand is that
it's necessary for the greater good such that what i'm
telling you is that if you got rid if god
got rid of the possibility of mass shootings what i'm
telling you is that would result in a worsening of
the creation as unbelievable as that sounds from your perspective
as an ego what i'm saying is true if you
take any part of reality and you say well what
if we change it what if we change god's design
such that there were no mosquitoes or there were no
asteroids or there were no murderers or there were no
psychopaths or there were no drug dealers or there were
no hitler's and stalin's you would think well yeah that
would that would improve the design it would be better
and then when i ask you well why isn't it
that way you would say well because i don't know
leo because the universe is just kind of random and
you know who says that it has to be good
who says that it has to be perfectly designed you
know it's just random atoms bouncing around you know we're
lucky that we that we're even here we're lucky that
the universe could even sustain life no we're not lucky
we're not lucky everything was engineered but see but all
that stuff that you said that would have made the
universe better it actually would have made it worse you
can't see it because you're not calculating the infinite chains
of causation which cascade through the entire universe see every
part of the universe is interconnected has to play with
itself work with itself it's a design i want you
to really spend some time after this video is over
contemplating what is design if any of you out there
are designers like graphic designers architects engineers web designers programmers
software architects um and and so forth if you've ever
designed anything you know how difficult design is it's difficult
to design a good watch or a good car or
a good website it's hard to design why is it
hard to design because there are many elements which you
need to make work together in a holistic fashion such
that the entire thing does what you want it to
do and it doesn't interfere with itself and it's got
a certain elegance and beauty to it good designers know
how to do that the designers at apple know how
to do that which is why their designs are so
popular if you're a designer you should appreciate how difficult
it is to solve a finite design challenge as a
designer have you ever sat there racking your mind over
some design problem whether it's you're designing an airplane or
you're designing a building or you're designing a web page
and it's just like you can't like there's element you
gotta like fit it in there but it's not fitting
if you fit this in it breaks some other part
of the design maybe if you're doing some code you
experience this i'm sure i've experienced this many times as
i've done design and so you start to appreciate as
a designer uh good design when you see a well-designed
building or a well-designed web page you're like oh look
that's that's nice that's exceptional that's rare that's that's something
that that took intellect to do that didn't happen by
accident someone really experienced and really intelligent and thoughtful someone
with an artistic eye sat down and did that then
of course you see all the bad designs and you
criticize all those and you say how how bad they
are how terrible they are well that's because someone inexperienced
an inexperienced designer with a lack of experience and intelligence
design that thing but now try to fathom the the
design challenge that god has you as a software engineer
web designer you're dealing with a very finite design challenge
that has maybe twenty thirty a hundred a thousand moving
parts how do you design something that's infinite for example
a butterfly that's flying somewhere on the earth right now
is being affected by the gravity of every rock on
the entire earth by the sun because the sun heats
the atmosphere of the entire planet every molecule in the
atmosphere trillions upon trillions of trillions of trillions of oxygen
nitrogen hydrogen oxygen and and so on molecules in the
atmosphere being heated by the sun creating pressure and temperature
differences across the globe which results in wind and air
currents the butterfly to survive needs to navigate this wind
and these air currents the butterfly is itself made up
of billions of cells all alive each cell an individual
organism onto itself controlling itself fighting for its own survival
regulating itself if you study molecular biology you understand the
complexity of things like the krebs cycle or the way
that the biological cells convert and process atp energy and
the way plants do photosynthesis how complex and delicate it
all is so there are billions of cells within that
butterfly working to live individually but also then working collectively
together in order to move that butterfly have it flap
its wings in the right way in the right manner
the butterflies wings are designed in such a manner that
they work against the air currents they also work against
the gravity of every rock on the entire planet which
is pulling on that butterfly every human being on the
entire planet exerts a gravitational force that attracts that butterfly
but not just that there are how many billions of
butterflies on the earth probably trillions of butterflies on the
earth all flapping their wings right now somewhere all of
them exerting gravitational force on each other all of them
also contributing to various wind currents that exist around the
entire globe but it doesn't stop there there are 100
billion solar systems in the milky way galaxy there are
100 billion or more galaxies in our known universe there
are trillions upon trillions of planets out there how many
of them have butterflies or something like that all of
those planets all of those stars all of those butterflies
all of those rocks even it doesn't have butterflies let's
just say it's it's a dead planet let's just say
it has rocks and nothing else well each rock that
exists on a planet on the opposite side of the
universe is exerting gravitational force on every butterfly on the
entire planet of earth that butterfly you could zoom into
it because it's fractal it has no scale which means
you can zoom into that butterfly forever and ever and
ever and ever beyond atoms beyond quarks become subatomic particles
beyond strings forever there's an infinite chain that one butterfly
flapping in swings right now somewhere on this planet is
like a universe onto itself in fact every single object
is a universe onto itself which goes on to infinity
infinite in all directions all of it working seamlessly perfectly
together without a single bug or a single glitch all
of it intelligible how do you design that that's not
an accident that's a design how do you design that
how do you take the chains of causation and every
object in the universe has an infinite chain of causation
so for example why am i wearing white today you
might wonder well let's look at the causes because i
bought a white shirt and white pants so i'm wearing
white but why did i decide to put them on
well because i felt like it because i did this
30 day solo retreat but why did i decide to
do this solo retreat well because you know i got
into meditation and enlightenment well how did i get into
that well because i got into meditation originally because i
got into pickup well how did i get into pickup
well because um i wasn't that good with with women
when i was younger didn't have a lot of experience
well why did that happen well because i was i
was shy in school and because i came here from
a different country so i never really felt felt like
i fit in never felt like i was quite an
american okay well why did that happen well because i
was born in the country well why did that happen
well because i was there was a sperm and an
egg in some man and some woman that that that
was in a different country it was in russia okay
well well why did that happen well because because the
sperms and eggs of their parents were were in that
location too well why did that happen well because other
generations of humans were there well why did that happen
well because of the collapse of the the the roman
empire okay well why did that happen well there's hundreds
of speculative historical causes of the collapse of the roman
empire and so on and so on it goes back
and back and back and back we can trace it
all back all the way to the beginning of the
big bang and that's why i'm wearing white today and
you might think well it all stops at the big
bang no it doesn't the big bang is just one
tiny part of an infinite thing think of the big
bang as a dust particle on some giant's nose that's
all it is on and on forever and not just
that that's just one dimension of the chain of causation
which leads me to wear white today we could also
analyze it in a different way we could say the
reason i'm wearing white today is because well someone i'm
this clothing is probably sewn together somewhere in like bangladesh
or in china well somebody there sewed this clothing and
i bought it online okay so why did uh why
did somebody sew this clothing well because there was some
businessman who had some entrepreneurial idea that we should we
should sew this kind of shirt someone had to sit
down and design it some shirt designer some tailor had
to design this thing and then some some poor woman
who works you know 15 hour shifts in bangladesh had
to stitch it together in some sweatshop and then why
did that happen well because she was poor and why
did that happen well because of geopolitics and the historical
develops the developments of bangladesh versus america when you know
you can study history and all the causes there and
you know uh and again that will you can trace
that chain of causation all the way back to the
big bang and before so what we have is that
every object in the universe has an infinite chain of
causation literally infinite infinite forever in all directions all of
these chains of causation have to cascade and ripple through
each other you know like for example the gravity of
the earth affects the the material of the clothing that
i'm wearing normally you don't think about any of this
because none of this has anything to do with your
ordinary life and yet at the same time it is
all of life there could not be ordinary life without
what i'm talking about here the thickness of your clothing
is directly proportional to the gravity of the earth directly
proportional to how far away the earth is from the
sun directly proportional to how much radiation there is in
the atmosphere depending on how much radiation there is in
the atmosphere the clothing would have to be a different
thickness different color the material out of which your clothing
is made like if this is made of cotton that's
a natural material plant material those plants have to live
according to how far they are from the sun and
and so forth so if if the gravity on the
planet was different we were close we'd be closer to
the sun temperature would be a little bit hotter let's
say on the planet uh the cotton plant even if
it existed uh let's assuming the change was very minor
let's say we were only like two inches closer to
the sun so you know cotton plants would still probably
exist but they would be different maybe they'd be a
little bit thicker or thinner i don't know um and
so on and so forth all the way to the
beginning of the big bang right so you see these
chains of causation ripple through each other usually when science
is analyzing something science analyzes only a few simple linear
chains of causation like a causes b causes c very
simple stuff something like you know eating bacon causes heart
disease okay that's a simple chain of causation and even
there it's not quite clear whether that's true or not
but let's assume it is um but you know it's
very simple chain of causation but but imagine the the
chains of causation just running through your body alone in
order to make your heart function to make your kidneys
function your liver function and all that there are trillions
of chains of causation just running so that you could
flex your finger like this trillions of chains of causation
are doing that every atom in the entire universe right
now is involved with the causation chain of the flexing
of my finger now of course as a scientist you'll
say well leo but it's an insignificant quantity something like
point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one percent
influence from some distant star that's true but it's still
happening it's still happening you can't deny that as a
scientist so the problem with science is is not per
se that science is false it's extremely partial it's completely
overlooking 99.999 of everything and it's especially overlooking the holistic
design integration and how all of these chains of causation
ripple through each other science is terrible at looking at
that and when it does then you get chaos theory
for example and chaos theory has some profound implications and
it shows some of the limitations of science and it
also talks about fractals which is why i'm calling it
a fractal it is a fractal and so the point
of all this is to get you to start to
understand the significance of what this thing called reality is
see you've been overlooking the significance of it so how
could such a thing be designed only by an infinite
all-powerful all-intelligent object something that's totally unlimited and it has
solved this design challenge so the design of god is
to make the best possible creation pure goodness and it
has completely succeeded in this design in fact it wasn't
a problem at all for god god solved the design
challenge instantly because that's what unlimited power allows you to
do see with unlimited power you can solve an unlimited
design challenge with zero time and so here it is
we're in it right now the only problem is that
you can't see it and you can't see it because
you're too selfish and because you're not conscious enough and
because you haven't done enough five emilio dmt or meditated
or done yoga or self-inquiry or whatever you want to
do now some of you are wondering well leah but
why would god be good why wouldn't god be evil
shouldn't god be kind like neutral not care one way
or another way isn't it more right to say leo
that god is neutral because look at all the evil
stuff happening so see god created some good stuff god
created some bad stuff no you are wrong god did
not create any bad stuff god only created good stuff
that's the miracle of awakening is that you realize that
you realize infinite goodness so in answer to your question
the reason that god did not create any bad stuff
think of it like this if you were all powerful
all intelligent and totally selfless and you could will anything
into being instantly if you were completely unlimited again what
would you create would you create anything bad would you
create anything evil no you wouldn't because as it turns
out infinite intelligence is identical with infinite goodness the more
intelligent you are the good the gooder you are to
put it awkwardly the good the the better the gooder
you are though let's put it as that because we're
using that word good the good or you are such
that if you had infinite intelligence and infinite selflessness you
would be totally good there would be no reason for
you to be bad the reason that you as a
human are bad or in other words selfish the reason
you're a devil is because you've separated yourself from the
unlimited it's because you're limited you feel so limited and
you're stuck in this game of survival where you need
to take from others in order to live and you
need to navigate survival and so for you you do
bad or evil stuff you steal you lie you cheat
you exploit you manipulate and others do it to you
the reason all that happens is because you're afraid of
death but see god can't be afraid of death because
god is nothing god is immortal it's eternal it's forever
so it has nothing to fear so think about it
this way if you had nothing to fear whatsoever if
you had no personal neuroses of any kind if you
had absolutely nothing to lose if you were not attached
to anything if you didn't cling to anything not to
money not to sex not to your children not to
your family not to anything if you were totally selfless
and immortal and you could create anything what would you
create only one thing ta-da you're in it you're in
it you're in it it's infinitely good you would spend
an eternity crafting a design where nothing was left a
chance where every piece of an infinite design was perfectly
aligned with every piece other piece of a design so
that it forms one seamless totality with infinite perfection and
infinite goodness and infinite love and infinite beauty not for
the benefit of one human or even the human race
not even for the benefit of life per se on
the planet earth but for everything you've played an infinite
chess game and you've looked an infinite number of moves
ahead and you've calculated everything such that everything is there
for the good of the all now locally you as
an individual human see the problem is that your perspective
is so myopic and limited that you don't have this
cosmic absolute perspective you're not worried about the all goodness
of things what you're worried about is you're worried about
what's good for you and that's why you can't see
the absolute goodness and beauty and intelligence of the universe
is because you're judging it for what's good for you
so for example if someone runs over your dog tomorrow
you're going to say oh god damn you god how
did you create this bad universe but you see what
you don't appreciate is that it had to be that
way it was done for the greater good it's just
that you're only looking three moves ahead whereas god is
looking an infinite number of rooms ahead so the reason
that that person ran over your dog is maybe because
they were they were drunk driving drunk and you would
say ah but but a good god would never allow
drunk drivers but you see to do that god would
have to get rid of for example alcohol and you
would say well what's wrong with that yeah alcohol is
bad get rid of alcohol a good god would never
permit alcohol ah but you see if if there was
no alcohol you wouldn't have been born how were you
conceived because your parents met at a party where they
were drinking and the only reason that your father mustered
up the courage to talk to your mother is because
he was half drunk and the only reason she uh
accepted having sex with him that night after the party
is because she was half drunk and then by accident
you were conceived and so here you are you see
so the problem is that you as a little myopic
human you're so selfish but you start to try to
like micromanage and try to try to change reality try
to change the infinite design of god but every time
you try to change it you actually make it worse
which is not to say that all humans are always
making things worse certainly you can improve things as a
human you can design better governments better cars and so
forth but you have to be very careful about what
you're designing and how you're designing it and especially don't
be so arrogant as to think that you can redesign
the very existential structure of the whole universe for the
better don't get simplistic ideas that well if we got
rid of alcohol then that would be a better universe
and if we got rid of murders that would be
better universe no it wouldn't it wouldn't you're wrong you're
just wrong you're too myopic your vision is too small
so literally if a thing is happening if it exists
it is absolute good nothing bad or evil has ever
happened in the world nor can it ever happen god
only allows absolute good to happen that's what existence is
it's absolute goodness do not make the mistake of thinking
that infinity is some sort of soulless uh dumb brute
force object like a bunch of numbers or some physics
formula or just the set of all possibilities reality is
not the set of all possibilities reality is the set
of all of the best possibilities and there is only
one such set it is the infinite set it is
infinity infinity is identical to goodness is identical to love
existence is literally synonymous with goodness such that if it's
not good it can't exist you see it can't exist
and now we come to the question of what is
not existence what is non-existence well you see there's no
such thing non-existence doesn't exist there is only existence existence
has no opposite you might think well leo but what
about uh a unicorn sitting on top of your head
that doesn't exist no that exists as an idea in
your mind a unicorn sitting on top of my head
you've just confused that idea for something that's supposed to
be seen up here another way to put it is
that what exists is the absence of a unicorn sitting
on top of my head right now that's what it
is it exists so when the entire world of form
disappears what exists just pure existence devoid of any content
you might say well leo that's non-existence no it's existence
devoid of any content see what existence is that which
is the case that that which is true that which
is true is that which is happening right now there
is nothing but truth there is no such thing as
falsehood you might say oh what about lying isn't lying
falsehood again you're getting lost in concepts a lie has
to exist a lie has to actually be truth it
has to be being it has to be to be
a lie the idea of non-existence itself exists as an
idea in your mind there's no such thing as non-existence
there's only ideas concepts fantasies of non-existence and therefore god
is immortal because god is just existence and existence just
exists forever without opposite the intelligence that you're using if
you're a designer or an engineer or an architect to
create your own creations is a tiny infinitesimally small sliver
of god's infinite intelligence you're using that to design those
things multiply that times infinity and that's how you were
designed and you can in fact become directly conscious of
how the will of god instantly manifests into for example
your body i became conscious by looking at my hand
how i as god am creating the hand instantly through
no mechanism whatsoever by willing it into existence this infinite
hand with his trillions of cells all working together perfectly
in order to be able to do all the things
that a hand does and of course this is just
a tiny piece of the infinite hole and it's absolutely
one all human beings are just the same god looking
through the eyes of a different form einstein famously said
that god does not play dice he was having a
debate with niels bohr about quantum mechanics and niels bohr
was trying to say that quantum mechanics is random random
virtual particles and all that stuff there ain't nothing random
about quantum mechanics einstein was right god does not play
dice but of course that was just an intuition that
einstein had einstein didn't actually become directly conscious of as
far as i know but i did so um what
i'm here to tell you is that if you're a
philosophically minded fellow like myself and you like to question
the universe and why everything exists and why it is
the way it is and how everything works if you're
really curious then follow that curiosity ultimately after decades and
decades of pulling your hair out maybe growing a beard
maybe taking some fiber neo dmt a couple dozen of
enlightenment experiences you can become fully conscious of why it's
all here you're it you did it you can become
conscious of it all you can [Music] you can you
can figure it all out of course way beyond the
mind i'm not talking about logic or reason here or
any just simple verbal or even reading books or studying
on top saying way beyond that we're talking about reaching
trans human realms of awareness but you can figure it
out i believe it was also einstein who said that
i'm just paraphrasing here something along the lines of the
most amazing thing about the universe is that it's comprehensible
that's right and the reason is comprehensible is because it's
designed by an infinite intellect of which the human intellect
is a tiny splinter so everything you see around you
is intelligible but your notion of intellect has to expand
enormously i'm not talking about iq what i'm talking about
intellect i'm not talking about traditional first order logic or
reason i'm not even talking about human cognition per se
and i'm not talking about just linguistic um propositions um
i'm talking about a pure intelligence pure pure intelligence what
you haven't considered before is that pure intelligence is possible
see you thought intelligence was some byproduct of some neurons
and some brain that's not what intelligence is consciousness is
infinitely intelligent see because it's unlimited and it's also all-powerful
this is the mind of god and it always has
been you just were not aware of it you weren't
awake to it god is total awakeness god is also
nothing so at the same time it might be sounding
like i'm talking about stuff that has happened all this
just exists and it's all real at the same time
all of it is absolutely nothing because infinity and zero
and nothingness are identical somethingness and nothingness can't be distinguished
but they also can when you don't distinguish them it's
nothing when you do distinguish them it's everything it's like
looking at a glass you could see it as half
empty or half full both are true simultaneously depending on
how you look at it so yeah a total metaphysical
understanding is possible but it's very deep don't expect to
get there without really purifying yourself and really putting your
heart and soul into it putting your whole life into
it another insight i had which was very profound was
that love and truth are absolutely identical truth is everything
that's happening right now and love is absolutely synonymous with
that but how do you explain that to a person
you gotta take some psychedelics or do some yoga to
really experience that for yourself love truth being consciousness these
are all synonymous unidentical it's all way too good to
be true is the problem see this is the kind
of stuff you can't believe um this is what i
was why i was telling you from the very beginning
with actualized.org i was telling you that um that you're
not going to understand how good all this is and
you're not going to you're not going to get there
unless you're radically open-minded i keep telling you to be
open-minded stay open-minded keep digging keep going down the rabbit
hole don't stop prematurely it only gets better and better
in the end you discover that it's infinitely good and
then you die to this goodness and then what's left
for you to do is to to be an embodiment
an example of goodness to the world to transform your
life to align with that so in conclusion that's what
is left for me to do now don't get the
wrong idea i'm not claiming that i'm the most enlightened
person ever i'm not claiming any special privilege um i'm
not saying that i access things that you can't access
or anybody else can't access i'm just saying that i've
accessed some rare stuff that few people have accessed because
it's practically quite difficult to do and i'm quite fortunate
that i was able to access it i'm not even
saying that i'm woke or enlightened i don't consider myself
actually awake yet i still consider myself as having a
lot of work to do to reach full awakening and
liberation i have become conscious of these various things and
these things have transformed me in certain ways but at
the same time as i am god sitting here before
you i'm also just a petty human with petty needs
and desires playing a game of survival within this dream
i still like certain bad food i still have bad
habits there's a lot of stuff that i need to
work on i still have fears and anxieties i still
get sad sometimes i get depressed sometimes all those ordinary
human things still happen i still have to worry about
money i still have to pay my bills i still
have to do my taxes speaking of which april 15th
is coming up um so you know so all this
is still at play that's the that's sort of the
the jarring uh feature of this work is that at
the same time you reach these incredible highs where nothing
matters and then you drop back down to ordinary life
where where the littlest things can annoy you you know
some traffic jam can annoy you and it might seem
like it's a contradiction but it's really not because you're
simultaneously god and you're simultaneously a human chimp animal and
you want to eat and [ __ ] and [
__ ] so don't go holding me to some kind
of uh ungodly standard uh i will disappoint you for
sure i have a lot of work left to do
um like i said i don't even consider myself awake
yet i have a lot of work to do just
to awaken and even after that there will be a
lot of work to do on removing various kinds of
shadow issues neuroses and problems and and and then you
know finally reaching liberation you have to make a distinction
between awakening having an awakening experience which is relatively easy
still hard for most people but relatively easy compared to
liberation like total liberation to be in this constant state
of god consciousness that's really what i'm saving the word
awakening for um i've experienced it as as temporary peaks
but not as a stable lasting full god consciousness so
i still have ego still have a sense of self
it still bugs me i still suffer all right so
all that is there uh so i still got a
ton of work to do on that um and that's
what i'll be working on as far as these five
meo experiences yes they're peaks they're awesome peaks and you
drop you drop out of the peak returning to ordinary
life but at the same time you've also been transformed
which is not unlike many awakening experiences that you have
while meditating or doing yoga or self-inquiry don't expect to
have one awakening experience then now you're in god mode
all the [ __ ] time that's extremely rare you
have to really work towards that so i'm more passionate
and excited about doing the work than ever as i've
been integrating a lot doing a lot of integration of
all these insights i've uh i've been feeling and sort
of trying to let almost let my mind and my
body get possessed by god it's almost like you're getting
possessed possessed and purified and that's that's one of the
core techniques that i'll be using going forward is one
of the most important things i think for being on
the spiritual path is you got to make it organic
and natural it can't be this forced thing where you
force yourself to sit down and do these strong determination
sits where you're in pain all the time and all
this this this can work for so for a while
but this is not real spirituality real spirituality is like
when you're fully surrendered and no matter what you're doing
whether you're driving a car or taking a [ __
] or you're on the phone or whatever you're you're
possessed by god of course that means you have to
hollow yourself out so that there's room for the divinity
within you the infinite goodness and love and beauty and
consciousness to to to take hold and that takes time
that's not going to happen in in a day in
a week and a month or even in a year
so i've begun that process a lot of my process
is going to be about just surrendering just literally you're
sitting and you're surrendering to god and you're putting your
full heart into it so one thing that i noticed
that i've changed is that my heart is a lot
more into the work now than before before it was
kind of a grind i kind of had to do
it then i kind of once it was done the
timer rang i go run off and do something else
that i enjoy more but now it's like it's becoming
a way of life and it has to be that
way it has to be fully organic fully organic fully
authentic so that's what i'm working on i'm working on
being more authentic hopefully you feel that now i've definitely
been transformed um but there's a lot of work left
to do and a lot of stuff that i want
to share with you in the future going forward a
lot of insights a lot of profound videos to to
talk about um really my whole understanding of awakening has
been transformed it's way deeper and more profound and more
religious than i ever anticipated it to be so i'm
dealing with that um some of my teachings will be
tweaked upgraded really um it's not per se that the
things i've told you in the past were false uh
it's it's mo it's more that um my teacher's gonna
become more direct more pure more powerful more authentic um
less ego games and other stuff that i was playing
um you know i'm i'm fully aware that when i'm
shooting videos you know i'm playing ego games it's very
easy to get lost in concepts so i'm fully aware
of this i have been for years it's but the
problem is that you know changing it is the hard
part it's it's easy to be aware of it um
changing into the hard part so i'm working on that
that'll be a multi-year long process i'm changing how i
do work i'm changing how i relate to people like
a lot of stuff in my life is changing it's
very exciting also kind of scary at the same time
i'm not quite sure where things are going to go
how things are going to unfold a lot of my
plans for the future just have to be kind of
thrown out the window and just let things unfold more
organically and that's what i'm doing so in the future
what's going to happen is that there's going to be
more weekly videos some very profound stuff so stick around
for those also what i'll be doing is i'll be
publishing um notes of the best insights from my uh
for my last 30-day retreat i'll be posting those um
on my blog it'll be in some kind of word
document form you can just go click on it click
on the link download it and read it it'll be
quite a few pages maybe 5 or 10 pages worth
it'll be a lot of stuff that i said here
but maybe in more detail other stuff i didn't have
time to say um so if you're really kind of
nerdy and you really really want to get into my
insights you can you can go check that out otherwise
there will be many videos that i'll be creating based
on various important lessons that i learned here that going
deeper in the stuff that i did talk about already
so there will be some reiteration of the stuff that
i said here but also other stuff that just i
didn't have time to talk about and also don't worry
um there will still be a lot of practical material
so i won't just be talking about god all the
time it's going to be practical stuff a lot of
specific and technical topics that we need we need to
cover and there's still a lot of stuff that i'm
still exploring that i still don't know so even though
i say that i have a total understanding of of
the universe what what i mean by that is not
that i understand everything in full detail what i mean
by that is i have a a very solid understanding
of the structure of reality in this totality and why
it is the way that it is i've become conscious
of that and i'm always open to more you know
i'm open to more insights more awakenings more so i'm
not i'm not stopping here i'm not resting on my
laurels yeah it's going to be interesting to see where
things where things go from here i'm going to work
on embodying the things that i speak more so that
my teachings are not so much just verbal and technical
and analytical as they have been but more uh embodied
through my body language through my tone through my emotions
through my personal example but at the same time there
will still be plenty of analysis and plenty of technical
details and examples as before so it's a natural natural
upgrade a natural evolution so like i said in the
video i did just before this where i talked about
leaving on the 30 day retreat i said that i
wanted to open a new chapter in my life and
so that's what has happened i've opened a new chapter
i also um i'm sort of starting to close the
old chapter of business and success and now it's going
to this this new chapter that's being opened up is
the the chapter of of becoming god not fully god
yet but working towards working towards total awakening and liberation
i anticipate that this chapter will take some number of
years maybe three or five years at which point i
hope to achieve total liberation and full god consciousness and
at that point everything will be transformed at that point
yeah i don't know i don't know what comes after
that after that point i guess i'll just be like
roaming the streets that's a raving uh it's a raving
madman yogi um preaching god to people or something like
that um we'll see we'll see what happens it's hard
to say um but uh that's it for now hope
you enjoyed and i hope you're inspired to seek a
piece of this for yourself you
