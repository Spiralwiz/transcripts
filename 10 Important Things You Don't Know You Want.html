hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be speaking about the ten things
that you want that you really really want but that
you have no clue that you want there is a
category of things that you really want deep down inside
but you're not aware of now this is a really
twisted and interesting phenomenon that this is happening within your
mind there are things really really deep and advanced things
that you might totally be unaware of or maybe you've
heard about them once or twice in your life but
they're just like not on your radar screen and you're
out there pursuing totally different things now think about this
I'm going to give you a list of all these
I'm going to talk about this in a lot of
depth but think about the the problems that this might
create for you if what I'm saying is true if
it was really the case that there were really deep
things that you wanted but you weren't aware of think
about how many problems in your life this would create
right because the things you're pursuing usually you don't question
why you pursue them you don't really question your wants
and one of the most basic problems that I see
most people who come to me for coaching or who
just want to do some self-improvement work the problem that
these people have is that they don't even know what
they want and so we have to spend a lot
of time just working to find out what it is
that you [ __ ] want and even after we
figure that out which is a process in and of
itself the things you come up with are still not
really deep they're not very genuine and they're not really
the things you want they're the things you think you
want and this is a big problem as you can
see because when you're doing self improvement or if you're
trying to accomplish anything in your life well how do
you do it you do it based on your wants
but if your wants you know the very first step
you take is already misguided well that creates the possibility
of you getting very far off track for where you
should be in life and what I suggest to you
is that that's exactly what's happened to you in your
life you're really far off track because these things that
she really want you almost have no idea what they
are and also when you hear them when I tell
them to you in a minute here um it's gonna
sound it's gonna sound to you like no leo you
don't understand I don't really want these things I want
what I want I want the things that I want
not the things you're telling me that I should want
and that's very tricky this is where we're really getting
into like the guts of how your mind works and
how it tricks you how it deceives you so be
very careful here this is an advanced topic if we
just took someone off the street or if we took
you and we gave you the old magic Genie lamp
and we asked you you know what are the three
wishes you would want in your life if you could
get anything you wanted what were the three things that
you would want that would really transform your life that
would really make you happy really make you fulfilled that
would be really meaningful to you hell we could even
give you ten wishes what are the 10 things you
would want in your life that would really make your
life amazing and the tragedy of this is is that
we if we took a person off the street and
we we did this with them they would come up
with all the wrong answers all the wrong answers the
things that they would wish for these would all be
wasted wishes they would wish for things that just would
not give them the satisfaction that they thought it would
give them why not well because this stuff is very
counterintuitive because this demonstrates how much their mind is tricking
them and how far off track it really are these
things that you want but that you don't know that
you want you've been distracted from them for decades you've
been so distracted from them that you're probably not even
aware that these things are possible and even if you
are aware that these things are possible you have no
idea how meaningful these things would be if they were
given to you you completely discount the value of these
things psychologically for you and your life you hold them
much lower than some of the other things you want
and those other things you want you hold them as
much higher than you should and then of course there's
an additional problem is that even if you do know
these things that are about to tell you you're gonna
still run into the problem of like well Leo how
how do I get these things I don't know how
to get these things you're talking about and that of
course is a problem but I really want to focus
on the Watts here right because if your wants are
misguided that means your entire strategy you know I'm talking
about being a strategic thinker if you're trying to be
a strategic thinker your whole strategy is based upon what
you want so if what you want is wrong that
means your tire strategy is wrong that means you can
waste a decade of your life doing something that you
shouldn't be doing in the first place right because you
have the wrong initial objective imagine if you were a
general on a battlefield and your your desire was something
very very misguided your desire was not to defeat the
enemy but your desire was something like to go show
off in front of the enemy right or your desire
was to humiliate the enemy or your desire was to
torture the enemy something like that if that was your
military objective your entire strategy would be very different from
just winning the battle you see so um you would
be a crazy psychotic military strategist and that would probably
get you killed very quickly because there's not much room
for showboating when it comes to life and death and
war so but you know the same thing applies to
your own life too to be good strategic thinker you
have to first and foremost really question your wants your
desires get very clear about them and make sure that
they're very very authentic and that they're really going to
lead you to where you want to go because they're
the starting point of everything else everything else branches off
from this one point all right so enough belaboring that
let's give you the list here are the things that
you want that you don't know that you want firstly
you want existence to feel magical again you want existence
to feel magical again the way that it felt to
you when you were first born when you were a
baby or when you were a toddler if you can
recall back to when you were like five six seven
years old all of reality was magical to you all
of it was beautiful even the stuff that was boring
or ugly or something you didn't like it was still
magical to you it was fresh to you and then
over the decades that magic was beaten out of you
through a lot of bad social conditioning and simply by
just becoming acclimated right acclimated to reality to the point
where where you are now reality to you is very
boring it's very mundane you take it completely for granted
you're not even consciously connected to the fact that what
you're alive inside of is you're inside this ball of
magic everything that's happening around you is pure magic but
you've totally lost touch with this and even if right
now you hear what I'm saying and you try to
intellectually see what I'm saying like oh yeah Leo I
can kind of sort of remember back to my past
where it was that way and maybe I can kind
of like conceptually try to force it now upon reality
like I could try to be in the present moment
right now but see you really can't you can't you
can't you don't have the ability you can't look upon
reality with fresh eyes the eyes of a child you
can't do that but this is something you desperately want
this is something that would come lately transform the quality
of your life if you could get it but you
have no idea how to get it you have no
idea how to see the beauty of very simple things
you have no idea of how to just look at
a tree and see its pure beauty and its magic
you have no idea how to look at the face
of your girlfriend or boyfriend or your spouse and to
see them the way you saw them the very first
time that you saw them and fell in love with
them you have no idea how to just take a
cup of water that you drink in the morning or
your cup of coffee and how to just sip that
water as though you're sipping water for the first time
so that it feels magical to you imagine what your
life would be like if you could get this ability
back that would be powerful that would be profound wouldn't
that be something worth working towards if we're talking about
self-actualization goals self-improvement goals you know we have to ask
ourselves what are the goals that are really truly worthwhile
and what I'm suggesting to you is that this list
that I'm giving you right now this is sort of
the ultimate list this is the stuff that should be
forefront forefront as you're strategizing going forward and yet you're
probably hearing this list for the very first time in
your life you've probably never thought about this before and
even if you have you thought about it for a
minute and then it slipped by you and you forgot
about it and nothing happened nothing happened you're not actually
able to realize this it's just [ __ ] words
to you just ideas but we have to start somewhere
so let's just start with ideas and then we'll see
how strategic you can be in acquiring these things everything
I'm telling you here on this list is acquirable so
it's doable the next thing you really want but that
you have no idea that you want is you want
things to be completely effortless in your life you want
to wake up and just go through your day and
you want everything just to flow just flows there's no
resistance there's no fighting with yourself there's no trying to
convince yourself there's no forcing or whipping yourself into a
frenzy to get something done there's no guilt there's no
rules it's just like it's effortless its flow it just
happens naturally you want whatever you're doing in your life
to unfold seamlessly effortlessly naturally think about that think about
how great your life would be if that was in
place for you if you were able to realize that
I think about how far away from that your day
currently is your typical day how close is it to
being completely effortless probably not very and yet maybe this
is something that's possible maybe this is something that you
could work towards with self development another thing that you
want that you have no idea that you want is
you want to be authentic you want to act speak
think and behave authentically spontaneously in an uninhibited fashion so
uninhibited that we might almost say like you're slightly intoxicated
but not intoxicated with alcohol or some kind of drug
but you're intoxicated simply with kind of like the again
the magic of life and just the playfulness of life
right you're playful in the way that you do everything
because you're doing it authentically and you're very uninhibited right
so you don't have those fears in the back of
your mind you don't have those worries you don't have
you don't have like reservations about all what are they
going to think of me and what's going to happen
if this happens and all that all that typical stuff
that happens in your mind none of that is happening
you're just behaving like out out out out like an
extrovert you're just behaving out and you're not worrying about
what's going on inside your mind this is kind of
spontaneous authentic behavior and you're doing this in your relationships
you're doing this with work you're doing this well you
everything everything in your life from the moment you wake
up to the moment you go to bed you're just
being authentic imagine that imagine what that would mean for
you how significant that would be if you had that
in your life if you were able to realize that
and also consider how far away from that you are
right now probably quite far and what's interesting is that
the way you go about being authentic is still inauthentic
so there's degrees of authenticity and what I'm talking about
here is like the ultimate rock-bottom of authenticity so I'm
not talking about being authentic as a way to manipulate
others or to get something you want or to be
authentic for some sort of neurotic reasons see a lot
of people try to be authentic for neurotic reasons I
mean really like authentic authentic not fake authentic authentic authentic
and what is that you might ask well how do
you distinguish the two well that's tricky that's tricky that's
something you could work towards I'm not here discussing with
you how to actually get these things because before we
can talk about how to get these things we first
have to address the fact that you don't want these
things not really I mean these things sound nice while
I'm telling them to you but you don't really want
these things these things are not at the forefront of
your mind you want other stupid things like money or
relationships or sex or success or knowledge you want these
things you don't want these things that I'm telling you
I mean you do deep down but you don't know
see we're simultaneously dealing with your authentic desires and your
inauthentic desires and your inauthentic desires are in the way
of your authentic desires so let's not put the cart
before the horse let's not worry about how to get
these things yet I'll tell you how to get these
things in the future and you know I've already shot
episodes in the past that tell you how to get
some of these things so don't worry about that worry
more about what you're strategizing towards I want you to
become aware that you're not strategizing you're not seriously strategizing
towards these things that I'm listing right now you're not
so let's keep going though uh the other thing you
really want but don't know that you want is you
want a dispassionate mind a dispassionate mind what does this
mean sounds like I'm telling you that you want to
be a robot you want to be highly rational and
mechanical and unemotional but that's not what I'm telling you
at all in fact that's a complete bastardization of what
I'm telling you a dispassionate mind is a mind that
does not cling or need anything it's detached but this
does not mean it's not emotional very different very different
but what you want is you want this kind of
dispassionate mind this kind of mind that treats everything in
reality evenly we might also call this an economist mind
a mind that has equanimity with everything with pleasure and
with pain and with boredom and with the highs and
the lows with the good and the bad and the
ugly and everything right treats everything dispassionately now this is
a very counterintuitive thing to want because what most people
want what you probably want is you want the exact
opposite of that when you think about it it's like
no Leo I actually want to be I want to
be passionate I want to love the good stuff and
I want to not want the bad stuff no but
see that's what you usually do that's what everybody does
that's what the bum sitting on the street corner begging
for money does what's rare is to have a dispassionate
mind that's very rare and that's something you actually deeply
authentically are searching for but you don't know yet this
is what you're searching for and you have no idea
about how to acquire it in fact you fear it
you worry about you worry about Leo if I have
it a dispassionate mind what does that mean for my
life you know will that mean I won't love my
kids or my my girlfriend or my boyfriend or my
family or will that mean that I'll just be a
boring person with no personality Sal what you mean and
and see that just that demonstrates to you that you
haven't really penetrated into what I'm saying it because that's
not what I mean another sub component of this point
about dispassionate mind is that you want to be totally
unattached from any ideology unattached from any ideology this means
that you have no intellectual position to defend of any
kind you have no scientific position to defend no historical
position no religious position no spiritual position no political position
no economic position just no intellectual positions at all you
want to be positioned less with no beliefs to defend
this means totally under Matic this means totally open-minded now
you might think that you already have that but you
don't have that that takes some real serious deep [
__ ] work to get what you have is you
have the opposite of that you have a bunch of
pet theories and cosmologies and metaphysical ideas that you love
to defend and you will [ __ ] fight you
will waste hours of your life on forums and on
internet chat rooms and with your friends talking and discussing
and debating this [ __ ] as though it [
__ ] matter at all philosophy politics religion science evolution
history you will [ __ ] fight over this [
__ ] like a child um what you really really
want is you want to stop doing that but also
you have no idea how to stop doing that and
also some of your pet ideas are such pet ideas
to you you love them so much that you're not
willing to give them up you'll say leo yeah maybe
maybe you got a point here but you know my
notions of God you know I don't wanna give those
up and you know my notions about you know what
we should do about about poverty and about the environment
politically speaking I don't want to give those up you
know those are good notions and and my notions about
science you know Leo science or rationality or mathematics or
you know some philosophical principle you know these are very
important I don't want to give that up well that's
your problem you see that's your foolishness that's your foolishness
you haven't realized yet how how much suffering cling to
all these ideologies creates for you and how it disconnects
you from reality this can actually from reality another thing
you really want but you have no idea that you
want is you want to be fully sober fully sober
what does this mean this means I don't mean intoxicants
here like chemicals and alcohol I mean you want to
be so conscious and so aware that the best word
I can come up for it is you're lucid you're
lucid it's as though you woke up in the middle
of a dream and you realize that you're dreaming but
this happens not in your dreams but in reality right
you're so conscious that you're lucid you're so conscious that
it's as though like everything that's happening around you is
happening kind of in slow motion everything is very still
and you're looking through the world as though the world
is mad at a glass this is a pretty powerful
experience that one could have especially if you do a
lot of consciousness work a lot of awareness work such
as meditation the paws on a-- self-inquiry and so forth
you can have these kinds of experiences but um another
way to phrase it is you basically just want to
look upon reality without having a single thought about it
so it doesn't matter what's happening in reality doesn't matter
where you are doesn't matter who you're with you just
want to be wherever you are and just experience it
with not a single thought not a single judgment not
a single theory just total quiet but see you can't
do that because your mind won't [ __ ] shut
up your mind just keeps yep yep yep yep yep
yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep if
you just yapping away yapping away and even when you
try to silence that it just yaps more interest you
have so you just you can't stop yapping you try
to silence this one you create another yapper now you
got to yappers in your mind yep yep yep yep
yep yep you got two of them you got double
the yapping when you try to stop yapping then you
can create three of them there's no end to it
because you don't have control over your mind so that's
something you really want when and if you ever do
experience reality without a single thought that will be so
powerful to you that you will go like oh that's
what Leo was talking about oh my god this is
what I was searching for my entire life and I
didn't know that this is what I was searching for
that will happen to you with every item on this
list that I'm talking about see at first if you're
very unconscious if you're very underdeveloped what I'm talking about
will sound silly stupid foolish ridiculous if you a little
bit more developed a little bit more awareness than what
I'm saying will sound like oh yeah leo these are
these are good ideas how do I get them and
then if you become really developed and you really start
to tap into some of these things and you start
to get a little taste of them here and there
you'll say oh my god this is what life is
about I can't believe no one's told me about this
before I can't believe I've been wasting decades of my
life with all these other things I don't what are
all these other things that I was that I was
looking for like what the [ __ ] is this
relationships what the [ __ ] sex money success like
what the [ __ ] was I thinking that's what
will happen to you if you keep growing with me
here on this journey but let's continue another thing that
you want but you don't know that you want is
you want to be nobody I love this you want
to be nobody this is so [ __ ] counterintuitive
you don't want to be cool you don't want to
be this person you don't wanna be the successful guy
you don't want to be the guy who's who's great
with women you don't want to be the woman who's
very creative and and it has a great family you
don't want any of this you don't want to be
associated with anything you want to have zero identity that's
what you really want but you don't know that you
think that self-development is about developing a greater nicer cooler
hipper um more powerful identity you haven't realized yet that
the the goal of the game is to get rid
of your identity so that you are literally a nobody
you have no personal history you have no personal attachments
to the past or the future you have no attachments
to what you should behave like to what your personality
is to who you are whether you're a male or
a female or an introvert or an extrovert or whether
you're good at math or you're good at English or
whether you're a good student or whether you're a good
mechanic or whether you're a nerdy person or whether you're
a hipster person or whether you're gay or you're straight
or whether you're a Republican or a Democrat or whether
you're religious or you're atheistic or you're scientific or you're
intelligent or you're dumb or whatever kind of identity you've
created for yourself that you believe is you you ultimately
what you really want is you want to have none
of that you want to completely drop it so that
what remains is just a blank you want to be
a blank you want to be a nobody the way
that you were by the way if you can remember
when you were a child when you were five years
old you were basically a nobody you didn't know very
much about yourself you didn't identify very much with anything
about yourself you didn't think you were smart or stupid
you didn't think you were even like male or female
these things only came in later as artificial ideas that
you picked up from your parents and from your friends
and from school and all that kind of stuff right
but in the beginning you didn't have any of that
you were just you were just a blank experiencing reality
happening to it that's what you were and that's where
you want to get back to but that's so counterintuitive
because you built up this entire identity structure and now
anytime you even attempt to dismantle some piece of this
identity it's painful to you so when I tell you
to become nobody to you it's like oh my god
that's going to be scary and painful I don't want
to do that I love this part about myself and
I love this part I mean surely oh yeah that
part I don't like I'll get rid of that part
and this part here you know I don't like that
part either I'll get rid of that so I'm I'm
down Lee I'm down for getting rid of the stuff
I don't like but the stuff that I like the
stuff that's really me I'm going to keep that stuff
and what I'm telling you is know what you really
want is you want to get rid of all of
it especially all the great stuff about you very counter
to it another thing you want but you don't know
that you want is you want Samadhi what is Samadhi
Samadhi is a basically a Hindu term refers to a
state or an experience where you merge with the object
which you are observing or perceiving so literally it's a
state where you become the thing that you are observing
so if you're looking at a tree you can look
at with such high concentration and such lucidity of mind
that you realize that there is no such thing as
a you looking at a tree but that there just
is a tree and that that tree is you or
an aspect of you this is not an intellectual endeavor
this is not a belief system this is not an
ideology this is a this is a direct experience so
it's an experience that's as real as right now you
sitting there and thinking that you are you you're that
body sitting there thinking listening to me so as natural
as it feels to be you well it'll feel just
as natural to be the tree or not the tree
but the moon not the moon but the the lake
not the lake but the stone on the ground or
if you're listening to me me you'll become me if
you have a samadhi experience of me you will be
me literally not metaphorically not as a belief but you
will be me as a matter of fact so these
Samadhi experiences you can develop yourself to have them I
mean it takes a lot of concentration takes a lot
of meditation takes a lot of development but you can
develop your mind to the point where you have you
smadi experience and these Samadhi experiences they come in in
various degrees at first they start off very light then
they become deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and
deeper and these Samadhi experiences feel amazing they feel [
__ ] amazing they feel more amazing than an orgasm
or going out and partying with your friends or whatever
you know thing that you really love to do a
samadhi experience blows all that [ __ ] out of
the water when you have one it'll be like oh
my god this is what I've been searching for my
whole life and I didn't even know this [ __
] existed I've been missing out I can't believe no
one's told me about this why didn't nobody teach this
to me well one of the reasons is because you're
so [ __ ] closed-minded that you're you're you're going
to resist anyone teaching it to you so as I
teach it to you you already resist it another problem
is that you don't want to [ __ ] work
to get it you'll take it for free but you're
not going to work ahead of time you're not going
to strategize to actually grow yourself to get it so
that's why I don't have it that's why 99% of
people in society have never experienced the samadhi experience rather
sad considering that it's one of the UM one of
the most beautiful experiences you can have it live rather
sad that you have not experienced it yet don't you
think another thing that you really want but you don't
know that you want is you want truth truth truth
with a capital T now what that is is a
mysterious thing hard to put into words so mmm if
you haven't listened to me before this your first time
hearing about this kind of stuff then you probably will
not come away knowing what I mean when I say
truth but if you have been following me then you
might kind of suspect what I mean by truth true
that's actually what's [ __ ] true what's actually real
right what you want is truth independent of anything else
truth at all costs that's what you want that's what
you really want but you don't know this you are
lost pursuing survival and thriving and success that's what you're
pursuing that's what your life is about thriving comfort security
success titillation that's what your life is about your life
is not about truth what you ultimately really want is
you want a life that's completely committed to truth but
first problem is you have no idea what truth is
second problem is you already believe you have the truth
so when I tell this to you you're like olio
truth yeah of course yeah I acknowledge that I like
truth and I want truth and truth is important and
that's why I already have it no no no you
don't understand what I mean by truth truth is something
you you have no idea so imagine everything you know
imagine everything you've ever experienced now classify all that as
untruth that's what you've got right now what truth is
truth is like a [ __ ] question mark to
you you have no idea what truth is and I'm
not going to tell you because you have to discover
for yourself but once you find it you'll realize ah
course of [ __ ] course yeah this is exactly
what I've wanted my whole life if only I had
this twenty years earlier oh man I wish I had
this 20 years earlier but I'm glad I at least
have it now that's what you want and this truth
is not a philosophy this truth is not a belief
this truth is not an ideology remember we're removing you
away from ideologies so truth is not an ideology so
what is truth well truth is what remains when you
remove all the ideology this is something you can have
it's something that you deeply want but that you don't
know you want this truth will cure you of all
the [ __ ] that you think you want once
you have truth a lot of the false stuff that
you want will just fall away it'll become irrelevant but
the one of the biggest problems you can have on
your journey towards truth is well you're going to set
conditions upon truth you're going to say like well yeah
Leo I want truth but only if X Y Z
you're gonna set conditions upon it you give me like
yeah I want truth you know leo but you know
I'm not willing to leave my relationship to find truth
and I'm not willing to quit my job and I'm
not willing to sit down and meditate for an hour
a day and I'm not willing to go to this
to this retreat that you're telling me to go to
and I'm not willing to read 20 books that you're
telling me to read I'm not willing to do any
of that stuff I will acquire truth my own way
I'll just sit back and I'll just do some armchair
philosophy and all arrive at truth and that will be
my truth leo you don't know what my truth is
Leo that's my truth ah no that's that's not what
I mean by truth that's a total bastardization of truth
what I mean is actual truth truth through the capital
T the truth that you have no idea about it
all yet you wanted you really really want it but
you have no idea that you want to get another
thing that you want but you don't know that you
want is you want to be a benevolent force in
the world a benevolent force in the world what does
that mean that means you want to be a force
of good but I don't mean good in like the
classical religious Christian sense I don't mean in the sense
of like good versus evil not in that sense this
is a force of benevolent force what it really means
is like you just want to be a force of
good a force of compassion a force of giving a
force of contribution like coming from a place of contribution
to society and to humanity and to reality at large
you want to be that kind of force now how
do you be a force of benevolence well there's a
lot of different ways and for different people it'll mean
different things you know for some people it will mean
being an artist and producing great art for other people
it'll mean helping out like actually going and helping out
in a soup kitchen or something and for other people
it'll mean shooting self-help videos the way I do or
for other people it'll mean helping to teach others in
the classroom or for others or living being a good
doctor and helping to cure them of their broken leg
or their giving them some surgery when they need it
you know there's a lot of different ways to be
a benevolent force and basically what this connects to is
my concept of life purpose so I have a whole
course on life purpose if you've taken my course then
that whole course is basically showing you how do you
become a benevolent force in the way that is most
authentic to you because this here is a very personal
thing right and there's a million different ways that you
can be a benevolent force and only a handful of
those ways will be right for you because you're a
unique individual right but you want to be this benevolent
force and in fact you want to be a benevolent
force to such a degree that you're no longer working
for yourself you're no longer worrying about yourself you spend
all your time working and worrying about how be a
benevolent force for others or for the environment or you
know whatever kind of impact you're making in the world
you become believable benevolent force to such a degree that
your just life becomes an outpouring a gift giving just
like benevolence pouring out of you at every one of
your pores it just comes out and seeps out effortlessly
just comes out and just kind of gives gives gives
gives gives and it just it's just like the love
of giving in whatever your favorite mode of giving is
that's what you want but this is probably the exact
opposite of what you've currently got cuz currently what you're
doing is you're obsessing about how to take take take
take take take take it's all about taking how do
I take and get what I what I need you
know how do I take the money how do I
take the fame how do I take the status how
do I take the approval the love give it all
to me how do I take everything how do I
take the knowledge and information how do i hoard it
all and keep it for myself and make myself better
that's what you're currently doing but that's not going to
work that's a far inferior goal to becoming a true
benevolent force how do you become a benevolent force well
um check out the life purpose course that will help
you a lot but also I'll talk more about in
the future and the final thing that you want that
you don't know that you want is you want a
simple natural lifestyle simple natural lifestyle what does this mean
well it means that your current lifestyle is extremely complicated
and polluted in many ways by a lot of unnecessary
and unhealthy and kind of just distracting noise a lot
of it comes from our culture television internet social media
smartphones computers partying clubs drugs alcohol you know all this
stuff shopping acquiring of possessions doing stuff always being busy
in your life getting involved with relationships and and sex
and all this this becomes very messy and pollute a
source of pollution in your life um you know the
hecticness of your work and how polluted your life becomes
because you're so focused on achievement climbing the corporate ladder
or uh attaining some kind of prestige or status or
reputation so you're pouring all this energy into all this
noise right your lifestyle you think that by doing more
of this [ __ ] by filling your life with
all this technology and all these gadgets and all this
kind of stuff that your life is becoming enriched and
that's somehow you know it's richer it's more fun it's
more interesting and that's that's what life is about right
um you don't realize yet that actually uh the great
life comes about when you pare away all those things
right you become kind of like a ruthless editor of
your life you cut away all that [ __ ]
you get rid of it you just you distill down
and you edit your life down it's just something very
very simple very basic more organic more natural less polluted
less attached to kind of the tentacles of mainstream culture
probably means eating healthier living healthier being out in nature
more connecting with it more it means doing less [
__ ] and just being sitting and being and soaking
in what life is it means making your lifestyle very
simple it makes it means having a free and relaxed
schedule where you'd have to be doing all this [
__ ] running around like a [ __ ] chicken
with its head cut off all day long and then
doing that Monday through Friday and even on the weekends
just like pairing all of it down and just making
your life very very simple almost as though like imagine
if you lived on a deserted island Robinson Crusoe style
just like you are trapped on a deserted island it's
a very small island there's not a lot of stuff
to do there there's no amusement parks there's no cellphones
there's no computers there's no [ __ ] friends there's
no family there's like [ __ ] nothing you don't
even have a pet this island is so deserted that
you don't even have like a dog or a [
__ ] cat you got nothing it's just like you
sitting on this island what do you do you eat
you you wash yourself uh you just sit there and
you live that's what life is it's just being you're
just being you're being on an island right you go
around hunting for food and just kind of like smelling
the flowers and just enjoying the sunsets and then going
to sleep on the beach and then you wake up
the next morning you do it again it's just like
it seems like a very boring kind of life but
remember remember the prior points that I said I said
as the first point that your life I mean that
reality becomes magical again right so don't be scared off
by this very simple natural sort of lifestyle because you've
also got these other points working in your favor all
of them come together as package and when life becomes
magical to you every single moment then this kind of
simple natural lifestyle becomes highly highly appealing you no longer
need to fill the void with all these polluting distractions
the way that you currently do so that's the list
those are the things that you want now notice that
what you want is not raw pleasure these things I
was talking about they're not about pleasure it's not hedonism
counter-intuitively the pursuit of raw pleasure the attempt to maximize
pleasure which we might call hedonism although that's not what
the word meant originally in the past but that's what
it means now this this notion of hedonism it doesn't
work right in backfires the human psyche is too calm
x2 allow a hedonistic strategy to actually be the most
advantageous doesn't work that way notice that I said nothing
about money sex relationships I mean I did talk about
these things but I talk about them as as the
things that you don't really want so these are things
you don't want you don't want money you don't want
sex you don't want relationships yeah you don't want to
look good you don't want to be taller you don't
want to be more handsome you don't want success you
don't want status reputation and position these things are really
irrelevant to you you don't want physical objects you don't
want technology you don't want gadgets you don't want entertainment
you don't want movies and video games you don't want
better porn you don't want more knowledge that's a big
trap more knowledge you don't want that you don't even
want self-actualization ironically you don't really want these things these
things are all distractions from the core 10 things that
I told you about here now the question is will
you be wise enough to understand this communication because the
tragedy is that you are so lost right now that
you don't even realize that you're lost that's how lost
you are you're so lost that you actually believe that
you're headed in the right direction that's how lost you
are it's worse than being lost it's being lost plus
layer upon layer upon layer of denial and delusion that's
your current position and now you start to see a
little bit about why true self development is so challenging
because you would assume that it's like oh Willy oh
I watched one of your episodes and what you're helping
me to do leo is you're helping me to achieve
my goals but that's not how I help you if
I did that I would just drive you and enable
your [ __ ] delusion Drive you deeper into your
delusion what I need to do to really help you
is to get you to realize that your goals are
[ __ ] stupid that they're childish immature and neurotic
and that they are leading you in many cases in
the exact opposite direction of where you should be going
that's how I can help you is to help you
to start just to start the little taste of the
truth of that notice that nobody ever talks about this
nobody tells you this have you noticed this is very
interesting in society nobody will just kind of stop you
dead in your [ __ ] tracks and tell you
what the [ __ ] are you doing this thing
is not right for you like if you're going to
college nobody you can go to college for eight years
getting a PhD degree you know from the very beginning
to the very end eight years and nobody not even
once will sit you down and say what the [
__ ] are you doing this is not what you
should be doing nobody will ever do that for you
including yourself most likely or if you're at work and
you started a business and you're running this business and
you know you're earning millions of dollars nobody will ever
come up to you say what the [ __ ]
are you doing this is stupid stop doing that stop
doing this whole thing this entire thing is totally [
__ ] wrong stop it this will never ever happen
even spiritual teachers like you can go to a [
__ ] Zen master or you know some meditation teacher
some retreat leader somewhere whatever and generally what they do
is they take a very hands-off approach just like well
if you come to me and you want it really
bad yeah I'll give you some insights but you know
if you just tell me your life story I'm not
gonna tell you just [ __ ] stop just stop
like dead in your tracks thought that's [ __ ]
wrong you're doing it wrong like I don't see anybody
doing this right in a sense because it's kind of
considered impolite uh you know I mean Who am I
after all who am I to pry into your life
and tell you what's right and what's wrong for you
but then again who the [ __ ] are you
to know what's right and what's wrong for you I
mean you have no understanding of how your psychology works
you have no understanding of awareness or of congi of
you have almost no understanding of these things so who
the [ __ ] are you to set the agenda
for your life you see the problem here is that
you're like the captain of a ship who's totally [
__ ] clueless about the journey he's going on so
you're just fumbling through and the [ __ ] you're
trying is just like the the most stupid ideas that
come to you is what you try because hey it
came to me so [ __ ] I mean I
don't even know how to question I don't know any
better that's what's going on with you so if actualizado
helps you it probably helps you simply because my philosophy
is that I do want to stop you and that
I do kind of want to pry into your life
because in a sense I know you way better than
you know yourself not because I know your particulars it's
because you're [ __ ] particulars you might think your
particulars are so special but they're not very [ __
] special your particulars are actually the common mistakes that
almost everybody makes its predictable you're predictable you're a machine
you're like a predictable machine you create the same kind
of problems and the same kind of stupidities that everybody
else creates and you just repeat them over and over
and over again in your life and how do I
know that because I am you I mean I'm the
same kind of machine I'm running the same software basically
with little differences but basically the same thing so kind
of like I've been where you're at I still am
where you're at I'm talking to myself as I'm talking
to you so yeah this is kind of like an
intervention this is where we sit you down and we
really have you re-examine your priorities your desires your goals
the seeds of your strategizing that's what we're questioning here
right because the strategies that you're currently creating are based
on false wants because the true wants are so [
__ ] counterintuitive that they it's like it's just you
can't you can't you try to grasp it and just
like slips out of your hands and you have a
lot of fear and resistance to your crew owns the
things you really want you're [ __ ] scared shitless
of actually realizing them believe it or not it's twisted
it's a very twisted mechanism your mind very twisted and
you know one day you will realize all these things
that I'm saying and they will seem extremely obvious to
you but it won't happen without years of you first
ignoring me you will ignore me and you will waste
probably decades of your life arguing with me denying me
resisting me avoiding the things I'm saying suppressing them tuning
it out all that stuff or maybe you won't maybe
you're so far gone that the most direct and the
most straightforward intervention which I'm doing right here even that
will not work maybe the [ __ ] wisest wisdom
of the entire [ __ ] universe that the wisdom
of sages and Zen masters and you know 50 years
of modern self-development and a hundred years of psychotherapy and
psychoanalysis and psychology studies all this [ __ ] the
best of the best that the entire universe has come
up with as a knowledge bank you know for the
last thirteen or fourteen billion years as the universe has
evolved right now is kind of like we're at the
forefront right we've got the best knowledge ever that we've
ever had maybe the best knowledge and the best wisdom
that we've ever had is not enough to correct your
[ __ ] course because you are that far gone
and for the most of you in fact for the
majority of you that is the case that is the
case and in that case I can't help you no
one can yeah maybe maybe we need to wait another
thousand or ten thousand years where there will be a
pill someone will invent a pill you take this pill
and it [ __ ] does what I say for
you because you're not capable of doing it yourself because
you're too [ __ ] stupid to myopic see myopic
you're myopic that's your [ __ ] problem you're short-sighted
you can see close but you can't see far maybe
someone will invent a pill one day that can solve
your conscious my opium but until then well it's all
