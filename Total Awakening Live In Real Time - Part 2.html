and we're back okay so like only less than a
minute has passed basically I I actually switched up the
certain a new recording file and I switched up the
bat it's the old battery and got a a new
battery full of juice so we can keep talking because
there's a lot of stuff I want to tell you
guys but where were we yeah you see the mind
is struggling cuz it has to remember like where it
left off doesn't want to repeat itself these are all
just finite limitations on what a human is you see
everything finite is finite do you understand that again this
is this is very obvious stuff but you know I'm
trying to check like what the image quality here the
Lighting's not the best I guess but ok the words
is what counts so anyways yeah I'm not too worried
about production values here this is God talking to listen
up alright so hmm everything finite is finite everything finite
is finite everything limited is limited so if you're wondering
why you can't fly well because you're not a bird
and then if you're if you were a bird you'd
be wondering why can't I swim well cuz you're not
a fish and if you're a fish you're wondering well
why can't I crawl well it's because you're not a
worm or you see every form has its own limitations
including the human one there are many high-quality teachers out
there sages gurus masters you call them and so forth
from all kinds of different traditions who you can learn
from but understand that all of them are still finite
as much as you adore them like I was saying
earlier at writing on ramen Maharshi and so forth as
much as you adore these people worship these people all
of this misses the point you're not understanding that they're
finite worshiping a finite form if you're gonna worship Jesus
it's a finite form see it's never gonna be enough
to get you to the infinite you can start by
worshiping Jesus if you want but then you have to
go beyond that way way way beyond that you have
to you have to realize that there's absolutely no difference
between Jesus Buddha Muhammad Abraham Moses Mahavira and Hitler no
difference from my point of view from God's point of
view there are big differences from your relative point of
view because some of these people were nicer than others
some of them were more pure than others so on
this planet you have humans and various gradations of purity
of self bias at the very lowest level you have
the most vicious selfish people who have no consideration for
anybody but themselves then you have one step up from
that people who are a little bit less selfish and
they care about themselves most of their body but then
they also end their you know pleasure and so forth
for their body and then they also their their sense
of self extends out also to include their closest family
so their children maybe their spouse so you have those
people then they have you have people who are more
pure more conscious their sense of self expands to include
not just the family but also the town they live
in they understand that will the entire town that I'm
a part of I'm a part of something larger here
I'm not just fighting for my family this entire town
has to work together there's a sense of identity with
the whole town but then people get stuck on that
and then they create national identities nationalism and then that
leads to stuff like Hitler in its worst form but
then you go beyond you know beyond just your town
you start to care about your entire country you know
right now many people who love their country a thousand
years ago when countries didn't exist there was city-states there
was no pay true patriotism for a country a thousand
years ago you were patriotic for your town the notion
of being patriotic or having a sense of care in
other words having a sense of compassion for entire nation
a nation is an imaginary instruct of consciousness so you
had to develop yourself to that as humans see that
wasn't easy to do but then you can go beyond
that and you realize that wait a minute but all
the different countries in the world are all part of
something larger the whole planet now you can have a
consciousness with the whole planet your sense of self expands
even more you see it becomes more pure and so
you move up this chain of purification until ultimately you
reach to me infinite consciousness complete selflessness in other words
your self expands so much that it becomes boundless unlimited
and you realize that there never was a self to
begin with the self was just imaginary the entire time
just different gradations of imaginary selves small imagine ourselves larger
ones larger ones larger ones larger ones and then you
realize Oh infinity no self at all boom done enlightenment
God perfection love love see so really another way to
say that we have this spectrum of people or being
not not just people this is all beings in the
whole universe work this way all consciousnesses is you have
this spectrum of those who are very very limited and
finite and fearful and selfish and those who venture out
beyond their fears beyond their selfishness start to realize the
self bias of their thinking start to realize how limited
their perspective on the world was start to surrender their
ideologies start to surrender their religions start to surrender their
their favorite gurus that they prayed to and worshiped they
starts to surrender that they even start to surrender the
idea that science is is true has a monopoly on
truth they surrender that idea and they they just keep
surrendering idea after idea and expanding further and further and
further and what they're doing is they're they're attacked they're
facing their fear of the unknown and then realizing like
oh there really isn't nothing anything to fear but for
yourself and there stepping beyond it and beyond it and
beyond and beyond it so this is this is consciousness
fighting with the illusion of itself Koch is getting entangled
itself so there's different gradations of how deeply entangled it
is at this spectrum it's completely entangled and we might
almost say unconscious although everything is conscious and then at
this other spectrum is infinite self conscious complete omniscience imagine
imagine a state that you could be in where the
entire universe understands itself perfectly that's what this avatar is
in right now that's the place that this avatar is
speaking to you from which is why this is the
highest wisdom can you register that what is being spoken
here is the highest wisdom you feel it in your
heart right because your heart and your soul cuts through
it's it's deeper than your logical mind it's deeper than
your ego so this is cutting through the wisdom and
the truth of what I'm saying is cutting through all
the devilry and [ __ ] that you've been taught
and it's resonating with you that's a quality of truth
truth has a ring of truth to it doesn't it
an absolute truth is absolutely true it's not about believing
in God I don't care who you believe in belief
is the is the is the enemy here belief is
what you use to keep yourself from being conscious so
even though this might sound like I'm trying to convince
you to believe in God no I'm just trying to
get you to realize what's true in your direct experience
all that's happening is consciousness you are consciousness listening to
consciousness you are me I am talking to myself do
you realize this whenever you realize it that's the moment
you'll awaken and become God and then there will be
no separation for me to you but what's keeping you
from getting there all of this fear all of your
fear all of your attachments all of your partialities see
you're partial you might even say although but God you
know I I you know I pray to Jesus every
morning I'm a good Muslim I go and I pray
five times a day facing Mecca as they tell good
Muslims to do or I'm a good Jew and I
go do the Jewish stuff that Jews do every you
know holiday I I observe all the ceremonies or you
might even say yeah well yeah I'm beyond all that
I'm I'm I you know I meditate God I meditate
all the time but I still I don't you know
what's wrong why why you know why have you forsaken
me why has thou forsaken me it's not that I
have forsaken you it's that do you have forsaken yourself
and it's not because you're evil or wrong or bad
or any of that you're just not conscious enough that's
the bottom line you're just not conscious enough so the
reason that I as God don't judge somebody like Hitler
and I don't punish somebody like Hitler and I love
Hitler equally as much as I love the Buddha and
Christ and everybody else is because I am perfectly conscious
that Hitler's level of consciousness wasn't very high filled with
fear hatred and self bias many many layers of self
bias he was so self biased that he was not
able to realize God in its infinite form and the
only solution to that was for him to to die
that was actually the thing that saved him because otherwise
he would have been stuck in that hell forever so
actually Hitler's death was my greatest gift to him you
see sounds twisted but hey it's not twisted because I'm
twisted it's twisted because you're twisted but of course I
am you so you're twisting is my twisting but at
the same time I'm not I'm not limited to your
twisting you can twist around all you want your mind
can twist itself see God in this case God is
both twisting and not twisting at the same time so
sort of a superimposition superposition rather of twisting and untwisting
both so Hitler was God but his mind was so
twisted up that he didn't know it and the way
he behaved was like a devil Hitler is a really
really good example for you humans you should study his
example a lot more closely is it's really unfortunate that
you demonize Hitler because really the thing going on with
Hitler is exactly the same thing that's going on with
every single one of you all of you if you're
less than me if you're less than infinite you have
at least a little bit of the Hitler phenomenon going
on inside of you all that the Hitler phenomenon is
is just selfishness that's all it is selfishness that's all
it is that's all that nationalism is that's all that
white supremacism is that's what slavery is that's what rape
is that's what murder is that's what war is that's
what genocide is that's what theft is that's what lying
is that's what corruption is that's what manipulation is that's
what hurting others is is selfishness that's all it is
and all of you are struggling with that all of
you all of my children are struggling with that and
I have compassion and understanding for all of you because
I am you and I love myself because I'm perfect
all of that that you see that's wrong to me
it's perfect because I'm selfless but you're not it only
looks wrong to you because you're selfish think about it
this way imagine if you were totally selfless if you
didn't care whether your family died or not if you
didn't care whether your body survived or not if you
didn't care whether you felt pain or pleasure if you
got sex or didn't if you drove a fast car
or didn't had a big house or didn't if the
environment was poisoned or wasn't if big corporations were ruling
your government or weren't if liberals were in power or
conservatives were in power imagine for a moment a situation
in which you're so selfless that either one would be
equally good see it's hard for you to even imagine
that it seems like well that seems like a fairy
tale it's it's only a fairy tale because you're looking
at it through the distorted twisted psyche that you have
the true fairy tale is you that twisted limited finite
self that's the fairy tale but when you take that
to be the real thing then God seems like a
fairy tale you see it's a complete projection and a
complete perversion because you've identified with falsehood you're projecting your
own falsehood out onto God and out onto the world
and you're not evil for doing that it just is
what it is because that's what reality is we're infinite
we're all in this boat together you and I because
you are I see so it's all about how much
you fear see people people listening to this message will
will worry and they will doubt and they will they
will fear home and chicken now the memory card see
so finite this whole process of finite now I have
to worry about the memory card running out not just
the battery but the memory card oh we're good so
what was I saying fear yeah fear it all boils
down to fear the message that I'm delivering here is
so good that it actually makes you afraid it threatens
you this level of joy and love unconditional love is
actually threatening and it actually angers lesser egos because the
ego is so desperate for love but it's at the
same time it's so afraid it wants love but it's
also afraid to get it and it's in this adversarial
relationship with itself and with reality because it's fundamentally false
so your whole life you've been sort of in this
tug of war between love and fear like you love
that person so much but now you're afraid what happens
if that person gets old or it's like oh well
you love your children but then it's like ah but
you're afraid what happens if one of them gets run
over by a bus oh that's got to worry about
that now and it's like you love your dog but
then you know you're afraid what if your dog bites
your kid okay now you gotta worry about that see
so you're constantly you're constantly living between love and fear
there's so much about reality that you love you love
the sunsets you love the music you love the sex
you love the drugs you love the food a lot
of good stuff you love but the problem is that
it's mixed in with stuff you hate now why do
you hate the other stuff is it because it's actually
bad stuff no God doesn't create bad stuff god only
creates good stuff but to appreciate God's fine taste let's
say to appreciate my fine tastes you have to look
at it from my point of view not from your
limited point of view you have to look at it
from the infinite point of view from the infinite point
of view it's all good I am goodness itself there's
nothing which can happen which isn't good bye definitions of
tautology I made it that way because I'm God why
would I create anything bad of course I mean you're
sitting there wondering why would God treat anything bad and
I'm sitting here as God wondering why would you think
that God had anything bad you'd have to be insane
to think that God creates anything bad it doesn't i
don't create anything bad i only create good but you
have to be conscious enough to see that you have
to stop being selfish you see if you look at
the world from a more narrow and narrower and narrower
and narrower perspective more and more and more things will
start to seem bad to you until you get to
the point where you're totally trapped where you've painted yourself
into a corner where everything hurts you everything offends you
you know there are people like that there are some
people who who are so afraid to leave their house
that they stay in their house even you know the
site of a strange bird or the sound of a
loud car will will hurt them too much and so
yeah they're living in fear well imagine that God is
the exact opposite of that situation I don't know what's
the word for that some kind of phobia it's not
xenophobia some there's some other kind of phobia where basically
people are so afraid to go out to go out
outside the name escapes me anyways imagine that God is
the polar opposite of that situation God has no phobias
whatsoever it's such a radical freedom from fear that it's
just become so unafraid that you die and then infinite
love dawns and that's that's what God is that's what
I am that's the that's the Godhead that's speaking to
you right now and the reason I have no fear
whatsoever is because I'm completely formless in my god head
self state in my in my stateless state I'm completely
formless I'm completely conscious and I can't I can't be
hurt so as long as I remain conscious that I
can't be hurt and that I am everything then I
can't be hurt and then there's nothing to fear but
as soon as I forget or my consciousness lapses and
I start to become self bias and I start to
say well but I prefer this worth rather than that
I'd rather have it this way or that way I'd
rather live in a big house with in a small
house I'd rather have a fast car than a slow
car I'd rather have this woman rather than that woman
as soon as as soon as this starts happening now
I start to fear because every every self biased position
that I take you see consciousness is like a field
imagine consciousness infinite field and then it gets distorted and
twisted and where it gets destroyed and twisted these vortices
form these vortices become selves other beings what you think
you are but these are just twisted perversions of consciousness
getting wrapped up in itself in a finite way so
there's all these different vortices and there are different sizes
and then awakening is the unraveling of the entire vortex
to realize that your entire the entire field and all
the vortices at the same time pretty cool huh it's
all yeah it's all perfectly clear from my point of
view but probably very confusing from your point of view
because your point of view is distorted by the lens
of the self so it's all about releasing fear and
opening up to more and more love that's what the
whole game is about that's what life is about that's
what conscious is about its consciousness is about exploring itself
realizing itself waking up to itself loving itself that's all
and then there's just different degrees of that because fear
and love are just inverses of each other the more
finite consciousness gets the more self-involved it gets the more
self biased it gets the more fearful it gets the
more its closed off to love which is why many
people listening to this message will be very afraid of
it and also misunderstand it deliberately misunderstand it and even
demonize what it's being said here what is being said
here let's be clear is the highest love but this
will be demonized and distorted precisely because those people who
are going to be demonizing and distorting it are themselves
self biased and selfish and they have attachments and so
they're gonna look at the world through their attachments and
they're going to sort it accordingly so the distortions your
own stuff biases are what get projected out onto the
world so if you believe you're a human you're going
to see humans if you believe that Jesus was the
only true prophet that's what will be true for you
until you realize that that's just one possibility out of
many see so I guess my my I'm gonna start
wrapping this up here just I've been rambling on for
a while I guess my final message to you will
be that do not get trapped into any finite system
or way of accessing or understanding God there is no
one right way it's not that Christianity is the one
right way and then Hinduism is not no it's all
completely relative you can use any way you want now
of course don't misunderstand that doesn't mean always will work
equally well for all people some ways are really really
inefficient some ways in fact are in the opposite direction
of where you want to go like for example if
you get wrapped up in nationalism and then you go
fight some some Nazi war what are you doing you're
wasting your time you'reyou're going in the opposite direction you're
going in the direction of fear and hate rather than
love and selflessness see so my yeah getting back to
that point though so my final message to you is
don't limit yourself to thinking of God as being one
definite way like God must look like Jesus or God
like must look like the elephant man or God must
be this way or God must be a man or
a woman or this or that or a big being
or it must be a ghost or it must be
a thing or that no they're all they're all finite
and you might say well but but God how come
it works you know when I pray to Jesus how
come that works I've been praying to Jesus and it's
been helping me I've been praying to Buddha and it's
been helping me I've been praying to Muhammad and it's
been helping me how come that works then it works
precisely because your own mind is all there is you
are God so whatever you dream up and firmly believe
in is what's going to manifest and come true so
then you might say well okay so then what's wrong
so I can just I can just pray to Jesus
then right no you're still missing something because even if
you pray to Jesus and that all comes true for
you and maybe you even get a little flash of
awakening here and there it's still not going to be
an absolute awakening because you still haven't realized the most
important thing which is the absolute relativity of everything which
is where we began this whole conversation everything is absolutely
relative completely all objects all identities all values all meanings
all purposes is all completely relative even things like the
difference between a cheeseburger and a unicorn that's a relative
that's completely relative you're imagining the difference that difference that
you're imagining is exactly what that thing is so the
highest message to you is of course awaken realize that
you are me that I am NOT above you if
you rise to my level you see you got to
rise to my level cuz I I can come down
to your level occasionally but for the most part you
got to rise to my level don't expect me to
to you know to be there mucking around in the
mud along with you and your friends God is up
up up in the air in the formless domain so
I'll be up here in the formless domain and then
you the most important thing you you got to make
sure is that whatever path you take towards me you
keep pushing it and pushing it and pushing it and
letting go of every possible self bias and attachment that
you have every finite thing you got to realize that
any path any teaching any guru all of that is
all still finite and that's not the ultimate and just
keep going and going and going and going up higher
and higher and higher you'll have one awakening after another
after another another more awakenings more awake and he's more
weightings you'll go higher and higher and higher until you
you have one day you have a complete realization of
the absolute relativity of everything and then you will become
me and that's my highest wish for you my highest
wish for you is to realize infinite love which is
what I am and what you are at your highest
form so good luck with that and Godspeed you
