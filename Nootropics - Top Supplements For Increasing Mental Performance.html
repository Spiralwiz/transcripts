[Music] let's talk about nootropics which are supplements for increasing
your mental performance there's an entire sort of field of
research where people online bio hacker types experiment with different
kinds of stacks and different kinds of supplements to see
what they can get out of their mental performance and
they have had some amazing results and so have I
and I want to share those with you in this
episode I'm gonna share with you over 15 of my
top nootropic supplements now a few warnings though before we
get into the weeds because this is a little bit
of technical topic this is not medical advice you have
to be very careful here and you have to consider
what your specific medical issues are what other kinds of
medication you might be taking before you go in and
just start eating a bunch of nootropics second warning is
that you must use caution and you must do research
into one each one of these substances for yourself don't
just take my word for it don't just take someone
else's word for it online you got to do the
research you've got to understand what this chemical is doing
that you're gonna be putting into your body also in
this episode I'm going to be sharing perhaps various brands
of supplements that I take this is not because I
am getting paid there's no paid promotions here and I
have no personal supplements to sell you I don't run
a supplement company or a business and I don't have
any affiliations with them alright so this is just me
sort of sharing my own research and experimentation that I've
done on myself and my own story is that I
have suffered from a hypo active thyroid which means a
lower thyroid chronic fatigue and brain fog and also I
do very cognitively intensive work all of the sexualize network
stuff it involves a lot of thinking a lot of
integrating a lot of reading and putting stuff together and
so this can be very taxing on the mind just
three or four hours of doing that can be very
taxing and so I started to notice just for myself
the reason that I got into nootropics is I started
to notice that my cognitive performance has felt like it
was declining and that's just compared to how it was
when I remember how I was in my early 20s
or even in high school like I was really really
sharp my intelligence was like super fluid super quick but
of course so what are the factors here the factors
are basically aging as you age and I'm now 33
and I'm getting older you gotta expect that your cognitive
performance will decrease and also it's it's about how much
do you tax yourself right is your work really cognitively
intense most people work people's work is not so for
me what I was really looking for and what I
discovered is that I need lubrication for my brain think
of it almost as though you're trying to run a
v8 engine in a performance sports car but you're running
it without oil without lubrication right maybe if you're running
it at low speeds and you're not really expecting a
lot of performance out of your car you can get
away with it but if you're really gonna be pushing
your mind to its limits then that's where the finding
some good lubrication is gonna be essential and so that's
sort of what I discovered starts taking some of these
different supplements and I started to see that like man
my mind my memory the way that I'm able to
connect dots and piece things together like it just it
works so much smoother when I'm taking these supplements now
you might say Oh leo but you do psychedelics so
could that be the reason for your cognitive decline no
this is something that I've been noticing even before I
started taking psychedelics and really you just you feel it
right you start to experiment with this stuff and you
feel that if you're really taxing your mind then you
got to be giving your mind the right nutrients that
it needs to grow new neural connections and you start
to do some of the research into how neurons grow
and there actually are supplements that will help your neurons
grow that will help to repair brain damage that will
help to give all the nutrients that you need to
think and you can really feel it now this is
not a cure for root causes so if you have
some serious problems in your life you got to work
on those and it's also very important they have a
proper diet for example because if you have a terrible
diet and you're not giving your brain the natural nutrients
it needs then just adding a bunch of nootropics on
top of it well that's gonna be like putting a
bandaid on a on a broken leg so what are
nootropics good for they're good for a lot of stuff
they help to increase focus they help with chronic fatigue
with ADHD with brain fog grogginess sleepiness monkey mind lack
of motivation memory problems alertness mood anxiety depression Alzheimer's dementia
and even brain injury some of these supplements can reverse
brain injury for example if you know somebody who's had
it maybe had a concussion or maybe they had a
stroke maybe they're on the brink of dementia if you
have some older parent or something like that these supplements
can be very beneficial and there's a lot of anecdotal
evidence that they helped really nootropics can give you your
life back but this word can has an asterisk on
it it doesn't necessarily mean that these substances will transform
your whole life it really depends on where you are
it really depends on how you've been using your mind
what kind of diet you've had what kind of personal
conditions genetic factors environmental factors how much toxicity how many
heavy metals you have in your body all these sorts
of factors come into play and if you're struggling with
one of these issues that I listed above like chronic
fatigue or problem focusing for example when you're trying to
meditate maybe you're struggling with depression the sorts of stuff
then nootropics even though I wouldn't rely on them to
cure you for example of your depression you got to
look for the root cause of your depression and that's
probably going to go deeper than just your diet although
that could play a role some people's dies are so
terrible that that alone could be the cause of your
depression of course there probably are some deep-seated psychological factors
as well so you got to address those but what
nootropics can do is they can give you that extra
a bit of leverage that you need because the problem
is is that when you're stuck in chronic fatigue crippling
chronic fatigue or you have just racing monkey mine you're
able to focus on anything you're not even able to
start like a meditation practice for example or you're so
depressed that you're not even able to do self-actualization work
and look for the root cause of your depression right
when you're really really stuck that's where nootropics can be
like that extra leverage that you use that can get
you some functionality back that then you can use and
then you can have more energy and more be more
empowered to then go work at those root causes which
usually take months and years to fix see so these
are like a catalyst a little extra boost that you
get generally and this is something we haven't spoken much
before about is that brain health is very important to
self actualization because to self actualize and to do serious
spiritual work your brain has to be functioning at its
peak how else are you gonna meditate contemplate focus do
the work be motivated if you're depressed and if you're
struggling with laziness and you've got motivation problems how are
you gonna self actualize right this is sort of just
foundational you got to get this foundational piece of the
puzzle solved now for many of you maybe this isn't
a problem at all understand that nootropics they can take
you from a dysfunctional level to a functional level but
also if you're already at a functional level they can
take you from a functional level to a like a
new level of mental performance that you've never experienced before
now it's important understand that there's a huge variety of
different brain types and personality types and genetic factors that
play into this and you have to assume that your
brain which is the hardware and your mind which is
the software that both of these are like two sides
of a coin they both affect one another so how
you use your mind how you use your brain what
you feed your brain this plays into itself what kind
of beliefs you have this this all comes together into
this package and this this unit now functioning it's running
your entire life and this is a unique thing no
two people have the same brain in the same mind
right so just keep that in mind as we're gonna
be talking about this because this is where the experimentation
comes in nootropics finding the right nootropics for you is
all about experimenting it's not about just popping pills that
I tell you to pop so without further ado let's
get to the first number one nootropic on my list
and this is a doozy this this one is huge
this is the most important one for me and for
many others who are into nootropics this is actually a
prescription pharmaceutical and it's going to be the only one
on this list of 15 Plus that I'm gonna give
you that's gonna be an actual drug the others are
all going to be supplements natural herbs that sorts of
stuff so the first nootropic is modafinil otherwise known by
its brand name provigil there's also a slight analogue or
variant of it which is even stronger called our modafinil
or by its brand name new Vigil this is an
amazing an amazing pharmaceutical you pop this pill and what
it does is it makes you super wakeful alert aware
and calm and creative for the next 10 hours it
almost puts you into a meditative state but the amazing
thing about it is that it's not addictive and it's
also not stimulating in the way that for example amphetamines
are which are commonly used to treat 80 ADHD ritalin
is that amphetamine and there's various other analogs and derivatives
of it so this is not that this gives you
a very smooth even keeled kind of ground to just
wakefulness and just alertness and it gives you this great
fluidity of thought where you can just think these long
chains of thoughts and they're very smooth and you can
like think through a problem very methodically it's just like
very effortless it the best way to describe it is
just like hyper wakefulness and like lubrication for your mind
it's amazing and it also makes you hyper creative or
you're able to connect many dots together it feels like
all the different disparate parts of your brain starts to
communicate with itself and that's why it's good for creativity
because fundamentally creativity is about connecting dots connecting different ideas
together in new novel ways so with this pill it's
easier to do intellectual work it's easier to contemplate it's
easier to meditate it's easier to do self inquiry it's
easier to do consciousness work it improves your mood you
feel great on it and the come-up is very smooth
the the plateau or the peak lasts for a long
time for about eight hours and then it comes down
and the come off is also very smooth and even
though in one sense it's it's a very strong sense
of alertness but it's also kind of subtle kind of
subtle especially when you start to take it on a
regular basis some days you don't even know that it's
there until you start stop taking it and then you
realize oh my god there's this a big difference this
drug was invented for narcoleptics people who fall asleep randomly
throughout the day I can't stay awake in order to
help them to stay awake and so it's it's a
it's a drug that's in a class by itself it's
not a psychedelic it's not an amphetamine it's just its
own thing and current science doesn't really have a good
understanding of how motor phenol works but hey as long
as it works it works and what's great about it
and the only reason I recommend it is because it's
not addictive of course you can still probably develop a
psychological addiction to it but it's not physically addictive and
I've had no problem going on it for weeks and
coming off of it for weeks and it's great like
it's really no problem I don't find myself craving for
it I can do my work on it or off
it and it's really not a crutch for me so
let me show you a graph here of the of
the effects of motor phenol as you can see on
this graph it takes about an hour or two to
come into effect you start to feel it then the
peak lasts for about six hours and then it drops
off the last two hours a full pill of this
motor phenol is really really powerful in fact it's so
powerful that it becomes a little bit too stimulating for
me I noticed my heart starts to beat a little
bit faster almost as though I was like running so
it's a little too stimulating as a full pill so
what I do is I cut it into four parts
and I just take one-fourth of it and that gives
me just that little extra boost that I want throughout
the day but without any of the race enos no
heart palpitations or anything like that speaking of which let's
talk about the side effects so it might sound like
this pill is too good to be true like Leo
what's the catch well honestly I haven't really found a
catch it does seem like a pretty magic sort of
pill now of course it's not going to solve all
your life's problems but it's a it's pretty amazing what
you can do on this stuff it's really really good
for improving your cognitive performance especially if you have cognitively
stressful or intensive work that you do the side effects
though can include headache dizziness nausea upset stomach dry mouth
runny nose insomnia increased heart rate heart palpitations and there's
a very very very rare extremely low probability of a
serious skin reaction which some people get so if you're
gonna take this and you experience any kind of skin
reaction then definitely don't take it again but I've never
experienced that in fact I haven't experienced almost any of
these side effects except for the increased heart rate I
definitely experienced that if I take a full pill of
it and sometimes I get a little bit of a
runny nose when I take it if I take a
large dose of it but other than that I haven't
gotten any of the above so what you want to
do to prevent building up tolerance is you want a
cycle this mode of phenyl on and off so you
can maybe take it for five days while you're working
then on the weekend give yourself a few days off
or maybe take it for two weeks and then take
a week off something like that you know you don't
want to be literally taking it every single day for
a whole year because that will develop tolerance now is
this a safe substance to take can you take it
for a whole year and not suffer any kind of
bodily harm or damage well millions of people have have
been prescribed modafinil and have taken it it's been used
now for a few decades it's a pretty popular pharmaceutical
and there doesn't seem to be any clinical evidence of
any serious long-term health problems or damage i I think
the biggest concern would be maybe your liver or your
kidneys probably your liver but I've read cases of people
taking this stuff for five or ten years and not
suffering any issues now of course I wouldn't recommend that
you take it for five or ten years straight if
you're taking it on and off and you have a
healthy diet and you also get blood work done every
year then you can monitor your stats and I think
you're gonna be safe but of course I'm me and
you're you so you gotta you gotta you know you
gotta take into account whatever health issues you might have
there which might be complicating factors now what's the difference
between modafinil and our modafinil our modafinil is actually a
newer version a newer variant it's an analogue and it's
more potent I actually found it to be significantly more
potent the wakefulness that I get on modafinil is it's
pretty nice but when I take an hour mode of
phenol it's like damn it almost is starting to get
into like a a micro dose of psychedelic territory of
course it doesn't have really like any visual hallucinations or
anything like this but just like that wakefulness and that
consciousness you get it really reminds me of a mild
mild dough of mushrooms or LSD like it's it's really
powerful in fact I took 1/4 of it and it
was so powerful that I'm like damn I definitely I'm
not going to be using this even 1/4 of it
on a daily basis because it's like it's really powerful
our motive phenol lasts several hours longer than mode a
phenol and actually it has interesting Li enough fewer side
effects people report and it also has a slightly different
matrix of side effects it's the same kind of side
effects I listed above but certain one of these variants
has more of like lists of headaches the other one
has more busyness or nos or something so you don't
have to experiment see for me personally the only side
effect that I noticed on our modafinil compared to modafinil
is that on our motive phenol when I take it
during that one hour come up where it's starting to
kick in I get a little bit of a sniffly
nose but then again I usually have a sniffly nose
anyways pretty often and and then it goes away after
it comes up and man SF is strong so how
does motive phenol compared to psychedelics mushrooms LSD five Meo
DMT and so forth you don't get any visual hallucinations
that's for sure I would say it's less than 1%
as potent so if you done psychedelic so you can
easily handle motive phenol or our motive phenol and what
you find on psychedelics is that it's impossible to accomplish
any work on psychedelics they're really hard at least for
me that's what I found even micro dosing LSD I
found that I couldn't actually work doing that I thought
maybe it would work but it's not effective however on
modafinil our motor phenol you're in a state of mind
we're actually you're hyper productive you're able to accomplish way
more work than you would normally and certainly you're far
more effective than you would be on psychedelics so that's
an interesting difference now what's really interesting if you've wondered
you know I talked a lot about 5 Meo and
the amazing lucidity of 5 Meo and the amazing conscious
expanding potential of 5 Meo and how 5 Meo different
from mushrooms and LSD and everything else in terms of
psychedelic well if you want to know what five Meo
is like pop one pill of our motive phenol and
then you'll see that and then multiply that by a
million and you'll see five mal you'll get it you
get a little bit of an idea of what five
Meo does at a breakthrough dose five amiyo is just
like pure pure pure consciousness it's so much consciousness that
when you take a significant dose of it literally all
of reality disappears in the light of your own consciousness
because you become infinitely conscious so conscious that you become
conscious that you weren't even born that's how conscious you
are it's ridiculous just [ __ ] God levels of
consciousness now our motive phenol is a lot more tamer
than that you're not going to get anything like that
but and here's where motive phenol and our motive phenol
can be effective I think for us as self actualize
errs and for us who are into spiritual work is
that if you've been a person who's been meditating hard
for a couple of years but you're struggling you've been
self inquiring and you've been struggling sometimes people ask me
leo I don't get it what's the point of spirituality
what's the point of meditation what's the point of yoga
what's the point of psychedelics you know and they don't
really want to try a psychedelic because they don't understand
yet what consciousness is what expansion of consciousness that they've
never experienced it so for these people what I recommend
is take one arm modafinil and you will have your
answer rather than having me explain to you why expanding
of consciousness is so important and why I talk about
consciousness non-stop in all my videos take an automotive phenol
and you will see what it means to have a
meditative state of consciousness for 10 hours straight it's amazing
when you experience that that gives you a little taste
of what's possible with psychedelics it gives you a little
taste of what's possible with yoga a little taste of
what's possible with self inquiry with meditation retreats with the
pasta and all this other stuff we're talking about and
and you see Oh consciousness yes that's exactly what I'm
missing in my life is more consciousness yeah of course
the mistake would be to think that you will get
consciousness from motor phenol every single day that would be
a mistake rather again the way you want to use
this is you want to use this as a lever
for example because you know it can be difficult to
start a meditation practice it can be difficult to motivate
yourself you know why are you doing this because for
the first few years that you're doing it you're not
going to see those amazing benefits some people will but
many people won't because meditation is difficult I struggled with
it a lot myself so you need something that can
kind of get you in there and when we're talking
about personal development you know don't get too don't get
too pedantic about it don't get too academic and philosophical
what needs to happen is that you need to bootstrap
yourself this is a scrappy sort of process you know
whatever works as long as it doesn't hurt you in
the long run whatever whatever works you try to use
it if you get a little leg up use it
of course don't turn it into a crutch now let's
talk about sourcing and pricing of motor phenol and our
motor phenol so of course this is a pharmaceutical and
it requires a prescription in the United States now I
talked to a wide audience of people all around the
world so I don't know what your situation is in
your country you'd have to check search online for what
the what the status is of this drug in your
country you might not need a prescription in certain countries
so there's a the two brand names provigil and new
vigil in the US these pills cost a lot one
pill of provigil 200 milligrams cost fifty dollars a pill
per pill if you get the generic version which is
available in the US then it'll cost you half that
twenty-five dollars a pill still quite expensive if you go
with new vigil it's cheaper and it's stronger so that's
interesting how that works a hundred and fifty milligrams of
new vigil in the US will cost you twenty five
dollars per pill that's the brand name and the generic
I couldn't find a price for I'm not even sure
if there generic I think there is a generic for
new vigil but I don't know what the price is
so obviously it'll be less than 25 maybe 15 bucks
maybe 10 bucks I don't know of course you got
to check with your insurance to see if it covers
you it may it may not even with insurance it
could still be pretty pricey now there's another option which
is that it is possible to obtain this from online
retailers for example from India I believe in India these
substances don't require prescription now of course if you're living
in the US there's sort of a gray area legal
issues whatever you're technically supposed to have a prescription but
again I'm speaking to a worldwide audience here so keep
that in mind so definitely you can you can try
to find an Indian source for these motor feetoes and
in fact there's two Indian brand names which are really
good one called mode alert which is the Indian brand
name for motor phenol it's made by Sun Pharma and
I'll show you a picture of it here so you
can see what that looks like and there's a similarly
the version for our motor phenol which is called art
vigil that's the Indian brand name for our motor phenol
and it's made by hab Pharma and here you'll see
a picture of what that looks like they come in
nice packages tin foil and plastic and all of that
and here's the here's a really good part about the
the Indian pills is that they're really cheap modafinil will
cost you one dollar and fifty cents for one pill
and our motive phenol the Indian version will cost you
also one dollar and fifty cents per pill and if
you buy large quantities like 300 pills at a time
then you can get it as cheap as one dollar
per pill so compare one dollar with fifty dollars or
twenty-five dollars and you can see the huge difference now
is it worth paying one dollar per pill for these
for these drugs absolutely absolutely is it worth paying $25
or $50 if you have cognitively demanding work like if
you're an artist a musician designer and architect and engineer
and inventor something creative like that a writer it's even
worth paying 20 or 25 bucks I mean 25 or
50 bucks per pill I think but of course that's
going to depend on your budget and all of that
now you're probably wondering well Leo how do we know
that these Indian pills aren't dangerous and aren't filled with
all sorts of toxins and all this well from what
I can tell you is that these two brand names
that I've described are really really high quality I haven't
seen any kind of problems with them they're amazingly high
quality I think they're as high quality as the u.s.
brand names so take that for what it's worth of
course there's always a little bit of risk there's always
some risk with something with psychedelics there's always some risk
with supplements there's always some risks with pharmaceuticals this is
just how this stuff goes right even if you take
the brand name US version there's still some risk that
you might have one of these side effects or something
like that you know so you're always take a little
bit of risk but then again all of life is
about taking a little bit of risk here and there
so it's not about you trying to eliminate all risk
it's really just about taking reasonable risks and so these
substances here I think are totally reasonable especially when you
take it you don't want to pop the entire pill
right off the bat what you do is you take
a little corner of it cut it into fourths or
even smaller take a little bit of it and just
test it and see how your body deals with it
do you have any allergic reactions anything like that this
is a smart way to go about it alright so
that is modafinil it's an amazing substance I can't tell
you what to do but for me man it's it's
great and if you're interested in the kind of stuff
that I'm interested in then I recommend checking you out
you can go to your doctor you could tell your
doctor that you're suffering for some chronic fatigue if you
want to get prescription chronic fatigue or you're having difficulty
concentrating you have HD ADHD symptoms depression mood problems this
sort of stuff and your doctor should be able to
write you a prescription okay now let's get to the
the natural and non prescription supplements so first what I
have for you is lion's mane mushrooms now no these
are not psychedelic mushrooms there's just regular mushrooms lion's mane
you could take up to 500 milligrams of this it's
a traditional Chinese herb that was used in Chinese medicine
for a long time here are the effects that it
offers it significantly increases neurogenesis and helps with brain cell
regeneration it improves memory and cognition improves focus and alertness
clears up brain fog reduces depression and anxiety so if
you're suffering with any of those you might want to
give this one a shot it's a natural it's just
mushrooms you shouldn't have any sorts of serious reactions to
it or any kind of complications or health issues the
next supplement is called l-theanine and you can take it
in the dose of 200 to 400 milligrams this is
a non dietary amino acid found in green tea so
it's also rather I would consider a sort of a
natural supplement this is a pretty powerful and foundational nootropic
and a lot of people in the tropics community say
that this is one of the ones that gave them
the biggest boost so what it does is it's a
relaxant it reduces blood pressure and heart rate it promotes
alpha and theta brainwaves which is exactly what you need
in order to meditate so usually if you're stuck in
ADHD or you're stuck in monkey mind you're in the
beta brainwave frequency territory so your your brain waves are
pretty quick and what this l-theanine will do is will
slow you down and move you into alpha and theta
which is perfect for the kind of work that we
want to do it also increases focus and awareness and
it does this without any kind of racing as it
actually relaxes you so unlike coffee which gives you jitters
or some sort of amphetamine like Ritalin which can also
do that this has the opposite effect which is exactly
what you want because that's the point of meditation point
of meditation is to be simultaneously focused and aware but
also totally relaxed it serves a neuroprotection protective function it
increases nerve growth factor which helps your neurons grow if
you're trying to learn memorize stuff that's what you need
it boosts your mood and it improves cognition it also
increases neurotransmitters gaba dopamine and serotonin it reduces stress it
improves memory and it improves sleep without making you drowsy
which is a pretty awesome list of effects so try
that out and see if that works for you a
lot of people report that they get good stuff on
it the next supplement is called huperzine a and you
can take it from 50 micrograms to 200 micrograms this
is an alkaloid from Chinese club moss which is also
another traditional Chinese medicine the effects of huperzine a are
a boost in short-term memory improvement in long-term brain health
it improves cognition supports brain cell mitochondria mitochondria are the
energy centers in your cells which power your entire body
so it gives you energy it serves as a brain
antioxidant and increases nerve growth factor as well with huperzine
a it also has an effect on the vividness of
your dreams some people take this supplement for example if
they're trying to loose a dream or they want to
do some kind of personal development work through their dreaming
like dream work then you can experiment with that supplement
there and for that purpose you would want to take
it right before bedtime whereas if you want it just
for the sort of cognitive enhancement effects then you would
take it in the morning rather than at nighttime the
next supplement is called alpha GPC you can take this
in the 400 milligram to one hundred and one thousand
two hundred milligram range this is a choline source a
more bioavailable version of choline and choline is something that's
important or your nootropic stack because it synergizes with the
other nootropics that you're taking it sort of gives your
brain like the raw fuel that it needs to do
its work so this alpha GPC can improve memory it
can improve mood and boost dopamine it boosts mental energy
it improves cognitive performance and increases nerve growth factor the
next supplement is Tarot stilbene 50 milligrams this is a
polyphenol antioxidant found in blueberries and grapes it's a very
potent antioxidant the effects are it increases neurogenesis increases neuroplasticity
it's a neuro protectant which means that it supports brain
health it improves cognition learning and memory it improves mood
and boosts dopamine it referred reverses the effects of aging
and it reduces anxiety the next supplement is 5 -
HTP taken at 200 milligrams this is a naturally produced
amino acid in your body and it's a precursor to
serotonin the effects are that it can improve anxiety and
depression and reduce stress but there is a warning that
comes with this supplement which is that you can't take
it if you're on any kind of antidepressant medication so
be very careful about mixing antidepressants and other kinds of
mind-altering medications with these supplements definitely do your research and
ask your doctor the next supplement is really interesting it's
called soul Butte I mean Soul Butte I mean taken
in the 200 to 400 milligram range this is a
synthetic derivative of the vitamin b1 the effects are it
increases attention span increases focus lifts brain fog boosts motivation
improve sociability and gives you a better vocab Larry improves
mood reduces chronic fatigue but it tends to develop a
quick tolerance so with this one you want to cycle
it on enough either take it every other day or
maybe take it for two or three days and then
don't take it for two or three days and then
kind of shift it back and forth like that there's
a very powerful stack that people have found of three
nootropics you combine so butylene with alpha GPC and you're
a Dean you're a Dean I'm going to cover in
a minute here we're gonna get to it so you
take all those three together and there's an extra synergistic
effect I definitely notice so butylene and it's pretty damn
powerful the next supplement is called vinpocetine and you take
it at ten milligrams and you can take it several
times per day this is an alkaloid derived from the
lesser periwinkle plant the effects are it improves blood flow
to the brain improves cognition alertness concentration and mood improves
memory reduces brain fog and mental fatigue its neuro protected
it boosts neuroplasticity repairs damage done by stroke which is
pretty amazing and it's anti-inflammatory so let me let me
just mention here as a little tangent these effects that
I'm listing for you where do they come from did
I just make this up is this something that's I
got from the back of the bottle of these supplements
no there's actually quite a lot of studies and research
that have been done on all of the supplements that
I'm talking about you can go look through the research
you can find various kinds of studies and so when
I'm mentioning these various effects positive effects that these supplements
have this is what the research is finding I like
for example when I say that it repairs damage done
by stroke they actually give this the pasa teen to
stroke victims and they see improvements relative to placebo and
same goes for all the other stuff that I've been
talking about and then I we'll be talking about right
now of course the science is still very new there's
always new research coming out some of the stuff that
I that I might be mentioning here might be outdated
five or ten years from now you know science is
always moving forward and that's fine but the clinical evidence
shows the things that I'm mentioning but also it seems
like there's a lot of anecdotal evidence from people who
take these substances and share their their stories online writing
testimonials and reviews and stuff like that now some people
say olio but how can you trust testimonials and reviews
after all they're they're fake or they're just anecdotal you
can't trust anecdotal you misunderstand anecdotal anecdotal evidence is actually
some of the most important and reliable evidence now of
course a lot of people can make [ __ ]
up but that doesn't diminish the validity of anecdotal evidence
in fact I hold anecdotal evidence when it comes to
substances psychedelics pharmaceuticals in much higher regard than I do
for example double-blind placebo-controlled laboratory studies why because you would
be foolish not to because by definition these highly clinical
technical studies they're very expensive they're very limited they're very
narrow in their scope and science is very conservative that
means that a lot of the benefits and stuff that
these substances can do science is it admitting yet why
because it's got a strong filter you see that's sort
of the upside of science as it has a strong
filter but also the downside of science is that it
has a strong filter which is why we need more
people for example taking psychedelics and taking various kinds of
nootropics and then as objectively as possible describing all the
effects that they're experiencing and that's how you really know
that something works for you you test it yourself you
don't go to some scientist to tell you because see
the problem with these clinical studies is what they do
is they work with averages scientists are not interested for
example in helping you to increase your performance or to
attain enlightenment or to become extra meditative or anything like
that all there really interested for the most part is
helping dysfunctional people getting to a functional normal level that's
mostly what their studies are designed to show so for
example they'll take some stroke victims and give them some
the pomposity nor whatever and then maybe they'll see some
improvement and they'll say okay good is so it helps
with that okay that's great but that tells me nothing
about how this can help me with my meditation practice
with consciousness work with enlightened with self-actualization with other stuff
like that with lucid dreaming you know there's all these
different factors and it's gonna take science maybe 200 years
to research all that [ __ ] I'll be dead
by then and so will you and also look the
way that these studies work is that they take large
averages so for example they might give this pill to
a sample of a thousand people now out of those
thousand it will help a hundred people a lot and
the other nine hundred people it will have no effect
on but what these scientists will do is they will
just average that out so if you take this as
a ratio you know one out of ten that's not
a very good ratio and so they'll say this is
not a very effective substance but this is a completely
irrelevant when what you are looking for as you're looking
for a substance is gonna help you with your particular
issue see so because we have so much variety in
our personality types and our brain types and our mind
types and our genetics and all of that you shouldn't
expect any one substance to work the same across a
thousand people and it doesn't matter to me if a
substance works on 99% of people or only 1% of
people so long as I'm in that 1% but generally
scientists don't really care much about this because they're looking
at very broad averages which is not what we care
about what we care about is that if I have
chronic fatigue or if I have brain fog or if
I have trouble concentrating or if I have some sort
of issue depression or whatever I care about finding any
kind of solution that I can that will help me
with my issue that means you got to test it
yourself alright let's move on the next supplement is called
n alt all capital null t' which stands for we're
n-acetyl LT Racine you take it in the 300 to
500 milligram range this is a highly bioavailable form of
the amino acid l-tyrosine its effects are that it will
improve cognition improve memory improves mental stress boosts mood boosts
neurotransmitters and it's especially good for ADHD and it's commonly
paired by people who have ADHD with their ADHD medication
Ritalin or whatever else they're taking and it seems to
have a certain synergistic effects but of course you want
to research that and check with your doctor to make
sure you don't get into trouble it has a tolerance
so this one you want to cycle as well the
next supplement is called phosphatidyl serine taken at 300 milligrams
this is a naturally occurring phospholipid in the brain cell
membrane so your brain cells neurons that's mostly what your
brain is made of you know it's man enough fat
phospholipids which create the membranes and there's myelin sheets going
around all the neurons in your brain and actually when
you get when you develop new skills and you learn
new things what's happening physically inside your brain is that
extra myelination extra layers of fat are being grown around
every neural connection that strengthens that connection and that's how
you build new skills new habits and so forth right
so if you're trying to change the way that your
mind works which is basically what we're doing actual eyes
not org then you want supplements that will help you
with with improving your phospholipids so the effects of this
hospital Starion is it improves brain health it promotes growth
of neurons it improves cognitive performance improves memory improves focus
reduces ADHD and it decreases beta brainwaves one of the
few supplements that has been discovered to do that in
clinical studies that's pretty cool brain waves again is the
monkey mind the next supplement is a natural herb called
bacopa Maneri I take it in the 200 to 400
milligram range at 45% back asides now what is these
45% back asides this is like the active ingredient or
alkaloid I assume that they extract and so you can
find the bacopa supplements at various percentages of back asides
45% a high percent you might find 10 percent or
25 percent so if the if the percentage is lower
you guys have to take a bigger dose is what
I mean now this bacopa is a traditional indian adaptogen
herb that's been used for a long time in southern
India and actually there it's called Brahmi brahmi as in
Brahman the absolute as in Brahman the Brahman class the
the Indian the highest Indian class caste system which are
supposed to be the gurus and the Yogi's and the
ones who study the scriptures in the sutras so they
call it Brahmi so that tells you something right they're
actually various Indian gurus and Yogi's have been taking this
herb to help them with improving their memory so that
they can memorize very long mantras and various kinds of
chance which tend to be very complicated and contorted and
arcane so this this herb helped them with that which
is why they called it Brahmi and then of course
by doing these chants by memorizing them and doing them
they then attain enlightenment and various altered states of consciousness
which is why they call it Brahmi so the effects
are it's described as a natural at all it reduces
ADHD it improves cognitive performance improves learning memory and focus
and it reduces anxiety but what's interesting about it is
that it has sort of a short-term effect in a
long-term effect the short-term effect if you start to take
it it kicks in immediately and this reduces anxiety the
long-term effect of taking bacopa if you take it for
four to six weeks every single day that's when you
get the memory improvement effects and those effects tend to
last for a long time so if you take it
for six weeks then you stop those effects of improved
memory should last know how long but for uh for
longer than just one day probably four weeks maybe four
months so if you're having memory issues and you might
want to consider this you'll have to experiment I haven't
taken it for that long to see if it really
does improve memory you'll have to experiment that yourself because
personally for me memory is not really the reason that
I take these substances I take it mostly for the
immediate enhancement in my alertness in my awareness and in
my focus ability not for the member my memory is
pretty good also you have to take into account that
your age plays an important part here for some of
you who are young in your early 20s early 30s
you might take some of these supplements and they might
not really do much for you and you might think
oh they're just a waste of money and nothing happened
well that's because you still have a very young and
well-functioning brain but those of you who are in your
50s and 60s and 70s well you're gonna probably start
to experience some decline in your mental performance as all
of us will as we get older and so there's
where you can see a much more pronounced effect so
some of these supplements will be greater for older folks
but still you know if you're young try it out
anyways because you don't know with these substances you just
don't know until you try it no amount of research
no amount of thinking about it will answer the question
for you you can only find out by taking it
the next supplement is called knack NAC all capitalized which
stands for n asset ll cysteine you can take 600
milligrams of it up to three times per day this
is a naturally occurring amino acid and it regulates dopamine
it's a precursor to glutathione which is an important substance
for your immune system in fact I love taking nak
whenever I'm feeling a cold or a flu coming on
and it helps me to deal with that it's sort
of like an antioxidant and it it helps with increasing
the immune system and ever since I've been taking it
plus several other supplements which I'm not talking about here
which because they're not nootropics but I take them I
found this sort of combination that I take whenever I
have a cold coming on and it wipes out the
cold within a matter of hours and for the last
few years I've never really gotten a serious cold or
a flu anymore whereas in the past I had I
was very very susceptible to colds and flus when I
was younger in fact not that long ago I had
a really terrible experience with the flu I got a
flu this was about five years ago when I was
still in Dallas when I lived in Dallas and I
got such a high fever that I went to the
bathroom to take a piss and I was standing there
pissing and I started to feel like super super dizzy
so dizzy that I actually lost consciousness as I was
standing and it happened so quickly that I hit my
forehead on the counter there's like a counter over my
toilet I hit my forehead against that there's a little
scar here still huh my skull from that and then
I just blacked out I don't know for how long
until I remember I just woke up like coming back
to life it was a really eerie experience unlike anything
I've ever experienced my life it was the only time
of my life that I fainted I came back and
what happened was I wasn't near the toilet in the
bathroom the bathroom was like a sort of a long
room like this the toilet was a lot on one
side the bathtub was on the other side I found
myself lying like this over the edge of the bathtub
with my back and my spine arched over the tub
like this my feet here towards the toilet in my
head inside the bathtub the bathtub was empty there's no
water and I and I'm shocked I didn't break my
back like I didn't know what happened or how I
got there like I have no memory of of how
I ended up in that position or how long I
lay there might have been four hours I have no
idea but it was like the most eerie sensation of
coming back to life it was almost like my mind
brain we're just like rebooting itself and giving me like
a second chance at life that's sort of like what
it felt like it was very odd I felt like
I was the Terminator in two in Terminator 2 coming
back online after he got his like spine destroyed and
then he came back online rebooted itself with a second
CPU sort of thing it felt like that very very
freaky and scary experience yeah so flus are no joke
so this knack has the effect of being a neuro
protectant relieving depression improving overall brain health improves cognitive performance
it repairs brain injury and reduces flu-like symptoms which is
what I was just talking about the next substance is
called pqq and this is a tongue twister pqq stands
for pyro Lok we know lean Queen own try saying
that ten times fast pyro Lok we lone Queen own
it's terrible you take it in the 20 milligram range
this is a very potent antioxidant its effects are that
promotes growth of new mitochondria it's one of the only
supplements that has been found to promote the growth of
new mitochondria which gives you energy increases nerve growth factor
its neuro protecting repairs damage caused by stroke helps grow
new neurons improves memory and improves cognition and sidon synergizes
very well with Co Q 10 which we'll be talking
about next but it can take up to a month
to kick in so if you start taking it you
got to keep taking it for a whole month but
if you do you might see some significant improvements the
next supplement is Co Q 10 coenzyme q10 you can
take it in the 300 to 400 milligram range and
it provides energy for mitochondria and it's a potent antioxidant
it's especially effective for older folks it might not be
worth taking if you're younger if you're in your 20s
and 30s but for older people this is great it
the effects of it are that it protects brain cells
boosts brain energy reduces too rushon reduces fatigue increases mental
clarity and it has various anti-aging and positive effects on
your cardiac system a lot of people take it I
think when they have a blood pressure issues and heart
issues as they get older the next supplement is uridine
taken in the 150 to 300 milligram range uridine is
one of the four base pairs found in DNA and
is produced naturally in your body the effects of this
supplement are it boosts the release of dopamine and improves
mood it's got anti depressant effects when paired with fish
oil it boosts cognition its neuro protecting and it improves
memory uridine is good to stack with alpha GPC fish
oil and soul butylene the next supplement is a classic
gingko biloba you can take it in the 120 milligrams
ange a gingko biloba is a Chinese tree this is
a traditional Chinese medicine has been used for thousands of
years the effects are that it increases blood circulation in
the brain which is very good improves memory cognition learning
and alertness it's got neuro protect protect and functions it
boosts mood reduces stress and helps repair brain cells gingko
biloba usually requires several weeks of continued use before you
start to see the effects and then the last two
supplements I'll give you I wouldn't really call them nootropics
per se but they can help which is fish or
krill oil take it in the 500 2,000 milligram range
and vitamin d3 taken in the 3,000 to 10,000 IU
range vitamin d3 is especially important a lot of people
these days have vitamin d3 deficiencies that they don't even
know about make sure you go to your doctor ask
for a vitamin D test it only costs 50 $100
you can get this blood work done and they will
tell you your vitamin B level this is important for
your immune system and also for the functioning of of
everything in your body and your overall health and vitamin
d3 it's not enough to just be on the low
end of the range there's like a recommended range chances
are that even if you have a sufficient amount of
d3 you're still on the low end of the range
you want to push that higher to get yourself sort
of in the middle of the range which is what's
optimal remember we're not just interested in becoming functional we're
interested in becoming optimal right so that's it that's a
different kind of goal most doctors if you go to
a doctor for advice they only give you advice for
dysfunctions to get you to normal but normal ain't great
normal is just like pretty mediocre you want to get
to optimal so take that into account now with vitamin
d3 you usually have a ticket for a long time
three six twelve months sometimes especially if you're very deficient
you have to take it every single day for that
long so that it builds up in your body especially
if you live up north and you don't spend a
lot of time out in the Sun then you're likely
to have vitamin D deficiency so make sure you check
that out now all these supplements that I listed not
only is there various kinds of clinical research you can
find on it but there are hundreds and hundreds of
five-star Amazon reviews about these substances now again you might
say ah believe but the reviews are fake and they're
all paid for and how can you really trust other
people online and all the sort of stuff look just
go go search for these substances look and read the
reviews some of these reviews are amazing they're very genuine
they people write their whole life stories and how these
substance have transformed their lives of course some of them
are fake some of them are paid for but I
still think that a large majority of them are still
genuine and people give really high praise to all these
various supplements that I mentioned above now that doesn't mean
in and of itself that this is gonna work for
you exactly like it did for all those people because
people are different but at least what this shows you
is that this stuff has been field-tested by thousands and
millions of people and with with some great results now
I take these nootropics in the morning with a banana
you definitely don't to take them on an empty stomach
because they'll make you nauseous but with one banana it's
fine do I take them all sometimes I do like
pop 20 pills sometimes not always I can go weeks
without popping anything but then sometimes I'll take 20 of
them or of course you know I build up to
it I don't just start taking 20 right off the
bat I experiment individually then I combine to make a
stack so forth and then sometimes I'll only take five
or ten so I'm still always experimenting with this stuff
Mike's parent a she's not complete I also will take
motor phenol in our motor phenol early in the day
with my banana in the morning because if you take
it too late in the day in the afternoon it
can be difficult to sleep so keep that mind but
you know I'm actually able to nap I'm a good
nap or I'm a good sleeper I'm able to nap
even on motor phenol at least 1/4 of what I
can do 1/4 of motor phenol a few hours later
I could take a nap I'll wake up it'll still
be there the effect will still be there and then
I'll just get to work or do whatever I need
to do what's really amazing is when you combine meditation
plus Kriya yoga plus self-inquiry plus some of these nootropics
all together and you create this amazing stack man you
can feel really good you can feel amazing in this
of course it's not about pleasure we're not doing this
so that we have some raw heroin like rush of
pleasure it's just about like you become hyper alert and
conscious and that in and of itself is the greatest
pleasure I recommend that you try to buy the highest
quality brands organic don't be cheap with your supplements especially
if you're going to be taking them for years at
a time you want to make sure that they're pure
and that there's no weird additives in there and they're
not cutting corners and sourcing the the chemicals from the
cheapest places here are some substances to avoid I recommend
you avoid addre phenyl this is yet a third analog
of motor phenol as if this wasn't complicated enough called
addre phenol you can buy this stuff I believe without
a prescription online in the US but the problem with
it is that it heavily taxes your liver and so
it's not healthy to take regularly so I would avoid
it if you want to try modafinil or our modafinil
that's fine but don't do a Hydra phenol the next
thing I would avoid is rasa Tam's rasa Tam's is
a whole class of various substances like aniracetam P racetam
and others they're pretty potent they're one of the most
potent nootropics out there I didn't really mention them though
because I don't recommend them because I've tried it myself
and what I feel is a very kind of stimulating
effect it doesn't feel healthy it feels a little bit
dirty I get heart palpitations I get weird dreams on
these rasa Tam's and it just it doesn't feel like
it's a sustainable thing that you want to take go
with the more healthy options especially when you have access
to mode of phenol why would you need to mess
with rasa Temps doesn't make sense I would also avoid
antidepressants a lot of people take antidepressants and he depressants
caused a lot of damage collectively thousands of people every
year die or commit suicide from antidepressants they're extremely addictive
once you start start them it's very difficult to get
off them you have to slowly wean yourself off that
can be challenging they present all sorts of weird side
effects erectile dysfunction lowering your sexual mood and all sorts
of other weird stuff you like you just don't want
to deal with this stuff I would recommend that if
you feel depressed before you go to antidepressants go through
an experiment with all these other supplements and modafinil and
see how that works for you and if that still
doesn't help you with your depression then then maybe as
a last resort turn to antidepressants and if you're already
on into depressants be very careful you can't just cut
them off cold turkey you have to wean yourself off
so talk to your doctor about how to do that
and ultimately if you're on antidepressants your long-term goal should
be to wean yourself off of antidepressants because what are
you you're gonna be on them your whole life you're
gonna be suffering from all these side effects so you
need to you need to address the root issue and
heat depressants never almost never address the root issue chances
are your depression has to do with various kinds of
trauma that you've experienced and various psychological factors and not
just purely a chemical issue although you know people vary
so if you need antidepressants by all means take them
just be very mindful that you probably don't need them
and there's probably better solutions out there but that you
haven't really tried them yet so I encourage you to
experiment I also recommend that you avoid stimulants and amphetamines
adderall ritalin and his sort of stuff just too many
complicating factors with them it doesn't doesn't seem sustainable to
me I recommend you avoid caffeine it builds up tolerance
pretty quickly anyways and it becomes a crutch and I
recommend that you avoid weed now some of you can
get away with using weed once in a while for
spiritual purposes if you can great the problem with weed
is that it tends to be addictive for many people
it becomes this chronic thing that they do a sort
of escape they're not really using it to grow themselves
they're just using it to get lazy and they're not
really using it for spirituality if you want to use
a substance for spiritual purposes there are much better substances
than wheat that don't have addictive potential so I would
avoid that would now I never ever recommend habit-forming substances
if you're trying to sort of reconcile in your mind
and you're thinking maybe Willie oh you're being a hypocrite
because here you are for psychedelics and crazy stuff like
v and mio DMT but then when it comes to
weed or to caffeine or to antidepressants or something you're
against it so what would what's what's this all about
well it's very simple psychedelics are not have it for
me that's it that's a super important factor super important
in fact before I experimented with psychedelics a few years
ago I really hadn't done any drugs at all in
my whole life and I was very much against them
anti-drug because that's sort of what I was programmed with
in school and in school they sort of brainwash us
to believe that all drugs are addictive and bad like
heroin and crack and meth so when I discovered though
that psychedelics are not addictive at first I didn't believe
it but then I read a little bit further and
I realized oh yeah this is true and then I
actually tried and I realized oh yeah of course it's
true it's not addictive at all then that completely changed
my understanding of psychedelics see if they were addictive I
wouldn't do them that's a super important point for example
ketamine is a dissociative / psychedelic which does have an
addictive habit forming potential and it can also damage certain
organs in your body and so I have no interest
in taking ketamine for example even though it has some
powerful psychedelic effects and people report various kinds of k
whole enlightenment experiences all sorts of crazy [ __ ]
on it you know you'd be interesting to try that
but it just doesn't seem like it's worth the risk
when I've got all these other options like LSD or
mushrooms or DMT or something like that or even motor
phenol so just keep that in mind mmm which is
also why I don't recommend alcohol because it's also habit
for me be careful taking supplements with medication be careful
taking supplements with psychedelics if I'm gonna be taking a
psychedelic I'm not gonna be taking my whole stack of
20 [ __ ] pills in the morning because I
don't know what that's gonna do to my trip gotta
be very careful if you're gonna be combining nootropics with
psychedelics at the very least you got to do it
one at a time like you take one nootropic and
once I can Ella come on and together see what
happens is that safe okay maybe it is then add
a second one try that add a third one try
that still yeah I mean you got to be careful
in you are taking potential risks there it's when you
start to mix substances that stuff can get wacky because
substance is gonna have weird synergistic effects you can have
one plus one add together and it doesn't equal two
it equals eleven so you got to be careful you
know if you take some LSD and then you combine
it with some supplement that like increases the blood flow
to your brain I don't know what that'll do that
might triple the intensity of your trip and that would
probably get you into some hairy trouble so be careful
you must test your nootropic stack gradually build it up
don't just take 20 pills at a time remember that
different things work for different people don't blindly copy others
just because someone has some stack that they came up
with that works for them doesn't mean that's gonna work
for you I recommend that you only go into nootropics
if you're willing to do the research and to experiment
that's fundamentally what this is about and that's part of
the interest in the appeal of all this and this
is really the foundational principle of actualized orgas self experimentation
not in a dangerous way in a responsible wise way
by first doing research figuring out whether this really might
work for you and then only then testing it out
and testing it out in small doses and then increasing
your doses all right that's the essence of experimentation and
this is really no different than how it was done
five or ten thousand years ago by ancient medicine men
who still lived today in the in the rain forest
riho you know how they would test various herbs and
poisonous plants and stuff they would take a leaf off
of it a little leaf they wouldn't just start to
consume the plant or just eat a bunch of berries
that they found in the wild they would take a
little leaf or a little piece of the berry and
they would rub it on the inside of their lip
for example or they would scratch their skin here a
little bit until they got a little bit of redness
and then they would rub the leaf and the juice
of the leaf into that little open spot it'll scratch
on their arm and then they would see does that
cause inflammation is to cause irritations to turn red and
swollen if it does and that means that's a dangerous
substance take it see so you gotta test this stuff
got to be intelligent about it there are lots of
nootropic forums online communities of people who come together into
a sort of hive mind and talk about their various
experiences you can go to those forums and figure out
what kind of stacks people have and find other kinds
of nootropics by no means is the list I gave
you above comprehensive there's probably dozens more that I haven't
talked about that I haven't experienced that I haven't even
researched yet that I might in the future and you
might to also I recommend you go on Amazon and
read reviews for all these various substances read people's stories
it can be very inspiring you can be encouraging it
can be illuminating people share all sorts of interesting ideas
within those Amazon reviews now a word about the cost
of this how much is all this gonna cost you
well I would be prepared to invest $500 at least
into researching nootropics that would allow you to buy maybe
fifteen or twenty different bottles and then you can try
those out is it worth it you might say leo
five hundred dollars on the all these stupid supplements what
if it's just a scam what if it doesn't do
anything for me hey look I mean of course it
depends on your budget for some people hundred dollars is
a lot for me it's nothing compared to the long-term
potential value that I could get from doing this research
the way that I think of it is like well
I can buy this bottle for thirty bucks maybe it
does absolutely nothing I lost thirty bucks okay not a
big problem but maybe it really helps me maybe it
improves my work performance maybe it allows me to meditate
better maybe it allows me to loose a dream maybe
it allows me to you know self inquire deeper or
it helps me with my chronic fatigue or something and
then if I find that one supplement that works for
me I can use that and rely on that for
the rest of my life thirty or forty years and
so that's certainly worth for me the risk of losing
thirty dollars but again you know I don't know where
you are or at if you're short on money then
probably researching nootropics is not the highest priority for you
we have bigger fish to fry which is why you
do want to become financially independent get your money situation
in order so that you have a little bit of
an extra disposable income that you can use for all
these kinds of little experiments that we do and that's
what makes this whole journey fun is that you do
get to try new stuff out that makes your life
exciting all right now let me give you a long
list of warnings about potential red flags here do not
or rather I should say these nootropics are not a
replacement for poor diet make sure you fix your diet
these nootropics are not a replacement for poor lifestyle make
sure you are living a healthy lifestyle and you're improving
that every year these are not a replacement for sleep
make sure you're getting your 8 hours of sleep every
day these are not a tool for workaholism if you're
a workaholic and you work 80 hours a week and
you're pushing yourself and cramming all the time and and
and doing all this is unsustainable this is unhealthy poor
lifestyle you've got to fix that no amount of nootropics
is going to to help you there in the short
term it might seem like they will but in the
long term you're gonna burn out and you're gonna face
a health crisis so watch out also I don't recommend
using nootropics for cramming in college and in school I
think you need to develop a high quality study habits
if you're gonna be going to to law school medical
school or you just want to a some exam or
something like that don't just think that you gonna pop
a moat of phenol and then the night before you're
gonna learn everything that you need to learn it doesn't
work like that and that's not healthy or sustainable anyways
this is not a replacement for personal development of course
so if you're taking nootropics and if they help you
great but you're still gonna be doing personal development this
is not a replacement for shadow work especially if you
have depression anxiety these deeper seeded psychological issues that requires
shadow work these supplements are not going to help you
to overcome some trauma you had in the past or
to you know overcome some deep-seated anger issue that you
have or bitterness towards the world or mother father issues
I know all the sorts of stuff the stuff that
you repress in your subconscious mind that requires real work
this is also not a replacement for spiritual practice so
if you think that you can just build a nootropic
stack and maybe use our modafinil and now you don't
have to meditate or do yoga anymore well you've completely
misunderstood the point of what I'm talking about here what
I'm talking about here is actually using these substances to
get you deeper into your spiritual practice to make you
more motivated to do your spiritual practice when I pop
an r modafinil that makes me more motivated to do
yoga more motivated to self inquire not less make sure
you get annual blood work just in case to monitor
your liver function your kidneys your your blood nutrients and
vitamin levels and all of this just to make sure
that you're within the safety zones on all the different
ranges and nothing is getting out of whack that's pretty
much it I will though post a link on my
blog with a good nootropics forum that I like and
if you want to delve into this topic deeply you
can go to that forum and check out different people
stacks and so forth so that will be available on
my blog after this episode is released so go and
look for that and speaking of forums actualize that already
is also available and of course since I now have
introduced this topic of nootropics I expect that people will
be interested in it and there'll be a lot more
talk about it on my forum and I hope that
just like people do trip reports on the forum they
will also write their reports and experiences with various nootropics
that they use and the different stacks that they develop
and so on the actualized forum I hope that we
will actually get a maybe a little section going about
nootropics over the years and in a few years hopefully
we'll have a lot of different kinds of reviews of
different supplements and all the sorts of stuff and sort
of the hive mind will come and work on this
problem and people will introduce new types of nootropics new
types of stacks and so that will be interesting so
if you're really interested in then you can come participate
on the forum and be a part of that okay
that's it I'm done here please click that like button
for me and come check out actualize that org that's
where you'll find my blog the forum my book list
the life purpose course and the last thing that I'll
say is that if you make the commitment to this
entire journey of self-actualization and you stay with me and
you watch every episode every week that I release you
will experience new facets of reality that I will introduce
you to that you had no idea existed before for
example I'm sure that for many of you you didn't
know what nootropics were or that was even a thing
or how it could possibly help you or even if
you didn't know about it it was just maybe you
knew the word but you didn't really know what it
could really do for you or how to go about
extracting his full benefits so one of the most important
things that I offer you to those people who stick
around and follow my content on a regular basis is
that as you watch every episode even if you don't
think the episode is gonna help you immediately with some
burning problem that you have keep watching it because inevitably
I'm gonna introduce you to more and more facets of
personal development that you never knew existed and if you
stick with me for two or three years in that
time I will introduce to you at least one or
two facets that will revolutionize your whole life the trick
is that you don't know which facet it will be
hell I might not even know because I'm always researching
and finding new stuff and the thing that I'll present
to you two years from that will that will change
your whole life I don't even know about it yet
I might just discover it one year from now you
see that's always really been the case I'm always researching
stuff I'm always keeping it fresh it's not just gonna
be a rehash of non-duality material over and over and
over again of course we still have a lot of
non-duality some to talk about but I will be introducing
new facets new subdomains of personal development very foundational stuff
stuff about your health stuff about relationships stuff about how
to improve your personality how to be more charismatic so
like all this stuff is gonna be there and it's
all coming and what you want to do most importantly
is you want to make a commitment to the exploration
process become an explorer become an experimenter it's only by
taking on that attitude that you get to discover amazing
things for example if I didn't take on that attitude
I would have never discovered yoga I would have never
discovered five Meo DMT I would have never discovered brain
training I would have never discovered like so many things
and even right now I have a list in my
mind of stuff that I haven't even shared with you
yet new facets and new techniques and new substances that
you've never heard about anywhere almost anywhere that will be
amazing and life transforming for some of you not for
everybody but for some of you cuz you know different
ones of unique different things at different times in your
life for your development for example I still have yet
to share with you uh an even more powerful is
like a dog that I found than five amigo DMT
nobody knows about it virtually nobody knows about it not
even online not even a psychedelic communities do they know
about it and yet I discovered it and I'll share
that with you in the future and I'll share a
lot more but what you have to be a little
careful with here is um be careful not to judge
my videos just by the titles alone I often don't
create the sexiest video titles I don't try to clickbait
you and I don't try to release content that's appealing
to a mass audience so what that means is that
sometimes I released a little bit kind of an esoteric
video with sort of a weird title and you're not
sure what this title will do for you you might
think like oh this title this is not gonna help
improve my life but if you actually watch it it
will completely change your whole life right so you have
to be a little bit careful about judging books by
their cover here because the truth is that you just
don't know what really will change your life and what
won't a lot of the stuff you think you need
that will change your life completely actually is all [
__ ] whereas the stuff you don't even know exists
yet that's the stuff that you really need and where
are you gonna hear about it are you gonna hear
about it on TV are you gonna hear about it
on Facebook are you here gonna hear about your friends
talking about this are you gonna hear it from your
co-workers from your University professor from your mom from your
dad [ __ ] no I've already talked about this
problem in my episode called the deep problem of marketing
that's actually a very important episode that many people didn't
watch because they think that marketing is not important it's
extremely important because how else are you getting your information
the only things you know about he understands the only
things you know in your life have come into your
awareness predominantly through marketing if it isn't marketed in your
culture you [ __ ] don't know about it let
that sink into your skull how significant that is all
of your ideas about what's possible and what's impossible in
life about how good life can be about spirituality but
personal all of these ideas you have they are all
utterly grounded in the center of gravity of your culture
and the marketing of the culture that you live in
and what's the center of gravity of our culture well
in America in most first world countries it's spotlight hammock
stage orange which is a pretty low level of development
and of consciousness and the kind of [ __ ]
that gets marketed is mostly junk food sex get-rich-quick schemes
and all sorts of nonsense you are never gonna see
a video or an advertisement I guess on CNN or
some cable news channel or on Facebook about 5mu TMT
or about yoga Kriya yoga or about you know the
benefits of meditation well actually on YouTube I'm sure that
you probably do see some of those as there tend
if they tend to be hyper targeted so maybe you
do see some yogi preaching some some yoga system to
you these days but but by and large you know
the stuff that gets advertised and shown to you is
um is neurotic dysfunctional and unhealthy so you don't even
know the things you want or need to ultimately create
the kind of amazing life that you can have you
don't even know what an amazing life is what it
what it really looks like because you don't see it
on TV you don't see it in the news all
you mostly see there is dysfunction dysfunction your friends dysfunction
your family dysfunction everywhere so what actualize that org is
for you it is like a high consciousness news channel
if you will you get news here that you're not
gonna get anywhere else news from various kinds of research
and new techniques and new resources check out my blog
for example I post a lot of interesting documentaries kind
of niche esoteric stuff that you generally wouldn't run into
if you're just sucking on the tit of mainstream culture
so for that reason and more you want to stick
around you
