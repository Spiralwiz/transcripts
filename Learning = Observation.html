hey leo here for actualised org and in this episode
I'm going to be talking about how learning equals observation
[Music] you a while back I released an episode called
learning equals behavior change a lot of you guys liked
that episode it was a pretty important one it was
a very practical one I think for many people opened
a lot of people's eyes but in that episode I
told you that that was just one perspective on learning
and that I have other perspectives that I need to
share with you perhaps as important if not more important
than that one so here we are the reason we're
talking about learning from multiple perspectives is because in a
sense learning is what life is all about it's central
to everything that you want in your life you want
to construct a good life you want good relationships you
want business success you want spiritual success you want person
about whatever you're doing you're learning if you're not a
lifelong learner you're not getting anywhere so if you want
some Metta advice for your life learn how to learn
become a rockstar learner and if you want to do
that then it helps to look at learning from different
perspectives because learning is a complex thing there's a lot
of different stuff that you could learn in life so
here's another perspective for you the deepest learning happens through
observation that's it that's the whole lesson it's very simple
but precisely because it is so simple it's easy to
overlook and it's easy to not implement in your life
and not to see the results of it so what
is observation it's simple you just look at a thing
for a very long period of time steadily diligently with
focus that's it you look at a thing without an
agenda that's it so for the purpose of this episode
observation you can equate it with awareness if you want
to think of it that way and with consciousness although
I like using the word observation because once we start
to use the word awareness or consciousness it becomes a
little bit abstract and it becomes a little bit like
far-fetched it's like Oh awarenesses some mystical thing out there
somewhere whereas observation it's like observation is simple observation is
what happens when you look through a telescope or you
look through a microscope or you go and you look
at some chimps in a zoo like maybe a research
scientist would do that's observation very simply just look at
the thing what isn't observation thinking reading listening to a
lecture watching a video memorizing facts doing or action trying
to fix a thing manipulation daydreaming trying to figure it
out training and behavior change these are not observation these
are something else and that's precisely why it's challenging is
because we're very tempted by our culture and just by
our innate inclinations to do all this other stuff instead
of observing and one of the biggest challenge you're gonna
have when you sit down to observe a thing is
that all this other stuff will come up there you
gonna try to do instead because your mind will rationalize
it away and say well if I'm just sitting there
observing something I'm wasting a lot of time I could
be figuring something out I could be training I could
be improving myself I could be reading a book or
whatever or I could be thinking about this thing and
that's exactly the thing you need to avoid in order
to observe successfully which is why observation is such a
rare thing let me ask you this when was the
last time that you actually sat and looked at an
object for five hours straight without an agenda ever probably
never be honest with yourself when was last time you
did that see so immediately this shows you that what
I'm talking about here even though it's very simple is
something that's actually foreign to you it's not something you
ever do so be careful about prejudging what I'm talking
about see the mistake you have to be very careful
is that it sounds like I'm just talking about and
making a very simple shallow point like a lob servation
oh that's it leo what's next come on give me
something more advanced give me some some mind-blowing abstract thing
that I could use some techniques some some theory about
something you know actually this right here is very profound
but you're gonna have to you're gonna have to practice
a little bit of doing this to see the profundity
of it you know this reminds me of what I
think is one of the most remarkable people in human
history which is Leonardo da Vinci and when I think
about Leonardo da Vinci if you ever study him study
some of his work and some of the stuff he's
accomplished he's really a remarkable guy because he was able
to go both deep and also broad in life like
he was able to study and develop military machines and
also do art and painting and the Mona Lisa and
sculpture and and anatomy and biology and pot and like
oh there's all this all this stuff he was able
to do everything how I was able to do that
in many ways he's sort of the poster child of
self-actualization but when I think about Leonardo da Vinci and
I try to boil down his essence to like one
thing what was it about him that made him so
remarkable to me it all boils down to his remarkable
ability to just observe that thread runs through all of
his work and really I think it defines his entire
life if you wanted to put one phrase on his
tombstone it would be something like Nardo da Vinci the
masterful observer because in everything he was just so meticulous
in the way he observed it and I can almost
imagine him sitting there just like with a little leaf
or a bug or an insect er or a tree
or something and just like looking at it as though
looking at it through a microscope I don't think they
had microscopes back then but he was just huge just
look at it very steadily and I didn't get the
sense that he was trying to do that in order
to you know to push some agenda to accomplish something
but just because he was innately curious about observing what
the hell the thing was without taking it for granted
without jumping to conclusions about it without just settling for
a label like oh yeah let's just it's a maple
leaf as though calling it a maple leaf really tells
you anything about what it is or about the details
of what's on it how is it that simply looking
at a thing could change anything in your life what
is this power that observation has over the last years
it's been remarkable I've been observing myself observing and it's
been like magic I've been noticing how observation just in
and of itself is a superpower there's something about awareness
or about consciousness that when aware soar consciousness just simply
sits still and is focused on itself or some aspect
of itself that it has an intelligence of its own
and it has a creativity a very deep creativity that's
just like baked into awareness such that it doesn't need
to concoct something it doesn't need to think it doesn't
need to figure anything out it doesn't need to Train
anything or do anything with somebody doesn't need to manipulate
just by observing a situation you learn you spontaneously learn
this just happens to be how the human mind is
wired it's uh I think it's a very profound aspect
of reality actually I think it goes way deeper than
just a human mind or even the brain I think
that really all intelligence is predicated upon this at a
very deep level it's the fact that awareness has this
capacity this magical capacity this almost supernatural capacity which which
largely goes unrecognized in Western culture it's because of this
that we are actually able to get all our creativity
and all our higher-level thinking and all what we call
human intelligence and rationale and all that logic all of
that is ultimately predicated upon this very primordial quality of
awareness of just making spontaneous insights and interconnections through simply
observing something and this is difficult to convey to people
because people think that well believe if I just look
at a leaf or something I've seen it what more
could there be it's like I've seen it okay I
spent five minutes looking at it but then I've basically
got it right and the answer is no if you
want to experience the full magic of what I'm talking
about the profundity of it you have to sit there
and look at it for a very very long time
very patiently without demanding anything of this process you don't
just sit there looking at the leaf like okay how
is this gonna make me richer how was just gonna
self actualize me how is this gonna do anything for
me how is this growing me not like that because
when you're doing that that's ego getting in the way
of this very primordial function of awareness of just see
what awareness does it it picks up these distinctions I
don't know if it picks them up or if it
creates them or if it's it's a kind of a
back-and-forth process but it's just incredible to me how this
happens something magical happens when you just look at a
thing for a very long period of time of course
you're gonna contemplate as you look at it two questions
will arise new insights will come to you you might
sit there looking on a leaf for an hour and
then you know bye-bye at one point in that hour
it's just like something's gonna strike is like oh I
could use maybe this leaf will be a logo for
my business or it's like this leaf will will be
a research project for for my biology class or this
is a leaf I could draw I could put it
on my music album or something like the veins in
the leaf remind me of the the neurons in the
brain and also remind me of the structure of a
galaxy and remind me of the way that atoms work
or something like that your mind is gonna make these
interconnections simply by observing and also not just these interconnections
and insights because that's like the creativity part but also
you're gonna see the leaf in a different way what
you're gonna get after a while of doing this you're
gonna get unmediated access to reality which is a rare
thing most of us assume that we have unmediated access
to reality but we don't because we're so language and
logic oriented as a culture as a species that everything
we look at is really just an augmented reality we
project a lot of stuff we project our ourself biases
our emotions our desires our own meanings and significances we're
looking at objects and even the fact that you're looking
at an object the only reason you're looking at an
object in the first place is because somewhere lately in
the back of your mind your subconscious mind has figured
out that hey this object would serve you in some
way to look at otherwise you're not looking at it
you're not noticing it 90% of stuff in your life
you don't even notice you don't think twice about so
when you actually get to look at an object for
a long period of time and you can kind of
break through all the concepts all the abstraction all the
labels all the words all the stuff that comes from
your culture that you think you know about this maple
leaf for example then eventually you get to an unmediated
access of this maple leaf and that's a thing that
many people have never experienced in their life observation is
also powerful because it's Unseld fiest a lot of your
perceptions are very biased by the fact that yourself you're
an ego and you're going about life doing stuff that
you want to do pursuing your own goals avoiding fears
and and perceived threats from the environment you're just constantly
doing this with everything you're doing the social you're doing
this in your business you're doing senior relationships you're doing
this with your money with with your entire day and
when you just observe if you do it right then
you break past this self bias that we tend to
have observation also allows us to transcend language logic and
monkey mind a lot of very good scientists make the
mistake of assuming that the only access they have to
reality is through their senses and through language logic and
the monkey mind they don't realize that there's actually something
much deeper at work there's this primordial awareness which sits
underneath language logic and monkey mind and that this gives
you a much clearer picture of reality and how it
works the greatest scientists actually tap into this people like
Leonardo da Vinci he was a great scientist he was
able to tap into it and the essence of science
the reason science is so much applauded these days and
a lot of skeptics hold up science as much superior
it's a superstition and religion is precisely because science the
one thing that it really got right is placing empiricism
at the center of it and empiricism really is just
about very accurate perception of the raw sense-data of which
reality consists so that's a step in the right direction
what I'm saying is that really you got to take
empiricism to a whole deeper level so science is getting
something right because it's it's it's based on empiricism but
still a lot of science is still very conceptual model
based simulation based language based logic based mind based and
this is actually a mistake if you want to become
a great scientist then you have to get really really
good at transcending all that and just observing whatever you're
talking about I mean of course in certain Sciences is
easier than others like it's easier to do that in
in anthropology maybe that it is to do it in
quantum mechanics because it's hard to observe stuff in quantum
mechanics although still the most tangible developments in quantum mechanics
where do they come from they come from the had
your Large Hadron colliders and particle colliders around the world
and what are those but just very again very meticulous
and careful observation devices seen so the the foundation of
science is really empiricism but then you can apply that
to your personal life as well and then you'll see
amazing results in your personal life if you throw in
very good observer observation is a rare thing in our
society here's why there's a host of reasons firstly because
it's counterintuitive because when you first start to observe a
thing you don't have a good skill in it so
you suck at it and so unless you have the
foresight to develop this skill you're not gonna get very
far you're gonna quit you can start doing something else
you can get distracted observation doesn't have an immediate short-term
payoff the way that manipulation does why do people manipulate
so much because it gives you an immediate payoff and
of course we know that people love their immediate payoffs
whereas if I tell you just sit there and observe
a maple leaf for five hours you're gonna be like
leo why the would I observe a maple leaf for
five hours what is that gonna do for me and
the answer is I don't know what it's gonna do
for you and neither do you and maybe it won't
do anything for you at least not right now maybe
you observer 400 hours something magical will happen but for
the first five hours maybe nothing will happen maybe you'll
think you're wasting your time and that's what most people
think it is it's just wasting their time and of
course it's counterintuitive because people are addicted to manipulation we're
just pressured into manipulating everything in our in our lives
because of the society and culture we live in that
we think that that's that's the appropriate way to interact
with reality is just constant manipulation what's in it for
me what's in it for my team what's in it
for my country and this is the opposite of what
you want to do if you want to really develop
yourself to the highest levels as a human being observation
is rare because it's just too simple when something is
so simple and so obvious usually you find that nobody
does it observation is rare because it requires lots of
focus patience and overcoming boredom which today is is going
to deter 99.999% of people because today if something requires
focused patience and going through boredom no one's gonna do
it basically that's what our culture has devolve down into
speaking of culture another reason that observations rare's because our
culture values knowing thinking and acting not unbiased observing our
culture rewards and pays for people who claim to know
experts thinkers people with solutions and ideas not simply observers
and this is really a shame and this of course
is reflected in our education system which is another reason
why observation is so rare because it's not actually taught
in school nobody taught you to observe what was your
school about school was about memorizing stuff passing tests homework
assignments getting grades reading books doing projects having answers in
class knowing a bunch of stuff thinking maybe a little
bit acting and that's about it but no one told
you about observation well that's why you have actualized I
don't worry so how do you develop observation it's simple
you just sit and you closely look at an object
you look at it for its own sake trying to
drop all your agenda while you get very curious about
the being the substance of the object or what it
actually is the reality of it the truth of it
whatever that happens to be and you try not to
prejudge it or to have some imagined idea of what
it should be or what it actually is you try
to drop all those as much as you can you
also try to drop all manipulation drop all your thoughts
as much as you can and just sit there and
be very still looking at it relax your mind relax
your body and yet stay alert don't get sleepy and
that's the whole process and then you just practice that
every day for however many hours you want to practice
that you just practice practice practice you can get so
kind of good at it I guess that you just
kind of walk through your day starting to be in
that kind of observer mode rather than the other kind
of modes that you're usually in and then it's not
so much it's how hassle so I don't know that
you need to actually sit down and create a one
hour observation habit every single day I don't think that
that's necessary although you could do that if you wanted
to in a sense that's what meditation is supposed to
be but a lot of times when we talk about
meditation this whole word this label this idea of meditating
it comes with all this baggage because it's not the
spiritual baggage behind it and you're using it for enlightenment
or you're using it to relax or you're using it
to accomplish something and so in a sense meditation is
just observation but it helps to think of observation as
its own thing because you can kind of get in
this mechanical mode of meditating maybe you have some technique
that you're using and then actually the technique gets in
the way of just observing the technique becomes a cell
and self involved thing so if you do have a
meditation habit definitely keep it but also double-check that you're
not doing it mechanically and maybe the next week or
two that you do it try to think of it
in this different light try to think of it as
observation and not so much meditation maybe sit there with
a maple leaf that you find outside or a pen
or a pencil and just sit there with it and
look at it rather than doing your traditional meditation technique
you see but mindfulness meditation with labeling or the paws
on a-- these are very powerful techniques which are designed
to train your observation abilities for a specific purpose but
sometimes that purpose gets in the way so you have
to be careful if you're a total newb actually I
recommend my mindfulness meditation with labeling or doing of a
Posten retreat that's really good that will that will kind
of open your eyes to some stuff when it comes
to observation but if you've been doing Vipassana now for
for a few years straight you might be getting stuck
in a rut then maybe shift a little bit and
try to do some observation and rather than just sitting
there and and labeling stuff take a pen or a
pencil or maple leaf and just sit there and look
at it for a few hours and see what that
reveals for you what I find for me is that
my meditation practice and also my self inquiry practice gets
richer and deeper when I approach it from different angles
now there's a downside to that in that if I'm
experimenting dabbling in all these different meditation techniques and observation
techniques and stuff acquires it all this it kind of
gets messy and you're not really focusing enough and that
can be a problem in its own right but also
a one of the advantages of that approach is that
you do get multiple angles and you see how all
this stuff interconnection converges in a rich and very fascinating
way and so I recommend kind of a hybrid approach
where you do it in a broad way but then
also at the end if you really want to have
some deep deep insights and enlightenment insights whatever then you
go laser focused maybe on one technique for a hall
retreat or for a whole month or whatever for a
whole year if you need to but for the purposes
of this episode I don't want you to think of
it as meditation I'm not talking about meditation here I'm
talking about observation and if you've never meditated before that's
fine just think this is observation start to practice it
a little bit here and there until you start to
notice what I'm talking about the most important thing I'm
talking about here is that I want you to notice
that just by observing a thing something magical will start
to happen there's a secret power there and if you
remember my other very popular episode called awareness alone is
curative I think that's one of the most important episodes
for folks to watch of mine because in that episode
I also sort of talked about this issue how a
lot of your problems in life they actually autocorrect when
you just apply the light of awareness to those problems
it's a little hard to believe until you start to
really get into building up your awareness and practicing this
observation stuff so you might want to check out that
episode along with this one so what are the key
things for you to observe in your life self-deception self
bias self justification the self in general all the you
do all your shenanigans all your dirty secrets emotions of
course physical objects like I was talking about the maple
leaf the pen the pencil that's all good stuff just
sitting with a physical object and really observing it can
be a powerful a powerful practice and it's actually a
really good one to start with because when you're observing
the mind the mind is very tricky and it's very
difficult to observe the mind it's a lot easier to
start with observing physical objects observe also nature observe other
people observe observing other people is difficult you think you're
observing other people but actually you're judging them you're criticizing
them you're arguing with them you're manipulating them you're using
them for whatever needs you have that you need field
that is not observation it's really tricky with people you
got to just sit there and observe people and observe
how do you relate to people that's tricky maybe you
can go sit on a park bench and just watch
people but that's not enough you also need to observe
people that you're actually interacting with in your everyday life
observe your spouse observe your girlfriend your boyfriend your kids
your your co-workers so forth observe people in the news
without judging them that's really hard it's really hard especially
these days well hold on nonsense is going on in
politics and news observe society observe culture again without judging
it that's not easy to do observe ideology observe tribalism
observe belief systems both in yourself and in others and
again that's not easy to do without judging it observe
evil without judging it that's really hard to do for
a lot of people so you got your work cut
out for you there's a lot of areas that you
can apply this technique to now you might wonder well
Leo does this contradict your prior episode about learning equals
behavior change because there you said that hey I didn't
learn a jack until I changed my behavior now you're
telling me that I just got to sit there and
observe something a stupid leaf that doesn't change my behavior
so what's the deal here right these are different perspectives
and there might be paradox and contradiction here that you
have to reconcile and cope with that's fine I think
that they actually dovetail nicely together they synergy so learning
equals behavior change is a great way to kind of
force yourself to actually learn the lessons that you haven't
been learning whereas learning equals observation he's a different angle
to come at it from but ultimately it sort of
leads to the same place because like I said in
my awarenesses curative episode when you just observe a thing
for a very long time very patiently you'll discover that
in the end your behavior will start to change that's
what's so remarkable about it but that's like in the
long run in the short run that might not happen
and that's okay so practice learning equals behavior change for
a month then practice learning equals observation for a month
and see the pros and cons and then see the
differences the paradoxes and also the similarities and the synergies
there you want to be an amazing human being cultivate
the ability to observe most people don't do this on
the other hand the sages the Saints the Yogi's the
Mystics the geniuses the ancients throughout history they were all
masters masters of observation that's where a lot of their
power came from and you know what the ultimate test
of your observation power is it's whether you can see
the most subtle thing of all can you see nothingness
that's the ultimate test nothing this is right here right
now you're inside of it you are it but you
don't see it because your observation ability is so weak
it's too subtle for you to pick it up even
though it's right here as I'm speaking to you and
what I want to end on is returning to Leonardo
da Vinci because I said that Leonardo da Vinci was
a masterful observer so let's put him to the test
do you think he was masterful enough to pass the
ultimate test could he see nothingness let me give you
his answer to that he writes quote among the great
things which are found among us the existence of nothing
is the greatest its essence dwells between the past and
the future and possesses nothing of the present nothingness has
no center and its boundaries are nothingness this nothingness has
the part equal to the whole and the whole to
the part the divisible to the indivisible and it comes
to the same amount whether we divide it or multiply
it or add to it or subtract from it everything
isn't folded into everything everything comes from everything and everything
is made out of everything and everything returns into everything
and quote that is from zen master da vinci he
took his observation abilities to the highest levels and i
recommend that you follow his lead that's it I'm done
here remember to click that like button for me don't
forget come check out actualize that org my website I
got a blog I keep posting a lot of cool
insights on the blog the forum the life purpose course
my book lists other stuff coming in the future and
stick with me for more next week you
