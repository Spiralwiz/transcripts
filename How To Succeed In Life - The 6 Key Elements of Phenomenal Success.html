hey this is Leo for actualize org I'm going to
tell you how to succeed in life right this is
my forte this is what I love to study is
success and I'm going to give you about six or
seven tips just the fundamentals of what it takes to
create a really successful life all right get ready because
it's going to be a really powerful quick self-help segment
and I go into more depth in other videos so
number one on the list is discover yourself you have
to have a deep understanding of who you really are
in life to have long-term sustainable success and both happiness
and then fulfillment right and for me success is shallow
if it doesn't come with the happiness and fulfillment component
so for me I want to get all of it
both the external success and then the fulfillment the lasting
fulfillment and happiness that you can get with that I
don't want just shallow external success and to do that
you need to really understand and discover who you are
and you might be thinking well I Know Who I
am no you don't most people out there I would
say 99% of people do not really know who they
are because they have not gone on the journey that
it takes to discover that and what I'm really talking
about here this is not some abstract notion is you
really need to discover what your top ten values are
you need to discover what your top five feelings are
in life you need to discover what it is that
you really want out of life what is meaningful to
you and you got to also discover what you don't
want and you might say well I know what I
don't want I know the things I don't like well
there might not be as much clarity there as you
think it there is so this is all about a
matter of clarity and articulation it's one thing to note
Begley it's a totally different thing to actually articulate it
write it down and know it very very consciously it's
going to clear a lot of things up for you
and you can you sit down and do this process
you're going to quickly realize that you don't know as
much about yourself as you think you do and you
probably have had moments in your life that have been
like epiphanies where you had deep self discovery maybe it
was when you were traveling maybe it was after a
breakup in a relationship maybe it was when you were
struggling at work you discover things yourself and by going
through these these challenging experiences we really discover what it
is that we want out of life and that's the
foundation successful people know what they want all right the
second point is have a life purpose have a purpose
to your life life purpose is a very very deep
topic that I cover in other videos but here what
I'm going to say about it is the fundamentals life
purpose is what you want to accomplish in your life
everything in your life that you're doing and this is
true for all successful people is all their actions on
a day-to-day basis on a weekly basis a monthly basis
on a yearly basis are leading towards some sort of
point they're all converging towards something and they know what
that convergence point is for them the convergence point first
of all it's outside themselves it's not so much about
them it's about something else something bigger than them it's
about a sense of contribution and again I don't mean
contribution in the sense of you have to be super
altruistic and not care about yourself know its contribution in
the sense that you get a lot of enjoyment from
contributing something positive to the world so the question really
is what is the impact that you want to have
are you clear on that are you totally committed to
having that impact so this could be impact in your
family this could be impact in starting the kind of
business you want to start and having that business have
a certain impact on society whether it's helping people in
Africa get more water or helping produce green energy or
helping people find find love through like creating an online
dating site you know whatever it is it doesn't matter
if you're an inventor it's about creating useful gadgets for
people to use right or useful inventions if you're a
scientist it's about discovering new things about human beings in
the world if you're a mathematician is discovering new truth
within mathematics if you're an engineer it's about building amazing
amazing machines that can help people some sort of positive
impact something that you really bought into something that's very
important if you have that you're gonna have passion you're
going to get motive you can get excited and that's
going to allow you to go out there and have
the external success that you want that's going to lead
to money that's going to lead to prestige and recognition
and fame all those things come from having a point
outside yourself that you're moving towards and being very clear
about it you have to be very clear about what
you want to be moving towards next is set big
goals successful people set big goals in fact they set
gargantuan goals and you have to do that too there's
a tendency to say that we want to set realistic
goals you might say well I'm not going to set
too ambitious of a goal because there's a risk that
I'm going to fail well instead what I'm going to
do is I'm going to focus on a goal that's
realistic that I can attain the problem with that kind
of thinking is that a lot of times those realistic
goals that we set are under valuing what we can
actually do in our lives right you're selling yourself short
you don't really know how much potential you really have
until you set a very ambitious goal I'm sure at
one point you're like you have done that and you've
actually been able to meet it or even exceed it
and you felt the power of that setting an ambitious
goal a big goal is a great way to supercharge
your motivation and successful people are very passionate and motivated
that's because they set big goals for themselves if you
set a weak goal a small goal a realistic goal
what's going to happen is that you're not going to
get engaged with it you're not going to get excited
enough to really go out there and take the action
encounter Tooley what might happen is that realistic goal that
you set might actually be harder to accomplish than the
very very ambitious goal because the ambitious goal has heart
to it whereas your weak piddly little goal well who
really cares if you accomplish it or not so I
can have a big impact on you and so I'm
going to have a big impact on the world so
have goals out there that are a big that are
about not just you but about other people too the
next point is hard work you got to work hard
if you're going to be successful successful people work their
ass off there are no magic bullets there are no
real get-rich-quick schemes and there are no real quick shortcuts
to success and to a deep fulfillment this is something
that you work towards you have to take a lot
of action towards the secret to making this work because
you don't want your work to be a grind is
you want your work to be aligned with your purpose
and with your values so that work and play that
boundary starts to start to really blur and when you're
working you're feeling like you're doing what you really love
to do and so you're really passionate about it and
the two are so blended that you really no longer
make a distinction between your time off and your time
at work and therefore you can work really really hard
but it doesn't feel like you're working really hard and
you can therefore take a lot of action which is
necessary to accomplish big goals and you can get them
accomplished and you can feel great about them and so
it's really like a win-win-win situation but you got to
be out there working hard if you're sitting on your
ass all the time at home on the couch watching
TV you're not going to have success in your life
it's just not going to happen there are people out
there they're really really pushing themselves and you got to
position yourself in a in a place in life where
you're pushing yourself hard too and you know what this
is where you want to be this is being on
your edge this is living an exciting charge kind of
life so work hard very important next point do not
quit successful people are extremely persistent they do not quit
when it gets tough and it will get tough I
don't care how passionate you are about what you're doing
I don't care how much you love it whether you
love it or you don't there's going to be ups
and downs in life and whatever you're pursuing whatever kind
of big goal you set for yourself especially if you
set those big goals they're going to be challenging they're
going to require you to grow they're going to require
you to step outside your comfort zone and that means
emotional labour will be involved that's okay but to it
to make sure that you get through that and to
get to your ultimate objective of success you're going to
have to have persistent and you can't quit when the
going gets tough so you know maybe you're working on
a project and something's not working out the way you
want something slips something fails and you're really tempted to
quit and throw in the towel or maybe there's a
relationship and you're trying to work it out but it's
not working and you're tempted to drop it you're tempted
to quit there you know whatever part of your life
you really want to quit or drop right now if
you're in that kind of point you gotta push through
it if it's really aligned with your values and aligned
with your purpose if it's not aligned you can you
can drop it in fact you should but otherwise you
have to be very very persistent if you read biographies
of the most successful people throughout human history business leaders
social leaders politicians celebrities actors you know that just the
underlying theme of all those biographies and all their histories
is that they were very very persistent and they were
okay with failure in fact most of these people they
were so successful because they failed so much that they
just couldn't they're successful is inevitable because after you fail
thousands of times you start to learn your lessons and
you start to get good and the human brain is
really really really stubborn and it doesn't tend to learn
from success as much as it does from failure so
when you're failing a lot don't get discouraged push on
persevere go through your hardest moments because those hardest moments
that you go through that's where you learn your biggest
lessons and those are what grow you to be able
to handle bigger and major challenges to accomplish more and
more and get that kind of success that you want
and these are also coincidentally the proudest moments of your
life the moments of your life that you will never
ever regret so never quit when you're doing something that's
important to you the next point is master your thoughts
and emotions this is a more subtle point but it's
very very important if you can't master your thoughts and
you're always swayed by your emotions you're thinking pessimistically you're
thinking negatively you're thinking uncritically or your emotions have the
better of you you're always stressed you're always anxious you're
always overwhelmed you can't focus then what are you going
to accomplish how can you accomplish anything in your life
not only are you not going to be externally successful
because you're not going to be able to run a
business you're not going to be able to hold down
a job you're not going to be able to study
you're not going to be able to be in a
good relationship because no one's want to be in a
relationship with you when you like that not only you're
not going to have those things but you're also going
to feel miserable too you don't want to be swayed
by all these negative emotions you don't want to be
worrying all the time you don't want to be stressed
all the time nobody likes to feel that and you
don't want your thoughts going in a million different places
you want to be able to concentrate and focus your
thoughts so this is called emotional mastery you got to
master your emotions you got to master your thoughts that
means you got to do some introspection once in a
while how about taking up some habits like journaling meditation
reading books talking with mentors or having a coach these
are great ways to start to develop mastery over your
emotions and your thoughts because if you're all over the
place you're going to be so concerned about just fixing
problems in your own life that you're not going to
be able to go out there and take the action
you need to take and make the contribution you need
to make in order to generate really big success and
then the last point and this is one of my
favorites and this is one that people really miss out
on is study success successful people study success success is
not what we naively think is just something that happens
naturally to some people and doesn't happen other people success
is a very deliberate conscious endeavor that you undertake success
is built over months and years and it's done consciously
and the more you understand the principles of success the
concepts success the more you study people who have been
successful the more you see what it really takes and
that process of success the principles are not always what
they seem and to me this is something that I
really committed my life to is studying these principles I
really love it it's exciting for me and I really
encourage you to get involved with that so that means
maybe attending some seminars reading some books watching these videos
learning about it maybe joining a group of friends that
are successful joining a mastermind group right be around successful
people learn how the success process works and learn the
psychology of success not the externals of success but the
psychology that's what we're talking about all right so I'm
going to wrap it up here this is how to
be successful in life please post me your comments I
