hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I want to talk about philosophy in particular I
want talk about practical philosophy how do we take philosophy
back from the goddamn academics that stole it from us
[Music] ok let's talk about philosophy this is a really
fascinating topic I want to cover what philosophy is and
I want to give a new definition for the velocity
I want to redefine philosophy and really it's not a
new definition its an old definition this is really powerful
now if you are thinking philosophy what does this have
to do with my life how is this going to
change my life how is this going to really have
any practical significance then this video is especially for you
because I'm going to be touching on that subject and
why your current thinking could be holding you back so
stick with me there will be practical applications but also
some nice philosophical applications and I think are going to
be blast I'm going to take you through a tour
of philosophy all right let's crack into that so I
am a philosophy major I was rather a philosophy major
in University originally I went in for aerospace engineering but
then after two years I didn't really like it it
was too dry for me so I became a philosophy
major and I graduated with that and I had a
blast doing philosophy I like to have lost me but
the philosophy that they teach you in universities is really
a travesty it is a bastardization of what philosophy really
is and the negative stigma that we have today both
in popular culture and even deeper than popular culture there's
just this stigma about philosophy being something for white crusty
old men who sit around and do a mental circle
jerk and that that's what philosophers do that's what philosophy
is and that really the best thing to do is
to leave it all alone and go off and run
your own life doing whatever it is that you do
without worrying too much about philosophy I totally resonate with
that I understand what you're saying you I'm a very
nerdy intellectual academically inclined guy and I had no problem
diving and talk all the academics of philosophy except and
I didn't realize this at the time when I was
in it because I didn't know enough about life I
didn't know enough about really psychology is that I didn't
realize what was happening what is currently happening in universities
and colleges all across the country in the world where
they're taking philosophy and they're turning it into something that
is it's it's not really philosophy what it is is
its academic minutia scholars and professors trying to one-up each
other with stupid research papers arguing about technical trivialities that
have absolutely no application to life not to mention our
lives but not even their own personal lives so that
is the current state of philosophy but that's not what
philosophy really is let's talk about what it really is
let's do a history lesson in philosophy all right so
first of all let's talk about the word philosophy what
does it actually mean literally filo means love and Asif
II just like biology or any kind of ology ending
you know what that means that means the study of
right so love of study or more accurately love of
wisdom love of knowledge that's literally what philosophy meant back
in the old days and by old days what I'm
talking about is two and a half thousand years ago
in the era of Plato and Aristotle that's if we're
talking about Western philosophy that's what it meant love of
wisdom love of knowledge and now you might be saying
okay that makes sense but you got to understand what
knowledge meant back then versus what it means now now
when we say knowledge what do we mean we usually
mean book smarts right book learning how much do you
know about X topic how much do you know about
biology how much do you know about math how much
do you know certain trivia how much do you know
about the world the war of 1812 that sort of
stuff there's nothing wrong with knowing those things and I
encourage you to study everything I'm a ferocious reader Brosius
study er I study everything I think it's critical to
your success in life but I also think that it's
a focus on the wrong thing in the old times
what wisdom and knowledge meant was not knowledge of specific
things or specific subjects it was knowledge of life knowledge
of psychology and see 2,000 years ago there really was
no subject of psychology psychology is something new it's a
new development psychology arose really with William James and that
was in the late 1800s and then it really got
going with Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung in the early
1900s and then started to take off we would say
in like the 1930s and the 1950s and then now
it's just blooming and now psychology has even evolved into
positive psychology which is actually what philosophy was two and
a half thousand years ago it was positive psychology positive
psychology as a branch didn't even exist 40 years ago
it's ridiculous so only 40 years ago did we finally
catch up and then we finally systematize this study the
values of the study of what it means to create
us happy fulfilled life what it means to be a
human being this is what blas was really interested in
now you might be saying well what about you know
what about all this very fairy conversation that philosophers have
the minutia aren't philosophers even in the old days arguing
about all sorts of crazy and stupid things like you
can cite numerous examples from from the Republic from Plato's
Republic like where there weren't our silly arguments in there
yes by their nature philosophers because they're looking for sources
of truth and knowledge they're going out there and you
know they're there they're doing an inspection they're doing the
inspection into life they're doing an inspection into psychology into
physics into everything they're just introspecting they're asking themselves questions
and they're looking for answers sometimes especially two and half
thousand years ago we didn't really know what we were
doing we didn't know what kind of questions to even
ask what kind of questions had answers what kind didn't
it was all bigness and it still is a big
mass to some degree even today but the focus there
the REE season that they were doing it see there
was a reason it wasn't just a debate for debates
sake it wasn't just to publish a paper or to
get some pat on the back that you said something
smart it was actually to embody the knowledge that you
discovered and then to live a powerful life if you
look at Aristotle if you look at Plato if you
look at Socrates especially if we just take three of
the Great's from the Classical era then you see that
these were people that not only theorized and philosophized they
lived they lived what they discovered they lived the highest
truths this actually had an effect on their life true
wisdom is not knowing some theory it's not just knowing
the theory of relativity or it's not knowing quantum mechanics
or some nerdy subject that is that is nothing that
is just a mockery of what knowledge is used for
knowledge is practical knowledge is what I'm teaching you guys
here knowledge is really understanding how to live a big
life it's understanding how to live a good life it
can also be an introspection into metaphysics and the nature
of reality the nature of knowledge so yes it can
be an introspection into all of those domains and there
we start to get a little more iffy a little
bit more abstract little bit more vague but that was
done in the old days that was done still with
the intention of improving your life making the life better
now really think about this these philosophers they lived their
values they lived the truths and they were a rare
sort you might say because what you might think is
you might think of it this way think of it
as there was the common folk the folk that were
really living a very miserable existence like the farmers depends
and the slaves then there was let's say the upper
class this was the nobility the aristocracy the Senators right
if we're talking about Greece and Rome and they were
they were the successful ones they were the ones that
ran businesses and had power and had were part of
a powerful family they had influence and connections and they
were well educated all this but then there were the
Philosopher's the Philosopher's were the ones that were living up
to something more noble and today we might say this
really goes along with self-actualization and Abraham Maslow's understanding of
what self-actualization is his description of people being being humanists
to be a humanist to be humanistic means to live
up to what a human is supposed to be the
highest potential within a human and back in the classical
times what they call that is they call that virtue
its living a virtuous life living two virtues virtues like
honesty truth beauty excellence doing the right thing duty loyalty
friendship love compassion knowledge understanding doing something positive for Humanity
making a contribution not doing petty things not losing your
temper not getting angry at people not being depressed or
anxious or being too selfish or earning money at the
expense of other people or laughing at the expense of
other people that's what it means to be virtuous that's
what it means to be self actualized the two are
really the same thing and it's really taken us a
couple thousand years as a culture to come back to
kind of come back home come back home to what
philosophy was it really it's a shame what philosophy has
been made out to be now in fact when I
was in in college I really I was so fascinated
by philosophy I started studying philosophy on my own even
before I got into college in in late high school
I was just so fascinated I think everyone should be
a philosopher why because what do you have but if
philosophy is about learning how to live a good life
and how to live a happy fulfilled life that that
means it applies to everyone it's the most practical of
things it's not the most airy-fairy and abstract it's the
most practical think about that it's the most practical because
what do you have you're going to grow you're going
to you're going to be born you're going to grow
up and you're going to die and that's life and
you're going to have yourself along for the ride from
the very beginning to the very end so what could
be more practical than just asking yourself questions as like
what am I doing here on this earth what is
the nature of reality what is my psychology what is
the connection between psychology and physics what is the connection
between the thoughts that I have and the results that
I get in my life what is the connection between
the values that I live up to and the results
that I get in my life and the happiness level
that I'm at what kind of values should I be
pursuing and what kind of values should I not be
pursuing that is relevant to you that is relevant to
everybody and so I started to get in very interested
in this back in high school and I started doing
a lot of just independent research study reading but also
most importantly just asking myself two questions and having the
curiosity which I find missing in many people because many
people what they do is they kind of get out
of high school and then they go into college and
they just study stuff whatever is kind of given to
them didn't they get of that they get into the
workforce and they're just kind of like humming along they're
just like robots going through life they're sleepwalking through life
they're not really critical they're not critically examining life they're
not asking themselves the questions they're not generating their own
answers even in the best cases people go to books
or some some authority to get answers religion politics media
their friends the Internet you go and you try to
get answers there and there's nothing really wrong with that
if you do it intelligently critically and you use your
judgment and your use wisdom but you've got no judgment
you've got no wisdom because you have an exercise philosophy
so you don't know a judgment and wisdom really are
you're not wise therefore whatever information is thrown at you
you just lap it up I can throw you a
piece of and you're going to eat it that's why
it's important to be a philosopher so you can understand
when people are feeding you and you can understand when
they're feeding you gold that way you can choose and
understand which people that you can listen to and which
people you cannot and then you can also develop ideas
that you get from other people you can develop them
further on your own it's really powerful as a philosopher
what you're becoming really is a master of thought a
master of reasoning understanding what wisdom is and then of
course it goes even deeper into psychology philosophy and psychology
to me are like this they're just like two sides
of the same coin so what I was disgusted with
what I was talking about earlier the point that I
neglected to make is that when I got into college
I really wanted to become a professor in philosophy because
I was so fascinated by it I want to get
a PhD but then when I started doing a little
more research digging into it what I discovered was that
if I was going to be a professional philosopher then
I would have to do that whole academic game jumping
through hoops with all these petty papers and and and
get trying to get tenure ship and going through all
the bureaucracy of that is just it's preposterous what they've
done in universities with philosophy is they take an original
philosophy old-school philosophy which was this beautiful like the most
precious thing that you could have and the most precious
activity that you can do as a human being they
took it they took the most precious part of it
they took the heart of it they ripped that out
they threw that to the ground they forgot about it
and now they've got this husk this this empty shell
that they call philosophy that they teach you and that
they write papers on it's a travesty it's ridiculous they
should be ashamed themselves of what they've done to this
beautiful human endeavor and really now the tide is kind
of shifted and it's gone into philosophy if you're going
to study anything that's going to be practical in college
its philosophy is that I mean not philosophy it's going
to be psychology and more specifically positive psychology because psychology
actually went through a phase in the early 1900s where
there was also this focus on the wrong things with
Freud and and Carl Jung and all the early old
school psychologists and I mean nothing against them they were
discovering a new field so they were in a different
time and we're kind of standing on their shoulders now
but the problem there is that they were looking at
dysfunction they look at all the problems with life and
they were looking at all the problems with with your
psychology and some people need that help so we don't
want to dismiss that you know some people genuinely need
assistance forward abnormal psychological conditions but most of us most
of us that's not what we need help with most
of us need help with be living up to the
values most of us need help with how do we
live an excellent life how do we live up to
our full potential how do we create a big life
how do we deal with the struggles of doing that
how do we how do we choose those values how
do we know which values to choose how do we
build practical wisdom that's what we really need help with
that's what's really practical and that is thankfully now something
that has really been tackled well a lot by the
self-help movement in the last 50 years but also positive
psychology is tackling that from the academic side so there's
some good news there bottom line though is philosophy I
really want to convince you that philosophy is something that
you should be critically interested in this should be a
side hobby of yours for the rest of your life
at the very least what does this really mean what
does it mean to be a philosopher well first of
all read a lot read a lot of books be
interested in stuff I read loads of books diverse topics
of books I read about science history political science philosophy
proper from the old school days I read about psychology
I read about biographies I'll read at all I love
it all it's fascinating all of it builds wisdom within
me all of it I can Jenna I can generate
insights from so start doing that start thinking critically about
your own life start thinking critically about society society's standards
start Chris thinking very critically about how you've been conditioned
and enculturated the effect that is having on you of
course all the information I'm bringing to you through these
videos definitely soak all that up look at it again
and again again think about it critically don't just take
all the ideas I give it you at face value
really think of them contemplate them see how they apply
see how maybe what I'm saying is not right for
you you have to do that you have to do
that critical thinking work don't just sit back like a
slug and just soak it up here's the real vision
though my real vision for you and I want us
to take back philosophy from the academics because what they've
done to it is a crying shame here's the best
analogy I can give to you because everyone has experience
with this Star Wars alright let's talk about Star Wars
what is Star Wars Star Wars is an illustration of
what I'm talking about what is going on in star
wars in star wars I'm talking about the original episodes
the original three is you've got the Jedi who is
the Jedi in the Star Wars universe the Jedi in
the Star Wars universe is a philosopher that's who he
is he is the philosopher he hit he is that
rare part of the general population that rare individual within
the whole population that is working for something larger he
is working towards the ultimate ideal he is living a
virtuous life not only is he thinking about it so
there's that whole mystical Yoda side of the Jedi but
there's also the practical side he's going out there he's
actually fighting the battles right he's creating the wars he's
choosing where to put the energy and where to leverage
make a leverage so that you can change the world
for the better because he sees that there are wrongs
that need to be righted he is the light side
he is delight he is the virtue of the universe
whereas what is everybody else what are all the other
characters in the star wars universe doing what are they
doing who do you have you've got Han Solo you've
got Leia you've got Chewbacca you've got the droids you've
got the storm troopers you've got the the evil emperor
and you've got his his apprentice Darth Vader so what
are all of them doing well they are living first
of all let's let's really separate the Emperor and Darth
Vader from the rest so let's take the rest it's
kind of the normal folk and say that they're kind
of living a comfortable ordinary existence in the universe they're
basically comprising the the status quo and they're just living
their existence right sure Han Solo will go out and
fight here or there but really he's he's a selfish
bastard he's out for himself and he wants sex and
he wants this so he's kind of you know he's
living for the lower values money and sex and whatever
else sometimes he'll go and he'll kind of fight a
little bit here here there to save his life or
the life of his friend and Leia what is she
doing you know she's got a cause of her own
but she's kind of like she's still kind of living
in an ordinary world and so is everybody else now
you've got the Emperor and you've got Darth Vader and
they're like the evil ones right they're the dark side
so they're there they're actually you can say that they're
living consciously but they're like the dark the evil side
of consciousness so how do we now map this on
to our own existence our own reality well the philosopher
is the Jedi they're the Jedi they're looking for about
the the value of high values the virtues that's where
they're trying to live up to the rest of the
masses those are the people that are living unconsciously it's
an unconscious kind of life and you know what that
really is that is the job about he is the
prime example of this so who do you want to
be do you want to be a Jedi or do
you want to be job of the Hut what is
Jabba the Hutt he is the epitome of base values
he is the epitome of living a comfortable relaxed kind
of life it's a life that you live for yourself
it's a life that you live that it's easy and
chill and you're not honoring any kind of high values
he's not after beauty he's not after excellence he's not
after saving the world or helping anybody and he's not
he's not it's like he's not after anything it's not
even after to really improve his own life look at
him he's a fat slug who's just eating frogs and
and then trying to trap Jedi's and his little dungeon
and feed them to a rancor that's what he's trying
to do and that's literally what you can you can
find Jabba the Hutt characters in life I'm sure you
can point them out right now maybe your boss right
or somebody is the Jabba the Hutt character they're not
honoring higher values but really look at this who are
you who are you in the the movie of your
life I hope you can say that you are not
the job of the Hutt character I hope so but
you know what actually I think you are you are
the job of the Hutt character because what do you
want your life are you doing some are you a
Jedi if you're not a Jedi that only leaves two
options you're either the Jabba the Hutt character or you're
some sort of evil Sith Lord a Darth Vader or
the Emperor and really there are a few of those
in life so most of us and in fact most
the evil of life is not some sort of super
or evil most of the evil in life is actually
unconsciousness and it's just complacency it's just being that Jabba
the Hutt really Jabba the Hutt was a horrible character
I mean he tried to kill a Jedi who was
trying to do something good he tried to kill Han
Solo he was really unfair he was he was lecherous
and disgusting and just a fat slob not somebody that
you want to emulate I mean do you want to
live your life that way is that what your life
is about is being Jabba the Hutt the most Jabba
the Hutt that you can it's like yeah I want
to be the best job of the Hutt that I
can be I don't even know if that makes sense
because if you wanted to do that it's almost like
you were kind of moving towards some sort of value
Jabba the Hutt's don't think like that they just live
unconsciously they don't recognize what they're doing but the Jedi
think about what the Jedi is in this universe he
is the conscious one he is the one that knows
he's got wisdom wisdom that the rest of the masses
cannot even understand right he's got the force the force
on his side what is the force what is the
equivalent of force and if you think that this is
just a vague metaphor that I'm making it is not
this is very literal there's a very literal mapping between
Star Wars and your life very very real here so
pay attention don't dismiss this the force is your understanding
and control of yourself and what is that that is
your own mastery of your psychology that is you having
wisdom you being able to control your emotions you really
understanding yourself and being in touch with who you are
who you are authentically you having a cause and a
purpose that all of your actions are moving towards and
that cause and purpose is outside yourself and it's something
big something powerful something based in consciousness not unconsciousness that's
the force how strong is your attunement with the force
right now do you really know your psychology do you
know how you work and I don't mean just know
in knowing theoretically I mean no do you know practically
can you practically control yourself do you have discipline problems
you have procrastination problems do you have anger problems do
you have negative thinking problems well if you do then
you do not really understand your psychology and you are
no Jedi or at the very least you are a
struggling Jedi very early on in anis training and it's
like a Jedi who is trying to pick up a
rock with the force and you can't do it that's
basically you somebody who has very good self mastery somebody
who understands their psychology and can control their psychology has
discipline has willpower has emotional intelligence has wisdom is pursuing
the right values in life is studying life is a
student of life appreciates that and is working toward something
high conscious what is that person doing well that person
is being a Jedi he is like the master Jedi
he is obi-wan Kenobi he has full mastery of the
force he knows the force the force flows through him
he is a vehicle of the force and he uses
it for good in the world and he is what
he's powerful he's got power he's got power that others
Envy he's got power that he can impart on other
people but only those that are willing to listen because
what in the Star Wars universe not every schmuck can
be a Jedi I mean you don't just get people
running up to Ben Kenobi asking to be a Jedi
why is that that's because the Jedi training process is
challenging and it takes a certain a certain initial drive
to even want you to start to pursue that path
Luke Skywalker had it that's why we related with him
he had something in him he had that little spark
that was enough to get him on the path because
all it takes is to see the value of it
as long as you can see the value of the
path you will get on the path even if right
now you have no idea what you're doing even if
you're lost the fact that you can recognize the value
is enough but most people cannot even recognize the value
and those are the people that dismiss philosophy as airy-fairy
those are the same people that will post youtube comments
on my videos and say stuff yeah I mean all
you're saying is good but it's idealistic and it's not
going to work for my life this piece of advice
is not going to work for me that's fairy tale
land fairy tales abstraction philosophy psychology all theory where the
results give me the results give me the results I
am giving you the results a Jedi gets phenomenal results
but he doesn't go on the path for results and
he doesn't ask himself every five minutes where are the
results he's smarter than that he's wise he's a long-term
thinker he knows that he has to really understand the
force psychology understand it play with it master it then
he can go out there and do battle and he
be phenomenal he can be so phenomenal he'll spits he'll
send chills up your spine and if you think that
this is just sort of a superhero fantasy you're dead
wrong because I'm very literal here you can literally have
the power of a Jedi in your life if you
commit yourself to the path the path that I'm talking
about here this is not theory although it sounds like
it this is not abstraction although it is this is
true power when you can master yourself there is very
little in this world that can stop you and that's
hard to explain to people it's hard to really get
this across to someone who does not have that initial
spark for wisdom who could not even see the value
of the wisdom it's hard to get across the value
of wisdom to someone who does understand that wisdom has
really deep value it's kind of like taking Jabba the
Hutt and saying you know what Jabba the Hutt I
see that you've got this ice palace here and you've
got they do have this cool thing going on with
your with your Sail Barge off in the desert you
can move around and you can you've got you're sitting
on your couch it seems so comfy and you get
to have nice entertainment by throwing people down into your
pit with the rancors and you get to eat those
yummy frogs like that's all great how about we strip
you of all that put you on a grueling path
of self mastery put you on a Stairmaster you goddamn
fat slug and then some years down the line you
will be able to wield a lightsaber and control the
forces of nature with your mind how about that Jabba
the Hutt what do you think is going to say
what do you think Jabba the Hutt is going to
say yeah let's do it let's do it this whole
thing I've got going here I don't need Jabba's palace
Jabba's palace that's let's go let's go apprentice with Yoda
yeah let's go apprentice with Kota and listen to Yoda's
mysterious backwards grammar talk and try to figure all this
stuff out try to master myself get on that on
that Stairmaster and then maybe five years from now I'll
be able to go do something good for the world
Yeah right that's what job with hot wants that's what
he's after no he's too far gone he's too far
gone he's he is the Darth Vader as well it's
like Darth Vader he's too far gone to be to
be brought back to the light side he's too far
gone he's too comfortable he's too comfortable and it's very
hard for someone like obi-wan Kenobi to come in there
and to show him the light side he's not going
to see it he's not gonna he's just literally not
going to see it he's not going to believe it
it's going to be outside of his reality completely and
that's what I see when I when I'm trying to
share some of this wisdom with you guys and literally
I'm sharing with you hundreds of thousands of dollars of
the best of the best wisdom from the last two
and a half thousand years I'm talking about the best
seminars that I've been to and I've seen the best
books that I've read never had hundreds of them the
best compilations of notes that I that I've looked and
studied everything that I've experienced with my clients in with
myself all the work that I've done I've taken all
of that distilled all the nuggets of it and it's
here for you the real question is are you going
to see the value of it are you even going
to register it or are you going to be a
fat lazy Jabba the Hutt and sit there and poke
fun and criticize and laugh and dismiss and come with
excuses and be a victim be a victim of your
own circumstances and be cynical and say that it cannot
be done and that this thing that is being shown
to you is not true it is true you just
don't see the light and in fact it is equally
powerful the information that I'm telling you this wisdom philosophy
psychology is equally powerful to the effect of the force
in Star Wars universe it's equally powerful here you will
be shocked when you actually do some of this work
at the parallels it will be freaky to you you
will literally have that moment and this is another analogy
like to use of neo in the matrix seeing the
matrix for the first time and seeing that and then
also then starting to bend the rules of the matrix
that's literally what you're going to discover when you get
really deep down this rabbit hole it's an extraordinary experience
it's very profound it's deeply fulfilling like it's so fulfilling
it brings you to tears when you realize some of
this stuff it's that powerful and if you think that
oh well it's just kind of like you know airy-fairy
there's the fulfillment part which is kind of airy-fairy you
know what is fulfillment but there's also the performance that
you get because don't forget who a Jedi is a
Jedi is not somebody who just sits in a cave
he is not a hermit he is active in the
world some sometimes he's a hermit sometimes he's reclusive but
then he can always pick up his sword and he
can always use his force powers he actually go go
out into the world onto the battlefield and fight the
good fight and he prevails and the way he prevails
oh my god he's got the power of the universe
behind him literally and this is literally what she will
have because let me tell you what you think is
the universe is actually your psychology and everything that you
think that is limiting you everything you think that is
outside of you that is holding you back that is
your psychology holding you back my friend so when you
understand the rules of psychology and you master them can
you imagine what you can do what you can do
with your life what you can accomplish you cannot even
imagine that right now your imagination is literally because it
is part of the your psychology and your mind it
has literally been so disused it's in such disrepair and
it's been so conditioned by the negative forces of society
and all of your past experience that you cannot even
see what is possible for you in fact I understand
your own psychology better than you do right now and
I can actually see your potential more clearly than you
can because I see through the fog I can see
through the fog because I've walked the path not completely
but I've walked it much further than you have therefore
I can look back and I can see how what
you're saying to me it's it's almost laughable sometimes when
I read some of the comments or I get some
emails people complaining about some of their problems in life
sometimes it's laughable to me because I look at that
I'm saying oh my god that person is dealing with
that like that's that's preposterous that problem is all in
his mind yet he thinks it's out there it's the
same way that the people in the matrix they think
that they can't fly and they can't jump and that
everything is real and everything is out to hurt them
but they don't they don't realize that it's an illusion
and the people that are in the matrix and they
do see it like neo and Morpheus and all the
others they can they can bend the rules so that's
literally what I'm doing with my life is I'm bending
the rules not physically I'm bending them psychologically because you
don't even appreciate right now how much of the rules
are in your head versus out in the real world
and it's crazy when you start to actually feel that
it takes some time to get there you won't get
there immediately this video probably won't do it for you
either this will just get you on the track I
want to get you on the track I want you
to open your mind and to tune in I want
you to tune in with that filter that you've got
somewhere maybe it's it's covered in dust and grime and
spider webs that filter that you've got that searches for
wisdom and truth and latches on to it because well
I want you to do is I want you to
use that filter to to pick out what I'm saying
to you and to say yes this is where I
get on the path this is something that is powerful
I can feel it somewhere in there I can feel
it somewhere even though I have my doubts my worries
my concerns my victim mindset just something about this feels
right and I want you to get on the path
and see where it takes you just see where it
takes you I can take you somewhere very cool some
are very powerful somewhere extremely profound I want to show
you the light side I want to show you the
