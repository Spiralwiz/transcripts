            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/InmNW96qcUk' target='_blank'>An Intro To Serious Philosophy - Top Advice For Philosophers</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Leo Gura's Early Interest in Philosophy</b>: Leo Gura began engaging with philosophy in his mid-teens, with an ambition to understand reality. Despite studying philosophy at university, he claims that his real philosophical understanding was self-taught, through decades of independent study. He criticizes the university system for its lackluster teaching of philosophy and asserts that he has reached an absolute understanding of reality through his own philosophical endeavors.
</li><li><b>Career as a Philosopher</b>: Describing himself as a professional philosopher, Gura has turned philosophy into a million-dollar career outside of academia. His philosophy is grounded, advanced, practical, and unique, and he believes he's found a way to make this often complex field both deep and accessible.
</li><li><b>Introduction to Meta Philosophy</b>: Gura introduces the concept of meta philosophy, which involves philosophical reflection on the process and methods of philosophy itself, questioning whether there are correct ways to conduct philosophy and warning of potential pitfalls.
</li><li><b>Aims for the Episode</b>: Throughout this episode, Gura aims to offer young, aspiring philosophers tips that will save them years of potentially wasted effort. He plans to address key questions: the nature of philosophy; whether its the right path for you; if theres an 'ultimate endpoint'; which philosophies are worth studying; whether philosophy should be professionalized; and the pros and cons of engaging with philosophy. 
</li><li><b>Personal Approach to Philosophy</b>: Gura champions a self-derived approach, arguing that even if he shares his understanding of the 'absolute truth', it is imperative for philosophers to go through the process of deriving it for themselves to avoid having others' beliefs imposed upon them.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's early interest in philosophy</b>: As a child, Leo Gura was fascinated by existential and scientific questions about life and reality. His early experiences involved philosophical discussions with his family during nightly hot tub sessions or road trips. Engaging in conversations about the universe, existence, and consciousness sparked his passion for philosophy. 
</li><li><b>Growing curiosity about the nature of consciousness</b>: Leo's interest led him to contemplate animal consciousness and the varying levels of understanding different species may possess. This made him question why human understanding and consciousness were seen as the pinnacle of intelligence, opening up the possibility of a higher form of consciousness beyond human comprehension.
</li><li><b>Exploration of existential issues during adolescence</b>: In high school, Leo engaged in debates on religious beliefs and God's existence. These discussions led him to the field of epistemology, the study of knowledge, as he questioned the certainty and origin of knowledge. This marked the beginning of his growing skepticism about existing belief systems and dogmas.
</li><li><b>Reflection on personal relationship with reality</b>: Apart from considering reality from an objective standpoint, Leo started to contemplate his personal relationship with the universe, other living beings, and his future. 
</li><li><b>First philosophical book</b>: Leo's first encounter with a formal exploration of philosophy was through an encyclopedia that gave an overview of various philosophical schools. This likely encouraged a broader and more diversified understanding of philosophy.
</li><li><b>Introduction to various philosophies</b>: Leo Gura read about different philosophies like materialism, idealism, solipsism, existentialism, nihilism, and more. He wondered about finding their truth as each one disagreed with the other and decided to decipher it for himself. 
</li><li><b>Approach to philosophy and science</b>: Rather than memorizing these different schools of philosophical thoughts, Leo was interested in finding out the true nature of reality. He also studied science, particularly physics, chemistry, and biology in order to get a deeper understanding of reality.
</li><li><b>Dedicated sessions for philosophical contemplation</b>: Despite his father's advice about philosophy being a purely academic pursuit, Leo continued to examine the realm of philosophy by conducting deep contemplation sessions late into the night. He focused intensely on understanding the nature of reality.
</li><li><b>Realization of groundless ideologies</b>: After a steadfast pursuit, Leo realized that all belief systems, including science and religion, are groundless and are justified in a circular manner. From the different philosophical schools, he connected the most with skepticism or pyranism, which questioned the possibility of knowing anything about reality.
</li><li><b>Aspiration to write a book</b>: An ambitious Leo wanted to write a book that would critique all philosophical systems, but realized the limitations and assumptions inherent in his own philosophically deconstructed system. This realization made it difficult for him to pen down anything positively constructive about reality.
</li><li><b>Insights into the academic world</b>: Exploring the university system made Leo realize that the structure does not prioritize truth-seeking or genuine philosophy. He decided to focus independently on his philosophical pursuits rather than becoming a part of a system he considered corrupt.
</li><li><b>Transitioning to video game design and establishing an online business</b>: Moving away from philosophy, Leo became a professional video game designer before starting his own online business to secure financial freedom and creative autonomy. The aim was to create a space where there would be no external influence on his work.
</li><li><b>Return to philosophy and exploration of personal development</b>: Upon achieving financial independence, Leo got back into self-education and personal development. He resonated with the philosophies of Owen Cook, a pick-up artist, which reignited his passion for philosophy. This led to his idea for Actualized.org, a platform with an amalgamation of philosophical concepts that are both profound and practical.
</li><li><b>Importance of curiosity and questioning in philosophy</b>: In this segment, Leo emphasizes that curiosity and questioning are at the heart of philosophy. He shares his personal journey into philosophy, triggered by insatiable curiosity and the need for answers. This journey included meditation, self-inquiry, personal development research, and use of psychedelics. He asserts that it led him to a complete understanding of existence or "omniscience," heightening his awareness of the shortcomings in the way philosophy is traditionally practiced in universities and the western world. Leo sees philosophy as a quest for understanding for its own sake and perceives philosophy's value in its ability to explore the depth of life. In his opinion, most people miss out on the depths of life, being occupied with material pursuits and superficial success rather than delving into philosophical inquiry.
</li><li><b>Gura's Encounter with the Concept of Enlightenment</b>: Gura encountered the concept of Enlightenment through a book titled 'Enlightenment: The Damnedest Thing' by Jed McKenna. This work profoundly affected him, leading to depression for a week as it deconstructed many of his illusions about life and reality. However, it also helped him understand the seriousness and importance of Enlightenment and the connection between Enlightenment and philosophy, thereby motivating him to intensively explore meditation, non-duality, self-inquiry through retreats and to experiment with psychedelics. 
</li><li><b>Influence of Meditation and Psychedelics on Gura's Philosophical Journey</b>: Gura's philosophical journey was significantly influenced by meditation and the use of psychedelics. During a 10-day vipassana Meditation Retreat, he experienced Enlightenment for the first time. He describes this occurrence as so momentous that it led him to a new dimension of reality that he and most people previously did not know existed. His subsequent deep dive into psychedelics further opened up his understanding of reality. 
</li><li><b>Philosophical Interconnections</b>: Throughout his journey, Gura found numerous interconnections between philosophy, personal development, and psychology, which led him to dedicate serious effort into these areas. This engagement culminated in the launch of his platform, Actualized.org.
</li><li><b>Mirroring the Importance of Philosophy</b>: Leaning on his personal experience, Gura suggests that the journey into philosophy is essential for people who are insatiably curious and cannot live without seeking answers. He perceives questioning reality as so crucial that life would seem meaningless without it. 
</li><li><b>The Foundations of Knowledge</b>: Gura claims that philosophy is the root and source of all knowledge and is more fundamental than science. He asserts that all knowledge originated from the first beings who began questioning their existence and reality. Science itself, Gura notes, used to be called natural philosophy and was an offshoot of philosophy. 
</li><li><b>Philosophy's Questioning Beyond Scientific Findings</b>: Gura also encourages people to continue questioning even those aspects of reality that science claims it has understood. He criticises the complacency with accepting ready-made answers from science or religion instead of cultivating wonder about life. 
</li><li><b>The Meaningfulness of Philosophical Depth</b>: Gura describes the depth brought about by philosophical inquiry as the most meaningful aspect of life. At the same time, he laments that most people miss out on this depth by focusing on material pursuits and personal achievements without deeper questioning about life.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Functions and Joy of Philosophy</b>: Philosophy serves two main functions: personal development, awakening, and the creation of useful insights for humanity. There's a joy derived from understanding subjects, concepts, and their workings. This understanding does not have to serve any practical purpose like making money or getting sex, but can be appreciated for its own sake.
</li><li><b>Questioning as a Superpower</b>: The core of philosophy is questioning. Humans uniquely have the ability to ask profound questions about reality and perceive meaningful answers. Most people underutilize this capability which, when exercised, could be transformative in life.
</li><li><b>The Art of Asking Questions</b>: The philosopher deliberately cultivates the art of asking questions. They do not reserve questioning for pragmatic reasons or trivial purposes. Instead, they engage in deep, persistent questioning, utilizing this superpower for broader and deeper exploration.
</li><li><b>Example Philosophical Questions</b>: Leo Gura presents a list of philosophical questions for guidance and to ignite curiosity about profound existential topics. These questions range across a variety of issues including: the origin of reality, the nature of consciousness, the validity of religious beliefs and their comparison to science, the definition of truth, and the framework for a better society.
</li><li><b>Assessing Affinity for Philosophy</b>: Philosophy is right for those who are deeply curious about existential questions, love truth and understanding, enjoy questioning and contemplating, and are excited by existential discussions. Those interested in philosophy should contemplate their motivations and what they seek to achieve from it.
</li><li><b>Fields of Philosophy</b>: There are various fields within philosophy. Metaphysics or ontology handles fundamental questions about existence and the nature of things. Epistemology deals with knowledge and how we determine what we know to be true. Other fields include ethics and morality, which focus on questions of right and wrong, aesthetics, political philosophy, philosophy of science, logic and mathematics, philosophy of mind and consciousness, sociology, history, spirituality, mysticism and philosophy of language.
</li><li><b>On the Fields of Philosophy</b>: The study encompasses various fields including ethics, morality, aesthetics, political philosophy, science, logic, mathematics, religion, mind, psychology, sociology, history, spirituality, mysticism, and the philosophy of language. Each field asks specific questions about aspects such as existence, knowledge, systems, paradigms, social constructions, and culture.
</li><li><b>On the Act of Philosophy</b>: Philosophy requires diligence and effort. Genuine observations and insights, as opposed to mere speculation and beliefs, are essential to the practice. An open mind unclouded by cultural programming, preconceived notions, and biases is necessary for effective questioning. Philosophy involves questioning how things are, not how we want them to be. 
</li><li><b>On Self-Deception in Philosophy</b>: The mind's self-deception mechanisms like confirmation bias and projection can hinder philosophical thinking. Understanding the intricacies and difficulties of fundamental questions requires thousands of hours of deep questioning and contemplation. Many people are fooled into thinking they're skilled philosophers without proper practice or critical examination of their conclusions. 
</li><li><b>On Developing Skills for Philosophy</b>: The skills of questioning and critical thinking need to be honed for good philosophy. Cognitive skills, such as observing reality and contemplating, are integral to the practice. Exploring different perspectives and asking powerful questions are crucial for successful philosophical inquiry. Overcoming biases and cultural programming is important for genuine observation and understanding. 
</li><li><b>On the Practicality of Philosophy</b>: Not merely an intellectual exercise, philosophy is also about practicing self-honesty and acknowledging biases. It involves deep reflection and questioning to uncover truth. Philosophers must invest time, effort, and possibly money, to authenticate their beliefs, avoiding common pitfalls like groupthink, creating ideologies, and rationalizing any belief. 
</li><li><b>On the Nature of True Philosophical Inquiry</b>: Philosophy, according to Leo Gura, isn't about nitpicking technicalities but about gaining understanding of the 'big picture' topics of reality, self, mankind, and consciousness. It also involves the willingness to question all assumptions and not limit thinking to specific ideologies or personalities. 
</li><li><b>On Pure Philosophy</b>: Pure philosophy, a concept introduced by Gura, is about questioning everything, free from debating, arguing, proving, or ideologies. It's a personal pursuit of understanding with radical open-mindedness, willing to question every assumption and derive explanations from scratch. 
</li><li><b>On Approach to Philosophy</b>: To engage in philosophy, Gura advises being open-minded, enjoying the process, and embodying it in daily life. Over-reliance on a particular philosophy or specialization is discouraged. The preference lies in contemplation and integration of knowledge from various fields for a holistic understanding. 
</li><li><b>On the Role of Philosophy in Life</b>: A tool for self-improvement, philosophy can be applied to enhance self-esteem, overcome depression, cultivate happiness, improve relationships and communication, and de-program harmful ideologies. The ultimate aim is to achieve absolute truth, existential understanding, omniscience, transcending physical death, and transforming personal outlook. 
</li><li><b>On the Practice of Philosophy</b>: To start with philosophy, Gura advises choosing a fascinating question and dedicating time for contemplating it. Philosophy requires integrity and embodiment, transforming oneself beyond theories and facts. His upcoming resources, including a book and a course, aim to provide further guidance in this respect.
</li><li><b>Doing Philosophy and Self-Deception Mechanisms</b>: Leo Gura explains that doing philosophy involves spending hundreds of hours in contemplation and self-observation. This process helps you identify various forms of self-deception and cognitive biases that often distort one's thinking, including confirmation bias and projection. Despite rigorous practice, it's possible for anyone to fall prey to such self-deceptions. However, philosophers can attempt to catch and correct these errors over time.
</li><li><b>Importance of Quality and General Thinking</b>: Gura stresses that philosophy primarily involves improving the quality of one's thinking. Even experts may excel in their narrow specialties but fail to think effectively outside of their specialized domain. The capability to think broadly about a range of subjects is a mark of a good philosopher.
</li><li><b>How Philosophical Work is Accomplished</b>: Philosophical work involves a combination of contemplation and observation. One should neutrally observe the external world and their mind and contemplate over these observations. This includes thought experiments that challenge existing beliefs. Additionally, exploring various perspectives and infinite possibilities allows for a well-rounded philosophical understanding.
</li><li><b>Role of Questioning</b>: Powerful questioning forms the backbone of philosophy, focusing on fundamental assumptions that often go unnoticed. Developing the ability to ask the right questions can significantly enhance individuals' lives in a range of scenarios.
</li><li><b>Philosophy and Self-Reflection</b>: Philosophers should introspect and observe their own thought processes while philosophizing. This is referred to as "going meta". This form of self-reflection is critical for philosophers to spot their biases and maintain the integrity of their work.
</li><li><b>Self-Honesty and Bias Avoidance</b>: Philosophy is not about assumptions or beliefs, but the pursuit and validation of truth through rigorous questioning and deep reflection. To facilitate this, philosophers must uphold self-honesty and strive to avoid all forms of cognitive and other biases.
</li><li><b>Pitfalls in Philosophy</b>: Highly speculative and casual discussions without the requisite contemplation or observation do not constitute philosophy. Many people often confuse philosophical contemplation with armchair speculation or guessing. Serious philosophy requires dedicated exploration into the nature of the consciousness of beings or objects, rather than forming assumptions about them.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Traps in Philosophy</b>: Philosophy is not about reinforcing pre-existing ideas or bias, often described as 'mental masturbation'. Instead, it requires serious work and integrity to unearth new insights and challenge deeply held notions. People who engage in this type of contemplation need to be wary of their cognitive biases and engage in continuous self-correction.
</li><li><b>Philosophy's function as a serious pursuit of truth</b>: Leo posits that true philosophy involves actively seeking and verifying the truth beyond mere speculation. This can require significant efforts and investement, which most people aren't willing to make, leading to a bias towards their preconceived beliefs.
</li><li><b>Dangers of subscribing to group think or ideology</b>: Leo points out that much of what people call philosophy is rigid adherence to certain ideologies or group think rather than genuine philosophical inquiry. Individuals often identify themselves with a certain philosophy and defend it, a practice Leo sees as misguided.
</li><li><b>Critique of academic approach to philosophy</b>: According to Leo, academic philosophy often gets bogged down in technicalities, minutiae, publications, and the study of established philosophers' works. This isn't true philosophy which should focus on basic, simple, and fundamental questions about big picture topics.
</li><li><b>Criticism of argumentative approach and desire to prove beliefs</b>: Leo argues that philosophy is not about arguing, proving beliefs to others, or subscribing to specific ideologies. Additionally, he highlights the pitfall of trying to prove one's understanding of reality to others, as some truths are so deep they cannot be proven.
</li><li><b>Highlighting the importance of personal understanding in philosophy</b>: Leo emphasizes that the true measure of a philosopher lies in their understanding of themselves, mankind, the workings of the mind, consciousness, and reality, regardless of their authority, credentials, and status.
</li><li><b>Advising against reliance on authority or credentials in philosophy</b>: Leo advises that philosophy should not be judged based on the authority, credentials, or status of the philosopher, but on the merit of their ideas. Even highly intelligent individuals can hold incorrect or ineffective ideas.
</li><li><b>Call for direct verification of philosophical beliefs</b>: Leo pushes for direct experience and verification of one's beliefs rather than blind acceptance of theories or assumptions. A true philosopher seeks knowledge and understanding unpossessed by bias or preconceived notions.
</li><li><b>Impact and importance of philosophy on practical life</b>: Leo Gura in this lecture emphasizes how philosophy can be practically applied for everyday life. He maintains that philosophy not only lends theoretical insights but also requires its embodiment into real-world circumstances. He argues against the idea of using philosophy to escape the realities of life and instead promotes the concept of implementing it to real-life situations ranging from running a business to managing a relationship. Leo believes that philosophy should integrate both theory and practice which significantly impacts the overall living experience, including emotions, interactions, and the very perspective towards self and life.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions and Traps of Philosophy</b>: Leo speaks about several common misconceptions and traps specific to the field of philosophy. He suggests that quite often individuals tend to use philosophical theories as a medium to avoid confronting relevant and immediate needs of life. People often misinterpret the practice of philosophy, considering it to be something too abstract that wouldn't have any bearing on practical life. Philosophy, as per Leo, should involve a balance of deep theoretical work with ample practice. He stresses that true philosophy requires personal transformation and embodying an understanding of reality, transforming one's emotional system, interactions, and sense of self. More than merely conjecture, the practice of philosophy brings about fundamental change in one's outlook and behavior.
</li><li><b>Philosophy and Power Games</b>: Interestingly, Leo also addresses how philosophy sometimes falls prey to power games and political activism. He suggests that when philosophy is used as a tool to acquire power or meet political targets, it strays from its real purpose, which is the pursuit of pure understanding. He asserts that power becomes a priority over truth, which signposts towards a failed approach in philosophy. 
</li><li><b>Theoretical and Practical Aspects of Philosophy</b>: In this section, Leo Gura discusses how philosophy is as much about theory as it is about practice. He stresses that it is essential for a philosopher to go beyond abstract thinking and apply it in real-world scenarios. He gives examples of how philosophy can guide one's rudimentary everyday decisions, such as dating, running a business, or dealing with personal loss. Philosophy, according to Gura, is transformative  it significantly impacts how you view yourself and how you interact with the world.
</li><li><b>Adverse Consequences of Practising Philosophy Incorrectly</b>: Gura points out that practising philosophy incorrectly or in a half-hearted manner could lead to delusional thinking or even the creation of harmful ideologies. Consequently, the essential trait of a philosopher, as per Gura, is the courage to face the truth and its effects, no matter how intimidating or challenging they may be. 
</li><li><b>Introduction of "Pure Philosophy"</b>: At this juncture, Leo introduces his own concept of "pure philosophy"an approach to philosophy that is free from biases, well-grounded in reality, and focused on the pursuit of pure understanding above all else. He suggests that true philosophy involves rigorous introspection, radical changes, and an unwavering commitment to seeking truth, even if this leads to 'insanity' or unpopular conclusions. 
</li><li><b>Approaches for Embarking on the Philosophical Journey</b>: Lastly, Leo gives practical advice on how listeners can embark on their philosophical journey. He emphasizes that philosophy is a serious endeavor that requires integrity, deep three-dimensional thought, an insatiable curiosity, and the courage to bring about radical personal changes. Moreover, he recommends dedicated contemplation on enticing philosophical questions and the practical application of philosophical insights to one's life. The culmination of philosophy, according to Leo, lies in attaining a complete understanding of oneself and reality.
</li><li><b>Introduction to Pure Philosophy</b>: Leo Gura introduces the concept of pure philosophy, which he claims involves completely free thought divorced from both history and named individuals. Pure philosophy is distinct from academic philosophy and history, as it cares only for the ideas themselves. It is an impersonal collection of ideas and concepts where one evaluates these concepts based on their merit, edits them freely, and blends them for the best possible understanding of reality. Pure philosophy endorses no debating, arguing, proving, debunking, or ideology but stresses personal understanding. The practice assumes infinite open-mindedness and willingness to question everything, regardless of the consequences. 
</li><li><b>Core Questions In Pure Philosophy</b>: Leo Gura identifies four key questions at the heart of pure philosophy: "How is anything possible?", "What is anything?", "Where did you come from?", and "What is consciousness?". A bonus question he includes is: "How do I live the best life?". Gura contends that if one can answer these five questions, they have figured out the whole universe and asserts interest in these core questions is fundamental for anyone calling themselves a philosopher.
</li><li><b>Techniques for Serious Philosophers</b>: Leo Gura suggests techniques for serious philosophers. Sitting down and contemplating for hours in solitude is a top priority, as is asking powerful questions and continually refining them. Simplicity, clarity, and cutting through confusion are also key. Ideally, complex concepts should be conveyed using simple language and metaphors for accessibility. Developers of pure philosophy are expected to demonstrate the ability to explain the nature of the entire universe in a clear and straightforward manner. 
</li><li><b>Claim about Omniscience</b>: Leo Gura asserts that it is possible to access omniscience and absolute truth through diligent practice of philosophy. He argues that with this level of profound understanding, one can explain the nature of the entire universe using simple vocabulary. Building on this, he urges philosophers to render their teachings clear and accessible, utilizing simple vocabulary rather than dense, academic language. 
</li><li><b>The Pursuit of Philosophy</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of truth-seeking regardless of the resulting consequences. He suggests that in the pursuit of genuine understanding, a philosopher might even choose the annihilation of mankind or the entire universe, underscoring the radical and dangerous nature of the endeavor.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Missteps in Philosophy</b>: Leo Gura advises serious philosophers against focusing too much on minor details and losing sight of the bigger questions. He further cautions against over-complicating philosophical concepts, urging clear and straightforward explanations instead. He stresses the perils of self-deception, urging philosophers to stay vigilant against personal biases but remaining indifferent to the biases of others. 
</li><li><b>Transcending Biases</b>: The concept of pure philosophy stresses the importance of recognizing personal biases and making a concerted effort to transcend them. The goal is to ensure that these biases do not skew the philosophers ability to understand reality truthfully. 
</li><li><b>Striving for Absolute Understanding</b>: Leo Gura argues that the ultimate goal of a philosopher is attaining absolute understanding. He claims that if done correctly, the practice of philosophy can provide precise answers to existential questions about reality. This level of understanding, he contends, is extremely profound and cannot be easily put into words.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's Philosophy Techniques</b>: Leo mentions several techniques for anyone looking to delve into serious philosophy. Firstly, there's radical skepticism, which means questioning everything, even one's own ideas. Studying multiple philosophies for an overview of diverse perspectives and cultivating radical open-mindedness are recommended. He emphasizes the necessity of questioning science's assumptions like one would question religious claims. Using psychedelics is seen as essential to understanding the true nature of reality. Keeping a commonplace book, a repository of notes and quotes, is advised for recording insights. Other techniques include serious meditation practice, studying psychology and sociology to understand the social influences on one's mind, working with making and collapsing distinctions. To effectively communicate complex concepts, mastering language and the art of articulation is crucial.
</li><li><b>Articulation of ideas</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the significance of refining how one articulates ideas and philosophies, in one's own mind, to make them clearer and more precise. He suggests that this is a powerful skill set, which takes years and continuous practice to develop.
</li><li><b>Engage other intellectuals</b>: He encourages conversations and dialogues with high-quality minds, discussing existential philosophies rather than engaging in ideological debates. Quality outweighs quantity in these interactions.
</li><li><b>Writing</b>: Leo advises philosophers to write out their thoughts and ideas. Writing keeps one's philosophy organized and promotes self-reflection.
</li><li><b>Public speaking</b>: Beginning a YouTube channel, blog, or speaking publicly helps refine ideas and gain feedback. Teaching philosophy can also dramatically improve comprehension.
</li><li><b>Practical aspects of life</b>: Do not neglect practical aspects of life like survival skills, managing finances, etc. Apart from abstract philosophical skills, practical skills are equally important.
</li><li><b>Avoid ideological defense</b>: Philosophy should not be turned into a defense of any dogma, world view, ideology, or pet theory. The pursuit of truth requires killing all personal pet theories.
</li><li><b>Simplicity and clarity</b>: Purity and simplicity in philosophy are critical. Avoid confusing academic and technical jargon. 
</li><li><b>Consciousness is key</b>: In the pursuit of truth, understanding the concept of consciousness is pivotal. This requires having a crystal clear, direct experience of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Open-mindedness</b>: Philosophers should be open to new ideas and perspectives. A high level of open-mindedness is necessary for philosophy.
</li><li><b>Enjoy the process</b>: Philosophy is not a race to the ultimate truth. It's crucial to enjoy the process and journey of philosophical inquiry.
</li><li><b>Philosophy embodiment</b>: Philosophy should not be purely academic; it should be embodied and reflected in daily life.
</li><li><b>Self-deception</b>: Philosophers should always be wary of self-deception, their own biases and assumptions.
</li><li><b>Generates practical insights</b>: Philosophy can be utilized to generate useful, practical insights for everyday life.
</li><li><b>Original thinking</b>: Encourages philosophers to be original thinkers and not to adhere strictly to ancient philosophies. One should contemplate more and read less for better philosophical insights.
</li><li><b>Avoid attachment to one school of philosophy</b>: Caution against adherence to a single school of philosophy like Buddhism. One should focus on the ideas and insights, and not get bogged down in deciphering dense technicalities of philosophy.
</li><li><b>Understanding philosophical concepts</b>: Leo emphasizes that complex philosophical works can be summarized and understood in easier and shorter terms, eliminating the need to read through extensive philosophical treatises.
</li><li><b>Use of Wikipedia in learning philosophy</b>: Suggests that Wikipedia is an excellent resource for getting an overview and understanding various philosophers' ideas without needing to read their extensive works.
</li><li><b>Integration of different disciplines for omniscience</b>: Leo advises integrating various disciplines like philosophy, science, religion, mysticism, spirituality, self-help, psychology, and sociology to reach a holistic understanding of life and reality.
</li><li><b>Clarity in philosophy</b>: He stresses the importance of clarity in understanding philosophical ideas and differentiating between the history of philosophy and the act of doing philosophy.
</li><li><b>Studying self-help along with philosophy</b>: Suggests that integrating self-help into the study of philosophy makes the latter more personal, practical, and impacting.
</li><li><b>Avoiding over specialization</b>: He warns against narrowly focusing on specific philosophies or philosophers, and instead, encourages the study of the big picture to combine different philosophies and philosophers for a broader understanding.
</li><li><b>Philosophies worth studying and overrated philosophies</b>: Lists multiple philosophies and philosophers that he believes are worth studying, and cautions against spending too much time reading and studying philosophers he deems overrated.
</li><li><b>Combining various philosophies for absolute truth</b>: Leo suggests that a combination of various philosophies comes closest to reaching absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Philosophy and mental masturbation</b>: Admits that philosophy can devolve into mental masturbation if not done properly, but argues that well-practiced philosophy can be extremely practical and transformative. 
</li><li><b>Practical application of philosophy</b>: Suggests that philosophy can be applied practically to improve one's life, including making money, improving self-esteem, changing depressive tendencies, fostering happiness, and improving relationships.
</li><li><b>Philosophy Can Be Used to Improve Communication and Empathy</b>: Leo Gura suggests one can utilize philosophy to enhance communication, empathy, and alleviate suffering from harmful ideologies.
</li><li><b>The Ultimate Aim of Philosophy</b>: According to Gura, the ultimate goal of philosophy is to achieve omniscience, absolute truth, and existential understanding. This endeavor, he believes, is the most valuable pursuit a human can undertake.
</li><li><b>Cannot Avoid Philosophy</b>: Gura argues that philosophy cannot be avoided. Without deliberate engagement in philosophy, an individual will be automatically programmed by their cultural surroundings and environment.
</li><li><b>The Potential Dangers and Rewards of Philosophy</b>: If approached incorrectly, Gura warns that philosophy can lead to confusion and toxic ideologies. However, if pursued correctly, it can lead to profound understanding, enlightenment, realization of absolute truth, infinite consciousness, and even immortality.
</li><li><b>The Cultivation of Mind and Intellect</b>: Leo Gura highlights the benefits of nucleating the mind and intellect. He suggests that one of his greatest joys in life is derived from his own cultivated intellect, which brings satisfaction and pleasure superior to any physical or material experience.
