hey this is Leo for actualise org and in this
video I'm going to talk about how to make friends
all right welcome back let's talk about how to make
friends so in this video I want to talk about
some of the problems that you might have if you're
lacking in friends if you feel like you need more
friends or if you feel like you want more from
your friends maybe you want to get more out of
your friendships that you're currently getting and to to do
that there's actually some some deeper insights that you need
to have about how friendship works what it is and
how you can go about just improving the quality of
your friendships and also the quantity so we'll take a
look at all those and some of these things are
simple but some of these ideas are also just things
that you haven't thought about because so many people just
take friendship ring granted they'll say like all friends you
know friends I get friends spontaneously I just naturally get
friends if they come then I have them if they
don't then I don't but actually you can put some
thought into how your friendships work and if you do
that they'll function much better you'll be much more satisfied
with them because for most people their friendships just function
on autopilot and when that tends to happen you don't
get the best results in fact you might get some
bad problems so in this video we're gonna really talk
about that and also how do you go out there
and specifically start to make friends so let's talk about
that first of all I think a very important idea
that needs to be introduced right off the bat is
the following quantity of friends versus quality of friends a
lot of people will get hung up on this and
they'll forget about quality completely and don't just focus on
quantity and it'll be all about quantity how many friends
do you have and probably the worst example of this
is your Facebook friend count or how many followers you
have on Twitter or something very shallow like that your
Facebook friends those aren't real friends that's that's that's not
a friend what I want to encourage you in this
video is to start thinking a little bit deeper about
your friendships and this means instead of focusing on the
quantity and trying to get more friends than everybody else
that that you know that's that's a losing game you
don't want to play that game instead what I want
you to really think about is focusing on the quality
of your friends the quality how deep are your friendships
the friends that you're friends with how supportive are they
really how much do they really care about you as
you and not from what they want from you try
to extract something from you how many of your friends
are actually people that you meet up with on a
continuous basis and then how many of them are just
people that you shoot one text message to once a
month okay so quantity you don't need dozens or even
hundreds of friends I think a lot of people get
this wrong is that they think that well I need
to have 50 friends or a hundred friends in reality
you can't make use of those you can't make use
of a hundred friends you don't have the time or
the energy in the day to really extract all the
like the benefit and you can out of a friendship
with a hundred type of friendships it's not going to
work what you really want is you want to focus
more on quality and depth if you get even two
or three or let's say five really high quality deep
friendships going with people that are really in line with
your values people that really support you people that are
really interested in what you're interested in people that you
really vibe with people that really kind of push you
and challenge you or willing to be open and authentic
with you people that you actually spend some time with
face to face not just through electronic means those those
are going to be enough to really satisfy you so
if you don't have a lot of friends right now
in your life this is actually very encouraging because this
doesn't mean that you have to go out there and
now befriend a hundred new people that's not necessary at
all really what you're looking for is you're looking for
just a couple a handful I'm really high quality friends
so that's the first idea that I wanted to introduce
the second idea is this idea that friends require energy
and time energy and time to get the juice that
you wanted a friendship you have to invest in it
right a lot of people they'll just kind of take
friendships for granted we have to you have to ask
yourself okay how many friends do I really want but
not only how many do I want but how many
friends do I have time for how much energy I
want to invest in each friendship that I have if
you only want to invest five minutes then what can
you expect to get back then all you can probably
spec to get back is a Facebook wall post on
your birthday that's it what else can you expect if
you want to invest more time and you're willing to
invest a couple hours a week into your friendship then
you can expect a lot more from it so really
ask yourself why do you need these friends do you
need these friends just to look cool do you need
these friends just to out friend somebody else that's in
your social circle just they have more status little more
prestige I mean those are all silly and stupid reasons
in the end you want friends because friends give you
deep companionship there you can have interesting conversations with them
there's stuff that they can help you with you can
help them with you can learn from each other you
can push each other you can grow together that's really
why you want a friend right okay so if that's
the case then you got to think okay well that
means I probably have to put a little or time
into each friendship that means that I'm going to have
fewer friendships not so many as we had here fewer
of them and then I'll put more energy into them
but then also get even more out of them it's
actually really nice because I think that a lot of
people unknowingly they actually get very frantic and and like
very busy with their social life they're so busy because
we have they have all these friends hitting them up
and all these activities that they want to be doing
but then you're not doing any of it you're just
kind of hitting your friend up once a week or
twice a week with a text message or something like
that is this like very shallow interaction and what happens
is that you're wasting a lot of time communicating but
you're not really building anything long-lasting or deep there so
instead of wasting so much time communicating writing little stupid
messages back and forth I mean nothing why don't you
actually like get one or two good friends start meeting
up with them face-to-face and start having like richer interactions
like actually doing interesting activities together growing together then like
wow you can you can not be so frantic with
all this messaging that's going back and forth you can
just focus on a couple of people it's much more
sane kind of a you know a minimalist approach to
friendship building alright so I think it's better to really
focus on just a few let's talk about now some
of the problems so if you're watching this and you
don't have very many friends maybe you don't even have
a single friend and you want to make some how
do you go about doing this let's take a look
at first of all why this is happening why do
you not have any friends and how how come you're
not able to create friendships I think there's really four
key elements to why people have problems making friends so
let's cover those and then we'll go into each each
point in depth one is not socializing you simply don't
go out you don't interact with people you're sitting at
home or you're cooped up at work or you're doing
something when you're not about you can't physically interact with
anybody so if you're not physically coming into contact with
people then of course you're going to be very limited
with how many friends you can have and make it's
probably the biggest biggest hurdle that people have when they
don't have friends hurdle number two is the following you
don't have the time and the energy also a problem
so this goes back to what we were trying to
earlier how much time do you have for your friends
how much energy do you have I mean if you're
working 10 hours every day and you really focus on
your career then how many friends can you expect to
be able to have to maintain how much energy also
are you willing to invest in the friendships or do
you just expect that the other friend will do all
the work are you going to invest time and energy
into setting up meetups and coming up with activities that
you're doing and kind of rounding everyone together and being
kind of the leader of the group if you're not
willing to do that then be honest with yourself and
say that I have more important priorities maybe you do
and there's nothing wrong with that you don't necessarily need
friends but if you want the benefits of having a
friend or a circle of friends then you need to
also be cognizant of the investments that will be required
both time and energy wise so if you don't have
the time but you do want friends then you have
to ask yourself okay how can I make some time
to start to reprioritize some things maybe you shouldn't be
working so much maybe you you should cut out some
the TV that you're watching all the time or maybe
you should cut out some of your internet browsing time
or whatever you're doing that's wasting a lot of time
in your life and I guarantee that you're doing stuff
that is totally useless and wasteful cut that stuff out
and then spend it with your friends point number three
is you're ruining opportunities so this means that you are
coming into contact with people maybe you even have friends
in your life but then you're losing them it's like
you're you're actually doing something to repel people and the
reason that is is because you're ruining the opportunities for
building lasting friendships and why is that happening ultimately it
boils down to the fact that you're in some way
very judgmental you're too judgmental of people for example for
me I've never really had a problem with building friends
on this point like I am introverted and I tend
to be in my own shell I don't socialize that
much I don't go out that much when I'm really
like working or focused on something else so in that
sense I won't have a lot of friends because of
those points but I won't have a problem with like
meeting someone new and then clicking with them that's because
I'm very open minded I'm not judgmental about somebody when
I meet them when I meet somebody like I'm interested
in that person and that person has has something just
going for him and I'm not going to judge him
like oh he's you know he's wearing something stupid or
like I don't like his ideas or this or that
see if you're very judgmental and picky then of course
you're gonna be bumping into a lot of people then
you're going to be judging them so harshly that you're
not gonna want to be friends with them instead what
you got to do if you have this problem is
you got a you got a you just got to
open yourself up there's stuff that you can learn from
other people and you don't necessarily need to become that
person you can just be around that person be a
friend with that person of course if you don't really
mesh value-wise at all then you probably won't be good
long-term friends you won't be like growing together anything but
you can still be a loose acquaintance with that person
but then if you do click then you can really
go deep a lot of times you don't know who
you click with until you spend a little time with
them and see and really get to know them so
don't judge a book by it's cover don't be too
judgemental with the kind of friends that you keep have
all sorts of friends around you have friends with all
sorts of different beliefs and different ideas right this will
make you more open-minded this will expose you to all
sorts of new info and the the fourth point is
the reason that people don't have friends is it because
they're very shy and they're very unconfident in social situations
even if they're out in about they're just very shy
in their shells or they are fake in their conversations
so if you're fake all the time or you're so
shy and so scared to talk to people that you
have trouble introducing yourself or troubling open up a conversation
or trouble introducing the conversation topics that you are interested
in if you have trouble doing that then of course
it's going to be hard for you to make friends
and you probably don't have very many friends because you
need to you need to take the initiative especially at
the beginning when you're trying to build a friendship you
have to be putting energy into it and so is
the other person you can't expect the other person to
do all the work for you you have to share
yourself too if to put yourself on the line you
have to take your own ideas and the things that
you love about life and you have to share those
because the other person can't read your mind he or
she they don't know what you're into so if you
never talk about where you're into in a conversation then
that person might not ever know about it and then
you hope you miss an opportunity to click with that
person on on anything so if you're always just like
very very reserved or you're trying to be fake you're
trying to put on this this fake facade when you're
around people then of course that's creating a problem too
and in the end no one really wants to be
friends with a fake person because what really they want
to do is they want to see the authentic you
authenticity that's what is attractive and magnetic when you're being
fake people usually see that through see through that very
quickly and then they will not want to have anything
to do with you so that's something that you want
to work on if you have that sticking point okay
so those are the four points ask yourself where you're
really having trouble I think that for most people if
they're really having trouble making friends or have zero friends
at all it's really because of point number one you're
not actually going out and being around people you need
some ideas for how to do that see your life
right now it's like this this pattern this habit of
just going to work or going to home or doing
doing stuff that's very isolated and insulating instead you want
to open that up that means you need to do
what you need to go join some new group join
a club join an organization go hang out with the
people that are at work you know organize a work
event where you're going off out after work and socializing
in some way to a bar club or restaurant or
some some sort of event that you're doing together you
got to do that maybe join some sort of sports
team or sports league you can go to meetup calm
there's tons of meetup groups that you can basically find
a meetup group on any topic in an entire world
that you want to and join that so you got
to do a little bit of research and figure out
where you can place yourself where you're literally surrounded by
more people this is probably the biggest thing because if
you do this the other points they'll tend to autocorrect
right this idea about being shy and fake well if
you're around a lot of people all the time then
this shine fake thing it will eventually dissolve eventually you'll
just kind of you know you'll break through it you'll
bust out of your comfort comfort zone if you're around
a lot of people but if you're never around a
lot of people then it's not going to happen you're
going to remain shy and fake and if you're always
judgmental about people that - if you're always around a
lot of people then you're not going to be able
to maintain that judgmental attitude so the reason that you're
very judgmental is probably because you're already very isolated and
living in your own little bubble be around a lot
of people be around a lot of diverse people and
then your judgement it'll it'll also dissipate because your mind
will open up people will open up your mind as
you're interacting with them and also if you don't have
the time and energy right now then that too might
change after you go out and join one of these
groups and start to socialize more because as you're socializing
you're seeing little difficult to describe the benefits that you
get from friends a lot of the benefits you get
from friends are very subtle and small maybe a friend
will just tell you about a book that they read
it really liked or they'll tell you about a new
cool restaurant that's opening or they'll invite you to go
with them on some sub trip next weekend and just
like very simple in things like that which can lead
to actually pretty extraordinary profound changes in your life because
maybe then you go to to that restaurant and you
meet your dream spouse there or maybe you go read
that book that they recommended and that turns out to
be a life-changing for you so friends are nice because
they open you up to all sorts of new ideas
this is why having diverse friends is important don't just
be friends with people that are identical to you you're
not getting you're not getting that cross-pollination that you will
get when you're interacting with people who are very different
than you I love having friends that are very very
different for me I learned so much from them to
me those are some of the most rewarding and interesting
