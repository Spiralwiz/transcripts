Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays I got my Santa hat
out as usual at this time in the season but
don't let this silly hat fool you because today we
have a very foundational and very important topic a very
serious topic which is the issue of marketing it's what
I call the deep problem of marketing it's a marketing
problem that no marketer talks about ever and it goes
way way way beyond merely just marketing you might say
to yourself well Leo what does marketing have to do
with self-actualization and personal development and spirituality and consciousness I
mean isn't marketing just for marketers and I'm not marketing
anything so this topic is it important for me oh
how wrong you are by the end of this episode
your mind will be completely changed about that you see
marketing isn't just for marketers and in fact most marketers
don't even understand what they're doing when their marketing marketing
isn't just about selling you things it's about shaping reality
and culture it's about getting eyeballs it's about having influence
within the entire web of belief of society and shaping
that that's what marketing is really about and that's a
very important topic when it comes to consciousness truth and
understanding reality and your own personal self-actualization so this issue
of marketing which we're going to go into it affects
you very personally and individually but also it affects all
of us collectively as a society because we're all in
this together we're all in this collective web of beliefs
that we call culture see people just assume that culture
media society and science discover the truth and then they
deliver it to you or to us but this is
a very naive notion of how knowledge works knowledge does
not work this way this is a complete taking for
granted of the challenges of discovering truth and then the
challenges of delivering and spreading truth throughout culture you see
it's one thing to discover the truth for an individual
that's hard enough it's a whole other beast of a
problem to then get that truth to percolate through culture
and translate to every corner of the world across millions
and billions of people and to change their individual minds
but then also to change the collective minds of all
the institutions and cultures and subcultures and businesses and religions
and schools and all of that which has been built
up on the prior base of knowledge people just assume
that if something is true and it's important then obviously
I would have heard about it that's how they reason
and so sometimes that presents a problem when I'm trying
to present some deep information because in your mind it
might seem like well Leo if this was really true
if in light Moe's really true or if some other
stuff you were saying was really true then wouldn't everybody
be talking about it like scientists and academics and school
teachers and in the news and all my friends and
all my Coker's wouldn't they all be talking about it
and of course the answer is no of course they
wouldn't to assume that they would is to completely take
this issue of knowledge for granted and it's to misunderstand
this challenging deep problem of marketing reality is not just
as simple as looking around collecting the facts and then
just sharing the facts with everybody and then everybody agrees
it doesn't work that way have you noticed that it
might seem like it works that way when you're living
in your little bubble but when you go outside your
little bubble you see that reality is much more complicated
and knowledge is much more complicated and people disagree about
a great many things there's actually very little agreement between
people about almost anything from scientists to religious people doesn't
matter the religious people bicker back and forth between each
other and so do the scientists and so do the
religious people and the scientists against one another and so
do the politicians and so do the schoolteachers and everybody
else and I'm not even talking about yet different cultures
when you start getting into different cultures that exist and
I'm not even talking about yet different eras that humanity
has been alive in so today 21st century but we
know all sorts of crazy things that people believed and
subscribe to just 100 years ago let alone 500 years
ago or a 2,000 years ago see to take this
naive view of the spreading of truth is to assume
that reality is very easy to figure out and then
ideas are very easy to spread when in fact this
is exactly the opposite of what's true spreading the truth
is always an uphill battle because minds and cultures are
resistant to new ideas have you noticed this very resistant
much more resistant than anybody really appreciates people think that
all if an idea just has merit if it's good
if it's backed up by evidence then everyone will accept
it yeah good luck that's not how it works maybe
that's how it works in the very very long term
like if you're talking about centuries or millennia then maybe
you could make that case but it certainly doesn't work
that way in your lifetime spreading new ideas costs billions
of dollars do you realize this changing culture is an
enormous undertaking and if you really wanted to do it
you would need to expend billions of dollars or have
thousands or millions of people at your disposal as volunteers
to work for you which is kind of like what
religions do that's how they change culture although of course
they also employ billions of dollars as well in many
cases if we're talking about organized religion and information generally
take centuries to spread through culture there have been discoveries
that we have made within general relativity for example or
quantum mechanics over over a hundred years ago and those
ideas still haven't really percolated through mainstream culture that's something
I'll talk about in the future when I talk about
quantum mechanics in a separate episode see what people don't
understand is that they unconsciously judge every teaching against the
background of culture in which they grew up so culture
and of course culture is marketed to you especially these
days culture sets the backdrop against which you assess everything
else so anything that I teach you anything you hear
from some guru anything you read in a book what
are you gonna do you are going to compare that
to your background of culture and then based on that
you're gonna criticize it judge it or dismiss it or
decide to accept it and if it's something that really
goes against your culture then you're probably gonna dismiss it
and you're gonna be very skeptical about it and also
you just might not resonate with that thing at all
even if you might think it's true it just won't
resonate with you because what resonates with you is the
culture that you grew up in in the same way
that the kind of food you like is largely shaped
by the kind of culture you grew up in the
kind of food you ate when you were a small
child that's the kind of food you generally like as
an adult with some exceptions here and there for adventurous
people but see people generally what they assume is they
assume that their culture is perfect it's likely oh we
live in 21st century our culture what are you talking
about our culture got us it's got its problems but
as far as truth and reality goes I mean our
culture is the best that there's ever been because we've
got science these days and we've got universities and things
and look we're able to do all this cool technological
stuff we're building solar panels and electric cars and self-driving
cars and Internet and all this we've got all this
sort of stuff and so what's wrong with our culture
aren't we living in a culture of truth no our
culture is deeply deeply materialistic and see the problem with
culture is that it's so widespread that you really have
nothing to contrast it against so it's hard to even
see how your culture can be wrong or untruthful because
what are you comparing it to there's nothing else that
you can compare it to now if you maybe start
to go around the world and travel around a lot
and really talk to people from different cultures than yours
and you really try to get to the bottom of
their beliefs and you see a lot of conflicts between
their culture and your culture maybe then that starts to
kind of shake you out of your little bubble but
most people don't do that even when people travel mostly
they just do touristy stuff so they don't really get
exposed to different perspectives very much and also because modern
marketing and modern business has gone global it's gone international
which means that mainstream Western culture is now starting to
infect every single culture all around the world and this
is the culture of materialism and it's very hard to
then introduce ideas to people who grew up in a
culture of materialism and know nothing else and think of
it as reality it's hard to then talk to them
about ideas which contradict materialism because like you don't even
have the possibility in your mind that there could be
other alternatives to materialism materialism looks so solid and so
real but of course it's not just an illusion that
happens from being exposed to so much culture and today
our culture is very materialistic I mean both metaphysically materialistic
but also of course commercially materialistic and that's not an
accident those things go together have you noticed that the
healthiest knowledge the healthiest teachings and insights and wisdom doesn't
percolate through culture and that when you find it it's
usually in rare pockets you just don't see it advertised
all across TV you see marketing isn't just about sales
marketing marketing is about influence and eyeballs it's about exposing
millions of people to certain kinds of paradigms assumptions and
ideas and then those ideas they become reality they define
what reality is reality is not just something that you
find out there you're constructing it your culture is constructing
it marketing and business are constructing it so the really
important question is what kind of ideas is the majority
of the human race being exposed to this is a
very important issue and there is a war raging a
silent war behind the scenes that most people are not
aware of over determining what kind of information we feed
to our children to adults to the general population at
universities and everywhere else see because channels of information and
eyeballs this is power and knowledge is never free it's
never been free and it's not free currently people take
knowledge so for granted and especially nowadays because we have
the internet you can make the case that all well
Leo knowledge is as free as it's ever been I
mean what's not free about it you can just like
go start a blog for free online go to wordpress.com
or tumblr or something you can start your own blog
and you can post any kind of crackpot ideas that
you want to any kind of crazy conspiracy you can
post whatever you want you basically have unlimited freedom of
speech these days if you live in a first world
country so what's the problem but you see it's not
that simple and it's never been that simple because the
issue isn't whether someone person can espouse some crackpot idea
that's always been the case the question is how many
people can you influence who will actually listen to you
yeah I can go start a crackpot blog or you
can or somebody else can but then without marketing no
one is even gonna know about those ideas and conversely
if someone has some deep truth or deep wisdom and
they start they're a little tumblr blog no one's gonna
know about it you're not gonna know about it you're
gonna live your whole life and you're gonna die without
ever having known about it the only things you know
about are the things that are mass marketed to you
see the only reason you're watching me the only reason
you're listening to actualize that org is because I put
a lot of effort into the marketing of this thing
without the marketing there would be nothing you wouldn't know
about this you see because the kind of stuff that
I talk about nobody talks about in mainstream media nobody
talks about it on Facebook nobody talks about it on
TV have you noticed this this is not an accident
and marketing actualized org has been very very challenging extremely
challenging it's very challenging to market this stuff going all
the way back to the Greeks and Romans 2,000 years
ago to the time of Socrates knowledge was never free
Socrates was put to death be of the knowledge the
heretical knowledge that he was spreading within the Greek society
within Athens see they put him to death because knowledge
is power and the kind of knowledge that he was
spreading well that was upsetting the status quo there's always
the status quo who is in power and the status
quo is always interested in maintaining its power and it
will fight to the death for it and of course
how his power maintained not just physically the most important
power is not physical power it's not military power it's
mind power its idea power it's the power of beliefs
it's the power to create reality through concepts and then
to tell everybody that that's reality and you didn't create
anything see that's the beauty of the mind is that
it can spin whatever kind of stories it wants and
then it can just say oh that's not a story
that's reality and most people will believe that so we
can look at Socrates we can look at kings and
dictators of the past and what did they do they
very strongly controlled the flow of information they ban certain
books they outlawed certain people from saying certain things it
took us many many centuries to start to get freedoms
such as freedom of speech that we enjoy today and
still you know within limits and only within certain countries
and that's a very recent development as far as human
civilization goes and many areas in the world still don't
enjoy those freedoms today so kings and dictators were very
much about controlling the media controlling information and using propaganda
and I mean you can see it even all the
way to today today dictators and authoritarian rulers still do
that they still try to control the media they still
I do propaganda look at what's going on in Russia
look at what's going on in North Korea not to
mention first real countries where it also happens but we'll
get into that a little bit later but also of
course think of the church think of the Spanish Inquisition
think of for how many centuries the church controlled the
flow of information and ideas and beliefs think of how
many wars were started over ideology think of the witch
trials so knowledge has never been free and it's not
free today because in the past although knowledge was largely
controlled by the church or by the state today it's
less so controlled by the state today is controlled by
in another sense something even worse science academia and business
modern business controls culture and controls what reality is for
millions and billions of people around the world and the
problem is that modern business is only really concerned about
one thing maximizing profits it doesn't care about truth it
doesn't care about consciousness it cares about maximizing its own
profits and science and academia you might think oh well
but they they are the ones who who really pursue
truth even at the cost of profits no they don't
modern science in academia is also very much corrupted by
business and money science is very much biased towards researching
those domains which have technological applicability technologies that can be
sold that can be patented they can be marketed so
this issue of marketing is not just about what kind
of ads you see on TV although of course obviously
it is about that it's about all these other ancillary
domains we're where marketing is important market is important anywhere
where you're trying to get a consensus of people to
agree on anything see how do you do that by
marketing those who have control and power they control access
to eyeballs think of North Korea it's really illustrative to
study what's going on in North Korea on the inside
how the North Korean regime is controlling and brainwashing its
citizens into basically maintaining that entire criminal enterprise that's what
that is North Korea's is just like one giant mafia
with tens of millions of hostages at stake and the
kind of extraordinary lengths that they go into to indoctrinate
and propaganda is their entire population he's really mind-blowing you
should read some books about that I have a book
list I mean I have a book on my book
list that talks about that very very eye-opening and sobering
but it isn't stopped with North Korea of course the
kind of stuff that happens in North Korea actually happens
in first world countries as well it's just happening a
little bit more under the radar under the veil of
freedom of speech under the veil of just mainstream news
or just Facebook or just TV ads you see that's
what makes the propaganda in first world countries even more
dangerous than North Korea because in North Korea it's kind
of obvious from the outside that the propaganda is very
very strong but then you look at American culture for
example and you say oh well look we don't have
propaganda like that and yeah sure we don't have propaganda
like that but we have a different version of propaganda
it's more subtle it's a lot harder to notice it's
a lot easier to think that oh we don't have
any propaganda so our culture just is real ality think
about education education is basically a propaganda program from start
to finish grade 1 through grade 12 and even college
by the time you go through that entire gauntlet you
have been indoctrinated to think inside of a certain box
according to a certain paradigm certain things and then anything
that goes against that from then on you're gonna consider
it as nonsense or insane or you're gonna think of
it as just like a weird fringe non-mainstream stuff but
you see there is a war waging right now in
America for example over what kind of information is taught
to grade schoolers to high schoolers and the healthiest and
most conscious information is not even mentioned during 12 years
of schooling not even mentioned a lot of times people
get into actual eyes out or they start to listen
to my stuff and they're like wow why didn't anybody
teach me this in school it's not an accident they
didn't just ignore it they didn't just like oops we
forgot no no no there's there's an exertion of power
going on and the people who have the power they
are not interested in teaching you consciousness or truth for
the most part because they themselves are unconscious so what
they're interested in is they're interested in teaching you the
sorts of things which lets them maintain the power and
control over you and which lets them sell you a
bunch of stuff both ideas and intangible goods so that
you're caught up in the cycle of consumerism and then
you're earning them money you see they program your mind
with the things you need to be buying and pursuing
and desiring and also fearing so that by the time
they're done with you you are their little zombie robot
you have no mind of your own but meanwhile you're
thinking oh I really desire all this stuff no you
don't you desire it because you've been programmed since birth
with that kind of stuff through schooling and everything and
so have your parents and your parents parents and there
is a constant battle going on secretly within every single
Society over what kinds of information our youth are gonna
be indoctrinated with see right now with the trump administration
in power the Conservatives are pushing their agenda through schools
they're trying to actually change the entire school system and
what's being taught in the school system right because the
people in power want their ideology spread through education generally
speaking and there's a lot more than I could go
into about that but we need to move on see
what rational and scientific people don't appreciate about this topic
of marketing is they think that oh well rationality and
science will just win out and all these things you're
Lear so you're just talking about like silly cultural norms
and things yeah those exist there's like dogmas and traditions
and and old ideologies and stuff those exists but generally
rationality will break through all that no who won't rationality
is serving that science is serving that they are in
bed with the enemy you have to understand that power
is largely antithetical to truth reality and consciousness the people
who are interested in power they're not interested in truth
and conversely the people who have truth reality and consciousness
they're not very interested in power because in truth everything
is equal everything is one nothing is more important than
anything else and what power is about is about saying
oh this thing is more important I am more important
my group is more port my nation is more important
my city is more important and therefore I'm gonna fight
for it and I'm gonna exert power over everybody else
to get my agenda push through that's what the ego
is all about the ego is power-hungry why because it
doesn't know the truth because it's not conscious if it
was conscious it would surrender all desire for power but
since it's not conscious it doesn't know any better so
to it all that life is about is acquiring more
and more power and then using that power to fulfill
shallow ego gratifications like buying stuff taking vacations I want
you to really notice that nothing high consciousness is ever
advertised for example on television or taught in schools or
universities what is the agenda of science to advance itself
it's not truth people think the agenda of science is
truth no it's not the agenda of science is first
and foremost to advance itself secondarily some truth but first
to advance itself what is the agenda of business to
enrich itself business doesn't care about truth at all it's
to enrich itself and it's bad enough that science is
corrupted by this agenda to advance itself but it's secondarily
corrupted there's a second layer of corruption because business is
then infiltrating science see because these days science is very
much dependent on the kind of funding that it gets
from business and the kind of funding against is the
kind of stuff that business finds marketable and the kind
of stuff that business finds marketable is the most low
consciousness stuff that there is there's a lot of money
and power to be made in catering to the unconscious
instincts of mankind and this is the deep problem with
modern marketing it's not just that modern marketing is selling
you crap you don't need it is of course but
it goes way deeper than that it's that it's it's
literally to do that in the purposes of doing that
it's infecting your mind with an artificial notion of what
reality is it's carefully engineering all your values and desires
and everything you're pursuing such that then you become like
an infected host that then goes off and does what
business wants you to do is which is play into
this game and then you wonder why you're not satisfied
why you're depressed why you're not passionate about life it's
because you're in this system you're so deeply in the
system you don't even know you're in this system modern
marketing is concerned with maximizing sales it's concerned with pushing
your emotional buttons to do that it promises easy answers
towards that end because if I can promise you an
easy answer you're gonna pull out your wallet and pay
me modern science sian marketing scientifically engineers marketing to be
irresistible so actually psychology and sociology and all these other
fields are being carefully used and funded with billions of
dollars every single year to carefully fine-tune and lab tests
the best ways to propagandize you to fill your mind
with all the wrong ideas about paddle of life so
that you become a consumerist zombie see do you understand
that companies are spending billions of dollars every year to
do this and that is highly effective especially now in
the internet era with computers every single ad is being
split tested and micro tested and micro calibrated every single
word of every single ad that you read online every
word in there is carefully tested to make sure that
every single word there triggers all your emotional buttons that
gets you to pull out your wallet and buy stuff
that is actually low consciousness stuff which is against your
ultimate highest good as a human being modern marketing has
no ethics and no high consciousness values no one within
modern marketing asks the question is this truthful no one
ever asked the question is this healthy no one ever
asked the question is this elevating humanity or dragging us
down into depravity because modern marketing is purely selfish all
it really cares about is maximizing sales and towards that
end anything goes and there's very little laws or regulations
or ethical norms that are exerting pressure on anything other
than that so of course it's a race to the
bottom it's a race to see who can get the
most sales by making the most empty promises and selling
you the least conscious things that can possibly be sold
to you damn the costs and perhaps what's worst of
all about this is that nobody is talking about this
it's like an open secret you've never heard anybody on
TV talking about this no one in the news none
of your favorite news anchors or political commentators none of
your celebrity friends or business people you don't hear Bill
Gates talking about this or Warren Buffett talking about this
or Allen muskie talk you know nobody's talking about this
because this is like the secret fuel that fuels our
entire society all of business and it's just taken as
well that's the only way it could work modern marketing
is particularly damaging in the following areas the way that
soda food alcohol and tobacco is advertised Pharmaceuticals oh man
the amount of selfish and reckless marketing that goes on
in the pharmaceutical industry is just like it it's shocking
it's shocking the things they're able to get away with
like they kill hundreds and thousands of people and they
destroy millions of lives with pharmaceuticals like it's just so
completely corrupt is so corrupt that doctors who are supposed
to be looking out for your health are completely corrupted
by the pharmaceutical industry to peddle their drugs to you
for all the problems that that you have that could
be fixed without using drugs and then people get addicted
to these drugs there's all these side effects with these
drugs they end up taking these drugs for years for
their entire lifetime and they don't know any better because
they just trust their doctors and the doctors well they're
corrupted by the pharmaceutical industry and these pharmaceutical companies you
know every single major pharmaceutical company has been fined by
governments both in America and in Europe to the tune
of billions of dollars many billions of dollars every single
year this happens they lose lawsuits because of the kind
of shady dishonest and unethical marketing that they do and
that's just the tip of the ice like the actual
criminal stuff let alone just the board the borderline gray
area unethical stuff that they do which really isn't illegal
but still completely shameful and it still is destroying the
fabric of a reality and it's making human beings unconscious
say these these these pharmaceuticals are literally [ __ ]
with your brain chemistry to make you a zombie millions
of people on antidepressants millions of people taking cholesterol medication
and all sorts of other medication mood enhancers and and
all this sort of stuff which is actually completely destroying
your ability to be conscious into self actualize because they're
sold on this idea of just take a pill on
this pill will solve all your problems how about the
advertising of gadgets and technology this area is also not
immune from from low consciousness marketing a lot of gadgets
that are pitched to you these days are completely unnecessary
and people get obsessed with and there's this entire culture
we have this entire subculture of like techno files people
who are into the latest follow the latest iPod the
latest gadget latest this the latest that entire websites that
catered that just giving you gadget news like it's porn
and then people get hooked on that and then you
get hooked on that so much that it's like when
you don't have your latest gadget with you or you're
not able to get it for Christmas then you're depressed
you're sad and then all your happiness goes into that
it's like wow I'll be happier next year when when
the next PlayStation comes out the next Xbox comes out
when the next iPhone comes out that'll solve all my
problems as if what about the marketing of all these
financial products and gimmicks if you turn on CNN or
any major TV news station what are the what are
most of their ads gonna be it's gonna be financial
gimmickry IRAs stock investments mutual funds retirement plans annuities life
insurance all these sorts of stuff and this is just
complete sleazebag marketing these firms are making billions and billions
of dollars basically handling other people's money and in many
cases just people out of their money and promising promising
them basically uh dreams of becoming rich how about the
marketing of various kinds of flimsy education programs a lot
of online universities and things like data get marketed these
days which are against the users best interest how about
the marketing of kids food and toys this is a
particularly pernicious problem because you've got kids that are three
four five six years old they don't even know what
it's like to grow up free of addiction they get
addicted from the very very early stages these days with
targeted laser targeted scientifically engineered marketing to corrupt their minds
when it comes to the kind of food they eat
the kind of toys they want to play with and
then so by the time these kids enter school and
then they become teenagers and early adults these people they
can't focus they can't concentrate they are eating garbage food
and all this has been programmed into their minds from
the very early stages so it becomes extremely difficult to
then unwire all that stuff how about the marketing that
goes on of movies games and books this is also
problematic notice the kind of movies games and books that
are marketed the most it's the most lowbrow low quality
stuff that you can imagine and how much of your
time is is then focused on on this following your
favorite movie the next Star Wars movie following your favorite
game the next game in the franchise or the kind
of book and the author just keeps pumping out books
but what is this this isn't high consciousness stuff these
aren't books that will transform your life these are books
this is media it's gonna waste a bunch of your
time and it's going to make you so addicted to
this sugary nonsense that they're pitching you that then when
I tell you to do something like go discipline yourself
and meditate for 20 minutes you can't do it because
how is 20 minutes of meditation going to compare with
the next star movie well this latest one got pretty
bad reviews so maybe they'll compare favorably but you get
the idea see that's the problem society is is poisoning
you with sugar metaphorically metaphorical sugar of course literal sugar
in all your food that's happened for the last 50
years now and that's a big problem with obesity but
um but it's also poisoning your brain with metaphorical sugar
how about clickbait titles you see those all online how
about the the mainstream news and I'm not criticizing the
factual nature of the mainstream news what I'm just criticizing
is the the business bias the pro-business bias that all
news has it's pro-corporate all news is basically pro-corporate because
they have to be because they are earning millions and
billions of dollars every single year from all those financial
companies and pharmaceutical companies and food companies and all this
other [ __ ] that needs to be advertised through
their channels so they have to be friendly to that
they can't piss off their advertisers so they have to
be pro corporate and of course that means that on
the news you will never hear anybody talking about anything
that I'm saying here never ever because what I'm saying
here isn't gonna earn anybody money and they're in the
business of earning money those news people they earn 10
million-dollar 20 million dollar a year salaries how do you
think they can earn that kind of money only by
participating in this program and they participate in this program
without even knowing that they're doing it some of them
no but many of them don't they themselves are brainwashed
by their own [ __ ] you might think that
I'm talking about some supreme reptilian overlords who sit in
the government somewhere and who are masterminding all of this
know if there are any kind of reptilian overlords they're
just as unconscious as the people who they're [ __
] over because people don't want to [ __ ]
over other people all the unconscious people do that because
they don't know any better and how about the marketing
of religion it might seem like I'm just picking on
science here I'm picking on business but you know religion
is still marketed these days and religion is interesting because
you don't usually see TV ads for it it's more
like word-of-mouth and sort of like that but still that
that's also a way of marketing you see marketing isn't
just ads marketing is any way to influence anybody and
getting eyeballs and then what you use those eyeballs for
well you know that can vary you could use it
to earn money you can use it to to pitch
a religion you can use it to make a cult
whatever whatever or you could use it to enlighten people
you know you can use it for good or for
evil notice that nobody talks about the real solutions to
mankind's problems you don't hear people talking about the real
solutions to government the real solutions to business the real
solutions for personal happiness they're real solutions to health and
love and spirituality and all this sort of stuff nobody
talks about this on TV nobody's talked about this on
Facebook nobody talks about this anywhere almost nowhere and then
we wonder why we have all these problems because what
business is pitching you what modern marketing is pitching you
is um fake solutions to very real problems and these
fake solutions they're designed not to work so that you
can come back and get more when a pharmaceutical company
is giving you a drug it's actually in their best
interest that that drug doesn't cure you because what's better
for them that they give you one pill and it
cures you or that they give you pills for the
rest of your life that never cure you hmm marketing
is directly responsible for causing the following things obesity heart
disease cancer mindless consumerism economic disparity the growing gap between
the lower and upper class pollution and poison every form
of addiction known to mankind from drugs to sex to
gambling to everything else mind-numbing entertainment laziness the anti mastery
mindset depression suicide anger Dogma tribalism disillusionment with life ignorance
misinformation war even war and the reinforcing of the materialist
paradigm it's in modern marketing the best interest to maintain
the materialist paradigm because when all you think that reality
is just a collection of bouncing atoms and molecules and
nothing else then what is there to do but to
sit back on your ass watch TV eat Cheetos go
to the store shop for first stuff and then come
back and do it all over again and then you
know work your ass off and some corporation to then
go buy yourself a house and to get some stock
options and this sort of stuff and that becomes your
whole life because the materials paradigm is gross by its
very nature it doesn't recognize anything subtle it doesn't recognize
creativity it doesn't recognize consciousness it doesn't recognize beauty and
truth and love it doesn't recognize any of these things
it recognizes the most base forms of human desire which
is like the need for for sex for greasy food
for easy stimulation and for shortcuts and quick solutions and
get rich to keep quick schemes modern marketing sets the
bar so low that when you do actually hear the
truth the truth sounds like insanity because you're always judging
anything you're hearing by what you've heard before and what
have you heard before it's all the stuff you've heard
from every single marketing channel that is popular so your
judging truth against untruth and there's always a giant mountain
of untruth with a little tiny grain of truth so
that giant mountain easily outweighs the little tiny grain of
truth if you are not vigilant about it and in
a sense this is how it must be because society
collectively must evolve up through the spiral dynamic stages what
can be marketed successfully is very much limited by the
audience's paradigm it's very much limited by the limits of
human language and what can be communicated if a thing
can't be communicated it's hard to market it it's also
limited by the predominant needs and desires of the population
so it creates this sort of vicious circle where unconscious
people will only buy things that are unconsciously marketed to
them but then because companies have to cater to that
and market unconscious things that makes the people even more
unconscious and then those unconscious people are themselves the ones
who are running the marketing companies you might think that
well leo I'm not a marketer so you're talking about
marketing here but what can I do about it I
mean I don't do marketing but you work for a
company you see no matter what company you work for
no matter what business that business can only survive because
it's able to market so you need to take a
look what kind of marketing is your business doing if
you're working for McDonald's look at the marketing that McDonald's
is doing that's the whole problem is that it's precisely
because people are working just like zombies like cogs in
a machine that they are actually just unconscious cogs in
this larger unconscious machine called a corporation like McDonald's which
markets and all the people in that company are contributing
to the marketing effort of McDonald's and then ultimately what
that is doing is literally poisoning human beings that's what
you do if you work at McDonald's you literally poison
human beings for a living does it matter if you're
the CEO or you're their marketing guy or you're just
one of the person who like cleans the floor at
night at the McDonald's store does it matter doesn't matter
if you're a programmer working for McDonald's you know working
on their website you might think oh well I'm just
a programmer I'm not part of this whole thing yes
you are by the very fact that you're denying that
you're a part of it that's precisely how you're a
part of it that's how unconsciousness works nobody takes responsibility
for anything the CEO doesn't take responsibility for the marketing
even the marketing guy doesn't take responsibility for the marketing
you know what he'll say he'll you say oh well
leo if we don't do this marketing Burger King we'll
do it jack-in-the-box will does somebody else will do it
and so we have to compete we're forced to compete
with them that's what they'll tell you and then of
course the person who washes the floors or flips the
burgers or cooks the fries he's gonna say well I'm
just a lowly the little employee I don't have anything
to do with marketing I don't have a say in
that yeah but you're working for them you see you're
doing their dirty work you are serving the poison you're
cooking the poison that they are marketing and you'll say
well beliya how am I supposed to survive in society
yeah precisely that's the challenge it's not easy to go
find conscious work most work is unconscious which feeds and
does the dirty work of unconscious marketing the unconscious work
leads to unconscious marketing and vice versa so it's this
vicious cycle and to break out of that cycle takes
consciousness takes vision takes am mission takes higher consciousness values
takes a lot of work to work towards those takes
moving through the spiral dynamic stages and this is not
something that you can just rush I'm not saying there's
a magic solution here to this society has to gradually
evolve through these stages and we're in the process of
that we can't just flick our fingers and tomorrow this
problem is solved but here's what we can do here's
where it gets practical you can take control of your
own life you can stop using society as the gold
standard against which you judge other paradigms and other ideas
you can stop assuming that society will deliver truth and
health to you you can stop sucking on society's tit
and take ownership over the kind of media that you
consume over the kind of businesses that you shop with
and over the kind of companies that you're willing to
work for and the kind of marketing that you're willing
to do and that you're willing to support that's within
your power and that's exactly what a conscious person will
need to do most people don't exercise this power because
they haven't really thought about it they don't know about
it they're just ignorant of it they're unconscious high consciousness
stuff is difficult to market no make no mistake about
it and if you are in a position where you're
trying to start your life purpose maybe you're trying to
start a business you're an entrepreneur or maybe you're starting
to go into the workforce you want to find a
good career for yourself it's not easy to find a
company that does high consciousness marketing that takes real strategy
for you to work towards that and if you are
your own business person you might say well Leo I'm
struggling as it is to get my business going or
my life purpose going and here you're telling me to
do conscious marketing yeah it's much harder to succeed doing
conscious marketing than doing unconscious marketing it's much easier to
create a business which sells people poison then is to
create a business which actually elevates people because the market
is glutted with crap it's hard to convince people to
buy good stuff when someone can go just by a
triple Big Mac with a pound of bacon in it
it's hard to convince them to buy your healthy salad
but that's a bullet you've got to bite that's a
bullet that we as a society have to bite if
we want to evolve you know somewhere we have to
draw the line we have to say no and although
you cannot control what McDonald's does or anybody else's you
can control what you do you can control the kind
of stuff that you are willing to tolerate the kind
of companies you're willing to work for kind of products
you're gonna put out the kind of advertisements you're gonna
put out are you gonna stoop the lowest common denominator
try to appeal to people's most base and unhealthy needs
and desires or are you gonna have a larger vision
for the world that's difficult to do but it can
be done people don't fathom how important marketing is for
learning about higher consciousness things you see the best books
and teachers you have no idea who they are or
that they even exist because they're never talked about on
TV or online or in the media or anywhere else
the wisest masters the human beings who have fear doubt
the most about reality they are completely unknown to you
they are not big-name professors with PhDs who have a
bunch of books that they've written and who've been on
radio shows and all these kind of they're not like
that they're not the neil degrasse tyson's of the world
they're not the same Harris's of the world these people
are marketing masters that's why they're known the only reason
you know about these people or any people or any
books is because somehow somebody mass-marketed it to you most
likely or maybe you just accidentally stumbled upon it but
that's very rare most of these wisest masters they will
die without you even knowing that they existed and that's
the real deep problem of marketing you see people just
expect at all well if there was a really wise
master he would just like be on TV spouting his
stuff and I would certainly hear about it no you
wouldn't of course he wouldn't stop assuming that stop taking
this stuff for granted hmm the world is filled with
incredible things that you will never see on TV the
internet in books or in magazines and even if somebody
writes a book about one of these incredible things how
are you going to discover that book you're not I
want you to see that the things that you know
about are literally defined by the things you're being marketed
by the kind of marketing channels that you open yourself
up to you tend to take marketing that you're exposed
to as the entire possibility space of what's out there
of what's possible and that is an enormous distortion of
the truth there's a whole world out there beyond mainstream
marketing that most people have no clue about but what
that requires that they get off their ass and do
a little bit of work to actually go and investigate
that rather than sitting at home and waiting for it
to come to them don't wait for amazing books to
come to you don't wait for amazing wise masters to
come to you there's a reason that Yoda lives in
a [ __ ] swamp on a planet somewhere far
off in some corner of the galaxy that nobody knows
about that was a very insightful depiction by George Lucas
in Star Wars see that's where you put Yoda cuz
that's where you find a wise Master Yoda's not found
on the internet on the online forums keyed keyboard jockeying
away he's not found on on the evening news that's
not where you find Yoda what would responsible marketing look
like it would look like marketing what elevates the user
taking the users agenda as your number one priority rather
than money is the thing you're selling going to truly
honestly elevate the user and not through some backwards rationalization
like the way that McDonald's will do it see cuz
if I ask this question of the McDonald's CEO he'll
say yeah but Leah we feed we fill a need
in the market people need their Big Macs you know
people are hungry they're starving they're driving to work they
don't have a lot of time they need to feed
their kids they need to drive into McDonald's and buy
their Big Mac by their Chicken McNugget meals or whatever
and that's a real service no that's not what I
mean that's a [ __ ] backwards rationalization what I'm
talking about is your product elevating the user how could
you improve your product so that you could really be
proud of the fact that you're elevating your users consciousness
chicken nuggets and man Big Macs are not elevating a
user's consciousness and you might say well leo but but
how am I supposed to make McDonald's elevate users consciousness
well maybe you can't maybe it needs to die or
maybe you can be crafty and clever and figure out
a way figure out a way to make healthier meals
that taste good that are fast figure it out or
leave that business responsible marketing takes on this challenge responsible
marketing actually cares about improving people's lives responsible marketing cares
about marketing health and dysfunction it doesn't want to a
dict people it wants to actually offer them permanent solutions
to their problems responsible marketing will try to market a
solution which actually then obviates the need for itself so
for example with actualized org my hope is that you
listen to enough of my content that one day you
actually outgrow the need to listen to any more personal
development advice from anybody including myself so that then you're
so wise that you realize hey all these answers he's
talking about they're just inside of me I could turn
inwards self reflect and contemplate teach myself to do that
for myself and then I can derive all this for
myself and much much much more and it'll be way
more powerful than watching it on a video or listening
to it through an audio but it might take you
a while to get there I grow pretty quickly so
I'll actually pay I'll bet good money that I will
grow faster than you and that um it'll take a
good long time before you actually outgrow actualize that work
because we're gonna be talking about some really advanced stuff
in the future stuff that'll take you years to to
get to by yourself but I do ultimately hope that
you get there um that's how you know that it's
actually working it's not my job to to hook you
in for life cuz I could keep talking about [
__ ] all the time for the rest of my
life but that's not really not the point the point
is for you to actually start to self actualize so
you need a little bit of it to get going
so wash it for a few years to get going
these are like training wheels but then eventually you take
off the training wheels and you spread your wings and
you learn to fly by yourself so responsible marketing is
possible it's more challenging but I recommend that you start
thinking and strategizing towards those ends if you're not there
yet if you don't know how to make it work
yet okay that's fine but set it as a vision
set it as a goal work towards it try to
get there in five years and ten years here are
the key takeaways from this episode this is the practical
stuff firstly start to notice how marketing is unhealthy just
how much of it around you there is and start
to notice that marketing doesn't just pertain to TV ads
but to a lot of other stuff that you normally
don't consider as marketing start to notice also the few
good examples of healthy marketing that exist and try to
see what's the ratio what's the ratio of the healthy
to unhealthy start to keep in track start looking at
billboards look at what's advertised on Billboard's and ask yourself
is that healthy is that elevating me or is that
dragging humanity down right there and see what the ratio
is gonna be it might be something like 5 to
100 or maybe 5 to a thousand also stop assuming
that truth will trickle down to you from up above
that society will spoon food feed you the truth it
won't also and this point right here will completely change
your whole life this 1 point go out of your
way to find the unmarked attempts this is how you
really advance yourself in life you don't sit back and
wait for the gems to come to you you don't
wait for me to tell them to you although for
example in my book list I do provide a lot
of those but you go out of your way to
find the unmarked attempts the books the seminars the teachers
the Yogi's the masters the retreat programs the workshops whatever
you need find the people find the resources it's all
out there you got to just go do some research
get off your ass and find it because those people
usually are not marketing masters and they're rarely going to
reach you if they reach you it'll be by accident
and then do your job in trying to spread those
on marketed gems to your friends to people around you
that you know the reward mouth that one point right
there will change your whole life you will discover things
that it will just blow your mind and you'll be
like why isn't anybody talking about this well now you
know why another takeaway is if you're the kind of
person who cares about thinking about how to improve society
and you like trying to make a good impact in
the world and that's maybe part of your life purpose
then understand that one of the biggest improvements we can
make to society is reforming our marketing system it's a
huge source of corruption and unconsciousness and this is something
that nobody almost talks about is the need to reform
a marketing system no one in government is talking about
this no one in business is talking about this but
that actually precisely proves my point see because nobody's talking
about this is because it's not really marketed if government
really wanted to it could invest billions of dollars all
the money that we're wasting on building up a nuclear
arsenal we could take some of that money some of
those billions and invest it towards actually regulating marketing setting
standards and ethics in place and also running public marketing
campaigns which actually try to deliver high consciousness information to
people because businesses are not gonna do it for the
most part so government can play a very big role
in that but actually these days with the Trump administration
it's actually quite the opposite you know just just the
sweet guy I heard some news where the the Trump
administration has actually banned the CDC the Center for Disease
Control which a federal arm which tax statistics for all
the death rates all the disease rates and everything else
it's the statistics arm of the US government they are
banning it from using certain words like science-based and evidence-based
and vulnerable and some of these other kinds of turn
there's a list of like ten of these terms these
are terms that are against the conservator agenda so they're
actually banning the use of these words for the CDC
see so just that shows you how deep this problem
of marketing goes see they're playing that war they're playing
that war of trying to get their ideology pushed through
we're really what we need is we need the exact
opposite of that we need government helping to sponsor open
mindedness and consciousness and mindfulness and meditation and self-actualization these
sorts of things could completely transform the face of society
if they were funded just a little bit you know
it doesn't need a hundred billion dollars just up even
like a hundred million dollars would make a huge huge
change in people's lives way way more consequential than any
kind of military defense spending or any other any other
kind of stuff that government waste this money on another
take away is to stop doing low consciousness marketing if
you're doing it if you are involved with marketing and
you care to be a high consciousness human being those
two things they don't go together you need to wake
up and you need to find a way out of
that find a way to elevate yourself and find a
way to elevate other people you as a marketer are
responsible for the kinds of ideas that you are putting
into people's minds you are responsible for the kind of
impact that you're making in the culture so if you
are making a kind of impact in the culture which
is turning people into a frenzy to buy a bunch
of your [ __ ] that nobody really needs or
that's unhealthy or that's dragging people down you are not
only damaging those individuals with your food or with whatever
you're selling them you're actually damaging the entire culture and
not just those people but their children and their children's
children and their children's children's children because they will get
infected with all those mind viruses that you are spewing
through your marketing and by the way you're not going
to be a happy human being working for a corporation
that does low consciousness marketing you're not no matter how
rich you get you're not going to be happy in
case you haven't noticed yet another takeaway here is that
if you have wealth and if you have power or
if you're going to have wealth and power in the
future maybe you apply some of these concepts that I'm
sharing with you and in 10 to 20 years you
become a millionaire or a billionaire you start some new
company that transforms the world some new face book some
new Google some new Apple and you have power now
it's your responsibility because you have wealth and power to
use that to help to reform our marketing system rather
than corrupting it so I hope you keep this in
mind so in 1020 years if you want to repay
me for this information you don't need to send me
a check just make a commitment that you're going to
reform the marketing system if you have power that's huge
you're gonna have a huge influence and in many ways
I'm critical of people like Warren Buffett or Bill Gates
who have billions and billions of dollars and what do
they do they go to Africa someplace and they do
research for improving poverty there and improving diseases and I
mean that's that's great you know that's very basic stuff
and it needs to be done but also if you
have hundreds of billions of dollars you've got nothing to
do with them you don't know what to do reform
a marketing system buy up these marketing channels and then
use them to to feed information to people and especially
here in America first of all countries feed people high
consciousness information the more people we can get to know
about these high consciousness things like meditation enlightenment self inquiry
self actualization all this sorts of stuff then the more
those people will take charge of their lives and then
the more good they can do and then actually the
quicker we can help other nations like in Africa and
everywhere else to get their [ __ ] together you
know it's hard to help other people get their [
__ ] together when we don't have our [ __
] together and we certainly don't in this country and
the last takeaway is that remember that conscious marketing is
a challenge it's a real challenge and you as an
entrepreneur or a business person or someone who's working on
their life purpose or whatever are gonna be tempted to
give up on that challenge cuz it's gonna be like
well I like a sort of business doing high consciousness
stuff but it's real difficult to market not a lot
of money and/or I can target I can I can
manufacture and sell poison to people and that will sell
real great people love it I'll just make it bacon
flavored poison and they'll love that [ __ ] and
I'll become filthy rich see so you're gonna be tempted
which way are you gonna go remember that this is
a very counterintuitive move it might seem like by going
this direction towards the high consciousness marketing it's like well
but I'm sacrificing so much no you're not actually you
sacrifice the most when you become a poison seller selling
poison for a living is a terrible way to live
it's not fulfilling or rewarding you want the most rewarding
life possible you know what that is is figure out
a way to elevate the most human beings in the
greatest possible degree putting their interest first and then also
support yourself in that you don't want to go broke
doing that but you know support yourself doing that to
a reasonable degree say of a reasonable standard of living
and you will be the most happy human being on
earth if you do that on the other hand if
you go sell poison and you earn billions of dollars
I guarantee you you're still gonna be miserable you're gonna
you're gonna get so much less from life then if
you would have chosen the high consciousness route and in
fact you are gonna put a glass ceiling on your
own growth because there's only so high you can grow
while working a low consciousness job it's just not gonna
work you're gonna be pursuing enlightenment on the one hand
but then working selling poison to other people and that's
gonna be a massive cognitive disconnect for you so what's
gonna realistically happen is that if you're gonna be dead
set on keeping your job and let's say you have
to because you're you're not very financially independent so you're
gonna have to have to keep your poison selling job
you're gonna abandon this enlightenment thing after a while you're
gonna you're gonna grow unconscious until you hit that glass
ceiling after which point it's like damn if I actually
become enlightened I'm gonna have to leave this job that's
gonna be sort of like your decision point but because
you can't leave this job you're gonna say oh well
okay then I guess I can't get enlightened I can't
become more conscious because your minds gonna sort of backwards
rationalize it to justify why you have to keep this
poison selling job because you know to quit a poison
selling job that pays very well and then to go
off and do something high consciousness that maybe doesn't pay
as well that's a very scary transition to make for
many people but that is the process of becoming more
conscious to become more conscious you have to let go
of all your unconscious behaviors and security blankets whatever those
are whether that's your religion whether that's your science where
that's your atheism your rationalism or your your nasty corporate
job or your toxic relationship or whatever else that's where
the rubber meets the road of this work it's all
theory and fun and games and it's all interesting philosophy
until you're you're facing a real world situation was like
[ __ ] I got to quit my job now
because of this I know too much and that's sort
of what happened with me when I started my first
business I started my first business and it was a
pretty low consciousness marketing business so by no means am
i above this but I distinctly remember when I was
sitting there reading a book some sort of self-help book
and my business was booming it was doing great I
was earning six figures like never before and I was
happy and then I read this book and I realize
it hits me for the first time it hits me
like [ __ ] I have to quit my entire
business my entire business is wrong I will never be
happy running this business even though it's making a bunch
of money I have to quit it because I can
clearly see that where I need to go this business
will drag me down it'll be an anchor I can't
actually go to how high I want to go while
this thing is weighing me down and that was really
scary but man am I glad that I that I
followed through on the wrong on the right choice in
that situation and that's what I encourage you to do
alright that's it I'm done here please click that like
button for me don't yet and come check out actualize
that ergh that's my website I've got cool resources there
for you especially check out my blog I'm posting a
lot of content there also I'm gonna be posting exclusive
videos to the blog so check those out some deep
videos I check out the forum check out the life
purpose course check out the book list speaking of gems
that you can discover and just stick around for more
episodes coming soon a lot of deep stuff coming soon
just so you understand kind of where I'm coming from
with this the way that I see my position with
actualize that org is I'm not a speaker I'm not
a life coach I'm not just some YouTube guy I'm
really a researcher that's mostly what I do is I
do research into weird stuff metaphysical stuff epistemic stuff personal
development stuff spiritual stuff non-dual stuff psychedelic stuff whatever kind
of stuff I'm willing to research whatever in order to
find the best techniques the best ideas and then I
want to synthesize those and bring them to you so
I literally research hundreds of sources a very broad range
of stuff stuff that you would think of first like
has nothing to do with personal development but actually what
you discover is that all of it comes together because
personal development is not a narrow field personal development is
life as a whole it's how do you live life
how do you become a great human being how do
you get the most happiness and to really understand that
you need a holistic approach which is what actualized org
is about and you need to research a lot of
very diverse stuff and the more I research the more
I discover how little I know and the more amazing
techniques I find amazing books amazing resources that I all
share with you in the future stuff that very few
people discover because most people they're not really interested in
research they're interested in just sort of like they've got
their idea they've got there one technique that they want
to share with you they're got they've got their system
and they're really attached to their system and they're trying
to teach you their system and they're not spending nearly
enough time doing research because you know what research takes
a lot of time and it doesn't always pay off
immediate results but then sometimes you hit the mother lode
and that's what really makes me excited I discover things
every single week as I'm doing research that I'm just
like super excited to want to share with you I
discover so much stuff I don't have enough time and
energy in the day to share all of it I
have so many products I want to create as so
many resource lists and so many blog posts that I
want to make and and forum posts like there's so
much stuff that I could share and talk about but
I'm only one man and there's only so much I
can do so quickly so it takes time for all
this stuff to unfold really the stuff that you're seeing
unfold now you might think all léo your contents getting
deeper and more profound well really this is the kind
of content that I was imagining myself making four years
ago but it's just taking us time to build up
to it it's also taken me time to build up
my skills to this level where I can talk about
it and so the stuff you're seeing now is like
four years behind and the stuff that I know now
I'm so excited about cuz I wish I'd just go
share it with you immediately but you know sometimes it
takes time to build up to it and that might
take a few years for us to get to so
make sure you stay tuned for all that really juicy
stuff coming in the future you
