hey this is Leo for actualised org and we are
continuing on with the blueprint series which is over 100
of the greatest personal development concepts of all time distilled
from over 100 thousand dollars worth of the best seminars
books and personable material out there so the concept that
we're covering in this video right now is going to
be eliminate addictions so what is it why is it
important and then let's get into the meat of it
and get down to business so what are addictions what
is it to eliminate addictions pretty straightforward on this one
I think you can tell yourself basically the prescription here
is that you want to identify any addictive behaviors in
your life stuff that is holding you back from living
a positive kind of life and feeling good and taking
those monkeys and getting them off your back that's what
you should be doing with this concept and why is
this important it's important because having monkeys on your back
are going to be weighing you down if you have
them they're going to be weighing you down from living
the kind of awesome life that you want to live
and they're also going to be the source of a
lot of negative emotions and constant frustration and they're just
going to waste a lot of your time and energy
so that that's going to take away from all the
positive things that you want to create in your life
it's really hard to be fulfilled and happy when you
have a slew of addictions that you're always engaging in
so that's why that's what it is that's why it's
important now let's get into the bread and butter of
it first of all I want to kind of give
you a list of addictions that I think are the
most common and the most pernicious that you want to
make sure that you are eliminating so if any of
these are part of your life you want to take
stock you want to get honest about it and then
you want to take some steps and figure out a
way how to get yourself out of this situation because
they're going to be a constant never-ending source of negative
emotions and just like a drain of a drain of
all your potential energy that it's going into so what
are some of these addictions I'm just going to rattle
off a big list and I'm gonna have that list
down in the article and this is not by any
means comprehensive but these are the most common so first
television huge huge huge one I think this applies to
so many people it's probably the biggest one on the
list then we've got other things like gossip tabloids partying
compulsive shopping internet browsing websites like Facebook Twitter news negative
thinking food porn gambling alcohol and drugs so this is
my list of the most common addictions you can definitely
come up with more esoteric ones this is not a
comprehensive list like I said but you want to make
sure that these these are the most common ones that
people really use as emotional crutches so let's talk a
little bit about what an addiction is and what the
structure of an addiction is like I said it's an
emotional crutch right so what an addiction is doing is
it's providing you with a dirty cheap source of short-term
pleasure or immediate gratification against a deeper problem that you
have in your life that you don't want to face
so example of this maybe you have a sour marriage
or relationship and therefore instead of dealing with that head-on
and dealing with what might be a potentially challenging situation
to to fix that what you do is you mask
the problem because you're getting so much emotional pain from
that you mask it with an addiction like food or
alcohol or drugs or going out and partying or watching
TV because that takes your mind off the real problem
and it gets you some nice pleasure you know you
go out and you have a nice meal or you
go out and you drink some alcohol or you go
out and you go and you party whatever it is
and you do that after after a certain point you
do that often enough and it becomes an addiction because
it's like a short term hit of pleasure and it
gives you a certain dirty high you know you get
a dirty high off of drugs we also get a
dirty high off of softer addictions like television or the
internet or food or even something very soft we should
consider something like negative thinking although that's one is actually
really holding you back from living that charge kind of
life so important to see what's really happening there so
if you have a bad marriage if you have a
bad job that you hate if you have some bad
family situation maybe you're dealing with some medical situation maybe
you're dealing with financial problems whatever that is those are
usually the core root causes and then the addictions are
like the band-aids that you're putting over those so what
is the problem with addictions well the problem is that
their source of never ending negative emotions and they're also
putting you in a low consciousness mode where what you're
doing is you're just getting cheap stimulation from the environment
right that's the case for example with food when you
go out there and you eat and you stuff yourself
and you're getting so much cheap stimulation that it's very
easy to overindulge and that's the same thing with alcohol
same thing with drugs same thing with Internet same thing
with television right it's just so convenient it's so comfortable
it makes you feel so good in a short term
but then what tends to happen is that you just
kind of like get in a rut with any one
of these things and that's one of the other common
underlying elements between all these addictions is that you can
over indulge in them and they can really soak up
a lot of your energy and a lot of your
time you know all the sudden you go down and
sit on on the couch because you want to take
your mind off the heavy work day that you had
and the crappy job that you maybe you have and
so you watch the television and then that one hour
of television then it's like oh well wow why not
do an extra hour because I don't want to go
back to my job to thinking about my job so
I'll do another hour and all of a sudden that
spills over into two hours and then three hours then
four hours and all sudden you realize that you wasted
your whole Saturday and Sunday watching a marathon session of
whatever your favorite show is and what initially was a
good source of perhaps entertainment or relief turned into this
just like nauseating overindulging marathon and now you wasted so
much time and so much energy and you have to
go back and face that problem anyways right after the
weekend you still have to go back to work and
yourself to face it and so what is it happening
is that you end up wasting a lot of your
life really it's wasting a lot of your life and
a lot of your energy and you're doing this on
a continual basis on a weekly basis monthly basis and
it goes on for months and years and you can
really waste your whole life doing this not to mention
that you always feel bad about it right because your
higher self is still there you can't get rid of
your higher self and your higher self is always telling
you that you should be doing more that you could
be doing more and that maybe you should be facing
the real problem and maybe you shouldn't be over indulging
so much and maybe you should be using your time
more wisely more constructively learning something doing something positive for
yourself right basically doing personal growth so your higher self
knows this and what ends up happening is you start
to develop a lot of guilt around your addiction because
you become out of it you get out of alignment
out of integrity with yourself because your higher self knows
that you shouldn't be overeating and you shouldn't be doing
so much alcohol and you shouldn't be watching so much
television but your lower self just kind of runs away
with it right and that's the problem is that when
you get really addicted to something is that your lower
self just tends to dominate and dominate and dominate until
it totally subdues the higher self even those higher self
can never be totally subdued so you still have those
pangs of guilt but the lower self just become so
dominant that you're not able to accomplish anything in your
life you basically give up all your personal power and
now you're at the effect of whatever your addiction was
and now you're controlled by that thing and you can't
think clearly you can't be in a high consciousness state
in fact you're the opposite you're in a very low
consciousness state because all these addictions they basically reduce your
consciousness right when you're getting that hit of food or
you're getting that hit of TV or that drug the
reason that it kind of feels good is because you
can just sit back and totally relax so let go
of everything and all of a sudden you don't need
to be conscious you don't really need to think you
just get pleasure and you just become like a pleasure
animal just like a pleasure addict but that's not where
greatness is in life that's not the higher pleasures in
life right the higher pleasures in life are things like
pride creative contribution sense of excitement adventure and growth and
pushing yourself and being on your edge and none of
that is really what addictions are about addictions are all
about being very comfortable being in your comfort zone being
so comfortable that you don't want to do anything with
your life that can obviously become a real problem if
you want to go out there and you want to
live a big life like we advocate at actualised org
so really addictions are in a nutshell avoidance of doing
the real work you know I want you to really
sit down and if you're addicted to one of these
things think about what are you really avoiding you know
if you're eating a lot of food what are you
really avoiding with that food is it a bad marriage
is it some bad family situation is it the lack
of finances that you have and you're struggling to pay
the bills is it the job that you really don't
like maybe something else right maybe it's some past emotional
trauma you're masking with this food or your your lack
of willingness to take control and get yourself into shape
you know whatever that might be so think about what
that food is really masking and the same thing with
television what does that masking for you it's a masking
a certain sense of boredom a lack of purpose in
life you know whatever these problems are these are the
real problems and I guess the way you flip this
on its head is that you say that these problems
are actually interesting problems to solve this is what personal
development is is really great at is helping you address
these problems right so if you don't have a really
good job well we've got videos on the site that
will show you how to get a good job and
how to create that kind of life purpose that you're
really passionate about your job so that you don't need
any of these drugs or other addictive things to make
you feel good about your job situation and the same
thing with relationships you know you got to figure out
how to get your relationships in order or whatever else
it is you gotta come to face to face with
the real problem and do the real work that you
got to do you can't keep avoiding it forever or
if you do the cost is going to be super
super high for you so just recognize what the real
costs are you're sacrificing living a big exciting passionate life
where you're really fulfilled you're sacrificing all that and a
lot of success and personal power just so that you
can get a little bit hit of food a little
bit hit of drugs get that dirty high going with
one of your addictions all right so I think you
can clearly see why that's not a good trade-off in
the long run right you want to think long term
rather than short term all right let me cover this
distinction that I have between hard addictions and soft addictions
and where you should look out for for which so
from this list that I talked about really we can
kind of break it down loosely into soft addictions and
hard ones and a lot of times people will say
well I don't really have any addictions and what they
really mean is they don't have any hard addictions so
maybe you're not addicted to drugs maybe you're not addicted
to alcohol maybe you're not a gambling addict maybe you're
not addicted to porn or sex so maybe one of
these is not an addiction of yours and in that
case you might say that you don't have any addictions
but then I would say that there's also these this
list of soft addictions that the soft addictions are in
some ways more pernicious because with the hard addictions at
least it's obvious that you have in addictions it's kind
of hard to deny when you're hooked on a drug
or you're hooked on alcohol or you're losing your life
savings gambling those tend to be hard to avoid for
a very long time although people can become pretty good
at doing even that but then the soft ones tend
to be there and then also society tends to reinforce
and say that that's okay you know no one says
that being a drug addict is okay but things like
television things like being a habitual gossip or thinking negatively
all the time or being very judgmental of people or
getting hooked on on the internet checking your email all
the time checking your email every five minutes or how
about checking your Facebook or your Twitter you know this
these types of things it's a little bit harder because
it's harder to draw that that clear line and say
that this is bad because clearly a lot of these
things you have to be doing anyways you know using
the Internet is a good thing the question is are
you using it too much are you using it to
avoid doing your real work Facebook and Twitter can be
legitimate tools but again are you using them to avoid
something and are they really hindering you more than they're
helping you same thing with television same thing with food
you're always going to need to eat food the question
is how much of it are you eating what quality
of food are you eating and are you using it
as an emotional crutch so the soft addictions I really
want you to look out for and I think that
for most of you probably the soft addiction categories actually
gonna be more important because well if you're really into
personal development the chances are that you're already really cognizant
about eliminating the hard addictions because the hard addictions are
just so nasty and give you so much pain and
so much emotional turmoil in your life that you really
can't have any sort of fulfillment or success in your
life if you have a hard addiction the soft addiction
is what they tend to do is they kind of
keep you in the zone of mediocrity where you're out
there maybe you're you know you're pursuing a good job
and maybe you're working on your relationships and you're doing
this kind of stuff but you're not getting the results
that you know you could be right you're not really
living to your full potential and that is because you
have these soft addictions and maybe you don't even realize
that you've got them maybe you're just watching a little
too much TV maybe you're watching a little bit too
much news maybe you're thinking too critically and too negatively
to judgmentally about things too often and that you're addicted
to that so you got to take take stock of
that recognize it and then create a plan for how
you're going to get yourself hooked off of it so
with the hard addictions there's actually again the nice thing
about hard addictions is that there's pretty good awareness around
it there's a lot of programs that you can go
out there there's books seminars audio programs video programs 12-step
programs that you can join that will help you to
get rid of the hard addictions as far as the
soft addictions that's a little bit harder I'm sure you
can find or groups for that as well and you
can find books and materials on it but it's a
little bit tougher and it's a little bit harder to
convince yourself that it's even worth a while to get
involved with something so serious for soft addiction with soft
addictions that tends to really be the domain of personal
development right and there you're going to have to probably
take that on under your own hands and try to
get yourself to work around it so with soft addictions
I find that it's really good as a strategy not
to aim at eliminating the addiction per se but instead
replacing it right so if you're trying to do something
like eliminate television as an addiction then the best way
is not to just eliminate television and then have that
spare time and do nothing with it because when you've
got nothing to do you're going to tend to use
that time to do what your body and your mind
have been conditioned to do and have been have just
had a habit of doing so you're going to get
back into it so the best thing to do when
you're trying to fix one of these addictions especially the
softer ones is to replace it replace it with something
positive right so if you're not going to be watching
TV anymore what are you gonna be doing are you
gonna be going on hikes are you going to be
reading books are you going to be spending more time
with your spouse or even go to the movie so
you can be hanging out with your friends some combination
of those or one of those is going to be
a really good way to channel your attention your energy
because a lot of it is about focus right as
soon as you find something better something more worthwhile for
you to do then you're naturally just because there's only
so much time in the day and most of us
are filling our schedules so much you're naturally going to
start to get rid of the activities that provide at
least value for you so if all the sudden let's
say you start a business and you used to be
a habitual TV watcher now you've got a business going
you've got obligations to your clients and you're excited about
your business and you're developing it all the sudden you
need all the time in the world to focus on
your business you don't have time to watch TV anymore
so that addiction can almost fix itself and a lot
of times that can be the best strategy for fixing
those because otherwise it's kind of hard to get leverage
on yourself to just stop watching TV but once you've
got something really positive in your life something that you
got to put your energy towards then it becomes much
easier so having that vision and again you know why
are we eliminating these addictions in the first place because
you have that vision of that kind of awesome life
that you want to create and you know that you
can't create that kind of life if you've got monkeys
on your back so that's part of the larger reason
of why you're undertaking this whole initiative all right so
pretty simple that's my whole spiel on addictions really take
stock be honest with yourself recognize why it is that
you have these addictions it's because you're trying to avoid
some more fundamental problem in your life so analyze it
and then commit to fixing it because the cost of
not doing so is really living a big life all
right so I'm going to wrap it up there go
ahead if you like this like it share it leave
your comments I always love to hear what your challenges
are and how this material is helping you alright signing
off you
