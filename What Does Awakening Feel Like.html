[Music] on this channel we spent a lot of time
talking about awakening using the word awakening and in fact
in pop culture the word woke now is uh is
becoming trendy of course it doesn't mean what i mean
when i say awakening but what do i mean when
i say awakening so i thought i would do an
episode just exclusively purely describing the subjective phenomenology of awakening
what does it feel like to awaken never mind what
it means metaphysically what it means for your life what
the consequences are forget all that just what does it
actually feel like and i remember when i first started
learning about enlightenment and awakening i was also very curious
about this and i didn't get very good descriptions that
i found satisfying from other teachers and gurus a lot
of them are kind of quiet about it or um
they tell their personal story of awakening but it doesn't
really do a good job of describing it phenomenologically so
i'm going to attempt that here today now this is
tricky to do by its very nature because it's an
ineffable experience and really it goes beyond even the notion
of an experience at all and also because there are
many different types and depths of awakening that's one of
the things you will realize if you do a lot
of this work is that there's so much depth and
also different types and facets to awakening in fact i
released an episode in the past called the many facets
of awakening which talk about the dozens of different facets
that exist to awakening i've had hundreds of awakenings and
many of them oddly enough have had different flavors and
hit upon different facets now that doesn't mean that these
awakenings all contradict each other actually the opposite is the
case they beautifully synergize together shedding light on more and
more of absolute truth but from different angles sometimes you
get a glimpse of one facet then another facet then
two or three facets together and then your mind is
stitching these facets together and then in the future as
you have your awakenings more of the fastest get illuminated
simultaneously for your for your pleasure or horror depending on
how you look at it some of these facets can
be quite challenging to integrate but once you integrate them
then that opens up the possibility of stitching them and
connecting them with other facets that you've yet to discover
and then eventually you can see the entire thing with
all of its facets and that's when it gets really
profound and then there's different degrees of depth to each
facet and so forth but anyways it gets complicated so
what i'll be describing here is how i personally experience
awakenings there's a lot of variability amongst how people experience
awakening and how various kinds of mystical spiritual experiences there
is an enormous amount of variability and people use words
like awakening and enlightenment and mysticism in in different ways
for different states of consciousness so be careful about that
too sometimes when people are talking about a spiritual experience
or state and they use the same word they may
not be talking about the same thing so keep that
in mind too so just because what i'll be describing
here is how it feels for me doesn't mean that
it will necessarily feel that way for you so be
careful with letting this sort of shape and color your
own experience of awakening you might have an awakening that's
different from mine then you might wonder like well but
this doesn't match up with what leo said and that
just might be because you're different you have a different
neurology different genetics different way of interpreting the world and
so forth or maybe what you had was not really
a proper awakening and it can be tricky to distinguish
between those things also you have to be careful to
distinguish between the awakening itself versus the ego's reactions to
it and a lot of times these can get conflated
so the awakening will happen that's one thing and then
your ego mind can still be intact and it can
still be struggling thinking fantasizing projecting reacting it can be
in shock it can be happy it can be crying
it can be dramatic it can be psychotic whatever is
going on and those reactions are not the same thing
as the awakening itself you see it gets a little
tricky there too um how do you distinguish those two
things and then also you have to distinguish between awakenings
and other mystical phenomena that can occur you could have
mystical visions you might see ghosts and aliens and dmt
entities and angels and jesus and buddha and that might
be all well and good but is that really awakening
maybe it is but maybe it isn't see it's a
little tricky so what i'm going to try to explain
here is what i would call sort of a a
pure and i wore that i use that word sort
of loosely a pure awakening without a bunch of mystical
visionary stuff which could or could not accompany an awakening
so just because there's mystical visionary stuff doesn't mean that
it's automatically not an awakening but also just because it
that's there you know jesus shows up to you or
something or you see an angel that also doesn't mean
it is an awakening so what exactly is an awakening
well let's clear this up i actually sort of kind
of want to guide you through it a little bit
from like a first person experience so you can sort
of imagine it for yourself but also with the warning
that anything you imagine awakening is it's not so everything
that i share with you here it's it's all just
going to be stories and fantasies it's not going to
actually be awakening the the real awakening if you ever
experience it will be something radically beyond whatever you imagine
it to be but anyways let's give it a shot
so um also the reason that i wanted to show
this episode is because maybe this will clear up some
misconceptions because a lot of times when spiritual teachers don't
fill in the blanks and they kind of just leave
things vague and ambiguous that sort of zed approach you
know that very tacit zen style of spiritual teaching the
problem with that is that the active mind fills in
the gaps with a bunch of fantasies and [ __
] so personally i think that it's very dangerous to
give spiritual students ambiguous vague notions of what awakening is
because their mind is not just going to sit around
idly and accept this emptiness that the teacher has left
in the student's mind the mind is going to fill
it in with all sorts of projections assumptions fantasies and
expectations which are probably going to be very deeply wrong
more wrong than if the teacher actually colored in some
of the details so here's me coloring in some of
the details all right so imagine this you're just sitting
there like you are right now you're just sitting there
you're looking around the room it's an ordinary room colors
sounds feelings in your body nothing changes in your visual
field colors and objects remain the same as they always
were so one of the misconceptions that people have about
awakening is that they they ask sort of like well
what is the visual content because we're very visual creatures
what is the visual content of an awakening like what
do you see or what do you not see in
the sense that like do i stop seeing altogether does
my vision disappear do objects disappear is there just literally
an empty void of nothing and what i'm telling you
is no nothing visually changes strictly speaking in a pure
awakening the only thing that changes imagine like this imagine
there is a dial like a master volume knob on
a sound controller this is the consciousness dial this dial
regulates how conscious you are right now for you for
an ordinary person that dial is set to like a
a three let's say if you're sleepy that dial is
like at a one if you're dreaming in deep sleep
that dial is maybe at a at a point two
and if you're totally unconscious that dialogue says zero so
the difficulty of explaining this to an ordinary person who's
never experienced it is that for most people their experience
of what this dial can do only ranges from zero
to three it's never gone any higher than three maybe
it's gone to a four like if you've meditated for
a bit you can sit there you can kind of
focus and you can be a little more conscious and
maybe it cranks from a three to a four if
you're very very clear minded and sober so really in
a sense this dial controls your sobriety ordinarily we think
that like this normal state that we're in this is
just this is sobriety right well that's a sobriety level
three but you can crank this master knob of consciousness
and it starts to increase your sobriety to a four
to a five to a six it goes up to
eleven and then it goes up to a hundred and
then it keeps spinning to a thousand and then it
keeps spinning to a hundred thousand and you realize that
this knob spins forever there's no limit to how sober
and conscious you can become it just so happens you
lived most of your life out of three and so
have all your friends and all the people you know
and so there's a point at which the knob gets
cranked let's say to a thousand or beyond there's a
there's almost a very distinct threshold that is crossed where
you look at the room nothing has changed the colors
are all the same the objects are all the same
you look at your hands your body you look around
the room and you realize oh my god i'm awake
this is what it means to be awake it's just
that that knob has gotten cranked up so much you
become so awake you become so woke that it's terrifying
it's frightening how awake you are you become so awake
that you're beyond human levels of weakness you're so conscious
you're impossibly conscious your mind cannot fathom how conscious you've
become you've become so conscious it's surreal it is beyond
what you would think is physically possible or scientifically possible
and your initial reaction is going to be something like
what the [ __ ] is this this is impossible
what is happening to me it feels like something some
alien force has taken over your mind and your body
it feels unreal but at the same time it's the
most real thing there is because this knob this is
the knob you might also call it not just consciousness
but reality itself the more this knob is cranked up
the more real things get the more you see things
for what they are so like right now when you're
at a three and you're sitting here and you're looking
at it at a coffee table to you it looks
like a coffee table and that's just what it is
when the knob gets cranked up to a thousand or
to a hundred thousand that coffee table even though its
colors and its shape doesn't change at all what you
understand it to be completely changes you no longer see
it as just a coffee table as a physical object
in a physical room part of a physical universe made
out of atoms and whatever else you believe about it
that object almost becomes like an alien object and it's
as though you're looking at that object for the first
time and when you look at that object you you
truly see it for what it really is for the
first time and it feels like the reason it's called
awakening is it feels like you've awoken from the dream
called life you become so conscious it's as though you're
able to pierce through the fabric of physical material reality
just with your mind and you're able to comprehend its
structure in its totality what it is now this is
not a mental activity you're doing in the sense that
you're sitting there thinking a bunch of thoughts the way
that a scientist might if a scientist was thinking about
some complex problem it's it's not a function of complexity
it's a it's a function of well consciousness you become
directly conscious of what things are unmediated by any kind
of thinking process you just intuitively grasp objects in a
highly multi-dimensional way and you instantly understand what they are
what they really absolutely are this is more than just
experience this is a heightening a sharpening of what experience
is because your experience usually is at a level three
consciousness and here it goes up to a thousand or
a hundred thousand so this awakening is a pure lucidity
that's a good word for it lucidity we're just cranking
up how lucid you are it's an impossible level of
consciousness it's a it's a level of consciousness that can't
be imagined when you're at a level three because that
level three is what limits your imagination i could also
describe it that it feels as though the air got
sucked out of the room everything becomes just crystal clear
and perfectly lucid it's like you're sitting in a vacuum
looking at the room the room becomes crystalline luminous hollow
empty a pure luminous void now the word void here
is a little bit misleading because when i say the
word void you might tend to think like the room
disappears the colors disappear but they don't all the colors
are there they're sharper than ever they're brighter than ever
you recognize the self-luminous nature of consciousness and all objects
what you consider matter gets recontextualized as your own consciousness
and its luminosity becomes uh just blatantly apparent undeniable this
absolute luminosity you realize that consciousness is self-knowing and self-illuminating
physical objects that you look at start to feel and
take on the flavor of a hologram or a mirage
an illusion now don't get me wrong when i say
a hologram or a mirage i don't mean that the
objects become transparent like hologram in star wars they maintain
all the same solidity and color and opacity that they
had before your hand will not go through a coffee
table it will hit the coffee table just like it
did before so in that sense it's not a hologram
but what i mean is that you realize that the
physicality that you attribute to that coffee table is actually
always was just a projection of your mind and that
really that coffee table is not a solid object the
way that you usually thought of it it is like
a mirage it is a mirage held within consciousness it's
a solid feeling mirage but what you also realize is
that solidity itself is also just another feature or mirage
within consciousness so even though your hand cannot go through
a coffee table in this state that that that doesn't
undermine the fact that it's a mirage everything feels more
vivid and there's a hyper presence like you're ridiculously present
you're so present it's scary you never knew this level
of presence was possible and then what you notice this
pure luminosity that i was talking about really what it
does it gives way to divinity what you realize is
divinity or spirit the reason they call it spirituality what
is spirit spirit is what at a level three we
ordinarily call matter or physical stuff physical objects so everything
that you're seeing right now in this video if you're
watching this this is all spirit the entire room that
you're in look around you look at your body look
at your hands all of this is spirit in fact
there's nothing but spirit so what happens is that physicality
and matter gets recontextualized as spirit or divinity why is
it divinity why is it spirit this will puzzle many
people who have not experienced this and i don't know
if i can help to really explain it because spirit
and divinity are the best terms for it literally it
is spirit it is divinity so as it turns out
what divinity is divinity is not some metaphor and it's
not some stuff that some religious people made up because
they were fundamentalists and dogmatic ideologues divinity is what happens
when when the knob of consciousness gets cranked up to
a thousand or a hundred thousand the more it gets
cranked up the more you recognize that everything that's happening
here is divine what does that really mean i'm struggling
for words to to explain it um well what you
realize is that experience the raw qualia of experience is
absolute truth it actually never was an experience it just
simply always was absolute truth and when you realize the
absoluteness of raw experience it gets it gets recontextualized as
something that used to be temporal from something that used
to be temporal into something that is now eternal literally
what you become conscious of is that this qualia the
phenomenal experience that you're having right now this present moment
of this room of that coffee table of your hands
or whatever else you're looking at is happening in eternity
it's not happening through time it's eternal it exists eternally
in the mind of god and so what happens is
that all of these colors and sounds and feelings that
you usually experience and attribute to biological processes in a
human creature organism all of that gets wiped away and
you realize that actually all of this is the light
of god it's god shining through itself to itself it's
the mind of god self-illuminated and color and sound and
all sensation the entire phenomenal manifold of your five senses
gets recontextualized and you realize it for what it really
is which is pure magic it's a causal there's no
scientific cause behind it there's no cause and effect there's
no chain of causation that led up to it there's
no physical laws there's no evolution there's no history there's
no mathematics there's no computer simulation it's pure a mechanical
magic it's pure manifestation mind manifesting itself instantaneously the mind
of god and then if you're if your knob gets
cranked up a little bit deeper i mean a little
bit higher and and your and your awareness goes from
looking out at the room more inwards towards towards the
the center of who you are the observer of this
room what you realize then is you have the i
am god awakening you realize that you are god so
first you realize that the room is god and then
when you turn that in towards yourself then you kind
of ask yourself what am i in relation to the
room you realize oh yes the room is god but
the room is me and i am therefore god and
and there's a very distinct couple of insights that you
get here one is first of all you realize for
the first time in your life that god is real
you realize what god is instantly like within less than
a millisecond you have a complete well i would say
complete but you have uh you finally have a recognition
that god exists not as a belief or a speculation
or a philosophical postulate but god right here right now
right before you you're face to face with god you
have an instant comprehension and intuition that god is real
and now you finally understand what the word god refers
to so for your entire life people have been using
the word god and you sort of understood what it
means intellectually but you had no idea until this precise
moment and some switch was flipped and right as that
switch was flipped now finally you understand what the word
god was pointing to that's a huge epiphany that's a
life changer right there so that's your first time ever
discovering that god is real but just because that switch
was flipped doesn't mean that you yet understand that you
are god that goes a little bit deeper that requires
a little bit more consciousness and actually a little bit
more um facing of yourself because there's a wall of
denial between god and you that prevents you from accepting
yourself as god so a lot of people can have
a mystical experience of god as other something out there
beyond but they'll never connect the dot between themselves and
what that other is which means that they're not fully
awake but if we crank the consciousness up some more
and we also lower your defenses and denials that wall
of denial then you realize and you turn inwards you
you take that awakened consciousness and you turn inwards you
realize oh of course i'm god not just a part
of god see again people are so in denial about
the fact that they are god that they might even
then say oh yeah i'm a part of god sure
maybe no that's not what i'm saying what i'm saying
is that you are the entire god the god not
a subset of god not a part of god not
a toenail of god the entire [ __ ] god
and it's only when you fully embrace that do you
really understand and when what god is what you are
and only then when i say you're you're truly awake
until you reach this point you're not fully awake and
at this point it feels very much like the universe
has awoken to itself for the first time in your
experience you as the universe realize you are the entire
universe and you always have been and that you were
just dreaming that you were human and when that happens
your reaction is probably something along the lines of if
you're like me oh now i understand now i really
understand what's going on see you had no clue what
the universe was up to what the universe was what
life was you had no clue what these things were
until this moment only now do you understand does it
all make sense all the pieces of life and existence
finally fit together and now you finally understand everything that's
been going on you finally see the game that was
being played here the cosmic game that god was playing
with itself dreaming itself into a human existence another thing
that will accompany this is a universal sense of self
self with a capital s now you tell yourself something
along the lines of i am the universe you've become
universal you've went from a human in the universe to
the universe dreaming itself as a human you become cosmic
i am cosmic i am the whole cosmos and you
feel like the whole cosmos your body especially gets recontextualized
as cosmic stuff not not a physical object but really
cosmic metaphysical your body goes from being physical to metaphysical
it's beyond physical and yet the colors don't change the
shape of your body doesn't change you just realize that
your body always was metaphysical and that physicality was just
some [ __ ] you were imagining to fool yourself
into thinking you're human also this may or may not
happen to you but ideally it would your sense of
scale should disappear so the idea that you're a small
human inside of some larger universe this should disappear you
should take on the scale of the entire universe or
what you should realize that scale is relative there's no
such thing as scale that means that when you look
at your hands you should realize that the scale of
your hands is exactly the same size as the entire
milky way galaxy there's no difference between the milky way
galaxy scale the scale of your hands and the scale
of one of your hairs on one of your fingers
like each each hair on my hand is an entire
galaxy onto itself that's how conscious you become and if
you become even more conscious beyond that you can actually
zoom in to every uh hair on your hand and
you can realize that it's infinite that means it goes
on forever you can keep zooming into that hair forever
and in there you will find more and more complexity
and form just like if you were zooming out of
the earth you know you would keep zooming out and
you would see galaxies and star systems and nebula and
supernovas and whatever else and you could keep zooming in
out and out and out well you can keep zooming
in forever too and it's when you realize you can
zoom out forever you can zoom in forever that no
matter how zoomed in or out you are you're always
in the middle of everything that is everything that you
are and therefore you are literally infinite and cosmic and
that there's no scale to anything scale loses all sense
of uh of proportion at this point because it's infinite
in all directions another distinct epiphany and realization that comes
with awakening is this a profound existential sense of i
am-ness i am i am i am i am i
am i exist absolutely i am existence itself i am
for the first time in your life you realize the
significance of i am and when you say i am
you're not saying i am a human you're saying i
am as existence itself you are all of existence this
i am this is absolute it has no opposite and
you realize that you can't not exist another thing that
usually accompanies this is of course you transcend death this
can be framed in two ways one thing one way
you can frame it you could say i've died literally
died and yet i'm still conscious you could frame it
like that or you could frame it as death is
imaginary and death is impossible because i am i've always
been and i'll always be because i'm existence itself so
both are just two sides of the same coin and
you can experience them in both ways you can experience
that as though you're dying that's kind of if you're
if you're coming at it from the ego's perspective then
it feels like the ego is dying or it has
already died so that can be kind of shocking from
the ego's point of view or if you are able
to let go of the ego then you can kind
of just realize that the ego was just some imaginary
construct and it's not even appropriate to call it death
because that's just some it's just literally just like a
thought in your mind you just let that go and
then you realize that you're the cosmic god mind and
then as the cosmic god mind there's uh death is
just another thought it's just it's it's just a figment
of god's imagination there's no such thing as death there
never was just a dream you have this surreal sense
that your entire life was a dream and this is
the most astounding thing ever because it feels like you've
broken reality it feels like you've broken your mind you've
gone so deep into your own mind that you've realized
that the mind wasn't contained inside of a brain but
rather that the brain was just a construct of mind
and when you've realized that you've you've broken through the
physical barriers that you thought were there your whole life
it's as shocking as walking through a wall so imagine
if you just tried to walk through a wall right
now and it worked imagine how astounded you would be
well what i'm describing here is as astounding if not
more astounding than that when it's happening to you it's
so surreal it seems so impossible that it strains your
mind's credulity like sometimes critics will hear me talk about
the stuff and say oh leo well you this is
just stuff you experience because you want to believe it
no no you don't understand how deep this goes this
is so deep these realizations are so deep that you
can't believe it you can't even imagine it you're in
shock that it's happening to you and yet it is
happening to you that's what's so shocking about it and
also of course what accompanies all this is that it's
so [ __ ] obvious you say to yourself of
course this is the most obvious thing ever of course
i'm the entire universe dreaming up my life of course
it's so obvious it's just crystal clear there's no doubt
whatsoever you're absolutely certain of it you're so certain and
it's so obvious that you might start to laugh because
it's it's it's like a joke that anybody could ever
doubt this another aspect of the realization is that it's
so radical and you'll probably be muttering to yourself as
it's happening to you this is so goddamn radical like
it's it's radical beyond any definition of radical there can't
be anything more radical than this in reality another thought
that will probably cross your mind is that this is
not at all what i thought it was going to
be like here i spent years and years reading about
awakening and thinking about awakening and dreaming about awakening and
fantasizing about being awake and now that it's actually happened
to me it's nothing like i imagined not even close
all that stuff that i thought awakening was it's all
[ __ ] none of it was awakening this is
the real awakening all of those were just stories and
delusions and you you realize for the first time in
your life what it truly means to say that the
map is not the territory for the first time in
your life you've realized the territory and it's completely different
than you thought it was it's it's it's so far
in the opposite direction of what you thought it was
that you can't even imagine how you could have been
so wrong imagine being so wrong about the nature of
reality that you couldn't possibly be more wrong that's how
wrong you are and you'll realize that and it'll shock
you how wrong you were and all of your ideas
about the buddha and jesus and all this stuff it'll
shock you how wrong you were in a good way
because it's even more amazing than you imagined it's impossibly
amazing it's just it's literally impossible what's happening to you
is impossible and yet it's happening to you and that's
why you call it divine it's way too good to
be true it's impossible that this is true it can't
be true and yet it's absolutely true another thought that
will probably cross your mind is there was never a
self of course of course there was never a finite
self of course there was never a human self that
was born of course how could i have been so
[ __ ] stupid to ever buy this ridiculous notion
of a human self inside of a human body this
is this is just idiotic i was such an idiot
for believing there was no there was a self of
course there's no self how could there be a self
this is what you'll be telling yourself and then um
after you're done with that you'll look around the room
in your awaken state and you'll realize oh of course
so this is what is meant by nothing this is
nothing now i'm conscious of nothing and again you'll be
shocked that nothing is not what you imagined it to
be nothing is not a lack of color or sound
or taste or sensation or objects nothing is the entire
experience of life as you've always experienced it it's nothing
life has gotten re-contextualized is absolutely nothing this is nothing
and then you'll realize that it's also everything and then
you'll realize that i am nothing and i am everything
and that of course they're the same thing how could
nothing and everything be different what would separate them and
you'll realize that there are no boundaries being anything what
is a boundary of course there's no boundaries and then
you'll realize pure oneness since all the boundaries dissolve between
everything you'll realize of course reality is just pure oneness
and then everything will make sense oneness explains everything and
then maybe you'll realize that since i'm everything i'm also
the coffee table i'm the cup i'm the faucet i'm
the refrigerator i'm the pencil lying on the table i'm
the carpet i'm the chair i'm everything and then you'll
realize maybe if you go a little deeper and you
turn that awareness even more deeply into your own psyche
you'll realize oh my god i'm also everyone not just
everything i am my mother i am my father i
am everybody who i've ever interacted with they are all
my own mind they were all me this entire time
all people are me you might also realize or become
conscious that the past is imaginary you're imagining the past
in the present it might also feel like every moment
in your life has been perfectly engineered to lead up
to this very point of awakening as though the very
function of life and existence itself has been this moment
of awakening and of course that's exactly what life is
life is just a construct to allow god to awaken
to itself so that time that you were a kid
back in elementary school and uh your parents bought you
an ice cream cone and you look that ice cream
cone and then it fell to the ground and then
you started crying you remember that time and you realize
of course that was just a stepping stone to my
awakening right now and everything makes sense at that point
and then if you crank that uh that knob a
little bit further you realize what you really are what
god really is is infinity what is really going on
what is reality really how did it get here infinity
you are infinity pure infinite consciousness at this point you're
overwhelmed with a sense of wholeness and completion you feel
totally complete you feel totally at one with yourself you're
completely satisfied a satisfaction beyond anything a human can imagine
you're totally complete forever you are infinity you're everything you're
everything that could possibly exist you're total you're complete you're
absolute and this generates the deepest sense of peace that
you can possibly imagine just a profound sense of tranquility
hits you and you realize to yourself that this is
the greatest thing ever there can't be anything greater in
the universe than this and then you probably think to
yourself this will change the whole world if only the
whole world knew about this this changes everything you might
also be tempted to go inwards and to kind of
define what you really are like but what am i
you still aren't clear about what you are because the
ego mind is trying to put its finger on what
it is what on what on what god is and
it can't everything the ego points his finger at isn't
it and so there's going to be this sort of
confusion in your mind where it's like yeah i understand
i understand that i'm god i understand that i'm nothing
but what is nothing i want to define i want
to grab it i want to encapsulate it i want
to i want to well how can i latch onto
this nothing and you realize of course that you can't
it's undefinable literally infinity is undefinable ungraspable it can't grasp
itself it's slippery and that slipperiness is it's very essence
and that's why you struggled so so much to grasp
it because you can't grasp it gra even god can't
grasp itself it's a mystery onto itself and then you
fully realize the mystery of what you are the mystery
of infinity the mystery of god this is a profound
existential mystery that leaves you in awe and wonder and
yet you're absolutely conscious of its mystery that it is
a mystery it's an eternal mystery unto itself that's just
the nature of infinity you also realize that it's utter
perfection it's absolutely perfect it's heaven you are in heaven
at this point and you realize infinite beauty it's infinitely
beautiful you are infinitely beautiful you realize for the first
time in your life your own infinite beauty and your
own perfection which melts away all of your self-judgments and
hatreds and criticisms and lack of love for the first
time in your life you appreciate how beautiful you are
and you fully accept yourself and there you go that's
what i would call a pure awakening now be careful
here because what i've described is actually not a single
awakening but a series of many awakenings that i've had
kind of combined together so the chances that when you
go on your next meditation retreat or you do your
next psychedelic or whatever or you do some yoga the
chances that you're going to reach this level of depth
and breadth of awakening that i just described here is
extremely low virtually zero in practice what's going to happen
is that you're going to get glimpses of these different
facets that i've talked about i've stitched together many facets
here for you to present sort of the whole thing
but it's very unlikely that you're going to be able
to grasp that whole thing all at once especially in
your early awakenings it's just too much it's shocking some
of these facets just by themselves are so shocking and
terrifying that it will take you months to integrate just
one of these facets after you have it assuming you
even reach it which could take you years just to
reach it and then you got to integrate it and
then you got to go back for more and find
new facets and integrate those and stitch those together so
the whole thing i mean this this we're talking years
here maybe decades of work to reach that what i've
talked about and also even though i painted a relatively
complete picture here of what i would call a pure
awakening i still haven't communicated the highest levels of a
way this is still not the highest levels of awakening
this is what i would call sort of intermediate levels
um the highest levels are are so shocking it's and
so inevitable they can't really be talked about uh basically
at the highest levels i mean i'll give you a
little clue even though i won't tell you much um
at the highest levels what happens is you just at
the highest levels the colors and sounds and feeling the
the visual field actually starts to break down and collapse
because you're becoming so conscious that even the physical distinctions
between walls your body and the coffee table all of
these physical distinctions start to break down you realize that
they were all imaginary and the entire the entire room
sort of collapses starts to collapse in on itself as
the dream and mirage that it is um and then
it it it turns into just an infinite singularity basically
it um imagine what what what existed sort of before
the big bang if you take all the matter in
the universe and you condense it down into an infinitely
small uh point that's smaller than the the tip of
a needle and yet it's all completely conscious of itself
that's what you become you become this perfectly symmetrical you
become almost spherical or imagine imagine becoming a uh a
geometric point a point in geometry has zero dim it's
a zero dimensional object it has no length or depth
or breadth or size and yet it exists and in
that point is contained absolutely everything could possibly be and
that's what you become and it's perfectly conscious of itself
and that is the that is sort of the pinnacle
of the godhead so that would be the highest awakening
at least that i've personally accessed um and at that
point there is no form there is no colors and
sounds because you're too conscious even for colors and sounds
to exist so there you go now maybe you have
an idea of what you're shooting for now again these
are just my experiences of my awakenings um to be
honest i have no idea what it's like for other
people because i only have my own awakenings to work
with so i'm just speaking from my own experience here
um now some people will say well but leo aren't
these just pleasant experiences that you're having these are just
states that are generated by the brain right no if
you think that you don't understand what i'm communicating these
are it's it's improper to even call these experiences although
they're not different from experiences but what you call an
experience what you think of as an experience is a
deeply corrupted notion that your ego mind is concocted so
to call what i'm talking about here's experiences is is
absurd what i'm talking about is absolute truth and it's
not rendered by any kind of brain it's not beholden
to any scientific process any mechanical process it's not beholden
to atoms to molecules to matter to neurons to computer
simulations to calculations to mathematics none of that it's beholdened
to nothing it's bounded by nothing it's limited by nothing
it's pure infinity it's not happening to a human it's
not happening to a creature it's not a biological event
it's not a physical process it's not evolutionary it didn't
evolve it didn't have a history it wasn't caused by
anything if you think oh leo well this was just
caused by a chemical psychedelic no it wasn't caused by
anything oh leo but this was just caused by some
meditation technique no it wasn't caused by anything it's uncaused
from your current level of consciousness at a level three
that's impossible and you can't understand how that's possible until
you crank that up to a thousand or more and
remember be careful because none of your ideas of awakening
are correct and even everything i shared with you here
you might say ah leo okay so now i understand
what awakening is right wrong you have no idea everything
i told you is as wrong and far away from
awakening as you could imagine when you actually awaken you
will look back upon this and you will laugh at
how wrong it was so you might wonder william why
did you tell me all this well because that's that's
the that's the existential bind that we're in if i
don't tell you about awakening we're damned if i do
tell you about awakening we're also damned we're damned if
we do and damned if we don't that's just the
limitations of of language and of mind and of your
level of conduct you got to understand that this master
control knob of consciousness this is the bottleneck of everything
right you can't be at a level three consciousness and
then just assume that from that level you can see
higher levels you can't you can't see above your level
so the only solution to that is not to stay
at your level and then try to imagine higher levels
the solution is to actually grab that knob and [
__ ] crank it to a thousand that will solve
your problem no amount of sciencing or logicing this thing
or debating this thing or imagining this thing or fantasizing
about it is going to change the fact that you're
stuck at a [ __ ] three when you're at
a three no amount of thinking will get you above
a three no amount of logic will get you above
a three no amount of science will get you above
a three you will be at a three forever until
you crank that knob to something higher that's just the
nature of the beast all right that's it now you
understand what awakening is all done uh so i'm done
here click that like button for me and come check
out actualize.org on the actualize.org website you will find resources
you will find a book list the book list is
crucial to help you to wrap your mind around some
of the things i say that i'm saying i say
some radical and crazy things on this channel uh that
your mind will probably not want to believe it'll be
unbelievable literally to your mind so how do you validate
some of these things well obviously by cranking that knob
but before you're actually going to even muster the curse
to crank that up read some books i got some
incredible books on my book list written by masters and
experts and teachers and researchers and phd's and god knows
who else that will help you to convince you that
this is something that's not just ideas that i've made
up these aren't just leo's delusions right i'm not the
first person who's talked about this i won't be the
last thousands of people have experienced this stuff for themselves
you can too right so the books help with that
they help to learn a little bit of authority to
this stuff if you need that now you don't need
that the truth doesn't depend upon the authority of any
book or human but your dense mind might be benefited
by that so check out my book list check out
my life purpose course that's also available there you can
also find my blog where i post all sorts of
interesting insights videos links resources articles don't miss those i
put quite a bit of time into my blog come
to the forum ask questions support me at patreon.com actualized
i appreciate that and check out my second channel called
actualized clips and then i'll end on one final point
which is actually rather important so listen close look a
lot of spiritual teachers and masters will try to convince
you there's this trend this sort of neo-invited trend online
like they'll try to convince you that awakening is nothing
special awakening is the most ordinary thing it's not astounding
it's not special it's not interesting it's just the most
ordinary thing so don't go chasing after some extraordinary thing
right you've heard this if you watched many of these
sort of neo-invited teachers guiding you toward through self-inquiry and
stuff like this this is deeply misleading deeply deeply misleading
there can be shallow versions of awakening which are not
very extraordinary but there's just no way that you are
going to comprehend the absolute nature of yourself god and
the universe and not be totally blown away by it
the only way it won't blow you away is if
you don't actually comprehend it fully and i see a
lot of people who get into these neo-invited teachings with
self inquiry and this sort of direct pointing methods and
so forth um then they start even denying things that
like god they start denying things like love they start
denying things like infinity and whatever else dismissing these as
just mystical experiences or some sort of ego concoctions or
whatever because awakening is just supposed to be this simple
ordinary emptiness or something what they imagined the buddha taught
that's actually not what the buddha taught but they imagine
that's what the buddha this is this is weak sauce
spirituality it's a weak sauce version of awakening this is
not even close to a full awakening uh it's a
it's a very deep trap these people have no deep
grasp of what reality actually is what they've done is
they've fooled themselves into emptying their mind through some kind
of practices and they've had some little glimpse of no
self or something like that or emptiness and they think
that they've comprehended the entire beast and they haven't they
haven't and i've i've been misled and gaslit by these
people for a long time in my own journey it's
taken me a lot of struggle to figure out just
how [ __ ] wrong these people are so watch
out there's traps within traps within traps in this work
and when you think you fully awoken that might be
the biggest trap of all so watch out watch out
with these shallow teachings if your teacher or guru is
teaching you a version of awakening that is not completely
ripping your whole reality apart and making you [ __
] in your pants in awe and horror leaving you
completely dumb struck and flabbergasted and writhing on the floor
in in ecstasy and wonder and mystery and horror then
it's not a it's not a full awakening it's far
shy of that you're not comprehending how deep consciousness goes
now at the same time even though i say that
of course these teachers are right in a certain sense
in the sense that if what you do is you're
always chasing some sort of peak experience or high or
you're chronically abusing psychedelics and you're not willing to just
sit down and do the work and to actually do
the hard manual labor of like a 10-day boring ass
grinding meditation retreat that is a problem so there's sort
of a middle ground here between it's not an either
or like that you treat awakening is just some ordinary
simple nothingness or emptiness or you're chasing some sort of
egoic mystical experiences it's like no there's something in the
middle these things that i'm describing these facets are definitely
not egoic experiences and they're way beyond just ordinary realizations
of no self no self is relatively minor and easy
attainment on this in this work on this path god
realization is way beyond that and then you know infinite
absolute infinite consciousness is even beyond that so just keep
that in mind um don't rest on your laurels when
you have some awakening or some attainment great but then
also the reason i'm saying this is is not to
elevate myself but just i'm saying this so that you
don't get stuck at a low version of awakening because
i see a lot of people do that and they
fool themselves and then they convince themselves that okay that's
it i'm done i'm done enough of this chasing and
seeking it's just all ego like they take this attitude
and they think that they're being wise and spiritual when
they do this they aren't they're [ __ ] stupid
they aren't fully awake they don't really understand what reality
is and you can you can easily easily demonstrate this
to yourself once you do fully awaken you can you
can just look at people you can ask them if
you just ask them one or two questions and just
how they answer you instantly tells you that they're not
fully awake and that they haven't realized what god is
or what love is or what infinity is or these
other things you can instantly recognize these things and then
you can you can laugh at these stupid neo-invited people
who tell you that awakening is not astounding and extraordinary
it is the most extraordinary [ __ ] thing that
there could possibly exist is so extraordinary you can't even
imagine how extraordinary it is and yet at the same
time it can also be very ordinary that's the paradox
of it and you have to distinguish what i'm telling
you here from some sort of you know mystical visions
of jesus and stuff that's not what i've been describing
here i've been describing a very pure form of awakening
there's a lot of weird new agey mystical mystical visionary
stuff that you can experience with spiritual practices various kinds
of cities and astral projections and dmt entities and angels
and [ __ ] i haven't talked about that stuff
at all i consider all that tangential now i'm not
denying those things can be conjured up by consciousness consciousness
can conjure up anything so i don't put anything beyond
the can of consciousness but uh that is not that
is not like the purest highest awakening in fact i
wouldn't even call that awakening proper like to see an
angel if you see one it's not awakening it might
be a powerful mystical experience it might be life-changing for
you it might even improve your life it might get
you to believe in god because if there's angels you
probably figure well god must be real too it might
do that but that is not the same thing as
realizing that you are god and by the way i
have not in this episode described all of the facets
of awakening there are more facets that i have neglected
here for example one of the facets that i neglected
is the facet of self-design i talk about it in
my episode the many facets of awakening go check that
out um but even that episode doesn't cover all the
facets because i'm still discovering more facets i've had hundreds
of awakenings i'm still discovering more facets so one of
the facets is self-design you become so conscious that you're
god that you realize how you're actually designing the entire
universe right now as you're sitting here you see that's
what that's what a full awakening really gets you it's
it's a deep comprehension of everything it's like the ultimate
big picture it's not limited to some angel or some
buddha or some jesus it is a cosmic scale self-understanding
so by no means is what i explained here the
full picture there's more stuff that i didn't have time
to explain that i forgot to explain i literally have
to keep lists of all the facets that i've discovered
because there's so many it's hard to keep them all
in my memory but um if you want that list
at least uh a good portion of that list go
check out my episode the many facets awakening and stay
tuned in the future for more and i'll share more
facets that i've discovered as well
