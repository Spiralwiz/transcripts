Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to make a critique of rationalism. Man, I'm
so excited about this one, I'm really, almost kind of
gloating inside. Because I'm really going to enjoy talking about
this, I've spent a lot of time in my life
researching the foundations of rationality and the foundations of human
knowledge. This is a kind of been a pet project
of mine for for years now for years. And it's
as much to say, in fact, I'm probably going to
write a book about this at some point, I've already
started outlining a book about the limits of rationality, and
the limits of certain schools of thought, that are like
the scientific, the materialistic ways of thinking, the physical mystic
ways of thinking that are very, very common in today's
society in the West. So right now, we live in
what spiral dynamics calls stage orange, that's kind of where
American culture and Western culture in general, in first world
countries is that what this means is rationalism, scientism, and
the materialistic frame of mind. The success of science has
made us blind to the limits of science. Because in
the last 500 years, we've developed many theories and ideas
that have been well tested now, and have given us
kind of mastery, technologically speaking over our, you know, the
physical plane. And that's all well and good, there's nothing
wrong with science, science is great, and it's useful, and
I love it. And I love to study science. And
I've spent years of my life studying science, I enjoy
science. But there are limits to science, which most rational
people do not understand. And even hardcore scientists do not
understand. Because science is a framework. And what scientists really
hate to hear is that science is the framework. Now,
if you're a really high quality scientist, actually, you recognize
this, and you've actually studied this, you actually become conscious
of the framework of sciences. And you're very modest with
the claims that you make as a scientist. But this
is not most scientists, most scientists are actually quite arrogant
in the claims they make. And the claims they think
science is able to make about reality. And this gets
them into trouble. This creates a blind spot, this blind
spot is further exacerbated by the failure of religion that
has occurred in the last 500 years. So at the
same time, as science has ascended, religion has sort of
descended. And we've kind of seen through the, just the
sham of organized religions, and the real corruptions of it,
and the abuses of it and the limitations of it.
And so we've kind of swung our pendulum from like
the really religious, to the now really materialistic and rational
based way of looking at life. And this has created
the blind spot and made it even worse, because it
feels like Well, there's only these two poles. And what's
left, I mean, we've kind of explored the extreme, extremely
religious pole. And we found that that's no good. So
now we're exploring the extremely rational scientific pole of the
spectrum. And that looks great look, I mean, we're evolving,
we're advancing life is getting better because of all the
technology we're developing, so on and so forth. And this
creates a kind of cultural blind spot. But what I
want to show you is actually that there's some limits
here, and that there's something beyond just these two poles
that you can access, and that this is the next
stage for you. If right now you're rationalist. So this
is going to be a critique against rationalism. Now, what
is rationalism? Who am I talking about here? I'm talking
about people who are basically buying into the standard scientific
model. And what's called Naive real realism. naive realism is
basically the idea that well, the world is pretty much
how we perceive it. There's a physical external world, its
objective, it exists even independent of us, independent of our
proceed perceiving it. If I look away, the tree is
still there. The tree has certain properties. Properties are inherent
to objects, the colors and the sensations that we experience.
These are subjective things that are basically informed by objective
reality. And so through our thinking, and conceptualizing. We can
explore and understand this reality. We can come up with
accurate formula and models that tell us exactly how this
reality works. And once we found those formula and models,
then we have a clearer picture of how or, quote
unquote, God thinks, we've kind of dissected and broken down
God into just basically a series of formulas, physical laws,
and so forth, and determinism and these kinds of things
in quantum mechanics, we've kind of broken it all down,
and we now understand everything there is to understand. And
of course, we'll, we'll explore the universe more. But basically,
we've kind of got the foundation of the universe figured
out. And we're going to use rationality to do all
this. This is our tool of heavy lifting. And we
expect to act rationally in our lives, we expect people
to act rationally. And we expect argumentation to be clear
and precise and laid out and very mathematical like terms,
so that we can find any contradictions. And as soon
as we see a contradiction, then that means that we're
off on the right on the wrong track. And when
we don't have any contradictions, that means we're on the
right track. And we're gonna go look for objective evidence
to prove our point. And we're going to look for,
you know, peer reviewed research studies and so forth, to
get to the truth of reality. So this is kind
of like the rationalist perspective. Let me tell you, though,
what the rationalist doesn't understand the limits of rationalism. So,
have you recognize this, that rationality is a small subset
of reality? If all of reality is like a giant
field, like a big canvas, you might say, that stretches
out in all these different directions, what rationality is really
is just a small subset within this larger field. It
is not the entire field. It is a small subset.
Rationality is a human feature, not a universal feature. Have
you ever thought about the fact that rationality depends upon
you having a mind and a brain? That's what makes
rationality possible. Now rationalist, tend to assume that kind of
like the whole universe is rational. I mean, why would
it not be? But have you actually questioned that? Have
you actually proven to yourself that the universe is rational?
Or could it be the case that the universe is
not rational, that only the human mind is rational? And
that's a tool that the human animal has to look
on the world with. But this does not necessarily have
to be the case that most animals are not rational.
They're not irrational either. They would be more like a
rational. existence itself. You have to wonder, existence itself. What
is that? Is that a rational thing? And if you
sit down and you look at it shouldn't take you
long to realize that existence itself has nothing to do
with rationality or logic. I mean, existence, actual existence. I'm
not just talking about theories here. I mean, actually, right
now, you're listening to me, you're hearing my words, you're
sensing your own body, you feel like you're conscious, whatever's
happening to you around you. That right there are sensory
experiences, that's existence happening right this very second. If none
of that existed, there would be nothing. There'll be nothing.
So just existence itself, this thing? What does it have
to do with rationality or logic? Is it rational or
logical that something exists rather than nothing existing? What's the
connection? If all human beings were killed, and that's where
rationality resides, and human minds, if all the human minds
were destroyed, would rationality exist any longer? Now, of course,
what the rationalist will say, is it no believe the
universe is rational? Of course, you know, we theorize about
it, but you know, you destroy our brains, and you
destroy the human race, but the universe still operates rationally.
No, it doesn't. Not at all. What you're failing to
appreciate is that what you call rationality is just like
a projection that you've made onto the universe. The universe
actually operates completely a rationally. Not irrationally, but a rationally,
which means that it's just, it's a non sequitur. The
operation of the universe and existence itself has nothing to
do with rationality or logic whatsoever. Rationality and logic is
a higher order emergent property of an a rational All
universe. How does rationality actually arise? How does logic arise?
What are these things? If you make a deep study
of this subject, very self, honestly, what you'll realize is
that rationality itself and logic has to be grounded in
something a rational, namely existence. See, existence doesn't depend upon
logic. But logic certainly depends upon existence. Because without existence,
you can't have logic. Logic and rational thinking is an
activity that's going on in your mind. You can actually
be aware of that happening to you as you're doing
it. Before that can happen, there has to be existence
and there has to be awareness. It is very easy
to prove to yourself that one of these is more
primary than the other. Because you can have existence without
logic, but you can't have logic without existence. And existence
itself has nothing to do with logic. There's no logical
reason for existence. Impure empirical facts themselves are not something
that require rationality or logic for them to exist. Any
empirical fact, in fact, needs no argumentation. Nor can it
be argued for or proven with thoughts. I'm talking about
the brute raw, empirical facts. So for example, that snow
is white is a brute empirical fact, no amount of
argumentation or reasoning can demonstrate that snow is actually white,
there is no reason why snow would have to be
white. In other words, snow happens to be white, because
that's what it is. There is no logical reason why
the sun should exist, the sun exists. And if you
want to demonstrate this to yourself and prove it, then
you go outside during the day, and you look out,
and you see the sun and it's shining, and therefore,
you know, it exists. If you sit down you think
and logically try to analyze whether the sun should or
shouldn't exist. You're not going to get very far. You
have to recognize that empirical facts have nothing at all
to do with rationality, they are completely a rational. Rationality
is something we do with empirical facts. See, and this
is what science is up to. What science is up
to is that it says yes, okay, we got all
these empirical facts. Now, let's make sense of them. And
the mistake, the blind spot that happens here is that
you think that when you're making sense of them, that
you're kind of like, really uncovering the deep existential truths
of reality. I mean, like when I make sense of
how a projectile moves through the air, or if I
toss the ball up into the air, I can calculate
and theorize and figure out the exact path of motion,
I can calculate and run numbers and come up with
equations. And I can figure out that there's a law
of gravity and, and special relativity and general relativity, all
these theories, and I can explain perfectly why the ball
moves in the way it does. Or we can launch
a satellite up into space. And we can predict exactly
how it's going to orbit around the different planets very
accurately. But just because you can do that. Do not
make the mistake of thinking that you somehow like, got
into the guts of the universe, and you figured out
actually the laws by which the universe works. No, what
you did is you made a human projection, you analyze
the facts, which were completely irrational. And now you came
up with some human model of how all that stuff
works. And if you do that successfully, then they give
you a Nobel Prize, and people praise you for it.
And they tell you all you're really smart, you understand
how the world works. But don't forget, ultimately what happened
there is that you made a human projection onto how
the world works. There could be 100 other equally valid
explanations for these exact same hard empirical facts. You might
claim yours The best you might claim yours is the
simplest, Occam's razor and so forth. But that ultimately says
nothing about how and why the world actually works. The
way it works is the totally disconnected. It's just a
projection of your mind. Which is created by mental labels
and images that happen in your mind. A real problem
that rationalists have is they give undue importance and weight
to mental labels and images that are happening in here,
inside the skull. These mental labels are what we use
to construct models, scientific models out of. And we think
that we're really getting to the core of reality when
we do this, but actually, we're not, what we're doing
is we're constructing an artificial human matrix, conceptual matrix of
labels, and images, and concepts. And we're just combining them
all together into a very rich and very elaborate system,
which then helps us to make approximations and predictions about
the future. And sometimes we do this successfully, and we
do it successfully, we call this good science. And when
we do it on successfully, we call it bad science
or mythology or something like this. But see, as soon
as people have a little success in the real world,
and they are able to predict something, they actually assume
that they understand what's really going on, like they've gotten
into the guts of how the universe really works. And
they stop recognizing the fact Oh, this was just mental
labels that I came up with mental labels, I can
actually see them functioning in my mind, you know, mental
labels concepts, I actually see that the law of gravity
is not something out in the world, it's something I
project out onto the world, gravity doesn't actually exist. This
is preposterous, preposterous to claim that gravity actually exists, just
the concept we came up with. Same thing for all
the other scientific cons of conservation of energy, this is
not exist, this is just a concept we came up
with. Now, of course, it's a useful concept. And I'm
not questioning that it can be used to, to do
some good stuff technologically. I'm just trying to draw the
limits and boundaries. To be very, very careful about what
we're actually doing when we're doing science, or what we're
actually doing when we're using logical rationality have to be
clear about this. So in general, rationalists don't acknowledge and
they don't recognize that what thinking and logic are, is
that there are language. And languages are very tricky and
complex things. Fact, there's something called philosophy of language. And
you can study languages, not just learning like Chinese. I
mean, like study linguistics, study the deep structure of what
language is what you do, if you study that what
you recognize, is that language functions, thanks to symbols. And
symbols are really, really tricky things. A symbol is one
thing that bears absolutely no connection or resemblance to another
thing, but claims to represent it. So for example, I
can use the symbol Apple to represent an apple, a
real red shiny apple, juicy apple in the real world.
And you can understand me, because we've trained our minds
to associate the sound, Apple, which has nothing to do
with apples. But we've trained that connection to the point
where we now actually can create this label of apple
and confuse it with the real thing. And you know,
with just one simple symbol like this, it's easy to
see that oh, well, you know, I know that Apple
is not an actually an apple, that's well and good.
But the problem is that when you start to create
symbol upon stumble upon symbol, and string them together, and
sentences and paragraphs and pages, and then entire theories get
created and concepts get created, models get created over hundreds
of years and 1000s of years and all combined together,
one supporting the next that is very easy to construct
a labyrinth of the mind, a labyrinth of symbols and
to get lost in this labyrinth and just think that
this labyrinth now is reality. What starts to happen is
that you overlay this matrix of virtual reality on top
of real reality and then you do it so much
and so often because it's so helpful for you that
you stopped seeing that it was a projection the whole
time. What started off very innocently, perhaps in the caveman
era. has now become this runaway effect. And it leads
to real problems when we don't acknowledge that the map
is not the territory. Alfred Korzybski came up with his
very famous statement, use a lot in NLP, I think
it's one of the most important concepts that humans have
come up with greatly underappreciated. More people should study, the
map is not the territory. What this means is that
we can construct maps of reality, using symbols and language
and thinking, mental labels. And these maps can be very
rich and robust. But they are never, ever, no matter
how accurate they are, they are never the territory. The
map is never the thing that is representing never. And
the most dangerous mistake you can make in your life,
is to believe that the map is the territory. And
you think that oh, you know, Leo, I can avoid
that mistake? No, you're so deep in this mistake right
now. That it would take me 100 hours, to reveal
to you all the areas in your life, which are
screwed up and totally backwards. Because you've made this mistake
of mistaking the map for the territory. This doesn't just
apply to scientific thinking, this applies to your personal life,
to your emotional life, to your relationships, to your relationship
to money, to your relationship to the opposite sex, to
your relationship to different races, to your beliefs about politics,
and academia, and how to raise children, everything else in
your life. All of those things are maps that you've
created in your mind. And you've mistaken them for the
territory. And now what's happening is that there's a real
sickness in your mind. Because you've came up with so
many maps, that these maps after a while they start
to conflict, and contradicted ultimately, they have inherent limitations. But
you can't see those limitations when you really believe the
map is the territory. And then you also get defensive
about the map on top of all that, you get
defensive about the map. And when someone tries to correct
your map, as I'm trying to do here, you get
all defensive about it, all emotional, all ego about it.
And you just want to cling to that map, because
the map is the territory for you. It's not for
me, but it is for you. At least if you're
rational. See, rationalists don't make the distinction between thought. And
awareness is a very, very fundamental and critical mistake is
to not distinguish thoughts versus awareness. The rational thinks that
he can just think his way into whatever he wants.
And that's basically the only tool it's kind of like,
you know, what's that old saying that if you have
a hammer, all you see is nails, all you see
is stuff to hammer in with, right? Because you just
want to use it so badly. It's your only tool.
But actually, there's more tools in the toolbox. Besides thought
you've got awareness. And in fact, awareness is primary thought.
Have you noticed that thought happens in your mind. And
that thought, basically what it is, it's not some spooky,
mysterious thing. It's internal mental sounds, words that you say
to yourself, which are symbols, and also images, internal mental
images, faint images, which are also symbols. And the combination
of both of these creates thoughts. That's what thoughts actually
are. But it takes a lot of mindfulness work, to
develop yourself to the point where you can actually resolve
and see what thoughts actually are, as you practice that
we should also understand is that awareness is something very
different. What happens when you're not thinking? What happens if
your mind is completely shut off, and it doesn't think
what's left? Well, that's actually hard to do for the
average person, because we're so addicted to the monkey chatter
in our minds and we can't shut off even for
a few seconds. But if you do shut off your
thoughts, what's left is awareness. Awareness is all the other
stuff. Of course, you've got sensory data coming in sights,
sounds, smells, tastes, touch, feeling, emotions, all this kind of
stuff occurs is within you. And you're aware of it.
You're aware of it as is happening to you in
this very moment. Of course, thoughts also arise there, and
you're aware of the thoughts. So awareness is necessary in
order to even have thoughts. Because if you had a
thought, but weren't aware of it, what would it be
to you, it would be nothing. Awareness is the thing
through which everything must pass, for it to be anything
of relevance to you. Because if it doesn't pass through
awareness, it basically doesn't exist for you. And thoughts, and
awareness are developed independently. So if you want to develop
your thinking skills, then you can go to school, you
can get a PhD, you can become a physicist or
a neuroscientist or whatever. And you're going to develop real
good thinking skills, you're going to become a real good
rationalist, a real good scientific thinker. And you would assume
that, okay, so that's good. That's it, I've kind of
mastered life, I understand what's going on in the world.
No, actually, you've mastered this thing called thinking, but you
haven't mastered its master. The master is awareness. Because all
thinking occurs within awareness, master that. And very people, few
people have tried to really master awareness because of mastering
words is a very difficult thing. And it's a totally
different, almost, diametrically opposite approach. And method than mastering thoughts.
You don't master awareness by thinking more you master awareness
by shutting up. And the most important shutting up you
do is not here, not in the mouth. This is
just an outlet, a trumpet, the source of your talking
is in here. That's what needs to be silenced. If
you can silence your mind for a little while, then
you just have pure awareness, you can bask in that.
And as you do that, more and more, you develop
your awareness higher and higher and higher. What's crazy, though,
and what most rational, Stoner understand is that awareness can
be developed, not just a little bit, not just double
or triple what you currently possess, but dozens of orders
of magnitude beyond what you presently have. If right, now
you have a level of awareness, let's say a level
of 10, you can develop it to a level of
100,000 or a million or 10 million. It's almost like
you have a microscope. And you can increase the resolving
power on the microscope more and more and more, you
know, 1x 2x 5x 10x 100x 1,000x 10,000x, and so
on. And the more you do that, the finer detail,
you're able to resolve in whatever subject you're studying. That's
very handy in science for us to be able to
look very, very closely as something will likewise with our
minds, the most important element of your mind is how
much awareness that has, this is like a muscle you
can build. Most people's awareness is so low, that they
are not even aware that awareness can be raised, let
alone how much it can be raised, let alone the
qualitative effects that occur with raising of awareness. It seems
like well, raising awareness. Yeah, that sounds nice Leo and
Meo. Maybe I'll do a little bit of meditation or
something to help me do that. But what does this
have to do with anything? Well, so you don't appreciate
what happens when you raise your awareness from 10x to
100,000 apps. It's not just that you now start to
see and feel things more clearly. You start to see
and feel things that never in your wildest dreams that
you imagined could exist. In the same way that when
you take up a microscope with 100x resolving power, and
you look down on something, you see a whole new
world, you see creatures and bacteria, and you see cells
and organelles within the cells, you see stuff that you
couldn't have even imagined was there until you sat down
and looked with a good enough microscope. And see the
rationalist fails to understand this, because he hasn't developed his
awareness very highly, because he's only developed his thoughts. And
he thinks that his thoughts are good enough. That that's
the best tool that there is. That's a huge blind
spot right there. huge blind spot. Because with such low
awareness, there's kinda like a catch 22 When your awareness
is this low, you're not aware of what thinking actually
is. So from a low position of awareness, it's feels
like thinking is all that there is. And that thinking
is great. And it's a powerful tool for understanding reality.
But the higher you raise awareness, the more you realize
that thinking is a system of symbols. And that symbols
are actually by definition, not the things they represent. And
so this gulf between the map and the territory just
goes wider and wider and wider and wider, until you
see that the map is just a complete fiction, a
complete illusion. And what you need to be concerned with
is the territory, not the map. And as soon as
you make that visible and aware to yourself, then at
that point, you suddenly have this break, and you start
to realize the gross limitations of thinking, in understanding reality,
because every thought you have, if you're highly aware, you
recognize what it actually is. It's not the thing it
points to, it's what it actually is. So Einstein's theory
of gravity is not revealing some deep existential truth about
the world, what it actually is, is a set of
sounds and symbols written on a piece of paper. That's
what it literally is. Except your awareness is too low
to actually see that. And so what happens is, you
get sucked into the content of the thoughts. And you
don't see any problem with that. Because to you, All
there is is content. You don't see the larger context
within which the content is occurring. This is a real
deep problem, real deep problem. When I see rationalists, criticizing
some of the things that I say, it becomes immediately
obvious that they're falling into this trap over and over
and over and over again. Because they're critiquing me on
the level of thoughts. Because they're lost in thoughts, and
they have no other recourse but to do that, when
they need to see that I'm speaking on the level
of awareness, which is a much higher level that you
need to develop yourself towards. And that's not an easy
thing to do. It really takes a lot of work
to develop yourself to that level. Really does. rationalists also
don't make a good clear distinction between the irrational and
the a rational. So they assume that well, Leo, what
are what are you talking about here? Are you a
proponent of irrational thinking? That's a straw man argument. No,
make a distinction between the irrational and the rash, the
a rational, the irrational, you might say is just like,
dumb thinking. I'm not arguing for dumb thinking. Rationality is
preferable to irrationality, and to emotionality. And, you know, like
working off of your emotions, but the distinction is a
rationality, a rationality, that a means that it's not, it's
not that kind of like atheism, or a political, if
you're a political, that means you're not political. It's a
non sequitur. Existence is a non sequitur, to rationality, there
are completely independent variables. They have nothing to do with
each other. You can have existence without any rationality whatsoever.
This does not mean that existence is irrational. It just
means that it's a rational. That's something that most rationalists
don't really, like, wrap their mind around. I don't see
them wanting to even wrap their mind around this. They
don't want to make this distinction. Because if they did,
it would, it would undermine a lot of the foundations
that they claim to also rationalist don't admit the limits
of logic. Logic is touted as this thing that's kind
of like unshakeable mechanism for arriving at truth. But really,
logic has no teeth. Even if you're a master logician
doesn't really mean anything. Because logic never proves anything. What
logic is logic is a system, a system of shuffling
and manipulating symbols. But what are you manipulating? You have
to have a premise to do a manipulation of that
premise to get to some kind of conclusion. But it's
the premises that are really the things doing the work,
not the logic. You can have perfectly sound and valid
logic, but your premises can be completely off and you
arrive at an invalid conclusion. And this is where rationalists
get into a deep trap is they they feel like
well, but I'm so rational, you know, I've studied the
laws of rationality and logic. And therefore, you know, I've
ensured that I will have an accurate picture of reality.
But this is, this is quite silly, because it's the
premises that you have to be looking at. And the
premises if you take a real close look at your
premises, you'll see that no premises ever really certain or
justified. premises are taken on faith. And on assumption. Doesn't
matter how good you think your premises are, they're ultimately
all taken on space. And I got news for you,
and most of them are very, very wrong. Even the
ones that seem very, very solid and in do bootable.
Rationality itself is founded upon irrational premises. Ask yourself, how
you can have rationality? What creates rationality? What are the
premises that make rationality possible? Rationality doesn't just exist out
in the ether. It has to be grounded in something.
What's the grounded in? What are the laws of rationality,
take a deep close look at those, what you'll find
is that they're irrational, irrational premises, create rationality. Another more
practical problem that rationalists make, is that they greatly overvalue
reason, in everyday life. It's almost assumed like we can
just kind of like, sit in an empty room and
just kind of reasoned through stuff, and be very logical.
And then this is how life works. And we can
base our decisions and operate from this place. But this
is completely ridiculous. This is the fantasy of ignoring the
effects of one's psychology. On living life, life is a
dirty thing. And if you've noticed 99% of your behaviors,
and even the way that you think, is informed by
emotion, not by logic. When you have to go take
a crap, there's nothing logical about that. That's an a
rational behavior. It's not irrational to go take a crap
when you feel like it. But it's not rational either.
Can we agree on this? When you're hungry, there's nothing
rational about hunger, you feel a certain emotion and you
go and you stuff your mouth with food, until it
disappears. There's nothing rational about this. It's not irrational either.
It's just a rational. When you decide to marry your
wife, or your husband, this is an emotionally driven choice.
There's nothing rational about this. Now you might sit down,
you might do the pros and cons and say, Well,
should I marry her? Or should I not? Well, you
know, here's the pros of marrying her here, the cons
of marrying her. And then you kind of sit there
and wait a decision. But ultimately, all of that is
happening for you. All that's happening, a rationally, you've got
circuits in the mind that are firing off, these circuits
are not themselves rational anyway. And then ultimately, they come
up with a conclusion for you. And then you take
that conclusion, then you go do it. And that's in
the most rational scenario. You know, most people don't even
get married that way, most people just get married based
on instinct. And I would suggest that 99% of your
behaviors are exactly like this. They have no logic in
them whatsoever. So your ability to be rational, logical, has
very little influence on your actual results in life. Life
is much more grounded in emotions. People who tend to
be very rational, what I noticed in them is that
they're actually disconnected from their body. And they have low
emotional intelligence. They're not really in touch with their emotions.
In fact, they're kind of afraid of emotions. They're emotionally
repressed people, their anal people, or their borderline autistic minded
people. You are people that are so hyper rational and
logical that they think that this is the only way
to interact with life, when actually it's kind of a
crippled way to interact with life. And you can actually
learn this is something I've learned over the last 10
years of my life. I used to be very logical
rational, because I learned how to connect with my body
more. And I'm still working on that, by the way,
and I've learned how to connect with my emotions. More.
And what this does is instead of making you irrational,
which is what the rational is sometimes fear with this
stuff, actually, it makes you a more full human being.
The reality is that you're already emotional. Even if you're
the most logically minded person in the world, like I
said, 99% of your behaviors are already emotional. The problem
is that you're denying this, you're resisting it, you're not
aware even of the fact that you're denying it. And
of course, you're not aware because like I talked about
earlier, you don't have the resolving power, your awareness level
is so low, you can't even see all the emotions
that you're denying that that's what's so damning about having
low awareness is that you don't even see what you
don't see. You don't know what you don't know. And
rational people just assume that well, you know, we don't
need any of that emotional stuff. I don't need to
get in touch with my body. What are you talking
about Leo, I can just keep plowing and plowing and
plowing with my theories and my models about the world.
And that's going to be enough. But that's not enough.
Not by a longshot. And what's really ironic is that
a rational people are actually very dogmatic about their rationalism.
They cling to it, they're emotional about it, they're reactive.
They're not really objective with their rationality, not at all.
Take a look at high profile, scientists take a look
at them debating religious people, fundamentalists, and so forth, you
can see that they react emotionally, not objective, not at
all, they have their own agenda. And they push their
own agenda, as if not even more emotionally than some
religious people do. What rational people are emotional against is
non rationalism, anything that they perceive as irrational or a
rational, they have a knee jerk reaction against, and they're
reactive against it. Because their ego is built upon this
model of the world as being rational. And anything that
comes into conflict with that causes them cognitive dissonance, and
they don't want to hear it. And so they shut
their ears and eyes, and they don't want to listen.
Which is very ironic, because the rationalists biggest gripe with
people that are faith based and traditional and religious, is
that those people shut their eyes and ears to evidence
from scientific circles. And that they're not being reasonable. Well,
how reasonable is the rational person being, he himself is
not being very reasonable. Because he closes his eyes and
ears to the a rational because he demonizes it and
labels that as irrational in a knee jerk fashion as
a reaction. In general, for rational sort of failure to
acknowledge the egos role and thinking. It says though, the
rationalist assumes that well, we live in this objective cleanroom
scenario. And if I just work from this objective, clean
room, where everything is nice and pristine, I can just
apply the laws of logic to facts about the world.
And I can come up with a clearer picture of
what reality is. But this is a fantasy, you can't
actually do this, there is no clean room, that rationality
is happening within your mind. And your mind is infested
with psychological biases. With emotions with feelings, you cannot escape
this. You cannot ignore your own psychology the way you've
been assuming you could up to now. Your rationality is
highly affected by ego. And psychological biases is something you
can make a real deep study of it'll take you
years to learn all the ways in which is affected
years, not to mention, then decades to undo all that
stuff. It's really a lifelong work. But in order to
even begin that process, you need to become aware that
this is even possible, and that it's a real serious
problem. I don't think that rational people do is they
demonize post rationalism. So what I'm talking about here, is
I'm talking about post rationality, as opposed to pre rationality.
Pre rationality is all the religious stuff you don't like
all the faith based stuff, all the mythological stuff you
don't like from that then humanity has moved to rationality,
which was a step up, I admit. But now from
this place, we have to move up to the next
step, which is post rationality, but what rationalists do in
their knee jerk way is that they react against that,
because they are threatened by it. And they think that
post rationality is the same thing as pre rationality. So
they lump the two together, they put them on the
side and they say, oh, all you post rational people
are actually just religious people in disguise. And then this
way they preserve their paradigm and their place life. And
then they can say that, Oh, we're as good as
it gets. Because there's nothing above us because anything above
us is below us. Actually. This happens through kind of
a demonization process, which itself is highly psychologically biased. And
it's all wrapped up with ego. But their awareness of
so low because they haven't made the awareness versus thinking
distinction, that they can't see this. This is called the
pre rational post rational fallacy. Ken Wilber talks about this
a lot in his books. So be very careful about
that. And in general, what I see with rational people
is that they have not really mastered their own personal
lives. Because it's not possible to master your personal life
through rationality. Because to master your personal life, you would
have to master emotions, and you'd have to master awareness.
And these are things that the rationalist discounts turn his
back on. What do I mean by not mastering your
personal life? This might sound almost like an ad hominem
attack, like I'm attacking rationalists based on their characters. No,
I'm not. I'm critiquing rationalism, because it really is like
a fractured mind. And it leads to a fractured life.
A person who's highly rational and logical, will not master
his relationships, he will not master his relationship with money,
he will not master his health, he will not master
his ability to empathize, and to even feel his own
emotions and his own passions, he will not be able
to work on his own shadow and the inner demons
that he has, because all of these things are not
very rational. They're mostly emotional based, or they're based in
the body somehow. See. So what you find is you
find these brilliant scientists who have uncovered amazing things about
quantum mechanics. But if you actually take a look at
their personal life, what you see is that they are,
you know, terrible with relationships, they have a bunch of
divorces, they are bad fathers, and they don't know how
to raise their kids properly. They can't control their emotions,
they're on antidepressants. They feel bad about their research, because
they're unsatisfied with life in general, because the more research
they do, the more stuff they discover. They can't get
enough and it's not nothing is ever satisfying anymore. You
can win five Nobel Prizes, but you're still going to
be unsatisfied fundamentally inside, because you don't understand the fundamentals
of your psychology, you haven't studied so you haven't mastered
that stuff. Mastering the stuff is not just thinking about
it. But actually mastering it embodying it, which is a
totally different thing. In general, the rationalist he likes to
think he likes to do mental masturbation on these topics.
And you know, mental masturbation can be useful, it can
win you the Nobel Prize, but it doesn't mean you're
gonna know how to live life. You're not going to
master life and you're not going to master yourself. And
in general, if you take a look at any highly
rational person's life, what you discover is that this person
has not made a deep study of the following topics,
the following subjects, he has not made a deep study
of epistemology, philosophy of science, non duality, psychology and meditation.
These are fields of life that need to be studied
in depth, not just Theoretically, yes, theoretically but also practically
to embody these things, especially psychology, non duality and meditation.
These are things that the average scientist or rational person
is completely ignorance of. totally ignorant of and closed minded
to. I want to see scientists and rational people who
have spent a decade doing meditation, a decade studying psychology,
practical psychology, not some academic bullshit, I mean, practical psychology
that you're applying in your own life. And I want
to see, scientists rational people have spent a decade studying
non duality, and practicing non duality, enlightenment, consciousness work, stuff
I talk about in other episodes. What I see is
that rationalists will often debate with me and I have
a topic that I talked about, like enlightened And, and
then some rational person will come in there and post
some comment to me or start some kind of rational
debate with me how I'm wrong. And this doesn't make
sense Leo and this is a contradiction, yada yada, yada.
But I look at this person, I can see clearly
just from the way he's writing his comment that he
has no awareness. It's like I'm trying to talk calculus
to a dog, the dog can't understand calculus. That's what
it's like, when someone with awareness is talking to someone
without awareness. It's just like night and day. The person
without awareness, he can call all he wants, he can
chase his tail all he wants, but he's not gonna
understand calculus. because there hasn't been this deeper study, a
very open mind to study, because you've been indoctrinated with
rationalism. And make no mistake, your rationalism is indoctrinated into
you, in exactly the same way, using the exact same
psychological mechanisms of the mind and brain that are used
by religion. And other kinds of brainwashing. No different. The
content of the brainwashing is different. But the the mechanism
is exactly the same, the mechanism that a suicide bomber
uses to you know, and the reasoning he has to
go blow up a building, or kill civilians, and the
mechanism that a fundamentalist religion religious person uses to go
Convert and proselytize other people into joining his religion is
the exact same mechanism that very intelligent scientists used to
prove their theories of space and time. And whatever else
they study, exact same mechanism, just different content, which is
what's so weird and really scary if you start to
dig into this. Just how powerful these mechanisms are, because
you start to see that wait a minute, these mechanisms
are also operating within me. It's not just the scientists,
and it's not just the religious people in the suicide
bombers, it's me too. It's got me. That's how tricky
the mind is. See this point about awareness. Here's a
good way to illustrate it. Imagine that you're a scientist,
and you're working really hard. And you're living in the
universe of the matrix, you know, the movie, The Matrix.
So you're living in the matrix universe, where Keanu Reeves
was when he first started out. And you're so you're
living in this world. And it looks like the real
world, and you're doing all this science, you know, you
go to the lab, and you do all your double
blind experiments, and you want a Nobel Prize. And you
get, you know, you got a textbook published and all
this stuff, and you're this famous professor, and you really
understand how the laws of the matrix work. And then
just some kid comes to you, and they said, Hey,
dude, you're a great scientist, and I admire your effort.
But did you know that you're living in a matrix?
Are you aware of that? And what does the scientist
do? The scientist, he pulls out his PhD and his
Nobel Prize, and he starts talking about his theories. No,
kid, you understand? I mean, look, look, let me tell
you about the laws of gravity. And let me tell
you about how this thing works. And let me tell
you about the how rationality works. And let me tell
you about all these theories and all the signs, go
read my textbook, and you'll understand what I understand. Let's
see, he failed to appreciate the love the paradigm difference
between him and the kid. The kid might not know
anything about science and all the technical stuff. But as
long as he's aware that he's in the matrix right
now, then that trumps everything else. Yes, you understand the
laws of the matrix? But do you understand that you're
in the matrix? Do you understand that you can get
out of the matrix? Do you understand there's something above
and beyond the matrix? Do you understand that the matrix
is just an illusion? And that what you've been studying
your whole life is an illusion. Do you understand that?
Do you understand that you're using the matrix to study
the matrix there? You're using illusion to study illusion? Do
you understand? Are you conscious of that? And if you're
not God help you. Because you certainly can't help yourself.
You're completely stuck. And there is no substitute. The only
way out is through awareness. You cannot substitute lack of
awareness with anything else. One day, either will click for
you or it won't. If it does, you'll get on
the track to increase and build your awareness throughout the
rest of your life and If it doesn't, you'll stay
lost in concept land, with justifications and ideas and symbols
that you use, because you think that that's all there
is because that's all you've been indoctrinated with, in exactly
the same way that a religious fundamentalist Christian will stay
in that philosophy for his whole life, believing that he's
really got a handle on reality, when in fact, he's
just doing mental masturbation. So if you're giving undue weight
and importance to thinking, then you are stuck in the
prison of your mind. And this is the case for
99.999% of people, they are stuck in the prisons of
their mind. Because their awareness is so low, they don't
even recognize that they could increase their awareness, and how
important it is. Thinking has to lose its primary status
for you. For the rationalists, this is the core thing
that defines him is that thinking is his modus operandi
in life. And it's very counterintuitive to drop that whole
thing to drop that paradigm. It's a real radical paradigm
shift. And to one day, just say, wait a minute,
how do I know that thinking? Is all it's cracked
up to be? Who told me that thinking leads me
to understanding reality, more thinking. And you trust that thinking?
Why? Because there's more thinking telling you that you can.
And you trust that thinking, why? Because your mind just
comes up with some more thinking that tells you that
you should. And why do you trust that thinking? Where
does it end? Can you see that? It's just a
vicious circle? Can you see that you're begging the question
all the time? Can you see that you're, you're rationalizing
your own rationalism, with more rationalism, which is completely irrational.
But of course, you hide the whole thing from yourself,
so you don't see it? Because you don't have awareness
to see it. Because you've never bothered developing awareness. Because
all you think there is a thinking, because thinking tells
you all there is a thinking because thinking tells you
that awareness is not important. But why do you trust
our thinking? It's almost as ridiculous as asking a rapist
if rape is good. If you ask a rapist, whether
rape is good, he'll tell you it's great. Let's go
rape some people. Rape is great. Why? Because he's a
rapist. That's all he likes. That's all he understands. That's
how he thinks. And that's exactly your situations rationalist. For
you, the most challenge, the most emotionally challenging bullet that
you're gonna have to buy, is to knock thinking off
its pedestal so that it stops taking primary status. Now,
does that mean you stop thinking and never use thinking
again, no, don't make that strawman argument. You can still
think and you will think and you can use thinking
for practical stuff. And it's useful at times fine. But
don't give it that primary status that you currently give
it. And this is going to be very difficult for
you to do because this is exactly what's dogmatically resisted.
egotistically resisted by rationalist philosophers moralists, academics, scientists, historians, theorists
of all stripes. And by the way, also neurotics and
religious people, and fundamentalists of all stripes, no difference really
whatsoever between these people. These people are all on the
same playing field. same playing field, just different ideas, different
beliefs that they're defending, but they're all defending something. And
they don't recognize that there's a step up. There's a
new playing field you could be playing on. And these
people all assume that they're playing on the higher playing
field, but actually, no, they're all playing on the same
playing field. That's just a trick of their mind. That's
how the ego tricks itself. Here's a really huge issue
that every rationalist must answer, and I encourage you to
sit down one day just lock yourself in a room
and just sit down and don't get up until you've
answered this question very, very self honestly and satisfactorily. And
the answer is this. Why is contradiction a problem? Why
is contradiction a problem? This is the core, the mother
of all assumptions of rationalism. Contradiction is like the NoNo
word. When you face a contradiction within your reasoning that
tells you something is wrong. And then you go busy
yourself with straightening out the contradiction. But have you ever
wondered, what tells you that the law of non contradiction
is actually true? Might say this might seem like well,
how can you even question that, Leo? But no, I'm
serious. Sit down and ask yourself. What tells you that
contradiction is the problem? Is it more thoughts? What What's
your evidence for that? What's that grounded in? If you
sit down and you look, honestly, you'll realize that non
contradiction, the law of non contradiction is just completely groundless.
Completely groundless, has nothing to do with existence or reality
itself. If you look at reality, reality is exactly as
it is. And you never see contradictions in reality. Never,
ever, you've never seen one. The only place you see
contradictions are in your own mind. contradictions are a function
of the language game that you play. They are what
happens when you use a lot of complex symbols. And
then these symbols, they clash and crash into each other.
In the same way that imagine if I walked around
the world was a label maker, you know, one of
those digital label makers, it prints a little white label
with some black text on it. And I just slap
those labels on things, you know, this is a lamp,
this is a car, this is the cat, this is
a coffee cup, this is a table, etc. You just
do that. And then one day, you know, I put
a label of car on my car. And then the
next day, I come over and I put the label
bird on my car. And then you come up to
me is hey, you know, we're playing this label game.
Everything's going great until you label that car a bird.
Why are you labeling that car? A bird? That's a
contradiction. Contradiction. We can't have any contradictions. That's not part
of the language game. And you get a bowl and,
you know, get your panties and twist. Because this is
a real problem. Real problems is a real affront to
to reason and logic and science. We can't have a
car and hold the bird. That's absurd. The whole system
comes crashing down. But of course, you know, to the
rationalist. That's the problem because the rationalist is just so
emotionally invested in language game. But to someone who's post
rational, you know, like, like me. It's preposterous. Ridiculous. These
are just labels, you're attaching labels to things. The contradiction
doesn't matter. The contradiction is not something that happens in
reality, reality, don't give a shit if you're conflicted and
contradicting yourself. It doesn't care. Reality is the same always.
It does what it does, whatever our labels are, whatever
we project on, it doesn't matter. That's what's cool about
reality. See, so, to a post rational person, you know,
they can see that if stuff contradicts that's not a
problem, really. That's a problem of this game of modeling
that we're playing. We're constructing these elaborate maps and approximations
of reality. And of course, you know, when we have
a lot of complex maps, we try to combine them
all together and stitch them together so that they make
sense. So we have this overarching theory of everything, we're
going to see all sorts of things that don't quite
fit and maybe some contradictions here and there. But it
doesn't really matter, because that whole thing is just a
map. It's not the territory itself. Rationalism is not any
different than religious fundamentalism in the way that it holds
the law of non contradiction. For the religious fundamentalists, you
know, his thing is God, that's the thing he defends.
What the rationalist defends is the law of non contradiction.
What the rationalist defends is all his models and his
belief that models can actually represent reality truthfully. He can't
give that up. In fact, he will claim to that
more than a religious person will cling to God. Because
he knows that well you know, these models believe these
models are so good look, we've used these models to
land a man on the moon and to send satellites
into orbit and, and so forth. And this is the
danger of the model getting so good that it stops
looking like a model. There is a great code that
I liked that I got from why it would small.
And he says, the better the model, the bigger the
problem is, the better the model, the bigger the problem.
Why? Because when you have a shitty model, you know,
it's a model. Like, you know, if I have a,
if I have a shitty painting of New York City,
I know it's a shitty painting, and I would never
confuse it with actual New York City. Now, when I
have a really high definition, photograph, New York City, now,
you know, for a second, I'm still not going to
be confused and trick, but just for a second, I
might look at it. And I might actually think that
I'm in New York. But now if I build a
virtual reality, thing, like, you know, virtual reality goggles, and
I strap you into those, and I build a really
high resolution model of New York City there, and I
stick you in that thing, and I hook you up
to all, you know, the feedback and sensors. All of
a sudden, now this model starts to get into the
place where it's too good for its own good. And
now you can actually get tricked and convinced that this
digital representation of New York is actually in New York.
And you could even imagine that it goes to such
a degree, that it becomes such a good replica, that
you can't even tell the difference anymore, between the real
New York and the fake New York. And now put
that puts us in the matrix situation, doesn't it? That's
the danger of the matrix. Because you can no longer
tell illusion from reality. And that's exactly the problem with
modelling. The better the model, the bigger the problem, because
everyone forgets that it's just a model. Because most of
us, we just care about practical stuff, we care that
something works, we don't care if it's true, we care
that it works. And contrary to what scientists will tell
you, scientists don't really care about what's true, what they
care about is what works. So if a, if some
theory proves something unexplained something away, and it can actually
be demonstrated by facts, that means that it works, it
doesn't mean that it's true. Very big trap. Very big
trap. Just because your model is proven true, or you
know, proven accurate and able to be reproduced does not
mean that it's actually true. If that is not true,
no model is true, by definition, because it's not reality
itself. You cannot model reality, because to model reality, you
would need at least as complex and larger model as
reality itself. And you will need to include that model
in reality itself. And you will need to include the
model of the model of the model in reality, the
reality itself, and it will have to go to infinity.
So, when you think about that, you realize that the
most accurate representation of reality is reality itself, you cannot
represent reality more accurately than reality is. See, models are
useful in that they're a simplified version, there's something that
are limited human intelligence are limited human mind can use
to make some quick work and some you know, some
practical stuff happen in the world. That's useful. But it's
not true. Spend some time really thinking about all this,
I don't want you to just believe me and take
me on faith. Sit down, spend a couple 1000 hours
thinking about it all. But don't think too much. Also
build up your awareness. Because thinking alone, like I said,
is a catch 22 It's dangerous. Gotta build your awareness
at the same time. Otherwise, you'll be stuck. Sometimes rational
people say Billy Oh, look at this. Look at what
you're doing. You're standing here. You're talking to us rationally?
I mean, aren't you being rational here yourself, Leo? So
aren't you contradicting yourself? And of course, yes, of course,
I'm being rational with you, as I'm speaking, not because
I particularly hold it as important. But simply because you
know, I am playing the language game I am using
language. Language is a tool. Without it. I couldn't really
communicate to you. And it's because it's really the only
thing you understand, I have to use your language to
get to you. If you're stuck in the matrix, I
have to go into the matrix to talk to you.
I can't talk to you from outside the matrix. You
see, but when I'm talking to you inside the matrix,
You have to be smart enough to understand that, hey,
I just dipped into the matrix for your sake, to
help you, I'm going to, as soon as this conversation
is over, I'm going to go out of the matrix,
you're going to still stay in the matrix. But if
you're smart, you're going to connect the dots, you're gonna
see all maybe this guy came into the matrix, he
communicated something within the matrix. But there's some higher thing
like I can read between the lines of what he
was saying. And I can maybe now intuit that there's
something outside the matrix, because he seems to be very
convinced that there is what might that be? I mean,
is he lying? Is he full of shit? Maybe, or
maybe he's onto something that I could go discover for
myself as well. And what that is, is post rationalism.
Post rationalism is getting more in touch with your body
and your emotions and raising your awareness. Most importantly, it's
raising your awareness. This is the whole path. This is
the path of spiritual work this the path of non
dual consciousness work. Ultimately, path towards enlightenment, the escape of
the matrix is enlightenment, is the realization that the self
is an illusion. And that thoughts are illusions as well,
that there is no external physical reality. That that's just
a concept. A huge paradigm shift, and I talked about
in other episodes, won't really cover it in depth here.
But what I'll tell you is that when you're moving
towards post rational, you know, out of rational to post
rational, be careful not to assume that there's a step
backwards, it's gonna feel initially like a step backwards, because
you're gonna be afraid the ego is going to be
afraid. You push through that anyways, what happens is not
that you abandoned rationality, completely, no, you transcend rationality. But
you also take it with you, in a sense, you
see, I haven't become irrational. Actually, I consider myself quite
a rational person. I can speak very rationally, to the
most rational people when I want to. But then also
inside my mind, when I'm speaking rationally to you, I
know that it's silly, I know that it really means
nothing. These are just symbols I'm spewing out at you,
they don't have any significance to me, my ego is
not attached to them. Because I've did a lot of
work, to go from rational to post rational, I did
a lot of work. And I'm continuing, that's not a
done deal. For me, that's just, I'm still in the,
you might say, the baby faces of that. I'm going
to go much further with that. But I'm at the
point where I'm not bothered by these things anymore. I'm
not bothered by contradictions, I'm not bothered by some of
these things that rationalists are bothered by, and I can,
you know, I can see all the potential that's there
for me, going forward, and you know, how I can
develop my life and amazing ways. Because I've got rid
of this ball and chain of rationalism that's been tied
around my ankles since I was a kid. So the
key here is that you don't just transcend and ditch,
you transcend and include, you will still be able to
be rational, so don't worry about that. And lastly, I
just want to talk about the the idea of how
this applies to your life. So you might say, well,
Leo, you know, you're talking about this very philosophical stuff.
I'm not really sure what this has to do with
my personal development. And I'm not really sure what this
has to do with, with anything, it seems very philosophical.
Are you just kind of arguing for argument's sake? And
the answer is no, actually, I'm very interested in practically
improving your life. The issues that are central to the
quality of your life, your relationships, your career, your passion,
your your mood, and your emotions, your health. All of
these things, your levels of confidence, for example, the beliefs
you have about money, and about business, and so forth.
These things all impact the quality of your life. That's
what the quality of your life is composed of these
different facets. But all of these are linked to your
ways of thinking about life, and your attachment to thoughts.
And when you're extremely attached to your thoughts, and you're
behaving dogmatically, without even knowing it, and you're not willing
to raise your awareness, then you're basically stuck. And so
your life is not going to be very great or
very satisfying. You might build some great intellectual achievements, you
know, with your theories and models, but your life is
going to be rather miserable and you're going to die
frustrated. and dissatisfied no matter what you achieve intellectually. Wouldn't
it be nicer to live a really rich and fulfilling
life? A fully human life, tapping into your full potential
in life, which means tapping into your emotions, and ultimately
transcending the ego and tapping into things like unconditional love,
and amazing levels of creativity, and amazing mastery over your
emotions. And your mind will not be even cooler. And
if you want, you can still have some intellectual pursuits,
you know, but you're just not going to take them
too seriously. Because you recognize that there's way cooler stuff,
way bigger fish to fry than just that. So this
issue is very important. Because a lot of rationalists, they
just get stuck. They're dogmatic, they get stuck. They stick
their head in the sand. And then they're not opening
themselves up to the higher learnings that they need to
learn to really self actualize. I see it all the
time. And they think that they're superior. And they think
that no, Leo, you know, you're talking all this airy,
fairy New Age stuff. And you know, I'm above you,
because, you know, I'm a very rational person. Now, that's
just your ego defending itself. I'm not here to get
you to believe some new age beliefs that I have.
No, that would be the pre rational post rational fallacy
committed on your part. I'm here simply to show you
that there's, there's really powerful stuff you can discover for
yourself without having to believe me in a very scientific
manner, but you have to be much more open minded
than you presently are. And you have to relinquish this
clinging to like this, this theory building aspect of science,
you know, true science is not theory building. True science
is just observation of empirical data. That's the real essence
of science. So take that to heart. And take that
attitude of skepticism, you can keep your skepticism That's good
stuff. Keep your skepticism. And also, stay true to this
core scientific idea of staying true to empirical facts. Take
that with you as you explore your awareness. That's what
you're going to need to reach enlightenment. That's what you're
going to need to really mastered all the different practical
areas of your life. And perhaps, even more importantly, than
just your personal life. The reason this issue is very
practical is because right now the world is on the
brake. Modern society is really at an inflection point where
we don't know what's going to happen in next couple
100 years, we could go extinct as a race. That
is a very real possibility. might not happen, but it
might happen. And if it does happen, the reason it
will happen is not because of excess. religious thinking, it's
probably going to happen because of excess rationalism, excess materialism,
excess scientism, when the mind schemes and plots and the
ego is in full force, and there's no recognition and
no awareness of this. And because science has created all
these powerful technologies that enable this ego to wreak havoc
on the world, that's when you really create a calamity.
A real calamity. So what we really need in the
world is we need to start shedding the excess rationalism
that's there, the excess materialism that's there, not to go
back to the Dark Ages. But to move beyond where
we're currently at to the next level. And the next
level is the level of emotions, intuitions, relationships, empathy, compassion,
and higher consciousness. And these are all actually very tangible
things that you can develop in yourself. This is not
airy fairy talk. This is not new age talk. This
is all real hard stuff. But your mind has to
be very open to the point where you can start
to do the work, you need to start to tap
into the tangibility of these abstract New Age sounding concepts
that for you know, if you're being introduced, for the
first time to these ideas, they're going to sound sappy
and soft and kind of like oh, Leo, this is
not what are you talking about? No, you know, I
want you to just to be practical and scientific, you
know, Don't go this route. Yeah, that's how the ego
feels when it's being pulled from orange to green. In
green is the next stage for you. And then after
green comes yellow, and then turquoise, and then there's even
stuff beyond that. And these stages come to us from
science, spiral that amorous comes to us from Clare graves,
Claire graves was a great scientist. He's a very empirical
scientist. So, really, science gets integrated with humanity. Because right
now we have science that kind of just runs amok.
And it's kind of cold and heartless, and it's used
by fucking corporations to sell you shit. That's what modern
science is. It's what it is. We need to integrate
that science more with humanity, and see where that takes
us. So a lot is this fake. Take the stuff
to heart. Go research this stuff. Study these topics that
I'm talking about. There's a lot of research you can
do. And not just mental masturbation theory, you can start
there, but then go into the actual practice of it,
until you start to see changes in your own life,
and the raising of your own awareness. All right, that's
it. I'm done. Signing off, go ahead, please click like

org This my website, I have a free newsletter on
there that keeps you on track. With all the new
material that I release every single week, I'm committed to
releasing new self actualization material, which is going to be
advanced concepts that you're going to need to move to
these higher stages in your life. How do you actually
do that? Very few people tell you how this can
be done. Very few people talk about these subjects, because
most of society, even people in the self help field
are not really very advanced. And I'm not trying to
say that I'm like the most advanced or anything. By
no means, you know, I have a lot of growth
to do that I will do. But I can tell
you one thing is that my commitment is to get

life you're going to feel a lot happier than you
were able to ever possibly be under the old paradigms
that you lived under. Alright, so sign up. Stay tuned
