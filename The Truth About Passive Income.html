Hey, this is Leo for actualized.org And in this video
I'm gonna tell you the truth about passive income. Passive
income is a really interesting thing and if you are
studying material or products on how to start your own
business maybe you want to start an online business maybe
you want to start an offline business you know whatever
you want to do one of the things you hear
talked about a lot when you're doing that just getting
started is the the whole passive income thing and there's
this ideal kind of this holy grail that everybody talks
about which is passive income and now that I've been
in business for about five years for myself I live
primarily off passive income I used to live a lot
more off passive income that I do now now a
little more active income now that I do one-on-one coaching
but the passive income thing so I've learned quite a
bit of money with passive income and I have a
couple of ideas just some thoughts that you should understand
about passive income because i think that some of the
stuff out there that you can watch on youtube or
anywhere else can be a little bit misleading there's really
three main points here that I want to make it
past them number one is that it's awesome it is
awesome number two is that it's not really as passive
as you're told and number three is that it's dangerous
and I really want to cover why it's dangerous and
some of the traps and pitfalls of passive income because
when we start off if you're working a salary job
here with a nine to five job the way that
I was before I started my business then you're probably
thinking like well passive income that means what that I
get to sit at home in my underwear and do
nothing and i'm still getting income and that's basically what
it means it means that if you're on vacation you're
still getting income it means that if it's Christmas or
if it's a labor day you're still getting income it
means that if you go on vacation somewhere far away
you're still getting income and so this is a cool
thing it might seem like well what could be the
downside of something like this so let me go into
that in some detail so first of all yes it
is awesome and I love that feeling that you get
when you first get even a little bit of passive
income i remember when i was getting just five dollars
a day for ten or twenty dollars a day that
already feels like a lot to you especially if it's
in addition to the salary income that you've got ten
dollars a day twenty dollars today you're thinking in your
mind stuff like well that's like a free meal like
if i get 20 bucks a day extra that means
i can go for some nice sushi every single day
I don't have to work for it is just coming
in like that's awesome now what if we can ratchet
that up to a hundred dollars a day well damn
for a hundred dollars a day you know I could
I could be buying cool stuff every day or I
could be using it to pay my bills or whatever
and if then you increase that to two or three
hundred dollars a day then at that point for most
people that's kind of the area where they start to
feel like oh damn if I had that much I
would quit my job and I go travel the world
I wouldn't have a single worry in the world anymore
because that is that magic number where basically your expenses
are all covered and you even got a little bit
extra for the luxuries of life and so I mean
that feels sweet that's awesome the other really cool thing
about it is the freedom of the schedule that you
get so the whole key to passive income is that
you get it without having to sit there and punch
on the keyboard or whatever other type of work you're
doing it just comes into you right it's just like
a guaranteed stream of income every single day for for
me it was only websites on websites that get traffic
when the website to get traffic that traffic is usually
fairly consistent throughout the day and throughout the week throughout
the month throughout the year so that's a pretty reliable
source of income and you can have statistics that track
all that stuff so you can be know exactly how
much you're earning per you know a thousand viewers or
10,000 viewers or whatever your traffic levels are and when
i started basically within a year I was able to
build up the business to the point where we were
making six figures passive income and ultimately generated probably over
a million dollars and and passive income over the last
three or four or five years or so kind of
don't really keep track of that stuff anymore but it's
just like it just comes in so this is a
really awesome thing the freedom to schedule this allowed for
me it'll add for some really awesome stuff actually this
is kind of what allowed me to do a lot
of person development work that other people are able to
do because they're so busy with their nine to five
job right the nine-to-five job really drains you not only
does it drain you but it's also like a very
fixed schedule so can't really work around it like for
example when I wanted to go date and I want
to get better with dating and relationships I would literally
take months off of my work or you know I'd
be working but my work was flexible enough that I
can do is just like a little a little bit
here a little bit there and basically i was able
to spend like almost pretty much a whole year just
really pursuing a master of relationships to the point where
I wasn't working that much just focusing on that and
that that had that really build me up really fast
and got me to the point where i was really
satisfied and then I could go back to work and
so it kind of allows you to to swing your
pendulum from one thing to the next thing without having
to simultaneously beats feels doing ten different things and stretching
yourself too thin that's a really cool thing with the
this freedom of the schedule and the other really cool
thing about passive income is that is very scalable so
unlike doing something made like manual labor you can't scale
that much you can only do nine hours of that
per day or however many hours you do but with
passive income there's really no limit at all so if
you're getting a hundred dollars a day there's no reason
you can't be getting 200 500 thousand or even more
and they're your mind just kind of runs while it's
like oh man look at the possibilities if I'm already
earning a hundred hours a day I can already picture
how I could turn that into 200 or 300 and
then it's like damn that's you know that really opens
up the doors for anything so that's why it's awesome
the other point that I wanted to make is that
it's not really as passive as you're told so passive
we kind of assume like oh well you know I
can go do anything I want and the income keeps
coming in well the reality of is it is of
it is a little bit different the fact is that
the way this passive income is generated is that usually
you spend a lot of time initially without any income
at all building it up so basically you're kind of
paying it forward you might sit there for a year
or two years working on your business building it up
and not be seeing anything then the passive income starts
rolling in so first we got to take into account
that the passive income is paying for all the work
you did you know the hard work you did months
earlier so you got to get paid for that but
then in addition to that once you have the passive
income there's always maintenance work required this is an interesting
phenomenon because you this means that really it's not a
whole holy grail that's made out to be because the
Holy Grail is that you just have some sort of
product or business or service that you're selling or whatever
it is and that customers just keep coming to you
well in reality this work that way because markets are
evolving pretty quickly and especially if you're running an online
business man online stuff evolves very very fast in six
months time the whole landscape can change of your industry
even if you're doing an offline business the landscape the
landscape can change quickly too so this is actually what
a lot of businesses go out of business this is
actually why a lot of really big corporations fail and
go into bankruptcy is because they're actually not proactive enough
at looking at the horizon of where the landscape is
going so it's kinda like you're going to her miles
an hour the car and you're not looking too far
ahead you get lost you make that turn to make
bad decisions and so that's the thing that I found
with passive income is that yes once i was even
getting six figures of passive income the travelodge was that
I always have to be on my feet and I
was actually working I wasn't doing the 4-hour workweek I
was doing the 60-hour work why because i'm always looking
at the horizon see how to adjust my business so
that the passive income can stay preserved you might say
well maybe that was just your business I don't know
about that see I think that this is going to
be the case in any business where you're earning decent
money because if you're earning decent money fairly easily that
means that you can have more and more competition creeping
in there just by the way that the market system
works that's how the free market system works really business
is about finding areas and imbalances in the market and
then exploiting those imbalances and those imbalances usually they're kind
of like a gold rush you know you first spot
a bunch of golden hills then you go there you
dig it out the first version of spots that he
becomes a billionaire the next person might become a millionaire
the next person might just get a a hundred thousand
dollars and the more people come and come and come
like that that resource of gold just gets exhausted until
afterwards maybe five years later that there's nothing left of
this mountain of gold is just a plain old mountain
it's been sucked dry now of course there are evergreen
businesses that will never be sucked dry but I find
that you still have to engage with the with like
development you have to be bettering your product bettering your
service better in your business I'm not even talking about
the very basic maintenance work that's required so for example
if you're running an online business at the very minimum
you're going to have to have some sort of customer
support if people are buying stuff from you so if
you sell a hundred products is guaranteed at least perhaps
two to five percent of the people who buy that
product will come back and ask for a problem a
technical issue you know whatever so just for that you're
gonna have to have some sort of manual labor and
you could say sure why don't we just outsource that
and you can you can outsource some of that stuff
and hire somebody to do it for you but then
you still have to oversee that person you can't outsource
literally your entire business if you try to do that
what's going to happen is that your bed is going
to collapse it's just a matter of time it might
take two years five years ten years but it's going
to collapse I've seen this in my business the more
time i put into it the more I'm looking at
the future the more on spotting cool trends and I'm
working towards that I'm improving my products and services and
then stuff is growing as soon as I stop doing
that it's not this thing stay the same they start
to die and sometimes that can be really quick or
to be more drawn out but I find that for
example online businesses just one or two years is enough
to kill your whole business if you're not on top
of the ball so that's the maintenance work stuff but
also because there's this kind of pressure to always be
looking at the future it's also stressful and one of
the things with passive income is that it's kind of
addictive it's like a drug you start getting it then
usually what people do is they ratchet up their life
style to match the passive income so now you're feeling
nice but what now happens if your passive income is
threatened and your lifestyle has been improved you might say
well just go back to my old life style but
see you say that now because you haven't ratcheted up
yet once you do Ratchet it up then you're going
to have a different opinion about that you're going to
be very worried and afraid and so what's going to
do is kind of put you and like fear mode
and you're always going to be in in this mode
where you're trying to protect yourself against other people taking
your income away from you because you're kind of dependent
on it's your lifeline and so this creates a constant
source of stress this is the kind of stress that
entrepreneurs and business people always have to deal with but
i think it's even worse when you're dealing with passive
income streams and kind of basing your lifestyle on the
passive income that you're getting which is a really popular
kind of idea nowadays especially online so it's not all
peaches and cream you do have you have this problem
and the stress you know gets to you especially if
what I found you know if you just want to
put your business in maintenance mode and you don't want
to keep growing it then what you're going to do
is you're going to always you're basically going to kind
of do it yourself to the death of your business
and you're just going to kind of waiting and just
seeing and drawing out drawing out you're going to see
that the end is coming for you the way to
deal with that is to put all your attention and
resources and time and energy into growing the business but
then that takes a lot of time growing the business
is like a full-time job plus it could be a
60 hour a week job so in reality most online
entrepreneurs it's not like they're sitting on the beach sipping
pina coladas most of them what they're doing is they're
looking for the next thing they're doing research and development
they're testing stuff out there are building new products creating
new services polishing everything up improving the cult the quality
of everything they're doing because they do have competition and
they're very mindful of that and also because if they
didn't do that you start to feel really bad just
psychologically because you would admit to yourself that well this
is the best that I could do I've already reached
my peak this is the best business I could do
this is the most income going to have now I'm
just going to maintain it see when you go into
maintenance mode it's really hard to motivate yourself to get
up in the bed out of your bed in the
morning because you you wake up and you're like oh
man I have to go do more maintenance for maintenance
work nobody likes to do maintenance work that's not work
that you can get passionate about so just keep that
in mind and the last point to make is the
dangers of passive income here's where I can really see
people screwing up their lives the problem with passive income
is that it makes you lazy and it makes you
complacent you don't have that thirst that fight anymore to
go out there and grow the business look for new
opportunities and really work hard I've really noticed in myself
you even lose the drive to do proper good quality
maintenance work even maintenance work will start to do is
you start to just kind of like shrug it off
not want to do it procrastinate on it and this
really even if your business is going to perform decently
the problem is that like your mind your head space
is going to become so screwed up and so like
toxic that is just going to put you like into
this rut and I can definitely see this rut growing
larger and larger larger and really robbing you of that
extraordinary life that you want the reason you went and
you want to get that passive income is probably because
you're in a type person you want to go out
there accomplish big stuff with your life and in the
world input impact people well what I see is that
when you get up oh six figures passive income every
single year that like totally robs you of all your
motivation even if you didn't go in to the business
for money this funny thing happens when you just like
someone throws a lot of money at you and all
the sudden it's like well you know that big ambitious
goal that I had to help people and it's not
important and you know this impact that I wanted to
have in my community that's not important and this product
that i wanted to create it's going to be all
super special and really make it you know cool impact
in mine it industry or my niche you know i'll
do that next year so you just kind of procrastinate
and procrastinate and procrastinate the other problem that I see
is passive income keeps you in the wrong niches within
your business it keeps you in the wrong wishes and
also encourage it encourages you to pursue the wrong wishes
what i mean by this is that your business should
be also kind of self actualizing with you this means
that if you start a business which is all about
profit maybe you have to do that just to you
know get some cash in the coffers ok cool but
then what happens is that if you get the cash
what you should do is you should evolve your goals
so that your business is not about just earning cash
but your business about helping people or living out your
passion doing something really meaningful for the world for society
your life purpose right this is getting into the topic
of life purpose and what I really find is that
the stuff that is your life purpose many times that's
not the most lucrative and profitable thing and it's also
not necessarily a guarantee passive income source so just to
give you an example let's say that I have my
online business and then when i discovered that oh I'm
really passionate about art and I want to become a
painter well it's going to be very difficult for me
to make that transition even if I'm really dead set
on becoming up danger and I know that that's what
I want to really passionate about it it's gonna be
very difficult because i got this source of income coming
in and it's incentivizing me to stay in my online
business and there's probably gonna be new opportunities within this
online business where i can grow even more I can
increase the income even more so what you'll find in
practice that you're gonna have this kind of a really
difficult choice one you can stay doing the thing that
you know isn't necessarily your passion but you can grow
and earn even more money or you can go to
become a painter becoming a painter is going to seem
like well that's kind of risky you know painters they
don't make that much money not most of them there's
a high failure rate there's a there's all sorts of
risks involved and this opportunity with the income like why
would I give that up I might never get this
opportunity again a couple years ago by this opportunity might
go away if I don't capitalize on it now that's
how your mind tends to think and then what happens
is that you're like this page or think it can
wait I can wait i'll just put it off till
you know two years down the road five years down
the road and that inevitably leads to put it off
forever so you're wasting a lot of your time and
energy into this passive income thing and what I found
very interesting about that is that it's not even the
best thing if you want actually lots of money and
i find that the passive income thing it will make
you think so small that you're not ultimately to put
yourself in the position to earn the most money that
you can because here's what's going to happen if you
were really passionate becoming a painter and you were really
sure that was your life purpose then you should go
and do that that's the proper strategy and if you
go and do that then perhaps you could make millions
of dollars selling your paintings now if you go to
the passive income thing you might be earning six figures
or something like that but the problem there is that
like it's just that's that's going to be kind of
yours your max even if you grow that business more
and more and more because you're not passionate about it
because you know that the passion is over the air
but you're looking over here that's going to suddenly undermine
every action that you take its going to rob you
of your motivation and you're just not going to be
as engaged with this business anymore as you used to
be all the stuff I'm talking about from personal experience
and I think that I was better equipped than most
people to have this infusion of cash and this passive
income coming in I was stuck really kind of you
know in a world full of chasing money even though
I was not materialistic and I never really was and
I knew the dangers of that but still it trapped
me for a couple of years and it was very
difficult to say no so I really feel like passive
income is one thing that's so dangerous because it could
keep you from pursuing your life purpose it can keep
you from even looking for it if you don't know
what your life purposes and you're getting passive income ninety-five
percent chance that that person will never even bothered to
go looking for the passive for the for the life
purpose because they they're just not you know they're not
feeling the pain of it they feel too comfortable they
are getting more comfortable there and the other problem that
i find is that passive income robs you of the
willingness to do real work it really kills your work
ethic this again connect with life purpose because for example
if you're getting this passive income you're probably not working
too hard for it after you've established your business so
maybe you're putting in a five hours of maintenance work
a week but you're getting back six figures that seems
like a really amazing ratio of effort versus reward that
seems so sweet it's like you can't you can't beat
that now if you try to go becoming an artist
well if you want to be an artist you gotta
go taking some classes you got to go put on
galleries and exhibits you've got to go to maybe travel
the country you've got to to practice your technique you
got to set up for hours practicing your technique drawing
painting you know getting us to do going to all
that stuff that would be so much work and that
would feel like real work to you because this little
maintenance work that you're doing on your passive income business
is just like you know your kind of your you're
basically phoning it in you're doing very dumb stuff that
you've already done many times before it's not very challenging
work but now when you're going to do the artist
thing that all the sudden becomes really challenging work it
really starts to push your comfort zone makes you uncomfortable
and because you haven't been doing that kind of work
for years because you've just been coasting here with the
passive income what it does is that it means that
you're you're never going to go and consciously want to
do that work anymore and so you're gonna quit you're
going to come back so what this creates this kind
of Whirlpool effect where you leave but then you come
back you leave and you come back it's almost like
getting addicted to drugs - drugs or like like being
in the Mafia like that kind of thing right just
when I thought I was out they pull me back
in that's what it tends to become because the rewards
are too high and that's why criminals get sucked back
into criminal activities is because again the the criminal activities
the rewards they are really very high you don't have
to actually go in and do a lot of labor
to get a lot of reward of course there's a
risk there so it's not smart so in the end
I think that the the way that you deal with
this you know what's the takeaway here the takeaway is
that passive income it's a great thing I think that
if you want to become a self-actualized person you actually
have to develop passive income sources I think that's a
really important thing for people if you value independence if
you value freedom if you want to be in control
of your life then go for passive income just be
aware of all these pitfalls and i think the most
important thing here the takeaway is that the more passive
income you get the more you should balance it out
with personal development work so one of the reasons that
i was able to handle I passive income and I
can still handle it today is because I've been doing
a lot of personal network that gave me the wisdom
that I need to see these pitfalls and to not
fall into them I actually did fall into them but
to pull myself out it gave me the tools if
you go to an ordinary person on the street random
person and they don't have any personal development training they
haven't learned these kind of things they don't know the
right mindset they don't know the dangers of this passive
income stuff that they're just going to fall into it
and they're probably never going to recover so watch out
for that I think that you need to really balance
it out so maybe make some goals for yourself say
something like well if I'm going to be earning a
hundred dollars a day of passive income then that means
i have to read at least one - development book
/ / / week and if i increase that to
two hundred dollars a day then that means i have
to take one paid seminar live in person seminar for
personal development somewhere around the country and then if any
increases beyond that then maybe I'll go do you know
some sort of training program here something else they're just
so they like your you're getting that higher value wisdom
rather than the lower value of just pursuing money and
just running a successful business because in the end having
lots of money in pursuing a successful business that's very
low value you want the high-value the self-actualization is found
in doing high value stuff like pursuing beauty excellence truth
justice contribution to others helping others in some way making
a meaningful impact that's high value stuff that's the stuff
you want to be aiming towards right that's why passive
income is so powerful that it can actually enable you
to do this high value stuff but most people cannot
be trusted to use the money for that most people
use that money for stupid low value stuff so just
be careful about that all right this is leo i'm
