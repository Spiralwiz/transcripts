            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/UTjcsXnxPBQ' target='_blank'>Self Image - The Amazing, Absolute Key To All Personal Growth</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Concept of self-image</b>: Self-image refers to a subconscious mental model of ourselves and our reality. Our perceptions about our possibilities and abilities are a part of our self-image. The self-image is largely subconscious and is influenced by our upbringing, interactions, experiences, and lessons learned over the years. 
</li><li><b>Influence of self-image</b>: Our self-image has a profound impact on our actions and behaviors, as it shapes what we believe is true. Regardless of whether these beliefs are accurate or not, we tend to operate based on them. Approximately 95% of our actions and behaviors are driven by our subconscious mind, heavily influenced by our self-image.
</li><li><b>Importance of working on self-image</b>: Addressing and improving our self-image can lead to significant and lasting changes in various aspects of our lives, such as our career, relationships, and personal psychology. Our self-image can be changed, making it possible to achieve sustainable personal growth.
</li><li><b>Understanding and redefining self-image</b>: Our self-image reflects our thoughts about ourselves and our lives. If we hold negative beliefs about ourselves, it can hinder our progress and self-growth. To achieve lasting transformation, we need to challenge and redefine these beliefs, working on our self-image consciously.
</li><li><b>Self-image and assumptions about reality</b>: Our self-image includes assumptions we hold about reality. If we believe that certain goals (such as earning a certain amount of money) are unattainable, this belief, rooted in our self-image, blocks us from achieving such goals. Identifying and challenging these limiting beliefs is critical for personal development and growth. 
</li><li><b>Self-image and perception of physical appearance</b>: Our self-image also includes our perceptions about our physical appearance. Even when physical features change, for example, through plastic surgery, people often continue to see themselves based on their old self-image. This underlines the importance of working on internal self-perceptions rather than focusing solely on external factors.
</li><li><b>Concept of Self-Image</b>: The way we perceive ourselves - our self-image - plays a significant part in our behaviors and attitudes. If we hold onto beliefs about ourselves, such as being poor at spelling, bad at mathematics, or having a tendency towards failure, it becomes an intrinsic part of our self-image, often leading to self-fulfilling prophecy. Leo Gura highlights that our lives reflect such aspects of our self-image.
</li><li><b>Impact of Beliefs</b>: Our financial situation, personal growth, and overall quality of life may be heavily influenced by our deeply ingrained beliefs and assumptions forming our self-image. For instance, the belief that we are bad at math may limit opportunities in relevant areas. Similarly, internalizing a belief that we're shy could significantly hamper our social relationships.
</li><li><b>False Beliefs and Self-Image</b>: Many elements of our self-image may be inaccurate or detrimental to our potential growth. There may be strongly held beliefs about ourselves that are baseless and negatively impact our lives' quality. Delving deep within the subconscious, we can uncover and challenge these false beliefs or assumptions that form our self-image.
</li><li><b>Impact of Self-Image on Relationships</b>: A negative self-image, such as believing oneself to be 'ugly,' often exacerbates relationship problems. This is because it creates a reliance on others for validation and affirmation, leading to stress, bitterness, and eventual relationship breakdown when such expectations aren't met.
</li><li><b>Reiterating Importance of Self-Image</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of understanding self-image as an impactful part of personal growth. He likens self-image work to using one's legs instead of one's back when lifting heavy objects, indicating the effort to be more effective and less straining.
</li><li><b>Willpower and Lasting Change</b>: Relying solely on willpower for change is like lifting heavy objects with your back - it can lead to burnout. Lasting transformation requires working with the subconscious, where 95% of our actions originate. This involves working on self-image and beliefs through deeper introspection. Coaching can be beneficial in bringing subconscious insights to the surface.
</li><li><b>Changing Subconscious Mind</b>: Subconscious change takes persistence and an average of 21 days to bring about lasting change, as stated in Maxwell Maltz's "Psycho Cybernetics." Implementing new habits also requires at least a month or two until they become embedded in the subconscious. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Feedback and Continuous Learning</b>: Leo values constructive feedback to improve the content he provides and get ideas for new videos. He encourages signing up for the Actualized.org newsletter for exclusive content, including a series on overcoming limiting beliefs and a chance to win two hours of coaching.
