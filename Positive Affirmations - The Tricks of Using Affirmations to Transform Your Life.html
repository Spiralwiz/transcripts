hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment we are going to talk about positive
affirmations all right so what are affirmations how do they
work do they actually work and can you use them
to create positive changes in your life and the answer
of course is yes you can use them and if
you study personal development and you study as much of
this stuff as I have literally over a hundred thousand
dollars worth hundreds of books some of the best seminars
and you study all these people that are into personal
development you see that they are all on board with
positive affirmations so I'm on board with it too I've
been using it now for about six months you've been
using them actively and I've been getting some amazing results
and so I want to share with you some of
my quick little tidbits and tips and techniques for how
to get positive affirmations to work magic in your life
all right so what are positive affirmations and then we'll
get into the how-to in this video and there's going
to be more that I'm going to talk about in
other videos this is kind of an intro so basically
a positive affirmation is simply a short statement that you
say to yourself and repeat to yourself in order to
get your subconscious mind reprogrammed and thinking along and empowering
train of thought so what's an example well one that
I'm using right now for example is simply this I
am a millionaire that's my affirmation and what I do
is I repeat it to myself again and again and
again so it would go something like this I am
a millionaire I am a millionaire I am a millionaire
I am a millionaire I am a millionaire I am
a millionaire and that's basically what it is pretty simple
right of course I am not technically right now a
millionaire even though I am financially independent so what is
going on here why would I be saying this to
myself isn't this delusional isn't this unrealistic isn't this fantasy
well when you go after goals and when you start
to really get on board with this idea that you
have a lot of potential within you that you're not
actually and you're not actualizing right now then what you're
starting to understand is that in order to get to
where you want to be you have to have some
sort of faith some sort of confidence in anything successful
that you've done in your life we can pretty much
look back yet that history that you've gone through and
notice that the places where you succeeded at where the
places where you were confident we had some sort of
faith that something would happen and you have some sort
of vision beyond current reality and the places where you
failed are those places where you were very doubtful second-guessing
yourself very fearful and you were very much pinned down
by current circumstances by current reality so the point of
affirmations are to create empowering messages to your mind right
because you have your conscious mind then you have the
subconscious mind and the subconscious mind tends to be very
stubborn and it tends to want to stay where it
currently is it tends to want to produce the current
results that you've been getting in your life so the
reason for example that I have this affirmation that I
want to be a millionaire is because I've been dealing
with some issues around limiting beliefs around money and I've
been doubting whether I could be a millionaire and I
needed to basically reprogram my subconscious mind to believe that
I could be a millionaire and a very simple magical
almost unbelievable fact about your subconscious mind is that it
believes whatever you repeat to it consistently and it doesn't
matter how true or false the statement is whatever you
repeat to your subconscious mind consistently eventually it just soaks
that in your subconscious mind is like a sponge now
there are a couple of tricks here that you have
to follow in order to actually get affirmations to work
for you so I'm going to go down and give
you my quick little how-to list so when you're doing
affirmations a couple of things you want to make sure
that you're doing number one is that and it's the
most important part is that you have to do your
affirmations daily every single day without missing a day that
means you do it today you do it tomorrow you
do it the next day you do it the following
day then you do it again and again and again
and again and the next week and the next week
in the next month the next month and you just
keep doing it you have to drill it into your
subconscious because your subconscious is like an animal mind it
is not thinking logically about things this principle that your
that your mind will take on whatever you feed it
and say to it regardless of truth or falsity that
principle only works through brute force and repetition so you
say to yourself consistently all the time it's like training
a dog that's basically what you're doing is you have
that dog mind inside of you somewhere you have a
mind that's a that's very basic and primitive beyond the
conscious mind that we have as humans we have this
subconscious primitive mind and that primitive mind has to be
trained through brute repetition and the key there is to
not miss a single day the way that I do
affirmations is five-minute periods so I literally will take a
timer and I will set aside some time in the
morning or in the evening some quiet time by myself
where I just sit down and I press the timer
for five minutes I set it at five minutes I
press it go and then I start doing the affirmations
and I just repeat for five minutes straight and I
will say to myself I'm a millionaire I am a
millionaire I am a millionaire I'm a millionaire and so
I'll say that for five whole minutes straight without any
distractions without any interruptions you have to do this in
a very quiet environment you can do with your eyes
open you can also do with your eyes closed and
so that's it that's pretty much how informations work but
you have to do that all the time you do
it consistently I would say at least commit yourself to
a month of affirmations on whatever specific issue you want
to be working on so if it's money and you
want to work on abundance of money then you would
say this I am a millionaire affirmation to yourself for
at least a month straight without missing a single day
and maybe even two months or three months depending on
how how much problem you're having in that area so
the more problem you're having in there the more deep-seated
that that problem is that limiting belief the grounded it
is in childhood events then the more you're going to
have to use the affirmations so that's basically the most
important thing is to do consistently and this is where
most people fail is that they don't do it consistently
they do it on and off and so they don't
get the results so I would say that if you're
not going to do it consistently and by consistently mean
every single day 100% then don't even do affirmations they're
not going to work for you so either do it
consistently or don't do them at all now if you
do decide to do them consistently then you're going to
want to keep in mind a couple of other points
about affirmations the next point is that an affirmation is
a short concise phrase ideally a phrase not even a
sentence so notice in this example that we're using I
am a millionaire very short simple phrase right this is
not some long-winded airy-fairy conceptual philosophical statement or some sort
of you know flowery mission statement or some sort of
paragraph or a short story about yourself this is just
a simple little phrase and that's what you want to
keep it to always keep as few words in your
affirmation as you can get to get the gist across
right so keep them short keep them sweet keep them
pithy because your mind your subconscious mind again it likes
those slogans this is something that you want to be
able to repeat yourself many many times within five minutes
and it needs to be something that you don't need
to even be able to read off piece of paper
you can just memorize it very simple I have a
millionaire I am a millionaire I have a millionaire let
me throw out some other examples for you how about
I have unlimited energy I have unlimited energy I have
unlimited energy I have unlimited energy how about what's another
one I love being confident I love being confident I
love being confident I love being confident how about for
those procrastinators out there in the crowd I'm always taking
action I'm always taking action I'm always taking action I'm
always taking action right you can literally couple an affirmation
for any problem area in your life or any kind
of goal that you set for yourself so whether it's
a fitness goal relationship goals money career goals business goals
hobby goals any kind of personal development goals that you
have any kind of thoughts that you want to have
you can create an affirmation for it and it's such
a flexible technique which is why it's so powerful and
awesome ok the next point we talked about keeping the
phrases short and I gave you some short examples the
next point is make sure that they're stated in the
positive so notice if I'm struggling with money and I
have limiting beliefs around money I am still going to
use a positive affirmation to work on that I'm not
going to say I you know I'm not going to
go broke I'm not going to go broke I'm not
going to go broke don't do that instead flip it
around and say it in the positive I'm going to
be wealthy I'm going to be wealthy I'm going to
be wealthy I'm going to be wealthy right state stuff
in the positive always and this can be a little
bit tricky especially for some of us negative thinkers who
are always caught on this idea that we have to
be moving away from things whether you're stuck and you're
unhealthy right now and you want to say well I
I just want to be to my normal health I
don't really want to be super healthy I just don't
want to be unhealthy so in that case you might
have this natural tendency to say well I'm no longer
fat I'm no longer fat I'm no longer fat you
might do an affirmation like that but that is a
negative affirmation you want to flip it around and say
I am fit I am fit I am fit or
I'm at my ideal weight pick up pick a number
pick whatever weight you want to be at for me
it was 170 I'm at 170 I'm at 170 I'm
at 170 whatever that is make sure it's positive it's
always got to be positive because your mind your subconscious
mind especially tends to exclude that not that negative part
so when you say I don't want to be fat
what happens is that your mind just kind of takes
out and crosses out the don't and it just says
I want to be fat and it just has that
picture of fat you want to move your mind off
from the negative pictures onto the positive pictures so this
is also dovetailing with visualization so that is also an
important point is keeping stuff positive another point is start
your affirmations if you can with I am it's nice
to start an affirmation with I am because this goes
to your identity this goes into shaping your beliefs in
your self-image about who you really are at the core
so when I say I am a millionaire that's something
about me that's like me saying that there's something within
me that is generating money that's attracting money it's like
I was born to be a millionaire right it's more
I debt I'm more identifying with that statement and this
is shaping my self-image on a deep level if I
do it repeatedly whereas if I just say I have
lots of money or I you say something like I'm
making lots of money that is not so much identity-based
you want to make sure your affirmations are grounded in
identity so I'm always confident I'm just a confident kind
of person I'm naturally confident right you want to make
sure that the things that you're adopting are natural to
you that you're stepping into that role in your like
role playing it you're feeling it so if you want
to be more confident you're naturally confident if you want
to be wealthy you're naturally wealthy you don't struggle to
be wealthy you just naturally are that is a powerful
way to go about it so I am I am
this I am that I am healthy I'm wealthy whatever
you want it to be next is be specific use
the specific affirmations so the more specific you can make
it the better you want to be earning certain dollar
amount per year put that into your affirmation do you
want to be driving a certain type of car with
a certain model on it put that into your affirmation
do you want to be living in a certain state
in a certain city in a certain neighborhood in a
certain house on a certain street put all that into
your affirmation the more specific then the more your mind
will latch on to it and feel like it's real
and the next point and the last point I think
I'll make is make sure that your affirmations are stated
in the present tense what does this mean well I
can say I will be a millionaire or I can
say I am a millionaire right now this one's a
little bit tricky and took me some time to get
my mind around this idea cuz I always tend to
say well I'm not a millionaire right now I can
believe the fact that maybe I'll be a millionaire in
the future but it sounds silly to say that I'm
a millionaire right now no the point of the affirmation
is that you're trying to instill something in yourself a
belief a sense of confidence and faith to do that
you say that you are right now even though you
are not so yes in the outer world right now
I am NOT a millionaire that's just a matter of
fact but in my inner world I'm reprogramming myself and
I'm saying that I am a millionaire I'm trying to
get in touch with that feeling of billing it being
a millionaire what does it feel like what does a
millionaire think like what does a millionaire visualize I'm trying
to get into that role and the way you do
that is not by imagining that you're going to be
a millionaire sometime in the future it's about just drilling
into your mind that you're a millionaire right now and
trusting that that will have its effect and it does
have its effect because that trying to principle whatever you
repeat and say to your mind over and over again
is what it's going to absorb is always at play
so if that's the case wouldn't you want to leverage
that as best as you can and feed yourself with
the most powerful type of affirmations possible well I do
that's why I put them in the present tense all
right so those are my points about positive affirmations there's
more to this there's more tips and techniques for how
