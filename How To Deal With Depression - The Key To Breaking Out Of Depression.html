hey this is Leo for actualise org and in this
video I'm going to tell you how to deal with
depression let's talk about dealing with depression I actually already
have a video on this topic and now I want
to cover it from a slightly differing GLE so you
should also check out that video I'm gonna link it
down below it's called why am I depressed in this
video I have some additional thoughts to add so before
we get into the meat of it and I really
want to give you something here that you can take
away with you and you can sort of take action
on so this can be a very powerful video for
you if you take it seriously and you really listen
and open your mind to what I'm telling you before
we get into that though what I want to talk
about is the different types of depression that are out
there so I think it's important to basically distinguish between
two types I'm saying that there's two types there's basically
hard core clinical depression which is actually a very rare
thing and that means that you have actually something in
your brain that's eliminating your ability to be happy this
could be a genetic thing that you acquired this could
be something that happened because of the way you were
raised or the way you you were you were birthed
so you literally got missing neurotransmitters and because of this
something's going wrong you're not getting the kinds of levels
of happiness that you should from your life this is
clinical medical serious depression now the problem is that most
people like to think that they have that when in
fact that's not what they have what they actually have
is they have a much more milder version of depression
which is really a self-inflicted form of depression which comes
about from having bad psychology so the analogy they like
to use here is think of it like a computer
right you have a computer and you've got the computer
hardware and you've also got the computer software now if
you're having a problem with your computer that's running slow
you've got bugs and glitches and in a way that
it's working then you could have basically two fundamental types
of problems one is that you could have faulty equipment
inside the computer the hardware could be bugged out because
there's some bad circuitry in there so it's just defective
hardware the other type of problem you could have is
that you just have bad software there's a bug in
the software you've got a virus in the system or
something is corrupt there so the software is running in
correctly now with depression it's actually probably similar to what
it's like with the computer when you have a problem
if your computer rarely is the case that you've got
bad Hardware usually it's the software that's the problem you've
got a virus or something like that is going wrong
now it's similar with people who are depressed especially nowadays
right a lot of people are depressed nowadays we have
record numbers of depressed people and mostly is because of
the bad psychology that's happening here so if you feel
like you have real honest clinical depression I mean nothing
against that go see a doctor and get the medication
that you need for that you know get a diagnosis
but also be careful because a lot of times doctors
will like to medicate you when in fact what you've
got is you've got a software problem and that medicine
that you're getting is not going to solve a software
problem it will only work on a hardware problem and
if you have a hardware problem a software solution can
also be useful to you so don't ignore what I'm
saying to you here simply because it's a it's psychology
it's not just psychology psychology determines the whole quality of
your life so this is something that can be very
powerful for you even if you got this a problem
with the with your hardware so here's basically what I
want to tell you about depression I was thinking about
this because I'm noticing in my own life you know
I worked really hard on my own personal development and
one of the reasons I do that is because I'm
you know I'm wise to the problems that would happen
if I didn't do it you know one of the
reasons that I do personal development because this you know
it's it's exciting it's fun I get a lot of
like positive stuff from it but another reason why I
do it is kind of the flip side for negative
reasons because I know how awful my life would be
if I didn't do it and as I'm working on
myself as I'm taking lots of action in certain areas
in my life you know as I'm setting up my
business orab setting up my relationships or I'm setting up
my my career in my life purpose and I'm setting
up my health and fitness as I'm doing these things
and I'm really working hard to get good results there
I've also noticed thing and I'm wondering hmm what would
my life be like if I didn't do all that
work to create this this thing that I wanted in
my life what would happen if I was still 65
pounds overweight overweight the way that I was for most
of my life and I was growing up how would
I feel now what kind of problems would I have
in my life how would I feel about those problems
you know I wonder about that stuff a lot of
times you do personal development then you kind of you
take stuff for granted nowadays I take my weight for
grant and I take for granted the fact that I'm
I'm lean and I'm healthy and I also take for
granted some of the stuff that I learned about relationships
how to manage relationships and I take for granted for
example my money situation with my business because I was
working really hard to put that area of my life
into place so I wonder you know how would I
feel right now in my life if I didn't have
my business if I didn't have my life purpose if
I didn't have the stuff that I know about relationships
if I was still overweight if I didn't work on
my negative thinking a lot if I didn't work on
my people-pleasing a lot if I didn't meditate if I
didn't go to the gym if I didn't look after
my diet if I didn't work hard at my job
if I didn't pay my bills on time if I
wasn't uh handling my family situation in the right way
if I was hanging around with negative people if I
was living in a bad neighborhood if I was living
in a bad country you know what would my life
be like and I'm pretty sure that I can make
myself depressed it's hard for me to imagine now that
I can become depressed I'm not a naturally depressive person
but I can easily see how I could become that
way if I let myself go here's a little story
to help illustrate this I don't know where where I
got the idea for this I think it's like Aesop's
fables or something like that it's like an old children's
story right where they have they have squirrels right there
it was a story about like a squirrel and a
bird and the winter is coming right it's the summer
now the winter is coming and the squirrel he's smart
he knows that winter's coming there's not gonna be enough
food so he better run around and stash all those
acorns build himself a nice nest or a burrow that
he can that he can live in so that he
can weather out the harsh winter that's about to come
the bird or whoever else was the character in on
the other side of this of the story he was
like the carefree one he didn't care he didn't to
build the nest he didn't want to go work and
stash acorns or any other kind of provisions for himself
so he was just carefree and living in the moment
and then what happens of course winter finally comes and
the squirrel the squirrel is nice and happy sitting in
his little burrow with his squirrel family and he's got
all those acorn stashed up and he's got more acorns
than he could possibly need for the whole winter he's
got enough for two winters so even if this winter
ends up running extra-long he's still going to survive and
even if it's extra cold he made sure to make
his burrow extra comfy and extra warm so he's going
to survive just fine but that bird heard that bird
who was very carefree and didn't put stuff into place
in his life now he's kind of screwed he's kind
of screwed because winter has come and he doesn't have
a nest he's freezing there's no food anywhere he doesn't
know what to do he has no one to rely
on is just him out there in the cold and
if he's lucky he might survive and he just might
make it just uh traumatized but he might not be
so lucky he might actually that that situation might actually
kill him that winter might kill him and so that's
what I'm telling to you now if you're depressed because
you went through some bad family situations maybe you were
abused or maybe you lost a lot of money maybe
somebody scammed you somebody robbed you maybe you had some
serious medical conditions maybe you lost a limb maybe you
became paralyzed maybe you're depressed because you feel like you
aren't attracted to the opposite sex maybe you're depressed because
you feel like you can get into a good relationship
or you'll never find that person that you want to
fall in love with and get married with or maybe
you're depressed because you feel like you won't be able
to to earn the money that you need your father
struggling financially whatever you feel like you're stuck in what
I'm telling you is that you're like that bird and
the winter has come and now you're because you didn't
build up that stash of acorns that the squirrel built
up and so now you desperately need that stash of
acorns you desperately need it or food or whatever you
need that nest but you don't have it for whatever
reason and I'm not necessarily blaming you I'm not saying
that your situation was entirely avoidable so maybe you had
a death in the family maybe you had a you
know a string of bad luck or whatever happened made
you depressed and maybe not maybe you're just depressed because
you have no no purpose to your life or you're
depressed because you don't have the kind of friends you
want you know something a little bit more more ordinary
less serious whatever your situation is in the end the
problem is that winter now has come and you have
not built the psychological resources that you need to survive
and you're now stuck in this rut right you're stuck
in this rut because whatever situation you're in whether it's
lack of money or losing a loved one or not
being able to attract that mate that you want you
know whatever it's actually depressed that is not something that
necessarily has to keep you depressed there have been many
people in history who have gone through the same circumstances
that you're going through and even much worse and have
come out perfectly fine in fact they've used that to
build themselves up even stronger to become even happier to
learn valuable life lessons but see if you're depressed right
now and is feeling very hopeless then you feel like
a victim you feel like you don't have a lot
of options you can't change the stuff you feel like
it's permanent you feel like nothing will help you and
see what that is is it's not so much the
reality that's out there it's more about the mental rut
that you're in because now winter has come and technically
speaking this bird who's out in the cold and who
didn't provision himself for the winter he actually can still
survive the winter if he's smart if he mobilizes if
he starts to take action if he puts in the
hard work that's necessary so it's not hopeless for this
bird it's not hopeless it's simply that it's going to
be difficult it might be extremely difficult the place that
you're in right now to dig your way out and
to to move forward up to that happy place that
you want to be but that amazing that you want
that's still something that's on the table for you even
though winter has come so it's not hopeless but the
real problem is that right now you lack the psychological
resources necessary to actually go out there and seize it
so that's what I want to give you here today
I want to show you how to develop those psychological
resources because right now honestly the things that you're really
missing are you're missing motivation you're missing willpower you're missing
faith and you're missing confidence in yourself these are the
core things that you're missing that you're going to need
now to you it might sound like well Leo I
can't feed my family on motivation I can't improve my
my job and financial situation simply on faith and confidence
so you're telling me about all these kind of nice
abstract things motivation willpower faith and confidence but I need
something more more tangible more practical I need money I
need sex I need love I need a better health
or something like that stay with me here because what
I'm giving you is a little bit abstract but you'll
see that this is what's necessary to get all the
tangible stuff that you think you need and also you
might not need as much tangible stuff as you think
you do a lot of you what you just need
is you need a new way of seeing the world
because you've got filters on that's making the world seem
very depressing and when those filters are removed all of
a sudden the exact same world will look very very
different and no longer will it be depressing and to
do that to remove those filters to work on yourself
to do the hard work that's necessary you're going to
need that motivation you're going to need that willpower you're
going to need that faith you need that confidence because
right now your brain is tricking you and telling you
that you can't that you won't that you're stuck that
it's hopeless right and that's where a little bit of
that faith in that confidence to come in so the
winter is here for you and it might be a
very real winter it might not be an illusory winter
the fact that you're already depressed and you lack these
mental resources these psychological resources that in and of itself
is a winter because to me one of the scariest
things in life is not that I run out of
money although I worry about that sometimes or that I
don't have that relationship I want or that my friends
leave me or something like that for me the scarier
thing is that I lose my resourcefulness in order to
acquire that I lose my drive I lose my ability
to get myself mobilized to take action I lose my
purpose in life I'll lose my passion I lose my
ability to think critically independently so that's the scarier thing
and so because of that your depression is actually real
even though it might be illusory because you might feel
like you need something that you don't actually need or
that something happened to you in the past that you
feel like has really crippled you today but actually it
might not be crippling you but the fact that you
believe it is already enough and so you don't have
the mental resources and that is a big problem why
is it B problem because winter is here and you
need to go and you need to gather acorns you
need to eat otherwise you're going to starve but you
don't have the ability to go out there and mobilize
and the reason is is because you see that there's
emotional labor involved for you here emotional labor it means
that there's going to be pain struggle to get yourself
out of this deep deep hole that you're in and
that in and of itself can be depressing so you're
mentally weak now you feel like you're in this rut
and you feel like it's hopeless is from where you
are now to where you want to go or where
you need to go even maybe to reach kind of
a normal level not even an awesome level of life
but just kind of an average level you might it
might feel like you you have to work a lot
it might seem like you don't even see the light
at the end of the tunnel it's so far away
but this is my solution for you is that you
need to mobilize to fight that's the solution this is
how you handle a depression it might seem simple but
this is what it takes simply the desire to mobilize
to fight right now a mobilization needs to happen for
you right you can't run away from it anymore you
can't keep avoiding the emotional labor you can't keep procrastinating
it and hoping that somehow you can weasel your way
out of it because it's too late for that you
could have done that you could have prepared before when
it was summer you could have prepared when it was
fall you still could have prepared but now it's the
middle of winter it's ice cold you can't prepare anymore
now it's mobilization time now it's time to fight this
is the fight for your life that's what it is
and you need to realize that and you need to
accept it that's the problem is that you don't want
to accept it right now you don't accept the pain
I want to help you to accept it though see
mobilization is an interesting thing because human beings and other
organisms and other not just organisms but other cybernetic systems
a cybernetic system is any kind of complex system that
has internal feedback loops which allow it to adjust for
various situations that are happening in environment so a thermostat
is very simple cybernetic system but you know a computer
is a more complicated one and of course your your
human brain in your body is a is a very
complicated cybernetic system especially the cybernetic systems that have evolved
I'd have to have to go through a you know
a fitness process a survival the fittest process those organisms
they have developed resources to mobilize to take massive action
when necessary to fight when necessary that's what your fight
and flight response are for so if you get threatened
by a wild animal or a burglar in the night
on the side you're going to feel like you have
much more energy to act to fight to run right
because it's a life-and-death situation and your body always has
extra reserves that allow to mobilize to handle really dangerous
life-threatening situations well this is kind of the system that
you need to tap into right now and it's not
going to be for one day it might take you
six months it might take you 12 months it might
take you three years of this mobilizing in order to
conquer whatever demons you have whatever circumstances you have to
get out of this depression but you can do it
it's within you the problem is that you don't really
want to do it right and especially right now if
there's no dire emergency situation on your hands you can
feel very depressed but there's nothing that's really lighting a
fire under your ass there's no grizzly bear staring at
your face that's about tomorrow you which will get that
adrenaline pumping so it's a little bit tricky which is
why I'm shooting this video while I'm talking to you
but you can do kind of a self mobilization you
know it's interesting in World War two you can if
you're stood of history you've studied this that whenever there
is a major war in some country it's amazing at
how that country is able to mobilize resources to defend
itself so in World War two for example the United
States if you've ever watched one of those Discovery Channel
or History Channel documentaries you know that the United States
did a massive massive mobilization effort to produce like incredible
output of industry in order to help stop the Germans
and to to to prevent World War two from advancing
and this happened I believe in World War one as
well so what's going on here is for example the
United States started to create ships just like they created
production lines where they were literally creating giant ships for
for naval warfare and they were doing it as such
a ridiculous rate where they were like building a ship
a day like it was it was incredible how quickly
and how much they were building ships when you kind
of look at a nation during peacetime it seems like
you know the nation has certain problems you watch the
news there's political problems Democrats Republicans there they're always bickering
and fighting with each other they can't get anything passed
it takes them 10 years to pass a certain you
know health care reform or something like that but see
that's that's a country that's not motivated that's a lazy
country that's a country that has the luxury to do
this kind of bickering and nonsense that's kind of the
luxury that we have actually is the United States we
can we can just kind of sit back and argue
about silly stuff but when push comes to shove and
there's like a war going on like a really serious
war I'm not talking about little war like the war
in Iraq that's not a really threatening war to the
United States but I talk about a serious war like
World War two where the you select United say it's
might've felt like they were actually threatened there was actually
an attack on Hawaii with Pearl Harbor etc so there's
a real you know more serious threat there that if
if Germany took over Europe then you'd the US was
next on there kind of hit list so they're like
fight and flight response starts to kick in adrenaline starts
kicking and when that kicks in is like BAM we
can produce ships by you know by the ton so
many ships we don't even know what to do with
them it's interesting on that works so what I'm proposing
is that you're capable of this exact same thing you're
also capable of this but you need to mobilize yourself
you need to get yourself ready to endure the pain
because there's pain ahead but you got to endure it
see right now you're think of yourself I don't want
to endure this pain I don't want to endure all
the change I have to do and you know the
stuff you got to do but you don't want to
do it the reason that is is because of course
you would rather postpone it you'd rather procrastinate it another
day another week a month a year but the more
and more you do that the deeper and deeper you
sink into this depression the less capable you become so
that's a dangerous game that you're playing it if you
play for too long you might really really get yourself
into a very very deep hole that maybe you won't
even be able to dig yourself out of so to
prevent that from happening what I want to do here
is I want to help you right now to mobilize
to deal with this pain to accept it and to
take it on as a challenge that's what it's going
to take so whatever your challenge is right now think
of it in your head money relationships how you feel
about yourself whatever it is I want you to draw
a line in the sand we're drawing a line in
the sand right now right here you and me right
we're doing this for you we're drawing a line in
the sand and once we draw that line in the
sand you're going to step over that line and you're
not going to come back by stepping over this line
what you're saying to yourself is that you are mobilized
that you are willing to take on the pain the
emotional labor that's going to go into that you know
what I mean by emotional labor right emotional labor is
all that work that you're gonna have to do that's
not going to feel very good in order to really
build yourself up so when that squirrel was running around
worrying about the winter gathering all those acorns doing all
that hard lifting and pushing and collecting and storing that
was emotional labor for him now you're gonna have to
do that are you ready alright I want you to
draw a line in the sand and I want you
to say this with me I am a force I'm
a force to be reckoned with and I have resources
within me that I can't even consciously tap right now
but I know that they're in there and I'm going
to tap into it now because this depression that I've
been under this this this way that my life is
and going this what that I've been in no more
of that I don't want to do that anymore that's
too painful in fact that's more painful than if I
just accept the pain and take on the challenge of
mobilizing myself to fix this and I'm going to fix
it through brute force I'm going to brute force it
there's not going to be any weasely little solutions I'm
not going to wait for some magic to happen or
the perfect time to come next year for me to
do whatever I need to do to lose that weight
or to fix my health or to get that relationship
handled or to get the money situation handled now now
through brute force it's going to happen now through massive
action it's going to happen and I will do anything
to make it happen absolutely anything I'm willing to do
what does it take tell me what it takes I'm
going to do it what does it mean does that
mean that I have to go to the gym every
single day for two hours I will do it does
it mean I need to move to a different city
a different state a different country I will do it
does it mean I need to go find a new
job maybe I need to find three new jobs I
will do it does that need to I need to
break off this relationship and get a divorce I will
do it what does it take tell me what it
takes I'm willing to do anything absolutely anything I will
literally work myself dead before I surrender and I'm stepping
over the line the mindset you need to have to
mobilize this is how you mobilize yourself even though I've
never been depressed there have been times in my life
where I felt very down about my prospects about my
future and there have been times in my life where
I had to mobilize like this right I knew for
example that my weight I was overweight my whole life
I knew that that was something I needed to really
mobilize myself for because there was no way I'm going
to break all those decades of bad habits without this
kind of intense mobilization so I did I I did
exactly that with my weight and that really worked for
me another area in my life where I really mobilized
hard was when I started my business really hard hard
hard mobilization to do that because that was also kind
of a do-or-die situation I knew that if I was
going to find my life purpose if I was going
to do what I really loved to do I would
need to become financially independent and to do that I
have to go embark on a brand new journey of
entrepreneurship that I didn't have any ideas about how to
manage I didn't know if I was going to be
successful I had a lot of doubts and so I
just had to brute-force my way through that and also
with my relationship side to really brute force my way
through that because I was so bad with relationships that
I literally thought that if I didn't mobilize myself right
here and right now that I would die lonely without
ever getting to a relationship with anybody I was that
bad and I was that not depressed but uh you
know I I knew I had a crystal clear picture
of what was going to happen if I just continued
on my current track so you need to surrender yourself
here not surrender your life what I'm talking about is
surrender to the emotional labor there's work involved you probably
know how much work is ahead for example I knew
how much work was ahead I need to lose a
lot of weight but I surrendered myself to that after
mobilizing what nice is that when you accept the challenge
when you accept the pain you so you don't it
I'm just going to do whatever it takes literally anything
I'll do and then that's not just words but you
actually go out and have followed up with action you
actually realize that you don't need the end result right
now to feel happy you don't need to wait a
year to lose all that weight you don't need to
wait two years to fix your money problems just by
starting to mobilize it to take that massive action already
you're going to start to feel a lot of relief
you're going to start to feel better than you felt
in a long long time because you've surrendered to the
emotional labor and that's really what you're resisting right now
you're trying to weasel your way out of it I
know it I do it too we all do it
nobody wants to go head-on and collide with a lot
of pain a lot of work a lot of emotional
labor nobody likes to do that but here's the truth
is that you're stuck right now and if you don't
take this option then you might not have any other
options left so you're stuck now because you've been avoiding
this labor you've been avoiding it you've been putting it
off been procrastinating you didn't want the pain all the
fears that you have about all the things that could
go wrong how uncomfortable it's going to feel how much
pain there's going to be how much suffering there's going
to be in there for you if you keep giving
in to those fears if you keep taking them seriously
if you don't surrender to them then you're going to
stay stuck and I'm honestly not optimistic for you because
most people when they're not situation they stay stuck if
I had to put my money on it I would
always always always bet that you're not going to mobilize
every time I would bet that you're not because you
people will it takes inner strength inner resolve something has
to click in you I hope something clicks on you
now because if something doesn't clicking you now you're staying
stuck and the more you avoided the deeper it's going
to it's going to get it's the only going to
get worse so the solution is to bite the bullet
you simply have to bite the bullet right now surrender
to whatever you have to do to whatever it takes
and you're going to see that this is the way
it's actually not going to be depressing for you to
do this surrender what's depressing for you now is that
you don't have any options once you do the surrender
and once you tell yourself that you're doing anything whatever
it takes you're no longer depressed because you're taking action
you're moving forward it's not hopeless if you tell yourself
that you'll do anything it takes you're going to find
a way maybe it's going to be a long tortuous
inconvenient way but you'll find a way but if you're
telling yourself well I'm going to wait for a good
way to reveal itself to me you might be waiting
for the rest of your life so we can't say
anything about that that's why this mobilisation is powerful it's
because when you're back into a corner and your life
is at stake then your body summons hidden inner resources
that you didn't even know you had that allow you
to overcome amazing obstacles and in the end you overcoming
those obstacles are gonna that's going to be one of
the one of the most rewarding and and powerful experiences
of your life you're going to look back on it
five ten twenty years from now I didn't say wow
that was amazing that I had the strength to mobilize
what I did and that after mobilizing I stayed with
it I kept with it I stayed with my word
I stayed true to the fact that I would do
anything and through that and only through that I broke
out and if I didn't mobilize then I would have
been stuck and maybe even twenty years thirty years would
have passed and I would have still stayed stuck and
how miserable would that be how big about a waste
of life would that be you would definitely regret doing
that if you or your future wiser self so try
to take on that wisdom right now mobilize yourself right
now bite the bullet right now surrender to the pain
right now and you will start to move ahead you're
going to feel much better because you're going to open
up a whole world of possibilities for you all right
this is Leo that's what I have to say about
how I would deal with depression if it wasn't the
hardcore clinical medical kind and even if it was that
kind I would still take on a psychological approach in
addition to the medication I would have get because your
psychology is a lot more powerful than you think it
