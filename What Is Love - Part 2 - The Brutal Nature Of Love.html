[Music] what is love part 2 warning this is gonna
be an advanced episode there need to be things that
I need to say here about love which are going
to be very controversial and which are gonna offend many
people including maybe yourself and that's as it must be
because the topic of love is a very radical one
and it's very tricky to teach and it's very easy
to misunderstand the things I'm gonna say here and to
abuse them to use them towards various selfish ends so
just be very careful and make sure you go watch
what is love part 1 because there we lay a
very nice foundation for what love is that I'm not
gonna rehash all over again here I assume that you
understand that stuff we're going to the next level we're
going even deeper I want to tell you a story
one time about four years ago I was at an
Enlightenment intensive retreat this was a very isolated retreat in
Canada where it was me and maybe 20 or 30
other people it was about ten days long and we
were there we were going balls to the wall self
inquiry and towards awakening and we were working at it
as a group and we were going at it like
14 hours a day just completely devoted to that for
10 days straight it was very very intense I did
not have an awakening but I learned a lot during
that period and one of the things I learned that
still stays with me today is the leader of the
retreat he's he's kind of old and he's been doing
these retreats for four decades and so he has a
lot of experience guiding many many people towards awakening and
one time some Buddhists came to him and they said
we'd like to participate in your retreat and so he
was of course open he's a very loving guy and
he accepted them and he tried to guide them and
they were there they were pushing towards awakening using his
process and and one of the Buddhist women she was
like a Buddhist monk I guess I I think they
were like from the east not Western Buddhists Eastern Buddhists
and towards the end of the retreat she actually had
her awakening the problem was though that her notion of
what awakening was was the very strict sort of awakening
that is taught in Buddhism this sort of nothingness and
void but what she had here during this retreat is
she had an awakening into the nature of love the
existential nature of love but because she had this Buddhist
Dogma in her mind that there can't be love it
has to be nothingness has to be emptiness otherwise it's
not the truth so she argued with the facilitator who
was trying to convince her that no you're having a
legitimate awakening into the nature of love this is a
beautiful thing except it embraces this is why you're here
but she couldn't accept it because she had this one-track
idea of what enlightenment should be this very narrow-minded idea
and from that point on he said that I can't
allow dogmatic Buddhists to come to my retreats anymore and
you know these Buddhists they actually wanted to get up
and to teach a little bit at his retreats as
well and he can't allow it any more because because
they're too dogmatic so the point of this is be
careful be careful with Buddhism be careful with things like
neo-advaita where you can get stuck in a very sort
of a narrow formulation of what Awakening is you can
read books and scriptures and so forth and you can
you can even take quotes for masters but the way
that you take it you take it partially you cherry-pick
stuff to fit your idea of what awakening should be
and in many of these paths they don't properly teach
you what love is that's my point and one thing
you're gonna notice for me with my teachings going forward
is that I'm going to be emphasizing the existential aspects
of love in my teachings going forward and sometimes people
criticize me for this as though somehow this is a
shouldn't of the teaching no no this is not a
corruption of the teaching this is this is central to
the teaching this is a deepening of the teaching is
what you need to understand so just watch out for
that be careful there's a lot more dimensions to awakening
than people think learning how to love is your primary
task as a human being and this is not some
airy-fairy new-agey thing this is the very heart of the
path this is not a distraction from the path this
is the path love is not an emotion the way
that culture has taught you to think love is truth
love is an existential thing love is equivalent to being
to nothingness to everything to consciousness to freedom to infinity
to God to self to no self to creation to
the absolute love is a distinct aspect of awakening and
you may have an awakening here or there but that
doesn't necessarily mean that you are conscious of what love
is that you're conscious that love and truth are identical
for this you need to go even deeper and you
also need to go broader sometimes people go deep with
awakening but it's too narrow so don't assume that just
because you've had an awakening once or twice that you've
gotten to the end of it and that you've awoken
to what love is you probably have it in my
episode what is truth I talk about truth as sort
of working on two different levels there's first-order truth the
truth of being itself and there's second-order truth with just
linguistic or symbolic truth which is often confused with first-order
truth well the same thing applies here to love there's
first-order love and there second-order love and it parallels to
what goes on with truth so usually when we talk
about love and the reason people get so confused about
you know Leo how can you talk about love what
what does love have to do with reality and so
forth isn't love just something humans do they're confusing second-order
love with first-order so usually when we're talking about love
in our culture in common parlance we're talking about second-order
love like loving activities or loving emotions or feelings or
being in a loving mood or being in a loving
state this isn't really what love is about this is
a second-order thing first-order love is the actual being or
substance or the consciousness of which everything is made and
I was thinking about how to communicate this and I
came up with a pretty pretty nice example before you
hear that i'ma show you an image of which is
with Lego bricks LEGO bricks are great example of first
versus second order so the first order of a Lego
brick or of Lego as an activity is the bricks
themselves you see without the bricks you have no lego
activities at all the bricks are the foundation there are
the atoms the molecules that make everything up and then
out of these bricks you can make all sorts of
creations now here's the here's the interesting thing so if
we take the Lego brick itself as the first order
the most fundamental level anything that you make out of
Legos will include that first level by definition because this
is if it's man of Legos it has to be
matter of those bricks and then what we make now
that is variable that can change a lot we can
make something beautiful or we can make something something ugly
you see we can make a castle we can make
a pirate ship or whatever that would be the second
order that's the thing you make out of the bricks
so what would happen though if we used Lego bricks
to construct a large Lego brick see now we're getting
into this sort of interesting strange loop territory where we
have us whoa all self-reflection we're using Lego bricks to
now create a larger second order structure which now resembles
itself a Lego brick and we what we can say
here is we can say if we're able to make
a large construction which resembles the actual little bricks of
which the big construction is made now we can say
that there's sort of a parallel or a reflection between
the second order and the first order and we can
ask the question how well does the second order reflect
the first order so if we make a large Lego
brick out of individual Lego bricks we would say that
now we're sort of being true at the second order
level to what a Lego brick actually is because if
we build a castle on the second order you know
a castle doesn't reflect as accurately what a Lego brick
actually is a castle is sort of like an illusion
that draws our attention to the shape of the castle
making us forget that it's actually a matter of bricks
whereas if we make a giant brick out of Lego
bricks then our mind is drawn to the fact that
oh it's all mad of brick so what does this
have to do with love well there's a direct parallel
here so when we talk about the love that we
feel for a romantic partner or for our children or
for some food that we love or whatever this is
second order love first order love is the actual building
blocks of reality itself the consciousness out of which you
experience the full range of emotions just like with these
Lego bricks so what needs to happen here and what
I'm going to be trying to get you to see
is we're going from the second order on which your
mind is stuck you know that sort of Valentine's Day
notion of love we need to go beneath that to
the existential to the metaphysical level of love to the
first order and at this first order here's where it's
a little bit counterintuitive and tricky is that even when
someone is hating you when someone is angry when someone's
in a bad mood when someone is depressed even that
still counts as love because it's still man of consciousness
and that's what love is is it's consciousness at the
first order and then whether or not we act in
a lovey-dovey manner whether I kiss you or not whether
I hug you or not whether I'm nice to you
or not this is the second order stuff you see
you need to be able to see that even if
I'm not nice to you that's still an expression of
love is that clear and the most important thing here
is not to be acting lovingly in your life that's
a second-order thing I don't really care whether you're acting
lovey-dovey all the time 24/7 in fact it's unrealistic that's
a improper expectation this is a foolish notion of love
I'm trying to get you down to to a grounded
version of love and for that what needs to happen
is you got to go to the first-order level you
got to have an insight into what love is that's
far more important than it is to act lovingly now
of course we're also gonna work on you acting more
lovingly too that is important because we want the second
order to reflect the first order in the same way
that when we're speaking words we want our words to
reflect truth but also we got to understand that truth
at the level of words is only second order truth
there's something even more important than that which is the
truth that grounds all of existence again consciousness see so
in order for us to actualize love at the second
order level first is required understanding and consciousness of the
first order level of love and then we can work
on getting them to reflect each other we really need
to work to get over this notion of feminine love
which is how most people conceive of love in our
society this is a sort of sweet sappy version of
love we're here if you're loving then you're nice to
people you're kind to people maybe you're even a dorm
a doormat you let people walk all over you do
whatever they want with you you're happy all the time
you're smiling you're positive you're maybe even passive and submissive
these are things we associate with with love so sort
of think of your stereotypical image of what love would
look like on a movie screen like if a movie
director wanted to demonstrate that two people are in love
what would what would they show that but see that
that's a stereotype don't get lost in that that's very
easy to see that version of love what's much more
harder is to appreciate the masculine dimension of love masculine
love can be ruthless and it can be brutal I
want you to start to recognize that there's love in
violence in war in terrorism and in the entire process
of survival for example cutting off a bad relationship this
might seem like a harsh move but that's an example
of love or it can be or telling the brutal
truth to a friend like your friend is [ __
] up in his life and you normally you'd want
to be nice and you want a tiptoe around the
issue but then there's a certain kind of love can
you see that there's a certain kind of love that
comes from just being brutally honest with your friend and
telling him exactly what he needs to hear cuz that
could save his life that could get him back on
track that could awaken him out of his rut we're
doing something stupid or the love that's required to confront
a bully that takes love or and sort of a
very extreme example the love required to shoot your mother
if she turns into a zombie think of that kind
of love and in fact on this topic I'm reminded
of a brilliant scene a great scene from the movie
with Will Smith I am Legend have you seen that
movie it's a zombie movie there's a great scene in
that movie towards the very end where you know throughout
the whole movie he has this his he's all alone
basically it's a very sort of solitary movie he doesn't
have any friends or family everything but he has his
dog who's with him the whole time but then in
the very end of the movie spoiler alert the dog
gets bitten by some zombies and then the dog of
course is now slowly turning into a zombie so Will
Smith you know rushes the dog to some medical center
and he's like in this abandoned medical bunker that has
medicine and stuff and he keno he injects the dog
full of this medicine thing that this will hoping that
this will you know cure the dog and it still
hasn't hit him that the dog is gonna become a
zombie because like you know this is his only companion
he's like the last man alive and this is his
dog and he's sitting there and the dog is kind
of like wounded and crying and he's holding this dog
in his hands and as he's holding that dog you
know kind of like cuddling it it's starting to turn
into a zombie like right in front of his eyes
and right in that moment he he realizes what he
has to do he has to kill the dog he
has to kill his own dog right his best friend
and and it's it's like a very powerful couple of
minutes scene where he's holding that dog and he has
to choke it and strangle it the camera actually kind
of like pans a little bit off to the side
it has his face it has Will Smith's face he
can't actually look down at the dog as he's killing
the dog has to look away as he's doing it
he can't watch himself do it but the cameras on
his face as he's doing and it's showing the agony
that he's going through doing that and it what it
really shows there is the brutality of love what he's
doing there is an act of love and it's that
dimension of love which which is so easily lost on
people because this is the kind of love that's too
real it's too raw for the ego to accept we
want a sweet sappy kind of love we want happy
love and if you want I'm going to post actually
a clip of this Will Smith scene I'll post it
on my blog so if you want to check it
out you can find on my blog I'll link to
it it's a powerful scene and what that leads us
to is the topic of the gravity of love the
gravity of reality because see love and reality are the
same thing love and truth are the same thing we're
talking about all of reality when we're talking about love
we're not talking about some narrow aspect of reality the
happy good stuff no we're talking about the entire thing
now this is love with a capital L here absolute
love not relative love absolute is the first order relative
is the second order so what I want you to
understand is that there's a terrifying quality to reality which
is the sheer brutality and scope of it it's infinite
scope but most people don't understand that infinite scope is
what creates this brutality most people most egos they just
think like all well there's evil stuff happening in the
world there's bad people there's bad guys you know like
the rapists and murderers and terrorists and Nazis and so
forth they're just the bad guys let's just get rid
of all them and then life will be peachy but
this is this is a cartoonish childís version of of
what reality is and how love works right it's it's
really a form of denial or it's it's a lack
of perspective and a lack of consciousness when your perspective
widens and expands radically and also it elevates its perspective
and you sort of look down upon reality as a
whole you look at it holistically from a very big
picture perspective you start to realize that all of this
brutality that goes on war genocide rape slavery and all
of this nasty stuff that we usually demonize that all
of this is actually inherent to the infinity of what
truth and what reality are what consciousness is so what's
really going on at the existential level is that consciousness
which is the only thing that exists you are conscious
right now this consciousness here is running into all different
aspects of itself and some of these aspects are so
brutal and so stark and so shocking that consciousness recoils
in horror at its own self reflection and it has
to deny that this is a reflection of itself it's
sort of like imagine being so ugly that when you
look in a mirror you can't even admit to yourself
that that's you in the mirror you have to tell
yourself that look at that ugly monster in the mirror
and you spend your whole life calling that this ugly
monster without ever admitting to yourself that that's actually you
that's what you are so the same thing is going
on with you not with your physical appearance I hope
but I mean with reality as a whole there is
this seriousness to consciousness which we don't want to admit
because we want to sort of pretend that life is
happy and sweet and we try to construct our life
this way we construct our social institutions to be nice
and kind there's this veneer of politeness and etiquette and
all this but underneath that is this brutality which is
always potentially there and this is something that of course
is extremely threatening to the ego so it's understandable why
you'd want to deny it I'm not blaming you for
this I'm just getting you trying to get you to
start to realize what you're doing there's also something that
makes consciousness very stark and that is the relentless impermanence
of all form all form changes and in the abstract
that sounds like okay yeah that's okay leo so what
but it's not so what this this this notion of
impermanence is absolutely central to understanding reality love and and
where evil comes from see most people they just they
just call things evil without questioning and theme deeply about
what that evil really is and why it's there why
it's there is to a large extent because of the
impermanence see because consciousness is so impertinent a constant state
of change which of course is very threatening because you
as a living being you need to cling to something
you need to cling to your identity you need to
cling to your house your shelter your family your identity
your nation your company your money your bank account you
got to cling to to something to ground you within
this reality but the but the truth of what consciousness
is that it's totally impermanent and everything you cling to
is going to eventually slip through your fingertips like sand
see this is not a mistake this is actually a
feature of what existence is it's not a bug the
mistake is trying to make the impermanent permanent this is
where you get dysfunction and neurosis as a part of
spirituality is is coming face to face with impermanence and
accepting it which of course is all about accepting your
own death in the very end that's ultimately what it
boils down to see so like in this example of
Will Smith with his dog what was that if you
really zoom out and look at what that was that
was an example of the relentlessness and the ruthlessness of
impermanence you know he wanted that dog to remain being
his his loyal friend the way it's been for for
for decades keeping him company and all of that he
wanted that so he wanted to lock that in he
want to make that permanent but then of course you
know life unfolds there are zombies and things and then
you know they'll bite your dog and so when you
get attached to your dog being your dog and not
being a zombie then that's where the suffering comes from
and then you ask yourself or you even ask God
like God why did you create these zombies who bit
my dog you know what kind of cruel existence is
this and gods reply to you is impermanence recognize impermanence
this is what consciousness is it's impermanence so real love
absolute love is raw it's severe it's grave it's bittersweet
it's uncompromising it's sober it's stark it's serious it's brutal
its pensive its melancholic its relentless its radical and this
is what gets people so confused about the topic of
love they can't understand how if everything is love then
how come we have all this crap going on in
the world see but what's really happening is that you're
confusing your own egos needs and fears which is distorting
your picture of reality and you're not seeing the love
precisely because you're attached to being some particular way you
need love to be conditional and so when you experience
unconditional love you misinterpret it in your mind actually as
hate and as evil and the very notion that unconditional
love is love revolts you or at least it does
most people and what I'm telling you is that your
job as a human being this is really your only
job in life is to learn to embrace love as
an absolute unconditionally not on your terms not in a
way which would suit and please your ego or your
survival but in its actuality to embrace reality as it
is warts and all that's the hardest thing to do
for a finite being to learn to love all aspects
of yourself that's very hard to do because of the
magnitude of what consciousness is infinite consciousness is terrifying because
it includes possibilities which are threatening to any finite form
but that's what love is love is infinite consciousness love
is not some part of reality love is the whole
thing with no exceptions this makes love twisted and very
counterintuitive where things that don't seem like they're love actually
are but you need to take into account the massive
distortion that the lens of the personal ego self creates
that distortion that creates an inability to truly see the
love that is all around you at all times because
you're so stuck in survival mode your mind is always
looking for advantages and looking for ways to survive and
the way you do that is you actually you have
created a sort of egoic form of conditional love this
is the sappy sort of sweet happy love that you've
invented to make yourself feel good which is a survival
mechanism you use that conditional love to manipulate reality to
get what you want to survive and here I will
refer you to my two-part series understanding survival so very
important for understanding what I'm talking about here my notion
of survival is much much broader than you think or
that you understand that in fact in general what I
noticed that even those of you who've watched those two
episodes you still have a very poor understanding of what
survivalists survival is such an important idea and yet all
but almost nobody under really understands it so go back
and watch it again contemplate what survival is there's an
uncompromising aspect to reality which actually many materialists misinterpret as
evidence of the fact that there couldn't be a god
or the fact that reality is just totally indifferent doesn't
give a [ __ ] about us but actually that
that's a misinterpretation of of what love is you know
people say Leo what love are you talking about when
there's war and genocide and all this but it's exactly
the opposite of that they seem that uncompromising aspect to
reality this is God refusing to soften reality to make
it convenient for your ego and why is that why
doesn't God just suit reality to fit you perfectly so
that you're living in a paradise because life needs to
work not just for you but for an infinite number
of beings see you're so stuck thinking about how to
make life good for you that you forget about the
entire universe if God behaved that way the universe would
be he'll see God on the other hand needs to
take the biggest picture possible and to take into account
all possible living beings what's good for everyone what's good
for the universe as a whole which means that sometimes
things are not going to go necessarily the best for
you individually because you you have to recognize are just
a tiny tiny portion of a larger whole and you
need to accept where you fit into the grand scheme
of things which of course the ego doesn't want to
do because the ego is arrogant by definition the ego
wants the entire universe to all revolve around it and
therein lies the whole problem see it's not just about
you so while you're complaining about war you might say
well but leo but but you know my country got
bombed so it's not about me it's about my country
but still your country is still you it's still even
thinking of reality in terms of countries or even thinking
about reality in terms of the entire earth like you
might wonder well Leo if an asteroid comes and hits
the earth tomorrow and kills everybody the same way it
did supposedly 65 million years ago with the dinosaurs you
know how's that for the greatest good of the universe
but you have to understand that you're looking at it
from such a narrow perspective you're looking at it from
the perspective of earth earth is like one out of
trillions and trillions of planets and even all that is
just still one tiny speck in the larger scheme of
things see so you got to be very careful not
to get caught up in your own little personal agenda
it's very important to to consider the big picture perspective
here and that's where we're going to be working on
in this episode the most with some examples so before
we get to the examples I want to introduce two
two laws of the universe for you the first law
of the universe is that everything that happens in the
universe happens to maximize love sounds kind of hokey and
you might wonder well Leo can you prove it how
do you prove something like this this sounds kind of
like a fairy tale but you can become conscious that
everything that happens in the universe happens to maximize love
the movement of every single molecule is there to maximize
love but you need to be able to zoom out
far enough to see it so a corollary of this
universal law is that if something is happening and you
can't see the love in it what that means is
that your perspective isn't wide enough if you don't have
enough elevation so you need to broaden and zoom all
the way out and look at that situation from an
even higher elevation until you're able to realize that that
is playing into the maximization of love in the long-term
in the evolution of the universe and and you might
say well Leo isn't this a tautology seems like anything
that happens then must be love by definition by the
way that you're defining your terms and that's exactly right
truth is a tautology love is a tautology the absolute
is a tautology which means that it's absolute it can't
be otherwise and then the second universal law is that
everyone is doing good from their point of view given
their worldview and given their life situation and circumstances everyone
with no exceptions so that means another corollary here to
this one is that if you see someone who you
think is doing evil it is a bad person what
you're not understanding is that from their point of view
given their worldview in their circumstances they're actually a good
person and they're acting in the name of love no
matter how twisted their actions might be and it can
get quite twisted they're still acting from love it's just
that of course people can get very deluded they can
trick themselves consciousness can get lost in itself it can
get very contracted and very egotistical but it's still fundamentally
acting from love no matter what it's doing or how
its acting so these are some pretty radical claims that
I'm making here so let's let's go into some detail
and explore some examples to help to illustrate this so
let's start off with a sort of easy one which
is a lion hunting and antelope on the savanna in
Africa how is this love and here I want to
encourage you to actually pause the video and think about
it before I give you my answers so pause right
now and ask yourself how is a lion hunting an
antelope how's this love how does this contribute to the
overall love of the entire universe and of course this
is survival 101 you have to understand that survival is
not the opposite of love survival is absolutely essential because
without survival nothing can exist you can't have life without
survival you can't have life without death you need to
be able to see how death is utterly absolutely essential
for there to be life so all the things that
you enjoy you know video games and sex and good
food and nice vacations and beautiful sunsets and this and
all of that the only way that that's possible is
through death you cannot have any of that without death
so how do we prove this well it's just very
simple common sense logic here look the only way that
you can see a beautiful sunset and go on some
beautiful vacation or honeymoon somewhere to to some tropical island
or see some beautiful sunset is first you have to
be alive as an organism as it as a mammal
how do we get mammals well you can't have mammals
unless you have animals hunting other animals like a lion
hunting an antelope there could not be mankind there could
not be human civilization without the hunting of animals our
ancestors couldn't have survived otherwise now some vegan might come
in here say all leo but but you know we
could transition all of mankind to eating soy and tofu
and you know these these new technologies we can grow
meat the lab so we don't even need to kill
animals yes that's possible in the future we will have
to evolve to that and notice it's going to be
a very challenging evolution it's gonna take us hundreds of
years maybe even thousands of years from today from the
21st century to evolve at that point but realize that
we could only get to that point because there have
been literally hundreds of thousands of years and even millions
of years of evolution prior to that which has gotten
us to where we are here today see even if
you're a vegan right now you still have to admit
that you probably weren't a vegan for your whole life
you probably started out eating meat that's because that's how
your parents ate that's how your grandparents ate and really
veganism is just a luxury of modern times modern technology
it wasn't possible in the past like if your ancestors
lived in the north somewhere in Siberia or in Alaska
they couldn't survive on vegetables you need animal protein animal
fat to survive up there you're not gonna have enough
calories otherwise see this lion is that the Lions fault
that he needs to eat antelopes of course not this
is part of reality so as brutal as it is
hunting down an antelope and then biting its neck and
having it bleed to death you might say well that
that's horrible you know from the antelopes point of view
this is so terrible what's where's the love in it
only some sort of cruel God would invent a this
sort of scenario when you think this way you're thinking
very myopic Lee you need to zoom out and see
the beauty of it in fact you can see the
beauty of a lion hunting antelope in fact if you
watch videos of it on you know on the BBC
or something there are some beautiful documentaries about it and
antelopes are beautiful creatures and lions are beautiful creatures and
you know how that antelope got to be so beautiful
through millions of years of natural selection you know how
that line got so beautiful through millions of years of
natural selection that means that thousands of lions had to
die because they were not good enough to hunt the
antelopes and thousands of antelopes have to die because they
were not good enough to run away from the lions
or they didn't have the right camouflage on their fur
or their their legs weren't skinny enough or their horns
weren't good enough for Farina they weren't sharp enough to
to fight off the lion or whatever and all of
that has led to this beautiful antelope that now exists
and this beautiful line that now exists see but usually
you don't think about any of this and of course
from the antelopes point of view does the Antelope care
about any of this does it know is it conscious
of any of this is it conscious of millions of
years of evolution that went into making it of course
not the only thing the Antelope cares about in its
selfishness is how to run away from the lion and
of course you can't blame the Antelope for this it
wants to live it loves life you see so what
I want you to see with this example is that
love love is moving through the entire dynamic of life
all dynamics of life not just in the sense that
all the Antelope loves life yes it loves life but
the lion also loves life the lion loves its its
cubs and it's you know it's got to raise its
cubs and then all the natural selection that happens to
create this beautiful creature called an antelope or a lion
and then from that you know humans and then we
humans we also had to hunt antelopes or some other
animals and you see the love that went into that
and then it's that love that then leads to the
evolution of the human nervous system that human nervous system
is then what's allowing you to look at a beautiful
sunset when you're on your honeymoon to Hawaii or somewhere
and you see that beautiful sunset why are you seeing
that beautiful sunset and you able to appreciate it it's
only because of the millions of years of natural selection
and evolution that went into evolving your nervous system that
now you can appreciate the love you see start to
see the interconnectedness of all this this is this is
absolutely crucial this is what this whole episode is about
another great example is with tyrants you know when we're
young we're taught history and we're taught about tyrants and
dictators throughout history people like Stalin and Hitler and Saddam
Hussein and various Roman emperors and and so forth maybe
Genghis Khan and then in the history books like the
way we're taught it it's so simplistic he's like oh
well that person is a tyrant he was evil then
he was overthrown through some revolution and then there was
democracy and everybody was happy and yeah and then there
was love and peace but the tyrant wasn't acting out
of love or was he or was he what I
want to convince you of is that all tyrants act
out of love and for this I recommend you actually
go and you read some in-depth biographies about Saddam Hussein
about Hitler about Stalin about Mao Genghis Khan read about
their childhoods read about where they came from read about
their motivations what they wanted to accomplish read about their
philosophy think about life from their point of view see
the problem is that when we already have an advanced
democracy like in the United States or in Western Europe
it's very easy to look back a thousand years or
look towards the Middle East for example it said I
was saying you know you can look back into the
Middle East recently and you could say well but you
know he didn't need to be a tyrant yes he
did yes he did the function he was serving in
the Middle East in Iraq rallying together a smile dynamic
stage purple society where there were tribes that were at
each other's throats someone like Saddam Hussein was necessary some
of that ruthless was necessary to unify the people and
to create a peace now of course he was vicious
and bloodthirsty and he was excessive and he was egotistical
and his sons were we could say monsters and all
this yes of course but also you have to see
the bigger picture of it's like look at the look
at the environment that his sons grew up in look
at the environment in which he grew up and I
actually I have a biography on my book list about
said I'm saying it's very fascinating I loved reading that
biography it goes in depth into where Saddam Hussein came
from like his childhood what tribe he came from like
grew up in a rural part of the of the
country he was he was bullied when he was young
you know he had to stand up for himself and
just just to survive his childhood he had to stand
up for himself against bullies and so forth you know
a vicious environment most of us today can't imagine this
kind of viciousness this kind of environment when we're living
in such a nice part of the world you know
if you grew up in some suburb in America you
can't appreciate any of this you take all of that
for granted so then when you see a tyrant you're
like oh well he's just evil he's not just evil
he's fulfilling a necessary function in that society and of
course when his function is complete then he'll get overthrown
but until then he's necessary and in fact you see
the function that Saddam Hussein was filling in Iraq very
clearly after the United States came in there and then
overthrew his government you see the chaos that resulted from
that and how many hundreds of thousands of lives have
been lost by the overthrow Saddam Hussein but see but
most people don't realize that they don't think this way
they think that all well if we just overthrow Assad
who sane then some nice guy will come to power
and he will just be nice to people and and
people be nice to him no they won't they're at
such a low level of development and evolution that you
need a someone like a dictator to unify those tribes
the Sunnis and Shiites and you know they can't get
along with each other now it doesn't mean it has
to be that way in the future forever it just
means that that's where they're at right now so tyranny
is not an example of how there is no love
in the universe it's exactly the opposite tyranny is the
critical example which demonstrates the love of the universe see
but you just need a very wide perspective to see
it you need to realize how counterintuitive love can be
it doesn't always manifest itself in this sweet lovey-dovey sort
of version of love that you want if what you
expect is you expect a valentine's day notion of love
then yeah when you look upon the universe you will
you will of course say that well leo of course
there's no love in the universe of course not right
because your picture of love is wrong change your picture
of love how about us Imperial imperialism and the military-industrial
complex people love to demonize this and they say well
how how is this an example of love but it
is everything is an example of love so of course
it is so let's think about this you can pause
the video and ask yourself how is US imperialism and
the military industrial complex an example of love well these
large military companies in the United States they employ tens
of thousands even hundreds of thousands of people a lot
of these people they're not fat-cat ceos of course some
of them are but the majorities people are just you
know hardworking people they don't even earn that much money
it's secretaries its mechanics its engineers its computer programmers its
accountants and these people they're not geniuses they're not awakened
masters and gurus they're simple people living their simple lives
you know it's like somebody works at a factory manufacturing
you know landing gear for for some military drone he
doesn't have any big picture understanding of how the the
landing gear that he manufactures on a day to day
basis when he comes into work you know he needs
that job to pay for his children and to send
him to college and so forth and to pay for
his house he he doesn't understand the complexities of how
all of this fits into like the landing gear that
he makes goes into some drone then that drone gets
sent by some corrupt politician to you know to bomb
some some some innocent civilians in the Middle East he
doesn't he can't put all those things together he's not
intelligent he doesn't have enough that perspective to do that
see and maybe even if he did what what would
be his alternative he might live in a kind of
place where he doesn't have any of the kind of
job that he can get so him building this landing
gear allows him to like buy groceries and Christmas gifts
for his children on on Christmas Eve and then so
when when his children gather around the Christmas tree in
the morning on Christmas Day you know they're opening their
gifts and their toys and all that do the children
know that those gifts and toys were purchased by the
building of landing gear for drones that that destroyed the
lives of innocent civilians and they no [ __ ]
idea this is what I mean by the complexity and
the the the infinite scope of consciousness right see they
have no idea how deep reality goes they're just enjoying
their toys on Christmas Day and then this father who
provided for righted these toys you know he's enjoying his
children enjoying the toys and then that that's what we
call the classical example of love but but where did
that come from that moment of classical Valentine's Day love
came from building [ __ ] landing gear and dropping
multi-ton bombs on civilians in the Middle East which of
course helps to / / to lower oil prices which
then helps this you know the mother in this family
to fuel her car to drive the children to school
to drive them to - you know it's a basketball
to tennis - whatever activities they need to do to
drive them to the hospital when one of them gets
sick and then you know to heal her children you
see everything is interconnected without understanding this infinite interconnectedness of
reality you will never understand what I mean by love
and you will forever be at odds with reality you
will be hating and judging and criticizing everything because you
don't see the totality of it you don't see how
everything interconnects how about the example of cancer Leo how
has cancer love how has cancer not love where does
cancer come from think about it pause and think about
it think about how cancer is love most people who
get cancer get it because of their lifestyle it's not
just an accident that befalls us cancer is directly related
to what we eat the chemicals we put in our
food preservatives color additives the chemicals we put in our
plastic bottles in our gasoline and other chemicals household stuff
that we use the technology that we develop the cars
and planes and all this sorts of stuff so who
created this who created all these technologies who created all
these chemicals well of course we did why did we
create them to make a better life for ourselves why
do we have gasoline why do we have cars why
do we have planes why do we have cell phones
why do we have a plastic bottled water why do
we have McDonald's and Taco Bell why do we have
fast food why do we have Gatorade and coca-cola all
these drinks why do we have cigarettes that we smoke
because we enjoy it we enjoy all this stuff we
enjoy our greasy fast food which gives us cancer we
enjoy having food that can last a long time because
it's filled with preservatives so it doesn't rot within a
day the way that produce tends to rot see we
enjoy all these modern comforts and convenience that's love you
love your ice cream and you love your fast food
and you love your coca-cola and you love your car
and you love your road trips which require gasoline you
love plastic products you love the convenience of plastic straws
and plastic forks and plastic bottles and all of this
now of course you don't want to deliberately give yourself
cancer but you enjoy it you enjoy all these products
as a society we enjoy these products in fact these
products we don't just enjoy the nice product save lives
cheap food prevents people from being hungry even though that
food might be full of chemicals and so forth might
give you cancer in 50 years but you know what
the greater urgency for for many people is not being
hungry they don't care about cancer 50 years later let
me just survive until next year that's what most people
care about so we created it people love to smoke
even though they know it's gonna give them cancer they
still do it any might say well leo but if
if the universe was truly loving wouldn't God create a
universe where we couldn't get cancer no because actually the
more loving universe is the one where you have the
freedom to invent new technologies new gadgets new food new
types of smoking and vaping and whatever else you want
which yeah if you create stuff in a sloppy manner
then you can shoot yourself in the foot and you
can get cancer but see the larger love of God
you might say here is that God gave humans the
freedom to invent think about all the goodness that comes
from being able to invent think of all the stuff
that mankind has invented from the very beginning of human
civilization writing machines buildings new materials metal and plastic and
glass and ceramics and all of this something that was
toxic some of it was radioactive some but gave you
cancer but the geordie if it didn't give you cancer
the majority of it works great improves our lives you
know you have comfortable mattresses to sleep on beds and
computer monitors don't look at all the amazing stuff we
invent it most of it works quite great improves our
lives saves many lives allows for billions of humans to
thrive on this planet which otherwise would be impossible but
you're complaining about cancer but that cancer is just an
outgrowth of that freedom that we had to invent see
in this way reality is radical because there's so much
freedom that God gives you enough rope to hang yourself
but then what people do is once they hang themselves
then they blame God for giving them forgiving humans so
much rope and they don't see the love of that
in that see and then of course also don't overlook
what cancer is at a cellular level as well again
remember the love isn't just happening at one level you
know we were just sort of talking about the social
aspects of human evolution and human society and love in
sort of in that chain of causation but then there's
a like another level of causation happening simultaneously which is
like the actual cells which create cancer what is that
these cells have a certain type of mechanism in it
you see this mechanism was necessary for you to even
be here for me to even be here speaking to
you and you for you to be there listening to
me we both have to be biological organisms for us
to be these biological organisms our cells have to be
structured in such a way that they work in certain
ways but also they're not perfect in the sense that
they have limitations everything in reality has limitations because all
form is limited so of course your cells they can
start to multiply out of control if you feed them
the wrong nutrients or you eat the wrong food or
you think the wrong thoughts or you're overstressed or overworked
or whatever it is you're doing see but don't get
mad at the cells the cells have to be that
way for you to even be here it's amazing that
cells work as well as they do that they're able
to to reproduce themselves and keep doing that for a
hundred years while they keep you alive that's already amazing
and there you are complaining about how how come there's
cancer at all well maybe that's just one of the
costs that you pay for being a human or for
being a living mammal and if we restructure our environment
and we remove some of the toxic chemicals and stuff
as a culture then we can eliminate a large chunk
of cancer now there might be still still some cancer
left over some sort of you might say accidental cancer
which isn't caused directly by food or other things but
but even in these cases you have to understand that
that's just a consequence even if the cancer is totally
accidental you might wonder Oh leo how come I was
cursed with this accidental cancer it was not the result
of any of my didn't drink I didn't smoke I
didn't eat anything bad I was perfect my whole life
and I still got cancer how is that love it's
still love because you have to understand that this this
cellular mechanism which is responsible for you being born at
all it is what it is it has its limits
and maybe that means that 100,000 people will die due
to improper cellular reproduction and division but look at what
we get for that what we get for that is
the rest of mankind so if your choice is between
one and a hundred thousand people dying of accidental cancer
versus not having any of mankind which are you gonna
choose see when the choices like that then it's obvious
that you're gonna choose mankind and a little bit of
a chance of cancer you see and then also you're
also overlooking the potential of what happens when you conquer
your cancer how that grows you how that deepens bonds
between people and so forth see so the love is
happening simultaneously at all levels of reality how about the
example of animal testing at first glance it seems kind
of cruel that we test drugs and makeup and chemicals
on various animals lab rats and so forth and am
I saying oh my god it's so terrible we're so
evil on the one hand yes but on the other
hand what does the animal testing get you how many
more people would have died if there wasn't animal testing
testing various pharmaceuticals and drugs and chemicals on animals allows
us to then know how it would affect humans otherwise
we have to test it on humans and then humans
would die or like for example say there's some new
potential technology some pharmaceutical technology that might save people with
Parkinson's disease or with cancer but it's far too risky
to test this directly on humans because if the pharmaceutical
company just tested directly on humans and one of the
humans dies they'll get sued and the pharmaceutical company will
just go out of business and of course then there
won't be any kind of cure or medicine that could
be marketed so instead the pharmaceutical company creates a lab
with monkeys tested on the monkeys a couple hundred of
these monkeys died in the process and that might seem
very cruel and evil but on the other hand now
we have a new cure for cancer for Parkinson's that
will save the lives of hundreds of thousands of people
or improve the lives of hundreds of thousands people not
just for a year but for the next 10,000 years
of human development let's say so was that worth it
a hundred monkeys for ten thousand years worth of improving
human lives and saving human lives you see so while
you might think that this scientist who's injecting this you
know chemical into this rat or this monkey does he
knows it's gonna kill this monkey but he's injecting it
anyways you might say oh that guy is so evil
and this isn't this is an example of love this
is an example of hate and devilry but what I'm
telling you is that that precise moment where he's injecting
that chemical into that monkey that is the very the
very embodiment of love if you can see it from
a wide-enough perspective how about the burning of the Amazon
recently in the news people have been upset about the
Amazon being burned down how bad and evil this is
and you know who's doing this farmers you know Brazil
is not a very advanced in alt-country yet they're still
struggling there are many poor farmers there it's a difficult
country to live in it's a difficult country to raise
your children in it's a very difficult country politically so
on the one hand you can look at these burning
of the Amazon you say oh this is so evil
and so bad this is a counterexample - lovely oh
how could burning the Amazon be love but it is
precisely that it's love that's why the Amazon burns because
the people who are clearing down those forests are doing
it so that they could create plantations of soybeans so
they can create grassland for farming cattle so they could
sell those soybeans and sell that cattle and feed their
children you know there's there's thousands of starving children in
Brazil thousands of people struggling to make it in Brazil
many of those farmers they're not millionaires and billionaires they
might say only a but some of them are what
about those really rich farmers or the giant corporations who
are doing all this yes but those giant corporations also
don't really understand what they're doing you see they don't
have enough consciousness to realize that these fires are gonna
lead to some sort of larger global problems they don't
have enough development to understand that you do but just
because you're that conscious doesn't mean that the executives of
that corporation of that conscious how is it that you
got so conscious but those executives aren't so conscious because
you had better parents you grew up in a better
country you grew up in a better situation you read
the right books you stumbled upon some better YouTube channel
that taught you how to meditate and all this and
those executives didn't who are you blaming they're only doing
the best that they know how to do all of
these people were talking about at all times they're only
doing the best that they know how to do given
their level of consciousness they're loving in their own limited
way and you're judging them for not being able to
love in a bigger way that's what's happening how about
cheating in a relationship can that be caused by love
quite obviously it's caused by love of course this is
very difficult to admit especially if you've been cheated on
it seems like the opposite doesn't it if you got
cheated on in a relationship it seems like leo that
[ __ ] he cheated on me for some younger
woman and this isn't love he was just some horny
[ __ ] [ __ ] and you know he
screwed up our family we had some children together and
all this and he he had to go and screw
it all up and how is this love but of
course it's love what is it that caused him to
get into a let's say a marriage with you in
the first place he loved you right he was attracted
to you what is it that caused him to take
you on that first date and to have sex with
you that first time what was that that was attraction
where did that attraction come from from love he loved
your body maybe he also loved your personality but then
you know somewhere along the way you know the marriage
deteriorated things got stale he got bored of course he's
also horny and you know some some opportunity came to
have sex with some other woman and so he did
yeah because he loved her too that very same love
that led him to to you now leads him to
the girl that's love of course it's a very narrow
constricted egotistical version of love highly conditional version of love
but it's love it's the only love he understands it's
the only love he's capable of if he was a
stronger man if he was more conscious if he did
yoga to purify himself and clear out his chakras you
know all this sorts of stuff then maybe he could
have resisted the temptation but he didn't why is that
because that's where he was at that time that's what
he was capable of that's the brutal truth of love
now of course that's not what you want to hear
that doesn't that doesn't align with your survival which is
why you don't want to hear that but nevertheless this
is the case and if you want to think of
it even deeper here you can think of it as
like um this version of love is what has led
to the human race having seven billion people on the
planet is this kind of love we're horny dogs both
men and women we cheat on each other we dump
each other we sleep around we get attracted to other
people that's human reproduction and if you think about it
it's been extremely successful because we're one of the most
populous species on the whole planet now again it doesn't
mean that it's gonna work out well for you but
think of the bigger picture how about an example of
a husband beating his wife could that be love of
course of course it's love think about it why does
the husband beat his wife because given his worldview that's
the best he knows honestly that's what's going on he's
not beating her because he hates her he's beating her
because he loves her that's his version of showing love
now you might protest you might say well he shouldn't
be like that and that's evil that's wrong fine you
can say all that but also before you say all
that understand what leads him to do that actually trace
through his history look into his history look into his
psychology and ask yourself what caused him to do that
because you know a person doesn't beat his wife for
no reason there's there's a chain of causation that goes
into that he has a bad job he drinks he's
an alcoholic which of course alcoholism has a genetic component
to it his own father might have beat him he
might be depressed he might have a mental illness or
a disorder he might have gotten bullied in school go
back and look through every single factor in his life
and what I'm telling you is when you understand every
single factor that went into his psychology from the moment
he was born up till him beating his wife today
what she'll realize is that all of that had to
add up to exactly what's happening right now see and
that this is his way of coping with it now
I'm not saying that this is necessarily the way he
should do it in the future but this is what
he did now and this is what led him to
where he is now and that is what it is
that's human psychology that's how it works human psychology is
fragile if you take a human being and you beat
him up when he's a kid you'd bully him you
insult him you put him in a dead-end job yeah
he might turn into that kind of guy who beats
his wife that's human psychology but you know what that
human psychology is the same human psychology which is in
all of our minds and brains which runs the entire
human race from the very beginning of human civilization it's
that same human psychology which has allowed us to build
all of human civilization and to enjoy all of the
benefits of human life yeah that's reality that's the complexity
of it you see it's not simple it's very complicated
in fact it's infinitely complicated and it's only when you're
able to take into account the full infinite complexity of
reality that you're able to finally make sense of how
all of it is love you can't deny that all
of these things and I that I've been talking about
as examples that all of these are necessary aspects of
reality now you don't like them okay but they are
necessary aspects of reality what she leads us to a
law of the universe number three which is that everything
that is is what must be and your job is
to see why it's necessary and how it serves the
greatest good now you have to be careful here not
to confuse what I'm saying as a justification for maintaining
future evil actions so what I'm saying is that if
this guy is beating his wife that part is necessary
because it already happened see you have to distinguish what
has already happened well what's already happening right the second
versus what will happen in the future now in the
future he could change himself he could reform himself he
could you know you can get some counseling and get
some therapy he can he can do some meditation he
can start to feel sorry for himself he could change
his behaviors in the future all those are open possibilities
but what's already happened has already happened and that is
necessary that is a tautology the delusion is to think
that what's already happened shouldn't have happened that's the delusion
so be careful to distinguish the past from the future
in this case I want you to notice that everyone
is doing their best to survive in life and that
all the stuff I talked about above these are nothing
but examples of survival that's all it is and survival
is a dirty business but then again you have to
understand that without survival none of us would be here
and none of the things you call love would be
possible at all and this of course includes the collective
egos and organizations which oftentimes we demonize you know we
like to demonize oil companies and um various countries and
nations and groups of people and lobbying groups and all
this but all of this they're also just surviving a
corporation an oil company is also just in the business
of survival no different than an a lion on the
savanna hunting an antelope or a child running away from
his kidnapper it's all survival variations on survival so it's
this complexity this infinite complexity of consciousness which hides the
simplicity that all is love you see love is this
infinite fractal of consciousness which is manifesting itself in all
possible variations some of them quite brutal quite stark quite
raw quite cruel and vicious quite brutal that's the cost
of existence and that is the thing that you need
to get in touch with to understand existential love but
you see the problem with explaining love to humans is
that these examples become so serious and so threatening that
anyone who becomes a teacher of true love will be
demonized for justifying evil see isn't that what you're doing
with me right now as I've been giving you these
examples in the back of your mind you've been thinking
about Leo but how could you be justifying this it
sounds like you're justifying burning the Amazon and you're justifying
torturing animals and you're justifying beating wives and all this
and you're justifying cheating no I'm not justifying anything but
it seems that way from your perspective because the ego
is just worried about you you see you want a
society you want a world in which you are safe
and that's all you care about you don't care about
truth you don't care about actual love you care about
getting your own way and getting your own way is
what you've called love that is the chief delusion of
the ego it doesn't even understand there can be love
or truth outside of what's good for the ego because
the ego self bias the egos distortion is simply that
if it doesn't serve me what use does it have
it has no use yeah that's the very definition of
selfishness that's also by the way the very definition of
devilry and that's also by the way the very thing
which creates the thing that you hate because all of
these examples if you hate the example or you hate
the people in the example or you hate me for
justifying this example it's precisely because this example is selfish
but that's the exact same thing you're doing when you're
criticizing these examples you see this is the distortion of
self bias go check out my episode about self bias
it's really difficult to teach love to humanity because humanity
doesn't care about truth and as it so happens love
and truth are identical so if humanity doesn't care about
truth it doesn't care about love so what does humanity
care about survival and of course as soon as you
start teaching love and truth as absolutes to humanity this
threatens their survival and humanity automatically demonizes that teacher for
being a devil and that's what many people will do
with me and my videos especially this one it's ironic
that love true love is actually the exact opposite of
some flaky new-age platitude you know a lot of times
some some new-age author speaks about how we have to
love the whole world and this hippie sort of idea
and then they get laughed at by materialists and the
pragmatists and the realist and say oh it's just you
know love love the world doesn't really love on run
on love that's so flaky it's so it's so wishy-washy
such soft thinking it's such distorted thinking you know what
is this flaky New Age hippie person even know they're
not being real they're not being truthful and it's the
exact opposite it's the person who is cynical about love
that's the deluded one that's being untruthful because they're judging
this New Age author talking about love or they're judging
me talking about love from the position of love being
this sappy sweet ego pleasing thing so yeah from that
perspective the world doesn't run on love but that's not
real love that's fake love that's the fake love of
the materialist the irony is that it's the materialist who
has a flaky sentimental emotional sappy ridiculous version of love
and so then yeah when we have a conversation about
love the materialist projects his own flakiness onto the conversation
and then can't understand how reality could be love that
is materialism shooting itself in the foot real love is
as serious as cancer as serious as genocide as serious
as rape that's real love but you see the materialist
wants nothing to do with that kind of love the
materialist wants to talk about love theoretically as a theory
as philosophy but then when you get into your actual
everyday survival all the sudden love flies out the window
nobody cares about love when it comes to your daily
sir Videl when it comes to your daily survival it's
survival at all costs and it's that thing that needs
to be transformed that attachment to survival at all costs
at the cost of truth at the cost of unconditional
love it's that which is ruining your life it's that
which needs to change and it's that thing which you
least want to change which is why you don't even
want to have this conversation which is why you misinterpret
and misunderstand everything I'm saying here you see because what
I'm saying here is way too threatening and way too
real you want this to be some flaky new-age platitude
filled video where I tell you that love is happiness
and joy and all this that's what you want as
a materialist because then you can stick to your materialist
idea that all the universe is just it's it's just
you know you can be the cynic and you could
say all the universe is just it's indifferent it's cruel
there is no God I don't know but if you
have to accept that the universe is love if you
have to accept that this is what God is if
you have to accept that God is cancer and genocide
and rape and torture and husband's beating wives and cheating
and all of this if you have to accept that
that's too much for you you see that would mean
you'd have to actually grow and change something beyond philosophy
something beyond Theory beyond ideology and that's the last thing
you want to do is to change in that way
that would be real growth but you don't want that
because you want to keep being a devil you want
to keep being selfish see the most threatening thing I
could tell you is to convince you to become selfless
is to make you so conscious that your selfishness becomes
unsustainable and the more you listen to me the more
conscious you become of how selfish you have been your
whole life and now all of your survival strategies whether
it's within relationships within earning money within your career within
your business within everything you do all of your survival
strategies how selfish and limited all of that has been
and how foolish you've been and how much growth you
have to do and how difficult it's gonna be to
change all that that's the last thing you want to
hear see so this is why people ridicule and act
cynical when it comes to love because real love this
is this is the most serious and the most truthful
pursuit I want you to contemplate especially these two critical
questions number one how is survival crucial to love and
number two how is devilry crucial to love right those
two down and contemplate them contemplate them for for weeks
for months for years contemplate them for the rest of
your life this is part of your work because if
you cannot reconcile survival with love and devilry with love
you will forever be in an adversarial relationship with reality
and you will forever not understand evil see you need
to start to see evil as love until you do
you're not really growing notice that without survival nothing could
exist there could not be any human life there could
not be happiness without a foundation of survival and of
course devilry is just another word for survival destruction death
suffering killing pain these are all necessary to life as
much as you may not like them not liking stuff
is also necessary to life that's part of your survival
hating stuff is a survival function so you're not gonna
transcend hate by hating some more you transcend hate by
realizing that everything is love including hate once your love
extends even to hate then you have transcended hate but
leo you're making a mockery of God here you are
talking about God saying that God loves evildoers no you
are making a mockery of God by saying that God
hates any aspect of itself how weak is your God
if your God needs to hate anything hatred is a
hallmark of low consciousness activity so you would have God
be some low consciousness being you see if you had
your way you would have God be a devil of
course in your image you know there's this quote that
I like which says something along the lines of if
if triangles had a God their God would have three
sides well if humans had a God their God would
be a devil that's what your God is your God
is a devil if your God hates your God it's
a devil not real God real God doesn't hate real
God is infinite love real God has infinite self-acceptance and
self-love because how could God hate itself to hate itself
God would need to be unconscious to certain aspects of
itself it would need to deny aspects of itself it
would need to deny aspects that it created because it
created everything if it created everything how could it hate
its creation it's almost like you're asking God to hate
its own children infinite consciousness means that you're conscious that
you're everything which means that there's nothing other than you
nothing separate from you nothing which you didn't create which
means that if you hated some aspect of reality you
would literally be hating yourself which just would be foolishness
the only way you can hate yourself or some aspect
of reality is if you're not conscious of it but
God is infinite consciousness so we can't hate it self
self-hatred is only possible at less than infinite consciousness here's
a universal law number 4 for you your love is
directly proportional to your level of consciousness the more conscious
you are the more love you have the more you
accept yourself the more you accept others because you recognize
that the distinction between yourself and other is imaginary and
so a central aspect of this work that we're doing
is we're raising our consciousness of course but also we're
increasing our self love and our self acceptance and in
so doing we end up loving the whole world and
in this way is how we conquer evil evil is
not something God created evil is something that occurs when
your consciousness is less than infinite so you might wonder
well why did God create consciousness which is less than
infinite precisely because infinite consciousness must include all finite aspects
of consciousness as well infinite consciousness means unlimited consciousness unlimited
consciousness means limited consciousness it goes full circle love means
hatred the hatred you find in the world is not
a counter example to God's love it is the very
epitome of God's love it's because God's love is infinite
that people hate you get that but leo isn't that
dangerous this whole conversation seems like you could just use
love to justify any kind of evil you want you
can cheat on your wife you can beat your wife
you can burn the rainforest you can drop bombs on
people and it's all for love yeah love is utterly
radical and love is totally free that's freedom what you're
running into here now is freedom absolute freedom it wouldn't
be absolute love unless it was absolute freedom unless it
allowed for evil see God is so selfless that he
allows you to be as selfish as you want love
is so inclusive that it includes evil love must allow
for self-deception love must allow for ignorant love must allow
for selfish justification love must allow for devilry the devil
exists precisely because of the magnitude of God's love that's
the paradigm of course it must be this way because
of the soft reference problem and because of the nature
of oneness and non duality the nature of infinity these
sorts of paradoxes are the direct result of everything being
one this is what this is what God is see
it's not a problem for God but it is a
problem for you as a human so how do you
escape this problem by realizing that you're not really a
human but that you're God when you realize that you
are God then you escape this whole problem because you
start to accept everything that you are without judgment including
the devilry the ignorance the self-deception the selfishness the justifications
all the games that people play now you might wonder
below what is the use of love when it accepts
everything this isn't practical that's right truth goes beyond practicality
it's prior to practicality remember that practicality is survival so
I'm not saying any of this is practical per se
I'm just saying that it's true this work is not
about practicality this work is about truth the catch-22 is
that if you're preoccupied all the time with practicality that
means you're stuck in survival mode when you're stuck in
survival mode that means all you care about is yourself
and you're being selfish when you're being selfish you're always
scared you're never satisfied because you're always looking towards the
future for how to improve your situation and in this
way you become like a mouse in a wheel running
round and round chasing your own tail for the rest
of your life and you're never satisfied with anything and
you never establish any sense of peace or groundedness in
your life that's what practicality leads you to whereas if
you transcend practicality and you go for truth and for
love then what happens is that you can escape that
whole rat race and you can find true peace and
true joy so again the practical and the impractical also
goes full circle by chasing practicality what ends up happening
is that in the end it becomes very impractical your
life becomes very impractical and dysfunctional whereas if you chase
the impractical which is truth let's say then once you
do find it it becomes very practical because it transforms
your entire perspective of of a reality that duality between
practical and impractical was never as separate as you thought
see the problem with God is that God has so
much love that no finite being can handle it it's
like God is trying to share its love with you
all the time but us humans were so terrified by
the enormity and gravity of what love is of what
infinite love is that we're always running away and we
call it evil you see this delicious irony you can't
appreciate infinity because you're a finite being you're identified with
being a finite being so of course how can you
appreciate infinite love you can't you've demonized demonized it in
your mind and we've demonized it in our culture every
time you judge or criticize evil what you're doing is
you're rejecting God's love you're rejecting yourself you're hating yourself
because all hatred all judgment is self-hatred and self-denial imited
finite being but God is an infinite being so every
time you try to eliminate you distort it you falsify
it and you only deepen your problem the solution to
being a finite being is not to take God and
make it finite to match you but rather to realize
that oh I'm finite there's something beyond me something infinite
let me expand myself to infinity so that I could
go up to God you see the mistake of a
devil is trying to drag down God to his level
that's what people are constantly trying to do because otherwise
you can't handle infinite love it's too much it's too
it's too good it's too powerful you would it would
dissolve your limited human identity and you've called that death
you've literally called God death and you've spent your whole
life running away from it and now you wonder why
you're so confused and why your life is so dysfunctional
and and why the world is going to hell why
everything is so crazy well it's because everybody is just
like you everybody is trying to demonize God and run
away from it and that's why mankind is so confused
about this topic of God you know it's been thousands
of years that teachers have been coming to mankind trying
to explain to Matt cotton to mankind what love is
what God is and mankind kept rejecting it and misunderstanding
it why does this keep happening it's too radical it's
too much mankind isn't ready to understand it yet you
see and of course because these teachers and God itself
is selfless they don't want to push it upon you
you have to come to God you have to come
to love love can't be pushed upon you you have
to be wise enough and conscious enough to to accept
it for yourself to be interested in for yourself that's
the tragedy of this whole thing called life and this
contributes and even deepens the love even further when you
realize how tragic it is that for the last 5000
years the history of mankind has been mankind rejecting God's
love over and over and over and over and over
again leading to the deaths of thousands and millions and
hundreds of millions of people to torture to suffering to
rape to all this when you realize all this and
you realize uh-huh that is God's love that's when it
hits you that's when you really understand see God has
been trying to reach out to you with this love
your whole life but you've been too scared you've been
running away from it because you're a finite being and
of course it couldn't be otherwise it's a it's a
totally necessary and it's a perfect tautology this is what
love is this is what reality is is what truth
is this is what consciousness is what is the connection
between love and absolute freedom they're identical how so well
absolute love has no restrictions so it has no need
to change anything it accepts everything exactly as it is
so you might wonder well why didn't God create a
better universe the answer is because God loves it exactly
how it is the question really is why do you
hate the universe as it is why don't you change
your perspective so that you love it exactly as it
is so rather than you wanting God to change the
universe how about you surrender yourself and realize that the
universe is perfect how about that oh no Leo I
don't want to do that well there's your problem there's
your problem people don't appreciate how scary true freedom is
total freedom total freedom means that consciousness explores itself to
infinity into every nook and cranny that means consciousness will
explore the Holocaust conscious will explore rape consciousness will explore
murder conscious will explore cannibalism consciousness will explore incest consciousness
will explore burning the Amazon conscious will explore greed and
theft and slavery all of this conscious will explore all
of itself all of itself until it's complete until it's
total until its one it will not reject anything of
itself that's God's point of view now you might wonder
well why would God be loving because it's infinite intelligence
because it's selfless because it has no needs it needs
nothing it fears nothing so what do you do when
you're infinitely intelligent infinitely conscious totally selfless you have no
needs you have no fears that is the very definition
of love imagine if you were a being like that
what would you do you have no needs there would
only be one thing worth doing at that point and
that is to radiate love that's the only thing because
you have nothing you need and you're too conscious to
hate yourself see consciousness and love are identical you can't
have one without the other let's do a little thought
experiment a little visualization exercise for you to start to
wrap your mind around what the love of God really
is I want you to bring to mind what it's
like to be you and to have lived your life
think about your whole life as a totality think about
all the different aspects of your life that you've loved
and enjoyed think about being yourself do you love yourself
do you love being you hopefully you do or at
least at some points in your life you felt that
way where you just thought to yourself man it's really
nice to be me I love being me bring that
to mind now imagine that sense of your whole life
you know everything that defines you in your life your
body all the stuff that's happened to you all of
your memories everything your humanity even your biology all of
it think of all that and imagine letting all of
that go so that you completely stop being you and
now imagine that you become some other person imagine that
you become a crippled or a disabled person in a
wheelchair imagine you become an ugly person and now as
you become a mentally [ __ ] person imagine you
become a murderer imagine you become a rapist imagine you
become a cannibal imagine you become a tyrant or a
dictator imagine you become a feminist imagine you become some
alright white nationalist imagine you become a thief imagine you
become a greedy criminal CEO who does white-collar crime and
now imagine totally loving all of that without any exception
whatsoever without even flinching having the courage to want to
explore all of those possibilities of consciousness without any fear
or resistance notice if there's any fear or resistance like
I I don't want to be a thief I don't
want to be some nationalist white nationalist I don't want
to be some rapist that would be bad or I
don't want to be some ugly person that would be
bad I don't want to be a disabled person that
would let all of that resistance go imagine yourself being
so selfless and so free as a consciousness so unattached
to your own body and to your own mind your
own beliefs to your own preferences and ideas and wants
you're so totally selfless that you don't even have any
personal desires other than to experience everything you could possibly
become that is God that is the love of God
that desire for total freedom and total selflessness that complete
desire to explore every possibility of what consciousness could be
that is God and that is precisely how you were
born how do you think you got here it's not
because your parents [ __ ] it's because God wanted
to explore all of the possibilities of consciousness of which
your parents and you were but one instance and it's
only because God's love was so infinite that they wanted
to explore every possibility of consciousness that in it end
up exploring all of life therefore imagining all of life
therefore creating all of life therefore having all of this
be here including your life the one that you're attached
to the one that used so much love see that's
really truly how everything was created it wasn't through natural
selection it wasn't really through evolution it wasn't through physics
it wasn't through anything it was through God's pure desire
to explore every aspect of what consciousness is because God
is an infinite mind therefore it had to literally imagine
every thing that consciousness could imagine of which this very
moment right here are you sitting there listening to me
and me sitting here talking to you this very moment
right now is being imagined right now by God because
this is what God is because this is the very
manifestations of God's love for itself for consciousness and that's
why we're here right now having this talk God is
talking and God is listening and God is imagining all
of this right here tah-dah notice that all of this
could only be possible through total selflessness non judgment and
total self-acceptance so it's only because God is completely selfless
that it was able to create this it's God's selflessness
that allows you to be selfish it's because God was
so selfless that it was willing to explore and to
imagine what selfishness was that selfishness was created it's because
God was so selfless that God imagined itself to be
a devil and that's what you're sitting there being you're
sitting there being a devil you're God being a devil
now you might wonder but Leo if everything is love
then how do I know how to be a good
person because I can't distinguish now you know before I
thought that like hitting someone over the head was bad
and that was hate hateful and then giving someone a
gift that that was love but now you're saying even
hitting someone over the head is love so that now
how do i distinguish what to do and the way
you do that is by being conscious it's very simple
just be conscious and also surrender your fears and your
personal needs if you can do these three things you
will never be an evil person you will automatically be
a good person just be conscious surrender all your fears
surrender all your personal needs notice that strips you free
of all of your devilry of course easier said than
done there are a few huge misconceptions here that I
want to clear up first of all the misconception is
that love means that nothing violent should happen in reality
no that's not true love violence is something you need
to learn to love violence is something you need to
learn to see as a manifestation of love not to
try to turn everything into a peaceful sort of hippie
utopia that's a mistake another big misconception is that if
you embody love then you must act in a certain
loving manner this is also false you can embody love
but you don't have to necessarily act in a particular
way in fact you can be ruthless sometimes in fact
sometimes you have to be ruthless to manifest love sometimes
you have to do something difficult sometimes you have to
make hard brutal decision which might involve many lives you
don't always have to be smiling you don't always have
to be kissing and hugging throw this silly idea out
of your mind you don't always have to be in
a good loving mood sometimes you can be pissed off
you can be angry in all of that allow yourself
to have a full range of emotions don't just try
to turn yourself into some sort of happy love robot
rather realize that when you're in your car and you're
pissed to offer angry at somebody for some silly reason
realize that that is a form of love it's contracted
full of love but realize that that's that too is
love and that will counter-intuitively help you to sort of
break free of it love can be expressed in a
million different ways in fact love is expressed not in
a million different ways but in an infinite number of
ways so be careful about limiting how love must be
expressed for it to be love the ego will want
to jump in there and say oh well that thing
over there that doesn't count as a true expression of
love and that doesn't count as a true expression of
love because you didn't say I love you to me
and because you didn't hug me and because you weren't
smiling at me and because you weren't being kind to
me therefore you're not loving and therefore this isn't true
love Dada itself is ego right there so be careful
with that trap it takes total selflessness to accept the
unlimited multiplicity of love and all the forms that it
comes in love as an absolute love with a capital
L another big misconception is that if you embody love
then you can't enforce boundaries and you must be a
doormat and everyone can walk all over you and they
can abuse you and exploit you know make sure you
don't get that wrong that is not what I'm saying
I'm not saying that you you let your husband beat
you if you're an abusive relationship or you let your
boss exploit you or you let somebody you know feve
from you and you don't stand up to them know
oftentimes love means the courage to stand up to a
bully the courage to enforce a boundary the courage to
create a conflict which goes back to the point about
violence sometimes you got to be a little bit violent
in your speech or even physically now I don't of
course condone physical violence against people I would leave that
as like a very very last resort but you know
what the reality is is that violence is an aspect
of reality if it wasn't there wouldn't be any violence
right learning how to enforce your boundaries is important and
in fact sometimes the most loving thing you can do
in a relationship is to enforce a boundary by calling
someone out for trying to exploit you or for being
abusive or calling out someone's gaslighting of you this is
an especially important point for you ladies and your intimate
relationships a lot of women can get to me about
enforcing boundaries and then this lets men exploit them so
be careful about that and then the woman rationalizes in
her mind of like oh well but I love him
you're falling into the trap of too much thinking of
love as a feminine sort of lovey dovey thing whereas
you're failing on the masculine dimension of love it's very
important that women learn the masculine dimension of love and
it's very important that men learn the feminine dimension of
love you need to balance both of those two out
if you have too much of one but not enough
of the other then you're gonna be out of balance
and dysfunctional and then that's when problems arise you need
to use the right one for the right context and
situation it's very contextual ultimately I want you to get
to a point in your life where something horrible is
gonna happen with reality maybe you're looking through the news
you see some horrible thing on the news or even
some some horrible thing happens in your personal life and
usually when you would recoil and you would get angry
and upset about it and you would start to criticize
somebody or judge reality or judge God for allowing this
I want you to get to a point where you
instead you realize oh this horror is the very essence
of love this horror doesn't diminish love reality it actually
heightens the love the horror makes it more real it
makes it more raw it means that I have to
be stronger the horror strengthens me it tests my love
it tests how much my consciousness can accept and then
when that happens and then you see at horn you
say oh my god I finally understand I finally under
the horror is God ah I see it now that's
the moment I want you to reach but that'll probably
take a lot of work and so to help you
to get there I have a little worksheet go down
below the video click the link there will be a
link to a worksheet the worksheet will list maybe 20
different examples or so of horrible things that I want
you to think about to visualize and contemplate and then
I want you to actually write out in that worksheet
for each one of those things how this horrible thing
isn't actually an example of love and actually increases the
love of the universe rather than decreases it so that's
gonna be your assignment try to actually do it do
it on paper actually write it out this will help
you and then in the future I'm gonna have some
more videos about love we're still not done with this
topic there's more to say I'm gonna have one about
fear versus love we still have a lot to talk
about when it comes to fear because fear is the
chief obstacle to love I'll help you figure that out
and I'll also talk about some exercises some further exercises
for how to actually practice being more loving and then
you will become the love master the love Lord you
really got to understand that all of my teachings really
are about love helping you to actualize love in a
radical way because there's really nothing else worth teaching and
that's really where all of my teachings have been leading
from the very beginning of course it wasn't always explicitly
stated as such and you got to really get deep
into the teachings before you start to see how everything
interconnects and you gotta sort of have awakening experiences and
of course it's extremely important that you have at least
one awakening into the existential nature of love you have
to become conscious of what love is otherwise what I'm
talking about here is just gonna sound like empty philosophy
it's gonna sound like some sort of hippie platitudes and
so forth so that's important but all of my teachings
going forward I want you to see them even if
I'm talking about a topic where I don't even mention
the word love like if I'm talking about life purpose
or I'm talking about improving your nutrition or I'm talking
about relating in a more conscious way to somebody or
communicating or being a good leader I'm just talking about
ways of being more loving without necessarily explicitly saying so
or when we're talking about politics we're really talking about
how to love the science of love this is a
much neglect ectopic a much neglected domain that they don't
teach you in school or in university of course and
now you understand why because it's very radical and because
it requires some serious awakening to appreciate all right that's
it I'm done here please click that like button for
me and come check out actualize that org that is
my website you'll find the blog where I'm gonna post
some examples of love for you check those out you'll
find the forum you'll find the life purpose course you'll
find the book list where I have some book books
about love I have biographies that will help you to
to study some of these tyrants and dictators that will
show you how they act out of love and the
last thing that I want to remind you of is
that Awakening is not some dry cold heartless rationalist stoic
pursuit the way that often Zen portrays it to be
it's easy to get that misunderstanding that by becoming enlightened
you're just gonna become immune you're gonna become like this
terminator without any emotions and that this is supposed to
be like the ultimate state that you're gonna reach and
then and then you know in that picture yeah if
you have that picture then where does love fit in
it doesn't in that picture fortunately that's not how it
works at all for many of you I suggest replacing
that image with the exact opposite imagine awakening making you
softer making you not less human but more human more
coming from your heart more emotional deeper into feeling deeper
into suffering and appreciating pain and and caring more that's
sort of the paradox of it yes of course there
will also be a dry cold stoic aspect to it
as well it's really not one or the other it's
both we're sort of unifying the masculine Zen approach with
the more feminine you could call it the sort of
Christian heart-centered approach or combining the two together and I
think that that's personally for me that's that's a much
more juicy path and a juicy way to do this
work then just the the cold stoic Harless Zen approach
you
