how open-mindedness works in this episode we're going to be
revisiting the classic topic of open mindedness that I've talked
about in the past I've referred to it as radical
open mindedness this is the master key that you need
if you care to understand reality to any significant degree
this is your biggest obstacle this is the number one
obstacle that people have when it comes to understanding reality
and by understanding reality I mean everything all of it
every aspect of reality holistically and how all of the
different facets fit together and relate to you into your
life so if you want to understand yourself at a
deep level if you want to understand emotions at a
deep level if you understand humanity at a deep level
society at a deep level reality science religion spirituality metaphysics
philosophy if you want to understand all of this stuff
radical open mindedness is the key but what is open
mindedness really let's take a deep look openness versus closeness
these are features of the mind your mind can either
be open or it can be closed and of course
this is not a simple binary there's a spectrum of
degrees here there are many degrees of open-mindedness and even
if you fancy yourself an open-minded person I would challenge
you to stick around and keep listening because it's not
enough just to be open-minded it's a question of how
open-minded are you like really how deeply open-minded are you
and chances are if you're following along with me and
you've been watching my content for years or for months
even you're already you have to be a relatively open-minded
person more so than the average person in society but
that's still not going to cut it for you to
really be able to understand reality at the levels that
were interested in here so the I guess the key
point of this episode is going to be more experiential
than just theoretical I'm gonna give be giving you theory
and insights about open-mindedness and so forth that's all good
but the most important takeaway I want you to get
here is is that openness has certain feel to it
and closedness has a certain feel to it and I
want to help you to experientially draw a distinction in
your mind this is gonna be something you learn here
today and you take away with you for the rest
of your life if you learn it this distinction is
an experiential distinction between the difference of when your mind
is open and when your mind is closed and and
see we're gonna be looking at the topic of open
mindedness here now not just from a macro perspective but
from a micro perspective what I mean by that is
I'm not so much interested here in whether you're just
a open-minded person in general like we could say all
that person over there's some religious fanatic fundamentalist and he's
close-minded and this person over here she's she's some sort
of hippie and she's very open-minded well of course you
can categorize people this way but let's get beyond that
there's something more important let's get into the micro level
of open-mindedness and closed mindedness because it's not that you're
just open-minded on all topics equally it's that on every
specific instance every situation that your mind comes in contact
with every new idea and belief and worldview you're gonna
be either open to it or close to it and
we want you to be able to notice and to
be aware of when your mind is doing what see
so don't just rest on your laurels and tell yourself
you know pat yourself on the back and tell yourself
how open-minded you are because even if you're open minded
about some things I guarantee you there's other things that
I could tell you that you will be close minded
to and it's it's that it's recognizing those cases which
is gonna really start to make a difference in your
life so let's start drawing this distinction with an exercise
this will be the first of several exercises that we
do here it's a simple exercise you ready roll up
your sleeves try to do this right now all it
requires is that you use your mind you're just flexing
your mind here so I want you to open your
mind to the possibility that your mother hatched from an
egg can you do that do it actually do it
right now and notice what it feels like to do
it open your mind to the possibility that your mother
hatched from an egg I'm not joking I want you
to actually do it or if you fail to do
it then notice that but at least try so what
what am I really asking you to do I'm asking
you to let go of the fact that your mother
was conventionally birthed let go of that because that's what
you I've presently believed let go of that as though
it never even existed in your mind throw it away
and now try on this new fact that she hatched
from an egg and try it on seriously not as
a joke and see how long you can hold that
in your mind and carefully observe what your mind is
doing as you're holding it observe how it feels are
you open to this possibility are you closed to it
if you're open notice how openness feels if you're closed
notice how closed in this feels you're either able to
do it or not and then of course there's a
question of how long you're able to do it you
might be able to only do it for 3 seconds
or 5 seconds you open your mind of the possibility
and then your mind shuts down and says oh well
it's ridiculous that's crazy why am I even doing this
as this isn't worth my time this is just silly
armchair philosophy it's not true it so it can't possibly
be true it's ridiculous okay then that's what happened so
I want you to start to notice when your mind
gets attached to an idea or a perspective or a
belief or a worldview or a position just generally speaking
this is one instance of it but your mind does
this all the time with other examples and I deliberately
picked an outlandish example here because I want to separate
the content of the example from your ability to be
open or closed about it these are two separate issues
we'll be talking a little bit more about that as
we go on here but I want you to notice
what attachment actually feels like what it feels to be
attached to an idea I want you to notice what
resistance to an idea feels like I want you to
notice any excuses and rationalizations that your mind comes up
with - opening up to some idea so what does
closed nough steel like you should feel a distinct sort
of emotional attachment there should be a resistance a sort
of righteousness and a sort of arrogance that comes with
sticking to your old position when the mind is closed
it doesn't even want to consider a new possibility and
that's really all that open-mindedness means is the willingness to
consider a new possibility and specifically what I'm interested in
is the consideration of radical new possibilities possibilities that are
beyond your conventional culture social norms and your paradigms of
what's physically possible see and that's when the mind really
becomes resistant and as it becomes resistant it becomes defensive
and as it becomes defensive it erect Saul sorts of
defense mechanisms one of which is that it becomes righteous
so if you're not able to open your mind to
the possibility that your mother has from an egg you
get righteous about you say oh well that's that's just
stupid Leo you're an idiot for asking me to even
consider such a possibility it can't possibly be true so
it's a waste of my time to even consider it
there's a sort of righteousness and arrogance there also what
she noticed that it feels dirty it feels impure it
feels neurotic you get agitated you can even even get
hot there can be sort of a hot sensation when
it comes to opening your mind to a new potentially
threatening possibility you can feel threatened you can feel offended
these are all common defense mechanisms of course when you're
closed it feels like an unwillingness to let go it
feels like I have to drag you kicking and screaming
towards a new possibility you don't want to go there
willingly you demand that I drag you there you demand
evidence and proof and you demand an explanation of why
you should go to this new possibility another common defense
mechanism which is part of the self-righteousness is people with
a closed mind they they tend to go on the
counter-attack because you know when it comes to the ego
line the best defense is often a good strong offense
as they say and so people who are closed-minded have
you noticed that oftentimes they are the ones that then
try to prove themselves or their position or their ideology
the most to you they try to convince you that
they're right so that's that's very characteristic of closed mindedness
the mind will want to lecture me like leo let
me tell you why you're wrong all the ways that
you're wrong and why you're asking me to take on
this OOP civility let me tell you why I shouldn't
this sort of attitude it's an attitude of I'm right
and that what I have as my old position is
just a fact it's just reality like that so the
closed mind tends to become argumentative it can become obnoxious
it can become emotional because this is coming from a
sort of emotionally charged sense of defensiveness and threat it
becomes easily judgmental it's often loud mouthed it makes a
lot of excuses it justifies it rationalizes it can become
hostile it can become violent even when pushed into a
corner it creates distractions it uses what about isms it
loves to blame and it loves to engage in projection
these are all classic symptoms of a closed mind so
notice when I ask you to consider that your mother
hatched from an egg first of all were you able
to do it and if you weren't did any of
these come up for you if it did it's okay
you didn't really fail anything it's just that you got
an experiential taste of what closed-mindedness feels like and that's
very important in fact in a sense this is what
I want here because some of you might be so
open-minded that you might be able to just do this
exercise and ace it but the problem then is that
you don't get an experiential feel for the distinction between
a closed at an open mind and we want you
to get that feel so if this example won't do
it for you there there will be others in this
episode that might but you might also need to just
pause and come up with your own examples of something
some example of some intellectual position that you're just unwilling
to open your mind to and just to see what
that feels like see what that resistance that impurity that
neuroticism what it feels like it feels there's something dirty
about it there's something that doesn't feel quite right you
might not be able to pinpoint it or put your
finger or fully articulated but it just doesn't sit quite
right with you that's close-mindedness now in contrast to that
how does open-mindedness feel it feels light calm cool easy
chill free unattached relaxed unafraid comfortable with letting go of
the old position because it has nothing to lose there's
a sort of a sense of a freedom of like
oh sure I can just jump between different positions I
don't need to cling to my old position let me
just consider it there's a sort of a curiosity an
innate curiosity and a desire to explore new possibilities so
when I tell you to consider that your mother has
from an egg it could be like rather than coming
up with excuses for why you shouldn't an open-minded person
might go oh that's interesting that's an interesting idea I've
never even thought about that let me consider that and
an open-minded person might even go further it might even
say well that's very interesting because you know how do
I even know how my mother was born did I
ask her or did I just assume my entire life
that she was born like other people what if she
was hatched from an egg and I didn't even ask
her and she never even and never even occurred to
her to tell me see that's how it open-minded person
would potentially react to such an exercise so notice that
difference open-mindedness I want you understand here very important don't
get lost in the content of the examples this is
not about the content this is about the structure see
my prior episode called content versus structure were I explained
that distinction but basically open-mindedness is a meta skill it's
an ability to feel when you're being closed and the
ability to it's sort of an awareness you're aware of
it and then you you can let it go rather
than being driven by it see and this meta skill
it doesn't have anything to do with a particular fact
or the truthfulness of a particular statement or belief rather
it's a it's a general skill that your mind can
develop some minds are more closed others are more open
those that are more open are able to let go
of old positions and explore new ones without getting emotionally
attached to them that's a skill that's a skill we
want to develop you see and this skill is independent
of what we're considering we could be talking about religion
we could be talking about science we could be talking
about politics we could be talking about sexuality or relationships
we could be talking about aliens we could be talking
about conspiracy theories or whatever and some of those things
could be true some of those things could be false
but this meta skill that's the key thing that you
need in order to be able to navigate all of
these different domains and much more in a an effective
and truthful manner now of course many skeptics and so
forth and rational people here will say but Leo I
will only open my mind if you give me sufficient
proof so Leah I'm all for open-mindedness but I'm not
gonna be so open-minded that I'm just gonna consider such
ridiculous things as my mother hatching from eggs or the
earth being flat or some conspiracy theory or something like
that if you're gonna make such an extraordinary claim you
need to provide the proof and the evidence and then
I will open my mind but that's closed mindedness that's
what I want you to recognize that position that was
just articulated that's closed mindedness see the key inside here
that you're missing is that open-mindedness is independent of an
actually prior to proof and truth see this is a
very common and naive mistake that even many scientifically minded
people make is they think that they should only be
willing to open their mind to things that are cruel
but this puts the cart before the horse and gets
the whole situation backwards because if you aren't open-minded in
the first place you will never accept the truth because
you're not going to give it a fair chance you
will never consider the proof and the evidence you're not
going to accept it because to accept proven evidence first
you have to be open-minded you get that that's very
very important many scientifically minded and rationally minded and atheistic
lis minded and skeptically minded people get this part wrong
so even when we're considering a topic like Flat Earth
for example you might say well provide the proof and
then I'll open my mind no first you open your
mind then we'll see and we'll look at the proof
and the evidence and we'll evaluate a situation from an
open-minded position you see because you're assuming that if I
provide you with proof and evidence that you will just
sort of be able to evaluate that evidence and proof
fairly objectively and if it's true you'll be able to
accept it but that's that's not a safe assumption that
in fact is not what you're going to be able
to do if you're closed-minded only an open-minded person is
able to do that but you're closed-minded in this case
so notice that a lot of times science masquerades actually
as closed mindedness and there are of course many many
examples throughout the history and epistemology of science if we
go through the history of science we see many examples
of scientists who behaved and very closed-minded way which [
__ ] the progress of science one such example of
courses when it came to Copernicus into Galileo and other
people in that camp who did groundbreaking research into the
motion of the earth around the Sun it was conventional
wisdom 500 years ago that the planet was stationary why
was it considered stationary because all proof and evidence from
our direct experience suggests that the planet is stationary it's
not moving if it was moving we would feel it
what could be more obvious and simple than that so
of course most people's minds were closed to the possibility
that the planet was moving especially at some ridiculous velocity
which is how it moves so it actually took a
very special kind of mind a very open mind to
be able to see that despite the apparent proven evidence
that the truth is actually the contrary it's the opposite
see it took a genius scientific intellect and really back
then it was philosophers who were doing this work science
hardly existed back then it was part of philosophy is
called natural philosophy basically and so philosophers which were the
deepest intellectuals in Europe were sitting around and they were
thinking really open-mindedly at least some of them were about
some of these possibilities and they open their minds to
the possibility that wait a minute what if it's moving
at such a velocity that it's so constant that we
can't tell the difference after all what frame of reference
would we use see this is now requiring a relativistic
conception of reality not an absolute istic one and so
now we open ourselves to the possibility that maybe it
is moving but we can't tell because we really don't
have a good frame of reference and sure enough that's
exactly how it works but you see people in that
time would have argued against the motion of the earth
by saying stuff like well but if I'm sitting in
a carriage and I'm driving down the road which is
how people got around back then or maybe out a
horse there were no cars there were no trains back
then and I'm moving I can tell it's obvious I
can feel my motion so if the earth was moving
I should be able to feel it too and clearly
we don't feel it so therefore it's not moving but
of course the problem with that sort of line of
reasoning is that you know the carriage is not moving
at a constant velocity now we can go into a
plane or into a train or into a car which
is moving relatively constant and isn't accelerating or decelerating and
we don't really notice that it's moving at all so
that was just you know that was just sort of
a very simple naive kind of oversight that could be
made based on direct experience so anyways the moral of
the story and there are many of these sorts of
examples throughout the entire history of science this is just
but one a very classic one the moral of the
story is that first you have to be open-minded and
then there's a possibility for the proof and the evidence
to convince you otherwise to get you to change your
position see if you're immediately close-minded to it what are
you assuming you're assuming that your entire sort of paradigm
of reality is correct but that's precisely what can easily
be wrong because you didn't actually spend a lot of
deep time developing your metaphysical and epistemic framework of reality
your worldview wasn't something you sat down and you carefully
developed over decades and years of experimentation you just picked
it up from your culture it's basically just dogma you
assumed it and you never even thought or considered any
alternatives and now you're just stuck on it defending it
blindly and therefore of course you're closed-minded about it what
I also want you to notice here is that it's
possible to be closed-minded and right and it's possible to
be open-minded wrong see for example you can be closed-minded
about Flat Earth you can just completely refuse to even
consider Flat Earth as a possibility and you might be
right in the end that might be true the planet
is probably round and so that instance then gets you
to think like well okay so it worked here so
I can just keep doing that and that turns into
a trap and many scientists especially fall into this trap
they think that as long as they're right and science
is factually right in many instances that's why Sciences is
so valuable and we appreciate it so much and we
tend to give it so much credibility is because it
has a lot of factual correctness to it but then
we get lulled into a sort of a false sense
of complacency thinking that well as long as science is
always factually right we can just be closed-minded about it
be dogmatic about science and therefore we're being scientific when
actually we're not being scientific we're being uh we're being
dogmatic it's also possible to be open-minded about something but
then ultimately wrong for example you can be open-minded about
Flat Earth you can consider it you can go and
research it and even you can launch yourself into space
and actually take a look is the earth round or
flat and and you might be wrong you might think
it's gonna be flat and it turns out to be
round and you're wrong but the open-mindedness really was the
important part so my point here is is that being
open-minded is more important than being right because being right
is just one instance of getting something correct whereas open-mindedness
is a is a much broader attitude and meta skill
which will be applied in many many instances for the
rest of life so while sure you can get a
few things wrong here and there you know factual inaccuracies
happen even with the best of us that's not a
big deal you can overcome various kinds of mistakes and
inaccuracies as long as you're open-minded but if you're closed-minded
and you get something wrong you're gonna be stuck with
it for the rest of your life see so that's
the more important factor here people naively assume that they
can reach the truth even when their mind is closed
a lot of scientists and materialists and atheists and rationalist
and skeptics fall into this trap this is the trap
that these debunkers fall into is they think that well
if something is true then surely it must be so
true that no matter how skeptical I am it will
overwhelm my skepticism and it will just prove itself to
me beyond a shadow of a doubt and my role
in this process is irrelevant this is extremely naive and
completely ignores the huge factor that psychology plays in discovering
truth the reality is is that denial is such a
strong psychological force that if you are willing to deny
something if you are willing to deny the truth you
can deny the truth successfully almost in all circumstances it's
shocking how powerful the human mind is at denying truth
you would think that well shouldn't there be a certain
amount of proof and logic and evidence that will convince
anybody and the answer is absolutely not if you want
to be in denial you can be in denial for
the rest of your life about almost any fact about
reality that's how strong your mind is at denial and
it's only when you appreciate that that then you start
to see the importance of open-mindedness the if you get
it stuck in your mind that something isn't true or
something is impossible and that that's lodged in there and
then you become a skeptic or a denier or a
debunk ER or a rat you become rational about it
you trying to develop logic that justifies why it's impossible
why it can't be true then that's gonna become a
self-fulfilling prophecy for you because your mind will reject and
ignore all evidence to the contrary and no evidence will
be able to get through to you see proof and
evidence requires experimentation experimentation and exploration and these are only
possible when you're open and willing to experiment and to
explore which requires open-mindedness even something like the fact that
the moon exists can easily be denied by a closed-minded
person you would think well how is that possible the
moon is up there you can just look and see
the moon in the night sky there it is the
full moon is so obvious who could possibly deny it
aha but that assumes that the person you're trying to
prove it to is open enough to actually be willing
to tilt his head up and point his eyes and
follow your finger to the moon and actually look at
it with his eyes that's that's a big assumption because
if someone is truly closed-minded you might say well there's
a moon and all you have to do is look
at my finger look I'm pointing at it up there
there it is just look at it and the person
will not do that and their rationale for not looking
at your finger and looking up at the skies they
will say that's preposterous there can't possibly be a moon
up there so it would be a waste of my
time to even look and in this way they're completely
trapped and they will never discover the moon but they're
so oblivious to this Mehta structural process to how their
own mind is shutting them off from reality that that
they think that they're actually being truthful and they think
that they're actually being open-minded because in their mind the
way they rationalize is themselves to say well but if
there was a moon surely it must be so obvious
that I would know it by now why don't I
know it if it exists surely I wouldn't have to
actually tilt my eyes up into the sky to see
a moon if a moon existed right this is essentially
how people think I mean it's preposterous in this example
I'm exaggerating but it's really not that far off same
sorts of problems were encountered by Galileo when he said
that there were moons around Jupiter his fellow intellectuals and
philosophers didn't believe him he told him looking to this
telescope that I invented looking the telescope and you'll see
the moons and do you think they looked in that
telescope of course not they denied the validity of a
telescope and of course that still happens to this day
I tell people go take some psychedelics you'll discover some
truth then of course people tell me oh but psychedelics
it's all just a hallucination why would I take psychedelics
and they never do because they're getting this whole thing
backwards if you want to understand something like psychedelics you
can't understand it from the position you're currently in first
you have to open your mind then you have to
realize that oh it's a new kind of experience I
have to go experience it then I can judge it
after the fact the problem is you're judging it before
the fact which means your mind is closed see proof
requires experimentation and exploration which is exactly what your mind
doesn't want to do how can you do the work
to prove or verify a thing which you believe is
impossible which your paradigm tells you is impossible which your
metaphysics or your epistemology tells you is impossible are you
gonna will be willing to invest time and energy and
money and resources into into doing that proof now of
course not and proof and here's another thing that that
many so-called materialists and scientists and rationals and skeptics don't
really understand about the notion of proof is that proof
often time requires a lot of work proof doesn't always
come easily sometimes you've got to work for years to
prove a thing sometimes it costs millions and billions of
dollars to prove a thing so actually there's very good
reason why many things that are true haven't been proven
because proof is hard work and are you willing to
do the work to prove a thing that you think
is impossible or highly unlikely no and that's exactly how
the truth hides from you because you're being lazy and
you're being close-minded and you're assuming a bunch of stuff
see if you know for a fact that God is
a man-made myth you can never test God if you
know for a fact that Christianity is the best truest
religion and Jesus Christ was the was the highest profit
you can never test the truth of that if you
know for a fact that reality is a material objective
system that exists independent of your mind you can never
test that see you have to open yourself to alternative
possibilities what if God is not a man-made myth what
if Christianity is not the best what if Jesus Christ
didn't even exist what if material reality is just something
you're imagining see if you open your mind to those
possibilities now there's a possibility of you going and testing
and maybe finding some proof for it but keep in
mind that necessarily happen easily might take years may take
decades I take a lot of work it might be
difficult emotionally and in other ways as well so let's
consider some more examples here we're gonna go through maybe
a dozen examples in a sort of rapid-fire all I
want you to do is I want you to just
open your mind to as many of these as possible
if you can and if you can't that's okay just
try to open your mind and notice how it feels
to either succeed in opening your mind here or resisting
it and closing down okay some of these examples will
be easier some of them will be harder some of
them will be quite outlandish on purpose alright so try
to do this and you could always rewind and come
back and do this over and over again so number
one open your mind to the possibility that Australia is
a hoax by which I mean that if you actually
take a plane and fly over Australia to where on
the map you would normally suppose there was Australia it
will just be ocean there would be no land there
you couldn't land consider that possibility and if you're Australian
and you live in Australia well just pick a different
country pick at your pan or pick Greenland and just
consider that they're hoaxes and that if you flew over
those countries there would be no land there so can
you do that try notice any resistance or excuses for
why that can't be true next example consider the possibility
that trump is a secret genius and that actually he's
highly intelligent he knows exactly what he's doing and that
every all of his bumbling and mumbling and all of
his shenanigans that you see ought to be all of
it is just an act and he's just acting that
way in order to guide mankind to the next evolution
some of you Trump supporters you you're already in total
agreement with me on that one right well for you
consider the opposite possibility that Trump is a total [
__ ] [ __ ] has no idea what he's
doing hoping your mind at that possibility notice what resistance
you have open your mind of the possibility that World
War two never happened open your mind to the possibility
that the Egyptian religion was the only true religion on
the planet and that all other ones are false now
let me just pause here to really explain what I
mean by taking this on as a possibility when you're
taking on this Egyptian religion example as a possibility like
you're really opening yourself up to the fact that this
is true that's what I mean when you actually do
this and your mind is capable of doing this there's
a sort of a shift that happens you used to
see the world in this one way and now you
open your mind to this alternative possibility it's almost like
an alternative reality or an alternative universe where it's like
whoa wow that would be amazing what if what if
the Egyptian religion was the only true one wow if
I like seriously consider that for a moment that feels
very different then where I was just a minute ago
with my old position now of course it may not
be true but that's a separate factor we're not interested
in what's true we're only interested right now in showing
you what it feels like to open your mind you
see that's separate from whether something is true or not
a thing doesn't have to be true for you to
open your mind to it that's the critical distinction that
I'm trying to teach you open your mind to the
possibility that you can become a millionaire not as a
theory not as a hypothetical not as a pipe dream
not by winning the lottery but actually you can you
really feel yourself being a millionaire that that's realistic for
you that you can actualize that try that see how
that feels for many people that's a radical possibility can
you open your mind to the possibility of attracting a
really beautiful girlfriend or boyfriend for many people that's a
radical possibility they have all sorts of excuses and reasons
for why it's just not possible but forget all those
and just open your mind for the next minute to
the possibility that you can do it how does that
feel notice whether excuses or resistance comes up notice your
mind closing down open your mind to the possibility that
God exists or doesn't exist whichever is the opposite of
what you hold right now so if you feel that
God exists I want you to open your mind to
the possibility that God does not exist and if you
believe that God doesn't exist open your mind of the
possibility that God does exist open your mind to the
possibility that you're fundamentally mistaken about God notice how that
feels of course it might be taboo in your culture
or in your religion or even in your academic institution
to take on this position that I'm asking you to
take on if you're a respectable scientist working in some
major university taking on the idea that God might exist
might be threatening to your career it might be very
taboo in that subculture notice that of course here if
of course if your Islamic taking on the idea that
Allah doesn't exist that's also very taboo but do it
anyways drop the fear or just open your mind to
the possibility see next open your mind to the possibility
that UFOs are real and that they are flying around
out there and that they're actually inhabited by aliens there's
aliens and those crafts open your mind to the possibility
that science and atheism are fundamentally wrong about reality you
see closed mindedness is not just a problem of religious
fanatics we all know religious fanatics are closed-minded what else
is new well what else is new what's more news
to people is discovering that actually scientists and atheists are
very dogmatic and closed-minded as well there's a lot of
things that science is not willing to open its mind
to which actually inhibits Sciences ability to do new high-quality
science because fundamentally science is not about taking one position
science is about the exploration of reality and discovering whatever
possibilities are out there but you can only explore those
possibilities seriously if you're open to them and there's a
long history of of ignorant closed-minded scientists who resisted exploring
new aspects of reality and therefore they held back science
it took some new scientists to come along to challenge
conventions and to to really question to really be open-minded
to make the new breakthroughs open your mind to the
possibility that evil does not exist at all that is
just a fabrication of your mind that means that the
most evil thing you can imagine imagine that it's not
actually evil open your mind of that possibility next open
your mind to the possibility that your memories are imaginary
that means your memory of childhood all that time you
spent with your mother and your father and your brother
and your sister and whatever that all of those are
just imaginary you're just hallucinating those they didn't actually happen
can you open your mind to that now open your
mind to the possibility that your country is evil whatever
country you're from whatever country you love what if your
country is actually the most evil country on the planet
open your mind now to that possibility how does that
feel there might be some resistance to that one next
open your mind to the possibility that you will get
reincarnated after your death as a rapist consider that possibility
can you just sit with that without resisting it open
your mind to the possibility that Hitler was actually a
force for good in the world consider that possibility seriously
consider it like what if that was actually true what
would that mean you see here part of the challenge
with this open-mindedness business is that sometimes to be open-minded
to such a significant possibility what it does it makes
you have to reevaluate your entire scheme of the world
because here you are you grew up thinking that Hitler
was the the evil one and you know he started
World War two for all sorts of selfish reasons and
then he was defeated and all of that was good
and you know good prevailed over evil bla bla bla
bla bla you believed all these stories and now all
the sudden you discover or you just even open your
mind to the possibility that Hitler was actually a force
of good and in the world and now whoa it's
like wait a minute if if that's true that means
all the other stuff I thought was true is wrong
are somehow mistaken I got to go back and figure
that out what what is really going I gotta think
through my history think through my schooling got a question
society question culture question a lot of stuff and see
that's exactly what you probably don't want to do which
is why you just find it much easier to close
off the possibility that Hitler was actually a force for
good in the world of course I'm not saying this
is true all I care about is opening your mind
to this possibility next imagine the possibility that Jesus Christ
never existed that he was just a fictional character that
was invented by other people whoa does that change your
perspective on things does that change your perspective on spirituality
on Christianity on enlightenment on awakening next consider the possibility
that the Buddha was not fully enlightened oh that's not
possible but how do you know how do you know
did you meet the Buddha are you yourself fully enlightened
how do you know what full enlightenment even is you
just assume didn't you isn't that all you did is
you just assumed the Buddha the Buddha was fully enlightened
now I'm not here saying he he was or he
wasn't I'm just interested in opening your mind to this
possibility so those are our list of examples of course
you can keep doing this exercise forever you can find
thousands of such examples and I recommend you play around
with this a bit more on your own but I
just want you to notice for now with these examples
notice what openness feels like notice what closedness feels like
and draw that experiential distinction between the two truth is
not the issue here but the issue here is resistance
and denial the issue is how your mind distorts reality
based upon preconceived prejudices and biases and what it needs
to be true see when your mind needs something to
be true it will fudge the facts and skew them
and distort them to create the picture that you need
to be true that's what scientists rationalists atheists and materialists
and skeptics don't really understand that's also of course what
religious people don't understand that's what New Age people and
many spiritual people don't understand they don't understand the power
of the mind to distort perception to create precisely the
sort of image or scenario or worldview that you want
you'd have to be very unbiased and objective in order
to avoid those distortions see my episode called self bias
for more about that topic it's important that when you're
opening your mind to these new possibilities that you really
take the possibilities as serious not just merely as mental
masturbation or armchair philosophy but like actually consider it now
of course the common objection that comes up here is
but Leo open-mindedness this is so dangerous because you're asking
me to believe in all this crazy stuff and then
what am I gonna do I'm gonna become a flat
earther I'm gonna become some kind of cult follower I'm
gonna turn into a religious fanatic or some new ager
or some loose minded person but actually these people are
closed-minded they're not open-minded people a flat earther is not
an open-minded person he's a close-minded person a cult follower
thought an open-minded person closed-minded person think of examples from
history of closed-minded people flat earthers religious fundamentalists cult leaders
racist white supremacist bigots homophobes transphobes nationalists nazis hitler the
spanish inquisition x' those who killed jesus anti-vaxxers climate change
deniers conspiracy theorists libertarians right-wingers read pillars all sorts of
bad scientists ignorant parents terrorists these were not open-minded people
these are closed minded people do you want to be
like these people or do you want to be open-minded
open-mindedness this is the mistake people make is they think
that open-mindedness means that now I'm gonna start believing in
stupid things no believing in stupid things as closed mindedness
see if you're open-minded you don't need to believe in
anything very strongly because you're willing to just explore the
entire intellectual landscape in a detached fashion coolly without much
bias or prejudice you're willing to explore stuff and then
what happens is that the truth can hit you whereas
if you lack closed mindedness what happens is that you
find the first one or two beliefs or worldviews that
you resonate with you laugh Shawn to them you sort
to believe in them you closed your mind around them
and then that's it you're stuck for the rest of
your life and the truth is never able to hit
you open-mindedness really is a it means mental flexibility it
means detachment and intellectual fearlessness closed mindedness is generated by
fear attachment the desire for power survival and the ego
mind closed mindedness comes from a certain agenda that your
mind has whereas open-mindedness is free of agenda you're just
willing to explore reality without needing it to be any
particular way and it's really only through that process that
you'll ever arrive at truth notice that the mind has
an inertia to it it accretes over time like a
snowball rolling down a hill it adds more and more
mass it becomes bigger and it develops a sort of
momentum of its own and then what happens is that
once the mind is sufficiently big enough it struggles to
change itself it's very difficult for the mind to then
change itself fundamentally the mind can make changes on the
periphery of the snowball but the very core of the
snowball is so densely packed and it's so integral to
the structure of the snowball that is very difficult to
penetrate through to it and to change the insides of
it I suggest that what has happened with your mind
it took the first 20 years of your life or
so to build up this snowball which was built up
in a certain culture that you grew up in it
was really just an accretion of cultural beliefs and opinions
and assumptions you accreted all of those and then that
formed the core of your mind and then from age
20 onwards you're basically living your life rolling downhill this
massive inertia and now when it comes to really using
your mind to be able to explore reality you can't
do it because the mind struggles to change itself think
of open mindedness as the minds willingness to change itself
the minds willingness to explore new ways that it could
be that it could see the world a closed mind
doesn't want to explore new ways to change itself it
doesn't want to see the world in new ways it's
focused rather on entrenching and defending its existing ways of
seeing the world because your life has actually been built
upon the ways in which you see the world you
see for example your career or your a marriage or
your relationship with your children or your relationship to business
or to politics or to science or to your religion
or to your church all of these relationships these are
real world relations it's not philosophy now we're talking about
real world relationships and situations that you have upon which
hinge your ability to earn money to have sex to
have positive emotions to have friends and so forth all
of these things hinge upon your worldview you see so
we're talking about changing worldviews we're not just talking about
armchair philosophy like we're sitting somewhere having a purely hypothetical
discussion about something no we mean that if we change
your worldviews sufficiently enough we're gonna change all those very
real tangible aspects of your life you might no longer
be able to live in the same country anymore you
may no longer be able to in the same house
with the same people you may no longer be able
to be married to the same spouse that you used
to be because now your world you has changed so
much that you couldn't live with yourself to live with
the same people in the same country in the same
house going to the same job doing the same things
that you did see so of course people are very
resistant to changing their worldviews because they fear what this
new world view what kind of repercussions it would have
for their real life and they're attached to their real
life you're attached to your friends your spouse to your
children to your job to your house to your country
to your religion to all this stuff and of course
changing all that stuff is uncomfortable and changing your mind
is uncomfortable admitting you're wrong is uncomfortable admitting that you've
wasted 10 or 20 years of your life going to
church praying to some false god that's uncomfortable admitting that
you've invested 20 years into science studying some sort of
scientific field which is fundamentally flawed based upon flawed metaphysical
or epistemic assumptions that's very painful and uncomfortable and you
don't know where that will place you in the future
you don't know you're gonna have to quit your job
and then what what are you gonna do you don't
know how are you gonna support your family how you
gonna feed your kids you don't know so you see
all of this seems like just philosophy but it's actually
much much more serious it's intimately tied with your survival
see my critical two-part series called understanding survival where we
talk about that so fundamentally open-mindedness is about the flexibility
and freedom of your mind how free is your mind
on a scale of one to ten how rigid or
flexible is your mind and I want you to contemplate
this is a bit of a homework assignment is what
are the problems that arise from having a rigid mind
see how many problems in society you can trace back
to having the rigid mind how many problems in politics
within religion within science within business how many personal problems
can you trace back to having a rigid mind problems
in your relationships emotional problems problems with money problems with
your career problems with your weight loss whatever how many
of those ultimately root themselves in having a rigid mind
you'll see that most of them do then that gets
you to now appreciate the the importance of flexibility of
mind which now gets you to see the importance of
radical open mindedness notice what it feels like to jump
and explore between different points of view and perspectives without
believing in any particular one this is a meta ability
it's a rare ability that few human beings cultivate it's
not really taught well in school or in church or
in business usually our society teaches us some one preferred
point of view one preferred philosophy one preferred ideology whether
that be in business at school at work whatever because
usually exploring different points of view this takes time it
doesn't give you immediate payoff it's not immediately profitable for
example if you want to become enlightened the fastest path
could be to just go and pick one school of
thought about enlightenment one spiritual school and just do everything
they tell you to do and don't consider any other
school or any other teaching just pick one teacher one
guru stick to him and there you go and that's
what most people do but of course you see the
problem with this is that what if you pick the
wrong one how would you know after all how would
you know you've picked the right one because the only
way honestly you could know if you picked the right
one is if you've explored the ball then you're in
a position where you can evaluate them you can contrast
compare them and then you can pick the right one
and sort of like shopping for a vacuum cleaner how
do you know you got the best deal only if
you shopped around at many stores then you can have
a sense of the fact that you got the best
deal but if you are just gonna go and buy
only one vacuum cleaner the first one that you see
that you lay your eyes on chances are pretty good
you might get fleeced see and that's exactly how people
get themselves into religious and spiritual cults is that they
just assume that well this gurus right Juan this religions
are i-1 they just go full in on all in
on that they don't consider any other alternatives and then
they end up getting themselves screwed and this even happens
when you pick a relatively good and lightened teacher you
could pick some enlightened teacher and follow him completely but
the problem will still be that any limitations or weaknesses
or biases that that enlightened teacher has they will transfer
and rub off on to you because you're not thinking
for yourself you're just blindly following him this is the
problem that I have with people who just blindly follow
the Buddha or blindly follow Christ or blindly follow Mooji
or Rupert Spira or Eckhart Tolle it's not that Eckhart
Tolle or Rupert spear are bad teachers or bad people
they're not but if you think that they're going to
give you the full scope of what spiritual work is
you're in for a rude awakening they won't they're going
to give you a partial picture and if you're not
willing to explore if you're not intellectually curious and open-minded
enough to consider possibilities like well maybe Rupert's spirit is
not at the highest level of realization I mean maybe
he is but maybe he isn't but if you're not
open to that possibility you're stuck you see and there's
no way you could know unless you go around and
you explore and you try different things but when you
do that there's a cost to that the cost is
time energy and confusion it's confusing to consider many different
points of view you don't get that immediate sense of
certainty and resolution because if you just go devote yourself
to one guru and you just say okay that's my
guru and I'm just gonna do everything he says and
just he's the most enlightened one and that's it and
there's nothing there's nothing I'm gonna miss by by being
fully devoted to him I'm that's gonna take me all
the way to the highest awakening if that's what you
believe from the very GetGo first of all notice that's
just a belief it's just an assumption there's no proof
for that you didn't actually derive that through experimentation and
exploration you just assumed it why did you assume it
because it's a very convenient assumption you need to do
a lot less work now you can just blindly follow
that person like a sheep and then you won't even
know what you've missed because you've closed yourself up off
to other possibilities so jumping around between different points of
view is a meta ability it's a rare ability and
it's something that closed-minded people are fundamentally incapable of they're
incapable of switching points of view on a dime if
they could do that they would be radically open-minded people
and it can be confusing and disorienting to rapidly change
points of view because the points of view they all
clash and contradict each other and then you don't know
who's right which point of view is superior to which
one should I be using this point of view as
the highest one or that one you don't know and
who do you ask can you go and ask some
guru to tell you which point of view is the
best one well no because if you ask some guru
that assumes that you take his point of view is
the absolute one so see you're sort of left in
this um in this sea of confusion in relativity and
then most people don't like that because the mind loves
certainty the mind wants a sense of direction something tangible
that it can bite onto and so that's usually what
it does is it it isn't it doesn't want to
be swimming in this sea of uncertainty so it just
picks a thing sticks to it and then convinces itself
that that's the right course and I'm not saying you
can't get results that way you can get results if
you're lucky and you happen to choose the right person
the right guru the right school maybe you will go
all the way to full awakening or whatever maybe you'll
earn billions of dollars if you choose the right business
guru maybe you will have sex with hundreds of women
if you choose the right dating coach or whatever but
also you could choose some cult leader who will guide
you towards something very harmful and how will you know
who's the cult leader who's not only through the experience
gained through exploring different points of view and being open-minded
if you happen to be a rather open-minded person by
default which you probably are if you're following my content
then be careful with the following mistake this is a
great mistake that open-minded people make this is a mistake
that I've made in my life because I'm I tend
to be rather open-minded by default is that as it
open-minded person you tend to assume that other people are
as open-minded as you are and you tend to assume
that it will if it's easy for you to think
relativistically and jump between different points of view that other
people can do it too and here's that's the mistake
no they can't the majority of mankind is that such
a level of cognitive development that they are incapable of
jumping between different points of view the way that you
and I and that doesn't mean they're evil people it
just is what it is and even if you are
open-minded you can still appreciate that there are other aspects
of life that you're not open-minded about like you could
be open-minded within the realm of spirituality but then you're
gonna be closed-minded within some other sphere you see like
I said you have to really look at on a
case-by-case basis get really micro with it one of the
things I want you to take away from this episode
I want you to start to feel and to notice
in every instance where your mind is being closed you
have to develop that feeling ability by going through these
exercises by self reflecting by doing some meditation whatever some
kind of mindfulness work it's especially helpful when you're in
a kind of a ideological debate or an argument with
somebody a friend a family member somebody on some online
forum whatever here is some ideological debate it's really important
to notice when you get wrapped up emotionally in that
debate and you start to defend your position and then
you start to notice so how it feels kind of
dirty your mind is kind of closing down and you're
just trying to defend that position even though now you
can almost tell there's a deeper layer of your mind
which kind of knows that you're you're being ideological and
you're going too far and you're pushing your position too
much you're not really hearing the other side you're not
really considering the other point of view but you just
keep pushing and pushing and pushing you've been there we've
all been there even the best and most open-minded of
us have been there and it's in those moments that
I want you to awaken and to realize oh this
is what I'm doing this is that close-mindedness stuff that
Leo was talking about I'm being defensive I'm going on
the counter-attack I'm being argumentative why am i doing that
and then get curious about that and explore deeper that
is what you got it that's the work that you
do to become open minded I did a lot of
that work when I was a teenager when I was
doing philosophy just by myself and that's ultimately what allowed
me to get to the point where I'm at today
is doing that work most people cannot switch points of
view easily in the same way that most people simply
can't juggle they didn't learn how they never practiced it
nobody taught them this stuff is generally not taught in
school why does the mine tend to get closed because
you have something to lose in letting go of a
belief or a point of view your beliefs and points
of views are not just frivolous things they are intimately
tied with your survival so to let go of a
belief or a point of view usually means a threat
to your survival and of course when you feel threatened
you get scared and when you're scared you get defensive
and then by that point truth has completely flown out
the window now you're not really following the truth now
you're just defending some bias you have because you need
it to turn out some particular way because that's what
you need in order to keep feeding your family or
to keep maintaining your friends or to sustain your marriage
or whatever see once the mind constructs an identity out
of a belief or a worldview then the mind becomes
closed about it because anything you create an identity out
of anything you attach yourself to it feels like it's
you so if you take a fundamentalist Christian or Muslim
and you ask them to stop believing in their prophet
and in their holy book they can't do it they
literally can't do it because it's such a huge part
of their identity because it's been so brainwashing to them
it's such a huge part of their identity losing it
feels like losing a part of themselves and so of
course their mind becomes closed to it and again this
is not exclusive to just religious fanatics this is also
true of scientists take a scientist like I don't know
Neil deGrasse Tyson or Sean Carroll or Richard Dawkins take
one of these scientists and and you'll see that they
suffer from the exact same problem because they've created an
identity out of science especially this guy Neil deGrasse Tyson
he's created such a huge identity and career out of
science that his identity his career his life his family
his ability to feed his children if he has them
I don't know it probably he does I assume all
of them are this is all so intertwined his celebrity
his fame his status his money his sex all of
it is intertwined so much with this you see it's
such an incestuous relationship that he can't seriously question science
because if he ever seriously questioned science his whole world
would crumble he would have an existential crisis he would
find himself sitting in a dark corner in his room
with a revolver playing Russian roulette because he would have
such an existential crisis you see how are you that
way in your life so Neil deGrasse Tyson's mind is
closed to certain things now generally he's open mind about
many things but he's also closed-minded to many things higher
things I say mystical things non-dual things so his mind
is closed [Music] because the enemy of the great is
the good when you have a good worldview it's hard
to drop it for a better world view for an
awesome world view for an infinite world view for something
beyond worldview entirely see because your life hinges on it
the minds job remember is to construct reality the mind
doesn't just think about reality the mind is actively engaged
in the process of constructing reality so one of the
reasons that it gets so rigid is in order to
fulfill its function of construction in order for the mind
to construct reality effectively it has to construct reality and
then deny that it constructed reality why does it have
to deny it because if it admits that it constructed
the reality then what it calls reality doesn't really feel
like reality anymore it feels like an illusion it feels
like a fabrication see science a scientist doesn't want to
admit that he's fabricating science he wants to say that
no no no no Leo I didn't fabricate gravity gravity
is something that's out in the world I just discovered
it I'm just reporting facts that's not what's actually happening
you are fabricating gravity in such profound ways you don't
even comprehend how you're doing it but that's precisely the
function of the mind is to do it but not
know how it's doing it thereby you get reality if
you knew how you were doing it it wouldn't be
reality anymore it would be what it would be your
creation if you knew how you constructed all of this
everything if you knew how you created time space people
animals planets stars galaxies universe's history future technology atoms molecules
viruses if you knew all that reality would not look
like reality to you anymore so you're playing games constructing
reality while denying that you're doing so because it's a
lot of responsibility to accept that you're creating reality that
means you're creating your own suffering you're creating your own
victim mindset you're creating your own hatred your own negative
emotions your own depression your own sadness your own incapability
you're creating all of that that's a lot to accept
you don't want to accept it so you deny that
you're doing it and honestly you're not conscious of how
you're doing it so it's not just that you're lying
you're lacking in consciousness - first and foremost you're lacking
in consciousness so in a certain sense you're innocent but
basically fear of letting go of mental positions creates a
paradigm lock I've talked about paradigm lock see my older
episode called how paradigms work I believe it's called important
one I talked about the concept of paradigm lock paradigm
lock basically just means that you have a certain paradigm
or a certain entire worldview or system how you see
the world and then every worldview has a sort of
a locking mechanism that locks you into that world view
the world view itself think of the world youths office
is almost like a survival organism for it to survive
it has to lock itself in and maintain its survival
the way it does that is sort of by infecting
your mind and then instilling you with fear that if
you leave this world to you that something bad is
gonna happen to you this is actually a classic tactic
that cult leaders use is that they will program new
members into the cult they will use mind-control techniques to
instill deep fear of how terrible their life will be
if they leave the cult and in this way they're
able to sort of blackmail and hold cult members hostage
because they've they spent months programming them with ideas like
well if you leave this cult then you're gonna lose
your family you're gonna lose your spouse you're gonna lose
opportunities for sex you're gonna lose your income you're gonna
lose everybody who loves you you're gonna lose all your
friends you're gonna lose everything basically your whole life will
be so bad that you'll want to kill yourself and
then of course how can you leave once your mind
has been programmed with all that fear and that's that's
the same sort of dynamic by the way see my
two-part series called cult psychology which is really profound goes
into a lot of these sneaky tactics that that cults
use and also part two talks about how it applies
to more generally to outside of traditional cults and into
more mainstream society because cult psychology is not limited to
only cults which is sort of a perfect segue here
because see every worldview in a sense uses some form
of sneaky cult psychology to hold you hostage to it
for example if you're born in Islamic country you're gonna
be programmed with the Islamic world view the Islamic paradigm
and and you know part of that paradigm is the
fear of going to hell if you ever question the
paradigm or if you ever dare to question Allah or
if you ever dare to question Muhammad or if you
ever dare to leave Islam see every worldview tries to
not every there are exceptions there are some world views
that are better than others so I don't want to
paint too broad of a brush here but uh but
most world views what they do is they have a
locking mechanism that locks you in with fear that closes
your mind down religion is guilty of this but science
is also guilty of this logic is guilty of this
the mainstream culture is guilty of this capitalism is guilty
of this even the notion of sanity is guilty of
this see what you consider sanity is actually a worldview
a sort of a paradigm that you're locked into and
to venture outside of the norms of what you would
consider sane and others around you and your culture consider
sane that scares you it terrifies you what would your
family think of you if you went beyond the boundary
of sanity what would you think of yourself if you
went beyond the boundary of sanity see you're gonna be
afraid and that locks you into whatever paradigm you call
sanity but what is sanity sanity is whatever culture tells
you it is so in order to really free your
mind and to be able to go to the deepest
levels of understanding you have to be able to bust
through these paradigm locks which first means you have to
be able to recognize their structure see them become aware
enough of them then you have to be willing to
jump between different paradigms not get attached to any one
of them and you have to be willing to call
a call the bluff of the paradigm see the paradigms
Bluff is that it's telling you the hey if you
leave Islam you're gonna you're gonna suffer in hell if
you question science then you're gonna become some sort of
Fringe lunatic and you're gonna lose your professorship if you
question logic you're gonna become some illogical nutcase conspiracy theorist
if you question sanity you're gonna end up in a
mental asylum if you question capitalism you're going to become
some sort of communist - you know radical and if
you question mainstream culture you're gonna become some weirdo and
nobody's gonna marry you or want to be friends with
you you know whatever fear and you have to say
oh yeah I call your [ __ ] bluff I
call your bluff show me what you got let me
challenge religion let me challenge science let me challenge logic
let me challenge the mainstream let me challenge capitalism let
me challenge sanity and let me see where it leads
me and that comes with open-mindedness and how many people
are willing to do that very very few see your
mind is playing a self deception game see my three
part series called self deception where I outline many self
deception mechanisms of which this topic here is one the
game that your mind is playing is that it tells
itself that your mind is open and open to proof
and evidence when it really isn't your mind is only
open to proof and evidence on your terms you see
here's one of the things that people don't understand about
closed mindedness when you are closed-minded it's not that you're
close minded and telling yourself that you're closed-minded you're lying
to yourself about it so if you ask some Christian
fundamentalist hey are you close-minded is he gonna tell you
yes of course not he's gonna tell you no no
I'm an I'm a totally open-minded person I'm very reasonable
I'm very logical I'm very evidence-based that's what any ideological
fundamentalist will tell you ask a capitalist are you open-minded
of course I am ask Islamic rabbi or Islamic Imam
are you open mind he'll say of course I am
but what he really means is yes he's open-minded on
his terms on the terms of his paradigm so he's
open to evidence and proof so long as it completely
validates his existing paradigm yes in that sense he's open-minded
but that's not real up in - of course that's
a perversion that's closed mindedness because to be truly open-minded
means you're willing question your paradigm you're willing to consider
proof and evidence which is outside of what you would
even consider valid proof and valid evidence because after all
what is valid proof what is valid evidence where did
you get these notions are these notions that were handed
down to mankind by God as to what constitutes valid
proof no these are highly relative subjective and contentious notions
what's valid evidence and proof to one person isn't to
another that's the whole problem so how do we adjudicate
this problem how do we know whose standards of proof
and evidence are the right ones this is a very
deep epistemic problem I've talked about in the past about
my in my episodes about epistemology I don't recall all
their titles at this point you have to go back
and search through my catalog but they're there this is
a very deep of a stomach problem so whatever paradigm
you adopt your paradigm is shaping the fundamental criteria of
what you consider valid and valid proof and evidence and
legitimate and illegitimate right and wrong and good and bad
and sane and insane and so forth see the paradigm
is reinforcing itself it's sort of like a vortex spinning
inside of a of a medium like like a tornado
or like a whirlpool in your shower in your bathtub
see and and you're kind of like a little particle
stuck in that whirlpool and your job is to break
free of it because that's not the only whirlpool there's
many whirlpools in this giant sea this ocean of consciousness
many whirlpools and you're just stuck in one of them
and the only way you're going to break out of
a whirlpool is by being open-minded and curious enough to
explore go explore others and the more of them you
explore the more it's gonna open your mind more and
more and more and more and you're gonna see that
oh man I thought I had everything figured out when
I was in this whirlpool and then I went to
this other whirlpool and it was bigger and grander and
more interesting and now I have to to compare and
then I went to a third one and it was
even different and fourth fifth to 6 and each one
opens you more and more and more see so what
you really need to be open-minded to is not making
surface level changes to your paradigm but fundamentally reevaluating the
core of your paradigm which is exactly what most people
are close minded to so the self-deception game at your
mind is playing is that it's pretending as though it's
open but it's only open on the surface it's open
to surface level change it's not open to structural change
it's not open to really questioning the paradigm so be
careful when your mind tells you that you're an open-minded
person consider the possibility that maybe you're lying to yourself
after all it's very convenient to tell yourself you're an
open-minded person cuz hey if I adopt the identity that
I'm an open-minded person and I become very close minded
about the fact that I'm an open-minded person and I
believe I'm very open-minded but actually I'm just a fundamentalist
Christian or I'm just a materialist scientist or I'm just
a capitalist or I'm whatever but I fancy myself open-minded
that's extremely convenient because that's part of my paradigm now
is that I'm open-minded and that my paradigm is actually
very open like science loves to fool itself to think
that all science is totally open leo science is open
to all evidence and all proof if it's true science
will adopt it and accept it and and love it
no it won't that's an extremely convenient feature of that
paradigm which lets it get away with actually being closed
because when you tell yourself that you're so open that
means that when you're actually gonna close something off you
have to deny it completely in your mind you have
to actually shut it out of your awareness and so
that becomes a super convenient feature of a paradigm to
just completely block out all other possibilities it just the
the paradigm basically it's almost like a parasite in your
mind and then it and it becomes monopolistic it tries
to monopolize your entire mind so the problem with something
like Christianity or Islam isn't is not it's not merely
that it's a mind virus it's a monopolistic mind virus
it just completely overtakes everything it's like a cancer in
your mind same thing with something like libertarianism or with
right-wing ideologies also some left-wing ideology as well like Marxism
sometimes it just completely monopolized as a person's mind to
the point where they can't see anything but through a
Marxist lens or they can't see anything but through a
libertarian lens or through a Christian lens or through an
Islamic lens or through a materialist scientific lens or through
a skeptic lens or through a rational lens and none
of that will get you to the deepest understandings of
reality all of that is limited because fundamentally why you're
monopolizing this and why your claim to all this up
is because it's coming from selfishness it's coming from limited
consciousness it's coming from attachment and from bias see closed
mindedness is fundamentally a weakness it's fear and open-mindedness is
fundamentally a strength it's love and these are two opposite
forces that are at work in your life in many
different domains and spheres this is just one of them
this is in the intellectual sphere now we're talking about
fear and love and the sphere of exploring one's intellect
in the operation of the mind what is the connection
between closed mindedness and self bias well closed mindedness is
there to defend self bias it's because you have biases
and by the way see my episode called self bias
where I explained that the reason you have self bias
is because you have a survival agenda because you're a
living organism we need to survive as a finite thing
as whatever you believe that you are that needs to
be survived and defended so your self bias is of
course they're all false they're all biases true that's completely
unbiased so you're sort of operating from a position of
bias and falsehood and therefore your mind needs to close
off to defend those self biases from from what from
from an assault from the outside by truth closed minuses
is like the the moat around the castle that is
built to protect the castle from getting assaulted from forces
from the outside otherwise the castle would be destroyed and
you might say oh well that's terrible why would I
want my castle destroyed well but what if you're very
confined living in a tiny little limited castle and there's
a giant vast Kingdom and world for you to explore
out there jungles and deserts and forests and mountains and
all this but you're living just on this little island
surrounded by a moat in this tiny little one-bedroom castle
and that's your whole life and you only look outside
the windows of your castle and what you see there
is you you take that for what the world is
but there's so much beyond that you haven't seen because
you're afraid to leave your castle so in this case
actually letting down the drawbridges and and dismantling the moat
to let the forces from outside you know attack you
and and destroy your castle it seems like it's a
terrible thing but actually it's a good thing let your
science get crumbled let your Christianity and your Islam get
crumbled let your capitalist philosophies get crumbled and your libertarian
ones get crumbled because that's not the truth that's not
ultimate understanding see all worldviews are self biased and they
all serve some survival function and because you don't want
to admit that because you want to keep being self
biased you want to keep being selfish that's why you
close your mind because if you open your mind you
would at some point have to admit oh my god
my worldview is so selfish it's so [ __ ]
selfish I have to relinquish it I can't live this
way anymore with all these biases so the only way
your self biases can survive is when you ignore them
and you sweep them under the rug and you aren't
conscious about them and the way you do that is
through the mechanism of closed mindedness now a common refrain
that I hear is people say Oh leo all this
open-mindedness is good but but you're taking it too far
after all we should be open-minded but we don't want
to be so open-minded that our brains fall out right
that's precisely wrong it sounds cute when you say it
it sounds nice like oh yeah be open-minded but not
so open-minded your brains fall out but actually this is
again what is this but fear it's fear it's fear
that's what that is you want to be so open-minded
that eventually you realize you don't even have a brain
your brain is a hallucination try to get to that
point become so open-minded that it kills you one day
try to get to that point become so open-minded you
have nothing left to defend intellectually people don't realize that
attachment to ideas beliefs and worldviews is one of the
greatest delusions and one of the most strongest forces in
society and in life you think people get attached to
their cars and their material possessions and people and things
and children money of course they do but even more
so they get attached to ideas beliefs and worldviews and
it's really really hard to let those go it's one
of the ultimate illusions of life because it's so central
to how we construct our reality see you can lose
a child you can lose a million dollars you can
lose a car you can lose a house you can
lose some material possession you can lose a spouse girlfriend
boyfriend you can lose these things and it sure it'll
hurt you it might even change you in some way
transform you a little bit grow you but but it's
not gonna like really shake the foundations of what you
consider reality but that's not the case with beliefs ideas
and worldviews there are certain beliefs ideas and worldviews that
you can question so deeply and let go of so
fully that it will literally change physical reality like I'm
not kidding it's possible that you become so open-minded that
you realize you don't have a brain open your mind
to that possibility so closed mindedness is one of the
top self deception mechanisms so this episode here will pair
very nicely as a follow-up to my three part series
on self deception go check that one out because this
is all you have to understand that this whole topic
is all within the context of self deception everything we're
talking about here to really unravel what life is and
how it works self deception is the key understanding self
deception your own self deception is the key because you're
constantly being deceived by yourself because that's what needs to
happen for you to construct a reality here's the key
insight that you should remember is that the truth requires
no defending the more truthful you are the less defensive
you are when you are really deeply conscious of the
truth all your defenses drop away all desire to argue
drops away all desire to prove others wrong drops away
all desire to be right drops away it's not needed
because you're so deeply grounded in the truth that you
know the truth is completely unshakable and because it's eternal
and it's completely unshakable is completely unquestionable it's completely absolute
it needs no defending because nothing can touch it now
the ego mind compensates for not having access to this
absolute truth by being defensive arrogant strident obnoxious critical ideological
and overly confident it's a sort of a facade of
confidence this sort of macho facade if I'm right I
have the truth when really all that just reveals is
that you don't have the because if you really have
the truth you wouldn't need to put on an act
of how much truth you have you would just silently
bask in the truth you wouldn't need to convince anybody
of it you wouldn't need to go on some crusade
or on some jihad now you might still be wondering
but Leo can open-mindedness go too far what happens if
I become so open-minded and then I go down the
rabbit hole start believing all sorts of fringe theories and
then just waste a bunch of my time and and
so on well here's the thing open-mindedness has to be
tempered by being grounded in direct experience and also by
being honest when you truly don't know something so the
difference between what I'm telling you here and something like
a flat earther philosophy or some conspiracy theory that's like
alex jones style stuff or david icke or whatever the
difference between between what i'm telling you and that is
that yes you're open-minded but also you're honest with yourself
about what is actually truly in your direct experience so
somebody tells you there's reptilians overlords who are conspiring to
dominate mankind and all of this okay but are you
conscious of these reptilian overlords are they in your correct
experience if not then you have to be honest about
that and then you have to say to yourself I
don't know I don't know if there are reptilian overlords
and then this is what now grounds you and it
keeps you from floating off into all sorts of fantasy
that is possible if you're open-minded but then you're you're
you're not paying close attention to direct experience then you
can veer off into fantasy and you can start believing
into ghosts and UFOs and this and that and all
sorts of crazy stuff and then you get lost now
that becomes a distraction in and of itself and conspiracy
theories are very toxic and very cancerous and problematic I'll
probably cover that in several episode in the future so
yeah you do have to be careful open-mindedness is not
a license for wishful thinking wild speculation it's not a
license for just guesswork we're it's like well I think
that there's some crazy [ __ ] happening over there
I haven't seen it I have an experience that I
haven't verified any of it but I just all believe
it it's like no that's fantasy that's not your direct
experience so you do have to be very ruthless with
keeping yourself grounded in direct experience but also open because
your direct experience can change significantly so you have to
be open to that open-mindedness is also not a license
for us versus them fear-based conspiracy theories I see and
here a lot of these lately were there some secret
cabal of people some overlords and elites who are taking
control of the earth and it's us versus them the
little guys versus the big guys you know it's it's
the populous versus the globalists it's the it's the progressives
versus the neoliberals it's the whatever the humans versus the
reptilians you know stuff like this this this just reeks
of fear and us versus them you know sort of
dualistic thinking so again is this really truly in your
Gretsch experience are you just projecting these overlords and these
lists how many these elitists have you actually met have
you actually gone and talked to the CEO a fortune
500 company have you sat down had a three-hour conversation
with that CEO and actually got his perspective about business
and the economy and how to run a company and
what kind of problems exist with running a giant corporation
no none of this is your direct experience you just
have theories and projections and you're just projecting your angst
and survival needs on to what you see in the
news and stuff like that this is not direct experiences
is not true up in mindedness this is wild speculation
and projection which is actually a form of closed mindedness
which is why all these conspiracy theorists are actually really
close minded people when you guys start to have conversations
with them they get very closed you can actually feel
that energy of them they get kind of hot agitated
neurotic they start to attack they start to you know
become unreasonable and calling you names and things and they
start protesting and you know kicking and screaming and bitching
and moaning all of these are signs of ego this
is not how a conscious open-minded person behaves that's grounded
in truth grounded in love grounded in consciousness grounded selflessness
whose transcended fear all these conspiracy years are fear-based which
is why don't track traffic in them so you also
have to be careful because the ego loves says this
to the devil yo devil same thing the ego loves
to co-opt open-mindedness in order to spread its own ideology
conspiracy theories and to fear monger so see somebody else
will come here say oh well Leo you're not open
to flatter you're not truly open you're making fun of
flat-earthers but I'm a flat earther and I know flatter
that's right and that's because I'm open minded in Leo
you're see leo look at how hypocritical you are you're
sitting up here and you're telling us to be open-minded
but you leo you're actually closed-minded because you don't believe
in my anti-vaccine theories and you don't believe in Alex
Jones and you don't believe in David Icke and you
don't believe in this and you don't believe in that
but open-mindedness and does not believe that I does not
mean that I'm going to believe and all the fear-based
[ __ ] that you believe in see and also
I'm not perfectly open-minded like I said in my series
on self deception self deception is always operative no matter
who you are how smart you are how conscious you
are how enlightened you are it's always operative you always
have to be on guard and careful with self-deception so
I'm always capable of self-deception sometimes I am close-minded and
I apply the lessons that I'm teaching you how do
you think I learned these lessons by observing my own
closed mindedness I didn't read this in any book I
spent years observing my own closed mindedness and my own
ignorance and have learned these lessons and now I'm imparting
them to you and so even though I learned these
lessons I'm not perfect at executing them sometimes I am
close-minded about certain things so again it's not about a
binary of being open or closed it's about how open-minded
are you how well do you apply it how good
are you at noticing when you're being closed and then
opening yourself back up there's an emotional challenge that comes
with open-mindedness and that's like I said it leaves you
in a sort of a uncertain place where you're sort
of like a leaf blowing in the wind without firm
resolution it can be harder to make decisions because you
have to constantly keep weighing things it's like well there's
you know the Christians tell us this is true and
the Muslims tell us that's true and the Hindus tell
us this is true and then science tells us that
that's true and some other scientist says the opposite thing
and then somebody else does something else Who am I
gonna believe and it's like well I don't know who
to believe so I don't know what to do whereas
if all you did was used to okay I'm just
gonna believe in Christ and that's it and I'm just
gonna believe in Christianity and I'm just gonna become an
evangelical well okay that makes you very decisive you don't
have to keep weighing all these factors it's it's a
much simpler way of approaching life so what I'm talking
about here is much more multi-dimensional and complex it's a
spa dynamic stage yellow approach to reality multi-perspective oh yeah
it's tier two much more complex than tier 1 tier
one is you you choose one ideology one world you
just stick with it and you go all in on
it so this is stage yellow stuff more difficult more
complex each stage the spiral becomes more and more complex
if you don't know what the hell I'm talking about
go check out my multi series multi-part series called spiral
dynamics where I have different colored stages and explain those
in a lot of depth see one of the benefits
of having a closed mind is that you don't need
to reevaluate anything it just constantly builds upon itself it
doesn't take anything away never does any deconstructive work it
only adds more so if you're a Christian you just
add more Christianity on top of the snowball and it's
just a giant growing snowball of Christianity which eventually you
know after decades of that it turns into into something
quite ugly veers completely off track from truth and consciousness
and love whereas with an open mind you're constantly having
to reevaluate yourself your constant having to consider whether you're
fooling yourself you're considering considering other points of view exploring
this stuff and that takes more energy more work but
also there's payoffs to that here's other insight I'll give
you how do you open someone's mind let's say you're
dealing with an ignorant person let's say your mother or
your father you're trying to explain enlightenment to them or
something God or whatever you're trying to explain to them
and they just they're not seeing it how do you
open their mind in one word imagination imagination is an
extremely powerful tool that most people overlook and poopoo because
you know it's just imaginary but then again everything's imaginary
so that just shows you how powerful imagination is so
what you do to open somebody's mind is you get
them to imagine a new possibility and you try to
do it in a non confrontational non-threatening manner so rather
than telling some Christian at all the Bible is [
__ ] cuz that that's just gonna further close his
mind rather than doing that if you really want to
open his mind present him with subtle possibilities that he
can imagine better beyond his paradigm not too far beyond
but a little bit beyond that pushed the boundaries of
his paradigm so how might that look well you might
say well imagine for example like where were you bored
you might ask him where were you born oh you
were born somewhere in Kentucky okay and you're an evangelical
okay so what do you think would happen imagine what
if instead of being born in Kentucky you were born
in the Middle East would you still be an evangelical
try to imagine that like really imagine it that's a
very powerful exercise that will quickly open your mind of
course he's probably gonna have defenses because the minds not
gonna give up so easily but still you can you
can kind of keep prodding like this with these imagination
exercises if you're a teacher if you're a professor in
a college or university if you're teaching young children in
school or high schoolers or whatever middle school if you're
trying to get your parents to understand something come up
with ways where you can phrase it as the following
can you imagine blank and then fill in that blank
with whatever imagine this imagine that like for example let's
say that there are some some libertarian types who think
that this coronavirus that we're dealing with right now hmm
at all well the coronavirus is not such a big
deal let's just reopen the country everybody just going back
to the beaches and schools and all this sort of
stuff but then you ask so you can say okay
so do you do you have a family do you
have a daughter do you have a son it's like
oh you have a daughter okay how old is your
daughter oh she's she's eight years old okay and how
do you love your daughter okay you love your daughter
very much okay how would you feel if if when
your daughter was in school your daughter's teacher for example
went out to a club or to a to a
bar at night she was just you know letting off
some steam having some drinks after work whatever teachers can
do that and then she caught the virus and then
she she brought it back to school and then your
daughter got it and then your daughter gets it and
then imagine that you know you have a you know
grandmother okay and then your daughter hangs out with your
grandmother on the weekends okay imagine that she gives it
to your grandmother imagine imagine your daughter lying in a
hospital bed with a ventilator down her throat slowly suffocating
while you're sitting by her bedside crying imagine that actually
imagine that if you can get that person to actually
imagine that that is what will change their mind you
see the whole function of closed mindedness is to prevent
the imagination so as long as you can get a
person to imagine something that already expands the boundaries of
of whatever ideology or paradigm they had because their ideology
is sort of a mental thing it lives in the
level of thoughts and beliefs and stuff but the imagination
is actually more powerful than that imagination is a very
powerful force but oftentimes because people are so bad at
using it independently you have to guide them to it
like really guide them step by step through all the
details imagine have them imagine a scenario compelling powerful emotional
scenario like that and then watch them get moved watch
them watch their mind change watch their paradigm expand so
this is this is part of what we might call
spiral wit wizardry or you start to get good at
dealing with other stages other people you kind of meet
them where they're at see where their limitations are come
up with a scenario that they could imagine that helps
them to then open their mind to new possibilities that
then they can then pursue you see you can't really
pursue something until you can first imagine it you can't
even go to the [ __ ] grocery store unless
you can first imagine it you can't go to Australia
you can't take a nice vacation in Australia unless you
can imagine it and the more vividly and compelling your
vision is gonna be the more likely you are to
actually get online and purchase a ticket and actually fly
there see and the nice thing about imagination is that
it imaginary just kind of playful and usually you can
get people to imagine so you can even get closed-minded
people to imagine stuff like you can even take a
you know some sort of fundamentalist Muslim and then just
kind of walk him slowly through an imagination exercise where
he really imagines the possibility that for example the the
Quran was not you know the Word of God handed
down by God but was actually written by by some
guy you know if you kind of get him to
really imagine through that that will kind of break down
some of his beliefs of course there probably still be
resistance but I'm not saying this is foolproof again there's
no there's no there's no force on earth strong enough
to overcome a mind that is in complete denial and
it's so close that it doesn't want to budge there's
nothing you can do about that but you can use
tricks most people are not that closed-minded you can use
little tricks to open people up and this this helps
you to be a better communicator if you want to
be a public speaker if you want to be persuasive
if you want to argue well if you want to
reason well with people if you want to convince people
if you want to motivate people if you want to
be a leader a great leader you have to give
people vision powerful compelling positive loving vision of the future
see and like for example if you're dealing with this
Muslim person and you know he's really stuck in his
fundamentalism and he's really struggling to let go and he's
in fear you can you can guide him with a
positive vision of like imagine the freedom you would experience
if you actually surrender your ideology about Allah and then
it's not that imagine that rather than imagining that you're
gonna forsake Allah and then Allah will cast you into
Hell or something like this and that you will be
lost without Allah no no imagine this imagine you let
go of the idea of Allah but then in its
place what you get is an actual direct connection with
Allah imagine that see now that makes it much more
palatable for that person to consider stepping beyond the bounds
of his narrow belief based ideology cuz you're you're taking
away the idea ideology but you're giving him some replacement
you're not just and you're not just blaming him for
being an idiot or something like that see so similar
like if you're a scientifically minded or an atheistic we
might a person imagine this and now this finally leads
to how I want to demonstrate this to you so
this is how we're gonna end this episode and this
is not just for scientists and atheists but really for
all of you um this is your ultimate open-mindedness exercise
you ready here we go I want you to open
your mind to the possibility of infinity infinity not a
number not a collection of numbers actual infinity open your
mind to the possibility of unlimited consciousness up to this
point in your life you've been living life conceiving of
reality as a limited finite thing it has to be
a particular narrow way it's bound to three dimensions or
to time into space or to good into evil or
to humans and animals or to plants and trees or
to stars and our universe this is all limited stuff
now I want you to drop that for just a
moment you can pick it back up in a minute
but just drop it for a minute and imagine a
truly unlimited consciousness not a human not an animal it's
not a physical object it's not a particle it's unlimited
consciousness infinite consciousness imagine that the entire universe can be
so conscious that it can be completely conscious of itself
unlimited consciousness imagine an unlimited universe where there are no
limits whatsoever zero limits anything is possible absolutely anything you
can imagine is possible everything that can be imagined is
possible pure infinite imagination without end without limits without restriction
unbounded by time by space by logic by science by
religion by fear by matter by limits of any kind
infinity true actual infinity completely self-knowing completely omniscient completely all-powerful
completely beautiful and perfect singular absolute endless existing forever eternal
unconstrained by absolutely anything because it's everything it's absolutely total
totality unlimited totality everything possible everything possible nothing is impossible
open your mind to that that's truth that's reality that's
love that's God that's see you that's this and that
is what all open-mindedness leads to is the realization of
infinity your infinite consciousness completely unlimited all limitation completely imaginary
including limitations such as death imagine becoming so open-minded that
you become completely omniscient your consciousness becomes completely unlimited and
you literally become immortal as you realize the totality and
unity of everything as you recognize and see yourself in
everything as you become the entire universe as you realize
what reality is is God infinite unlimited consciousness and why
is it this way because what would limit it it's
everything so there can't be anything outside of it that
could possibly limit it is therefore it's absolute infinite perfection
can you open your mind to that if not keep
trying and as your homework assignment over the next week
I want you to practice feeling when your mind is
closed if you're on a forum in a conversation with
your parents or your friends or whatever you're doing if
you're watching the news and you see some latest shenanigan
in politics happening and you notice your mind closing down
I want you to notice it and then practice opening
it up even if the thing that's being considered might
not be necessarily true just practice opening up and noticing
your biases all right that's it I'm done here thank

that thank you very much for that and my final
words to you are this open-mindedness has completely changed the
trajectory of my life I have used open mindedness to
discover total omniscience and immortality as outlandish as that sounds
it's true so when I talk about this open mindedness
I'm trying to lead you somewhere some were very powerful
open mindedness will take you way beyond science way beyond
Western philosophy way beyond anything you could have possibly imagined
the fruits that open-mindedness yields are so rich and rewarding
that they can't be described in words but they take
time to bear fruit this is a seed that you
plant this is a seed this open-mindedness seed is a
seed I planted in my mind when I was a
teenager when I was 16 or 18 years old this
seed was planted in me and this seed has grown
and blossomed matured over over decades and years until finally
it it bloomed into an infinitely beautiful tree with infinitely
many fruits that's the the real potential of open mindedness
so now I want you to finally imagine the possibility
that today we will plant this seed in your mind
of open mindedness and that this seed will be planted
and it's gonna be nurtured by you you're gonna water
a little bit every day every week for the rest
of your life and is gonna keep growing and growing
it first slowly it's gonna turn into a giant tree
over years and decades and it's gonna keep sprouting fruits
forever for the rest of your life it's gonna keep
sprouting more and more and more fruits until it completely
changes the trajectory of your life open your mind to
that possibility and I'll see you in the next one
you
