[Music] you what very few people know is that the
founding fathers of quantum mechanics were mystics and idealists for
the most part they were very sympathetic to anti realism
and in their mind quantum mechanics and all of their
discoveries in the early 20th century completely destroyed the notion
of a clockwork materialist universe and they got it and
it's very shocking to actually go and read their writings
and I spent many dozens of hours reading their writings
for the preparation of this episode and I'm gonna bombard
you with quotes from all these people because it's it's
just shocking it's shocking they don't teach you this stuff
in school they don't tell you about this stuff in
university it's just shocking how sympathetic they were to mysticism
some of them actually picked up Vedanta and picked up
Buddhism and actually started practicing this stuff and learning about
it it's quite remarkable so Who am I talking about
I'm not talking about some fringe scientists I'm talking about
the guys who came up with quantum mechanics starting with
Niels Bohr whose huge into mysticism Werner Heisenberg also is
as well or when Schrodinger who became a mystic Max
Planck Arthur Eddington who is extremely sympathetic to mysticism as
you'll see Wolfgang Pauli Albert Einstein who was famously very
open to mysticism James genes David Bohm John Archibald wheeler
Freeman Dyson and to a lesser degree Richard Feynman I
wouldn't call him a mystic but he was a rational
guy who understood the limitations of rationalism and that's what's
interesting about all of these founding fathers is that on
the one hand they were remarkable scientists some of the
best scientists that have ever lived they also produced amazing
discoveries that won the Nobel Prizes and that created a
lot of the technologies that we use today and at
the same time they were deep Philosopher's deep thinkers they
were radically open-minded they actually cared about the interpretations of
quantum mechanics they weren't merely using quantum mechanics as a
pragmatic tool to get something and they were geniuses and
they actually went post rational they understood the limitations of
rationality in a way that many academics today just don't
do anymore it's become quaint these were very intuitive thinkers
and it's actually precisely because they were so intuitive and
they were able to transcend rationality that they were able
to make the breakthroughs that they made because a traditional
rationally minded person who is wedded to the idea of
materialism could not have made the discoveries that these people
made see because they have to think really far outside
the box and for that they had to be radically
open minded and they were for the most part but
still not radically open-minded enough not perfectly open-minded which is
why even though all of these folks went pretty far
as far as I understand none of them were actually
enlightened and that's a shame to me because that means
that none of them actually experienced the source and origin
of why reality exists and obviously to them that would
have been the greatest discovery of all time the problem
is is that if they had experienced it they wouldn't
have been able to communicate it and had they actually
experienced it they would have become true mystics in which
case what would happen is that they would not have
been accepted within the domain of science because the only
things that are accepted within the traditional domain of science
is the stuff that fits tradition its orthodoxy it's a
bureaucratic system you're not accepted if you go too far
outside the box you can go a little bit outside
the box but not too far so I'm gonna quote
to you from many of these great thinkers and these
quotes will blow your mind so make sure you stick
with me through all of it before I get to
that though let me just stress one point again I'm
gonna be doing commentary on these quotes so that you
can really get the full significance of them but what
I want to stress to you is I want to
stress to you the importance of epistemology within quantum mechanics
quantum mechanics was not just a theoretical or a physical
theory it involved knowledge itself epistemology is a study of
knowledge and so within epistemology the biggest problem is the
problem of how do we know anything how can we
trust the things that we know what are we using
as our criteria for justification for grounding how can there
be a grounding at all for any kind of knowledge
what does it even mean to know a thing how
is the thing known how is it possible that there
is a thing out there the object and a thing
over here the subject and the subject apprehends the object
how is that possible what's the physical mechanism by which
that works that is a very deep question and there's
no easy answer because the answer is a strange loop
but what you're going to see with all these quotes
that I'm giving to you here in a minute is
you will start to see this theme repeating over and
over and over again it's the problem the core problem
of epistemology and you will see that these thinkers they
understood the ramifications of their discoveries when it came to
epistemology and also to metaphysics so let's begin first we
have Niels Bohr who was the early early father of
quantum mechanics he was instrumental in the development of quantum
mechanics everything sort of built upon his earliest work he
said quote while the finish given to our picture of
the world by the theory of relativity has already been
absorbed into the general scientific consciousness this has scarcely occurred
to the same extent with those aspects of the general
problem of knowledge which have been elucidated by the quantum
theory he also said quote isolated material particles are abstractions
their properties being definable and as an observable only through
their interaction with other systems and my own commentary on
this one is that again see he's stressing that this
notion you have of an atomic particle that makes up
a chair or a person or a cat or a
tree this is actually a conceptual construction there are no
such particles and the only way you can make sense
of there being particles is when that is being interacted
with with another system so really what quantum mechanics reveals
to us is the the holistic nature of reality you
can't just subdivide reality little pieces and then expect all
those pieces to just be interchangeable and just to work
perfectly with each other and to be all understandable in
these isolated little fragments the way that science wants you
can't do that it has to be a holistic understanding
at least if you care about understanding the whole now
if all you care about is understand the little fragment
fine you can work on that little fragment but here
we really want to understand what is the biggest picture
and he said quote we are suspended in language in
such a way that we cannot say what is up
and what is down the word reality is also a
word a word which we must unit used learn to
use correctly see you can't take for granted the word
reality the way that everybody does that's what quantum mechanics
revealed he also said quote physics is to be regarded
not so much as the study of something a priori
given but rather as the development of methods by of
ordering and surveying human experience and quote so you see
my commentary on this one is that normally we think
of physics as oh it's just a study of reality
study of physical objects but what is reality and what
is a physical object are those not human experiences so
physics is not what the materialist thinks it is the
materialists started out thinking that all physics is just a
study of the of the real world but then as
you go deeper and deeper and deeper you discover like
oh holy [ __ ] physics wasn't about that physics
was about the study of human experience oh that completely
recontextualizes what physics is he also says quote I myself
find the division of the world into an objective and
a subjective side much too arbitrary the fact that religions
throughout the ages have spoken in images and parables and
paradoxes means simply that there are no other ways of
grasping the reality to which they refer but that does
not mean that it is not a genuine reality and
splitting this reality into an objective and subjective side won't
get us very far end quote now let me make
a little meta point here about how these thinkers are
going to use the word religion so throughout all these
Kuo you'll hear the word religion cropping up on occasion
when they say religion really what they mean is mysticism
they don't mean so much traditional religion the Orthodox religion
of Christianity or Islam or or whatever else they mean
the esoteric non dual cores of religion or a better
word would be spirituality you see they were writing a
hundred years ago so the meaning of some of these
words has changed so when you hear the word religion
as I'm reading these quotes I want you to think
not religion but spirituality or mysticism all right he continues
and he says quote I consider those developments in physics
during the last decades which have shown how problematical such
concepts as objective and subjective are a great liberation of
thought the wholes thing started with theory of relativity in
the past the statement that two events are simultaneous was
considered an objective assertion one that could be communicated quite
simply and that was to be open to verification by
any observer but today we know that simultaneity contains a
subjective element we have come a long way from the
classical ideal of objective descriptions in quantum mechanics the departure
from this ideal has been even more radical we can
still use the objectifying language of classical physics to make
statements about observable facts for instance we can say that
a photographic plate has been blackened or that cloud droplets
have formed but we can say nothing about the atoms
themselves and what predictions we base on such findings depend
on the way we pose our experimental question and here
the observer has freedom of choice naturally it will still
make no difference whether the observer is a man or
an animal or a piece of apparatus but it is
no longer possible to make predictions without reference to the
observer or the means of observation to that extent every
physical may be said to have an objective and a
subjective component the objective world of the 19th century science
was as we know today an ideal a limiting case
but not the whole of reality admittedly even in our
future encounters with reality we shall have to distinguish between
the objective and the subjective side to make a division
between the two but the location of the separation may
depend on the way that things are looked at to
a certain extent it can be chosen at will hence
I can quite understand why we cannot speak about the
content of religion in objectifying language the fact that different
religions try to express this content in quite distinct spiritual
forms is no real objection perhaps we ought to look
upon these different forms as complementary descriptions which though they
exclude one another are needed to convey the rich possibilities
flowing from man's relationship with the central order and quote
so you see what he's saying here is he's saying
that the old classical materialist and skeptic and rationalist objections
to religion or to spirituality don't actually hold water because
the way that that those schools of thought objected to
spirituality is they would say oh well spirituality is just
all in your head it's just all just ideas that
you come up with it's all just myths and symbols
right but what is physics what is mathematics what is
science is precisely the same thing so that division that
hard line that we thought existed that duality between science
and religion actually doesn't exist and quantum mechanics brought that
to light Niels Bohr also said quote I go to
the Upanishads to ask questions and of Niels Bohr John
Archibald wheeler said quote you can talk about people like
Buddha Jesus Moses and Confucius but the thing that convinced
me that such people existed were my conversations with Bohr
Niels Bohr and quote so so much for Niels Bohr
now let's move on to Werner Heisenberg he said quote
there is a fundamental error in separating the parts from
the whole the mistake of atomizing which should not be
atomized unity and complementarity constitute reality so again this is
just the theme of holism being echoed once again he
also said quote we have to remember that what we
observe is not Nature herself but nature exposed to our
methods of questioning and quote that goes straight to Sean
Carroll's point about mistaking the formalisms of the equations with
Nature herself science does not reveal Nature herself science reveals
what nature pings back at us after we send out
the radar signal see we ping nature with our questions
we ping nature with our perceptions and then what we
get back from nature is a partial perspective never the
whole you can't ping to get back the whole because
you are the whole you are nature man is not
separate from nature that's the duality that needs to collapse
he also said quote light and matter are both single
entities and the apparent duality arises in the limitations of
our language it is not surprising that our language should
be incapable of describing the processes occurring within the atoms
for it was invented to describe the experiences of daily
life and these consist only of processes involving exceedingly large
numbers of atoms therefore it is very difficult to modify
our language so that it will be able to describe
those atomic processes four words can only describe things of
which we can have and form mental pictures and this
ability to as a result of daily experience and quote
so you see the problem is is that you can't
just think about reality in this sort of sloppy naive
materialist way as though reality is just sitting there on
a on a table and you can just walk up
and just pick it up and and look at it
the looking process itself your thinking process and language itself
has assumptions and metaphysical frameworks which are the pinging mechanism
that you are using to interact with reality and that
of course shapes what gets pinged back to you by
reality language is not innocent like people assume language carries
with it a deep metaphysics when you're using language language
implies duality it implies fragmentation it implies differences between the
the the subject and the object it implies distinctions such
as real and unreal these are all implicit to our
language and people take this completely for granted including most
scientists because to understand this stuff requires deep levels of
consciousness and much contemplation about things like what is the
nature of language what is the nature of reality what
is the nature of knowledge what is the nature of
mind what is the nature of thought what is the
nature of symbols and these are generally not questions that
most scientists ask unless they're also philosophers now we move
on to Max Planck and he said quote I regard
consciousness as fundamental I regard matter as derivative from consciousness
we cannot get behind consciousness everything that we talk about
everything that we regard is existing postulates consciousness end quote
of course of course the only baffling question is why
do modern scientists and academics don't understand this point and
of course the answer is simply because they've bought into
a culture of materialism and they aren't conscious of it
and many of them are are are deeply wedded to
it they cling to it like a Dogma so in
a very ironic twist a very delicious twist of of
poetic irony it's most modern scientists that actually behave like
religious fundamentalists their religion has become materialism Max Planck went
on to say quote science cannot solve the ultimate mystery
of nature and that is because in the last analysis
we ourselves are part of nature and therefore part of
the mystery that we are trying to solve and quote
that is a perfect encapsulation of the problem of epistemology
to understand physics or metaphysics you first have to understand
epistemology but then again you got the strange loop because
where is epistemology couched in couched in physics and metaphysics
so how do you untangle those well you can't untangle
them you're part of the mystery tada that's not a
problem that's the feature he also went on to say
quote a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing
its opponents and making them see the light but rather
because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows
up that is familiar with it end quote so that's
exactly the problem that we're facing now the current generation
is very materialistic and perhaps even the next generation will
be materialistic as well and they are not going to
accept this mysticism stuff they are not going to accept
it what's gonna have to happen is that they're gonna
have to die and then a new generation of it
eventually will have to come up who will just be
exposed to non-duality into mysticism from the very beginning as
though it's truth as though as fact it's going to
be part of the culture culture will have to evolve
at point non-duality and mysticism will just become fused with
science in a way that's unimaginable right now in most
universities for example you know if you go around espousing
mysticism or non-duality in a university they will kick you
out they're not gonna give you 10 ER tenure and
they're not gonna fund your your research they're not gonna
give you students to teach they're gonna kick you out
because the whole paradigm of the university is what can
you prove and how do you prove stuff with mathematical
symbols and and laboratory studies that's how you prove stuff
and if you can't do that get out you're not
a scientist get out why are not a scientist by
definition not because you're not a real scientist but by
by their definition you don't qualify to be a scientist
in their institution it's a bureaucracy it's a game it's
a culture now does that mean that all scientific discoveries
are just willy-nilly you can just make [ __ ]
up in a university no it doesn't mean that you
still have to do good science and good laboratory work
it doesn't mean that it just means that there's an
additional domain which is being missed because these requirements of
doing laboratory work in mathematical proofs and stuff this this
limits the domain of truth because what you can mathematically
represent and quantize is this much and the truth is
this much it's big it's huge it doesn't fit on
the screen it's bigger than the whole screen you can't
even see it that's how big the truth is and
the mistake that many rational people make is that they
think oh well if it's true that means it must
be provable and it must be communicable and I must
be able to write it in a book and I
must be able to quantize it no why would you
assume that much of the truth cannot be quantized there's
your problem right there so this creates blind spots max-planck
goes on to say quote we are always brought face
to face with the irrational else we could not have
faith as Einstein has said you could not be a
scientist if you didn't know that the external world existed
in reality but that knowledge is not gained by any
process of reasoning it is a direct perception and therefore
in its nature it is akin to what is called
faith it is a metaphysical belief anybody who has been
seriously engaged in scientific work of any kind realizes that
over the entrance of the gates of the temple of
science are written the words ye must have faith it
is a quality which the scientists cannot dispense with the
pure rationalist has no place here and quote I love
that that was written by Max Planck he came up
with the Planck constant it's just genius it's genius and
yet it's completely overlooked today by most scientists completely overlooked
faith is a bad word amongst most scientists you hear
that word and you recoil and you think all faiths
face that's what the religious people are into is faith
that's what separates me as a scientist from all those
crazy religious fundamentalist people is that they have faith and
I don't need faith I have my reason but you
have faith in reason and moreover your faith and reason
is very deeply misplaced because as a matter of fact
reality is not going to submit to your logical reasoning
it won't certain parts of reality will but not the
whole of reality every scientist makes many deep epistemic and
metaphysical assumptions in order to do his science you cannot
carry out science without interpretation the way that many naive
people with in popular culture think like a lot the
that silly notion number that I said that first of
the three-part distinction of popular science science is this idealized
myth well in this ideal people think that all scientists
they don't do any interpretation size is just like the
tracking of hard core facts but what quantum mechanics told
us is that there are no hard core facts everything
is interpretation interpretation creates reality reality is perspective and if
you want to experience reality without a perspective well you're
talking about infinity you're talking about the absolute you're talking
about the the wavefunction of the entire universe as a
whole and that's not even something you can think with
your mind you can't even imagine what that is that's
everything possible at once and also the negation of everything
possible at once forget it your mind can't grow your
mind cannot go there forget it logic cannot go there
rationality cannot go there language cannot go there symbols cannot
go there mathematics cannot go there now we move on
to her wounds reading her who I really love because
he actually started to 3d to read and to study
certain Hindu and Vedantic texts and philosophy because he saw
that that's what quantum mechanics was pointing him to he
says quote Nirvana is a state of pure bliss and
knowledge it has nothing to do with the individual the
ego or its separation is an illusion indeed in a
certain sense two eyes are identical namely when one disregards
all special contents their karma the goal of man is
to reserved his Karma and to develop it further when
man dies his Karma lives and creates for itself another
carrier do you expect a a physicist to say that
these days he goes on to say quote the same
elements compose my mind in the world the situation is
the same for every mind and it's world in spite
of the abundance of cross-references between them the world is
given to me only once not one existing in one
perceived subject and object are one the barrier between them
cannot be said to have been broken down as a
result of recent experiments in the physical sciences for there
was never a barrier to begin with end quote he
goes on to say quote inconceivable as it seems to
the to ordinary reason you and all other conscious beings
as such are all in all hence in this life
of yours which you are living is not merely a
piece of the entire existence but is in a certain
sense the whole only this is not so constituted that
it can be surveyed in one single glance this as
we know is what the Brahmins express in their sacred
mystic formula which is yet really so simple and so
clear taught to vom I see this is you or
again in such words as I am in the east
and I am in the West I am below and
I am above I am this whole world thus you
can throw yourself flat on the ground stretched out upon
mother earth with the certain conviction that you are one
with her and she with you you are as firmly
established as invulnerable as she indeed a thousand times firmer
and more environmentally as she will engulf you tomorrow sir
so so surely will she bring you forth anew to
new striving and new suffering and not merely some day
but now today every day she is bringing you forth
not once but thousands upon thousands of times just as
every day she engulfs you a thousand times over for
eternally and always there is only the now and the
one and the same now the present is the only
thing that has no end and quote from Irwin Schrodinger
so he is describing classical classical non-duality this is exactly
what Vedanta teachers and he's melting it with his understanding
of the metaphysics of quantum mechanics the now is the
absolute and you are all of it and it is
eternal he also goes on to say quote for philosophy
the real difficulty lies in the spatial and temporal multiplicity
of observing of thinking individuals I do not think this
difficulty can be logically resolved by consistent thought within our
intellects but it is quite easy to express the solution
in words as such the plurality that we perceive is
only in appearance it is not real Vedanta philosophy has
sought to clarify this by a number of analogies one
of the most attractive being the many faceted crystal which
while showing hundreds of little pictures of what is in
reality a single existent object does not really multiply the
object we intellectuals of today are not accustomed to admit
of a pictorial analogy as valid philosophical insight we insist
instead on logical deduction but as against this it may
perhaps be possible for logical thinking to disclose at least
this much that to grasp the basis of phenomena through
logical thought may in itself in all probability be impossible
since logical thought is itself a part of the phenomenon
and wholly involved with them end quote so you see
this is the deep problem of epistemology is that the
thoughts and the reasoning that you're using is itself part
of the thing that needs to be explained which is
what the rationalists don't understand they use reason to understand
the world but then they never asked the question of
what is reason where does it come from what is
it grounded in how does it work and why is
it true they don't go there they use reason as
a tool as a means to an end they use
reason pragmatically and in most situations it works it works
for everyday stuff if you want to use reason to
to buy a car or to to do some stuff
at work it works but it doesn't work when you're
trying to understand the absolute nature of everything it breaks
down and it makes complete sense that it would break
down because how can you expect reason which is a
piece of the whole to grasp the whole you're asking
the subset of the superset to encompass the superset it
ain't gonna work next let's move on to Albert Einstein
he has some real beautiful words to say about this
about mysticism religion and physics he says quote there is
a third stage of religious experience even though it is
rarely found in pure form and I shall call it
cosmic religious feeling it is very difficult to elucidate this
feeling to anyone who is entirely without it especially as
there is no anthropomorphic conception of God corresponding to it
the individual feels the futility of human desires and aims
and the sublimity and marvelous order which reveal themselves both
in nature and in the world of thought individual existence
impresses him as a sort of prison and he wants
to experience the universe as a single significant hole the
religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this
kind of religious feeling which knows no Dogma and no
God conceived in man's image so that there can be
no church whose central teachings are based upon it hence
it is precisely among the heretics of every age that
we find men who were filled with the highest kind
of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by
their contemporaries as atheists sometimes also as Saints to maintain
that cosmic religious feeling is the strongest and most noblest
motive of scientific research a person who is religiously enlightened
appears to me to be one who has to the
best of his ability liberated himself from the fetters of
his selfish desires and is preoccupied with thoughts feelings and
aspirations because of their super personal value a religious person
is devout in the sense that he has no doubt
of the significance and loftiness of those super personal objects
and goals which neither require nor are capable of rational
foundation they exist with the same necessity and matter-of-factness as
he himself a human being is a part of the
whole called bias universe a part limited in time and
space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings ask something
separated from the rest as a kind of optical delusion
of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison
for us restricting us to our personal desires and affection
to a few nearest people to us our task must
be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our
circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the
whole of nature and its beauty nobody is capable of
achieving this completely but the striving for such achievement is
in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation
for inner security end quote you getting this Einstein got
it Einstein God Einstein understood what the game was here
in life what we were supposed to be doing that's
what's so remarkable about him not only was he one
of the greatest most original thinkers but he was deeply
humanitarian he was deeply connected with his intuition his emotions
which is actually precisely why he was the world's famous
scientists genius doesn't come from the ego genius doesn't come
from rationality genius comes from transcendence from infinity from infinite
intelligence and the greatest scientist will always be those who
go post rational and connect with infinite intelligence they will
not be the rational stacks that inhabit most universities they
will not be the materialists it takes heart and spirit
and faith and passion and deep intelligence and selflessness to
be a good scientist it takes radical open-mindedness and the
grandfather's of quantum mechanics appreciated this they understood it because
they were living it and of Albert Einstein John Archibald
wheeler said quote of all the heroes Spinoza was Einsteins
greatest no one expressed more strongly than he a belief
in the Harmony the beauty and most of all the
ultimate comprehensibility of nature and quote and of course Spinoza
if you know is one of the few accepted mystics
and idealists of the Western intellectual tradition especially in philosophy
there are very few philosophers who were successful idealists in
the Western tradition Spinoza was one of them Bishop Berkeley
after whom Berkeley University was named is also another one
and there were a handful of others but but generally
very few most were duelists most were rationalist most were
materialists so there's no no accident that Einstein picked Spinoza
as his greatest hero and philosopher now we move on
to Freeman Dyson who is a more recent physicist and
maybe you haven't heard of him but he was also
instrumental in developing certain theories within within modern physics here's
what he said quote beware of him and whom reason
has become the greatest and most terrible of passions end
quote and also quote an awareness of our smallness may
help to redeem us from the arrogance which is besetting
the sin of scientists and quote and quote scientifically speaking
a butterfly is at least as mysterious as a superstring
when something ceases to be mysterious it ceases to be
of absorbing interest to scientists almost all things scientists think
and dream about our mysterious end quote and quote religious
creationists and scientific materialists are equally dogmatic and and sensitive
by their arrogance they bring both science and religion into
disrepute and lastly he said quote if it should turn
out that the whole of physical reality can be described
by a finite set of equations I would be greatly
disappointed I would feel that the Creator has been uncharacteristically
lacking in imagination and code and of course that's precisely
because reality is infinite and so therefore you cannot encapsulate
it with a finite set of equations next we move
on to John Archibald wheeler who may be also you
haven't heard of but he was also a more modern
physicist who did some instrumental work on understanding general relativity
and in quantum mechanics and modern physics and in fact
he invented the idea of a black hole he coined
that her he also coined the term I believe quantum
foam if you're familiar with Allen he said quote every
item of the physical world has that bottom at a
very deep bottom and a material source and explanation that
which we call reality arises in the last analysis from
the posing of yes/no questions and the registering of equipment
evoked responses in short all things physical are actually information
theoretic in origin and this is a participa taury universe
and also he said quote I had the good fortune
of having my first and only heart attack last January
I call it good fortune because it taught me that
there's a limited amount of time left and I better
concentrate on one thing how come existence how come existence
the ultimate question and the ultimate answer and it can
be answered but not symbolically not dualistic aliy because how
come existence means all of existence and it's non dual
so you have to become Nandu you have to go
to it it will not come to you if you
insist on being a materialist or rationalist then that's what
you'll have you're not gonna have the answer to how
come existence because existence money must include more than your
rationalism and more than your materialism because those are limiting
cases of the larger whole next we move on to
one of my favourite physicists and thinkers David Bohm he
was an extraordinary thinker and he figured all of this
stuff out quote we have reversed the usual classical notion
that the independent elementary particles of the world our fundamental
reality and that the various systems are merely particular contingent
forms and arrangements of these parts rather we say that
inseparable quantum interconnectedness of the whole universe is the foundational
reality and that relatively independent behaving parts are merely particular
and contingent forms within this whole consciousness is much more
of the implicit order than its master than oh sorry
than matter a deeper level matter and consciousness at a
deeper level matter and consciousness are actually inseparable and interwoven
just as in a computer game the player and the
screen are united by participation the field of the infinite
the fee sorry the field of the finite is all
that we can see here touch remember and describe this
field is basically that which is manifest or tangible the
essential quality of the infinite by contrast is its subtlety
its intangibility this quality is conveyed in the spirit world
in the word spirit whose root meaning is wind or
breath this suggests an invisible but pervasive energy to which
the manifest world of the finite responds this energy or
spirit infuses all living beings and without it any organism
must fall apart into its constituent elements that which is
truly alive in the living being is this energy of
spirit and this is never born and it never dies
quote ultimately all moments are really one therefore now is
an eternity and he went on to say quote space
is not empty it is full a plenum as opposed
to a vacuum and in this ground and is the
ground for the existence of everything including ourselves the universe
is not separate from this cosmic sea of energy and
he said quote some might say that fragmentation is the
reality and that wholeness is only an ideal towards which
we should perhaps strive but this is not what's being
said here rather what should be said is that wholeness
is what is real and that fragmentation is the response
of this whole to man's action guided by a losery
perception which is shaped by fragmentary thought and quote so
david hole is really big on this idea of holism
you can't understand reality through fragmentation and the biggest thing
that we as scientists and theoreticians have to fight is
our tendency to use our mind to fragment reality to
quantize reality to analyze everything to categorize everything as we're
doing that what we're not realizing is that our mind
is projecting those categories and that fragmentation onto reality which
isn't really there it's like you're walking around projecting a
grid onto the world and that that grid doesn't exist
unless you project it and it's also possible to stop
projecting it and when you do if you do stop
projecting it you will see that everything is non-dual and
you will realize that the grid wasn't just projected out
from your mind or from your body onto the world
but that actually your mind and your body are part
of the whole grid that was being projected so as
you remove this grid you will not only remove the
categories and the judgments that you have about the physical
world out there you will also remove them from yourself
and ultimately you will eradicate and erase the ultimate grid
the ultimate category which is the category of self versus
other such that the two will merge into one whole
such that literally you will not be able to distinguish
another human being from yourself it's all gonna be one
and that's gonna be true non-duality you are gonna remove
the grid so much that you will no longer even
be able to think the difference between non duality and
duality because even that that distinction between all this person's
enlightened and that person is not enlightened this is duality
that's non duality even that will go even those categories
will be erased and then what will be left what
will be left cannot be spoken david bohm also said
quote the essential feature in quantum interconnectedness is that the
whole universe is in folded into everything and that each
thing is unfolded in the whole both observer and observed
are merging and interpenetrating aspects of one whole reality which
is indivisible and unanalyzed able and code do you hear
that materialists on analyzable do you hear that rationalist unanalyzed
able you cannot analyze it it's a synthesis synthesis is
the opposite of analysis he also said quote the classical
idea of the separable 'ti of the world in two
distinct but interacting parts is no longer valid or relevant
rather we have to regard the universe as an undivided
unbroken whole division into particles and fields is only a
crude abstraction an approximation thus we come to an order
that is radically different from that of Galileo and Newton
the order of undivided wholeness and he says quote one
discovers both from considerations of the meaning of the mathematical
equations and from the results of the actual experiments that
the various particles have to be taken literally as projections
of a higher dimensional reality which cannot be accounted for
in terms of any force of interaction between them each
electron acts as if it were a projection of a
higher dimensional reality so we do not say that the
mind of the body causally effect each other but rather
the movements of both are the outcome of the related
projections of a common higher dimensional ground and quote so
if you're wondering is the world inside the brain or
is the brain inside the world what he's telling you
is that it's neither the brain in the world are
projections of a higher dimensional reality you ain't gonna figure
it out at this plane of consciousness you need to
ascend to a higher dimension of reality or consciousness he
also said quote the illusion that the self and the
world are broken into fragments our agent originates in the
kind of thought that goes beyond its proper measure and
confuses its own product with the same independent reality to
end the solution requires insight not only into the world
as a whole but also into how the instrument of
thought is working such insight implies an original and creative
act of perception into all aspects of life mental and
physical both through the senses and through the mind and
this is perhaps the true meaning of meditation end quote
you see so what David Bohm has figured out here
and what he's telling us is that we have to
turn inwards we have to reflect about our own thought
process become mindful and aware and conscious of the very
mechanism of observation and perception which is going on inside
of us otherwise we're gonna externalize it and we're gonna
keep projecting this grid onto the world and of course
when you project a grid onto the world don't be
surprised when you see a grid shining back at you
you projected it there you put it there of course
is there of course the world looks mathematical when your
mind is mathematical the world is not truly mathematical the
world doesn't run on equations there is no physics the
world is not a giant supercomputer crunching ones and zeros
behind the scene those are all metaphors they're not reality
the world is what then it's precisely what's presented to
you right now the world is not hidden from you
the world is given to you directly you are experiencing
the absolute your experience gap solut infinity right now but
you say leo but if i'm experiencing the absolute right
now then how come I feel so limited how come
I'm not experiencing everything how can I can't see through
the eyes of a kangaroo and an elephant and a
giraffe and another person and and this and that how
come how come I can't read your thoughts how could
this be the absolute look here's how it works you
see this hand it's a hand you see these fingers
their fingers now when I tell you that right now
you're experiencing the absolute that's like me telling you you're
seeing a hand now when I tell you that you're
experiencing your own personal perspective that's like me telling you
you're seeing a finger but are these things mutually exclusive
look at it when you're looking at just one finger
if you're only focused on the finger you can get
so preoccupied with seeing a finger that you forget that
actually the finger is also the hand now you might
say but leo how can a finger be a hand
how can it not a hand is something that has
fingers the absolute or the infinite is something that contains
all the finite perspectives of which you are one and
here you are you are the finger so wrapped up
in being a finger that you forget that you are
also the hand you see that's all that's happening and
what non-duality and enlightenment and all this quantum mechanics stuff
is pointing you you towards is to say oh yeah
of course I am a finger I'm this finger but
I'm also the whole hand because the finger is the
hand oh yeah of course of course I am the
universe let's move on to Sir Arthur Eddington who has
some of the some of the best writings connecting quantum
mechanics and non-duality and he was an important physicist who
worked on general relativity and modern physics he said quote
our present concept of the physical world is hollow enough
to hold anything the basis of all phenomena is a
scheme of symbols connected by mathematical equations that this is
what physical reality boils down to when probed by the
methods which a physicists sorry that is what physical reality
boils down to when probed by the methods which a
physicists can apply a skeleton scheme of symbols proclaiming its
own hollowness to put the conclusion crudely the stuff of
the world is mind stuff the mind stuff of the
world is of course something more general than our individual
conscious minds but we may think of its nature as
not altogether foreign to the feelings in our consciousness the
realistic matter and fields of force of former physical Theory
are altogether irrelevant except insofar as the mind stuff has
spun these imaginings the mind stuff is not spread in
space and time these are part of the cyclic scheme
ultimately derived out of it I had a lot of
reason to do so I got a lubricate my throat
so you see what he's saying there he's saying that
all these physical concepts that we have including the concept
of reality is actually just ideas in the universal infinite
mind physicality is an idea within universal mind we're talking
about an infinite dream this dream has enough power to
dream up anything it wants including the fact that you're
standing here right now being supported by a physical planet
and not falling through the planet that's part of the
dream physicality is part of the dream it's a limiting
case of the dream not all dreams have this component
of physicality to them but this particular one that you're
in right now does which is why I feel so
ill so physical so material he goes on to say
quote it is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept
the view that the substratum of everything is of mental
character but no one can deny that mind is the
first and most direct thing in our experience and that
all else is remote inference probably it would not have
occurred to us that the world could be based on
anything else but mind stuff had we not been under
the impression that there was a rival stuff with a
more concrete reality something too inert and stupid to be
capable of forging an illusion this rival stuff turns out
to be a schedule of pointer readings and though a
world of symbolic character can be constructed from it this
is a mere shelving of the inquiry into the nature
of the world of experience end quote so his language
is a little bit archaic there but what he's trying
to say is he's trying to say that everything is
mine stuff the idea that there could be anything but
mind stuff is a ridiculous idea and all that really
is is just more mind stuff and what we thought
wasn't mind stuff but physical hard stuff turned out to
be just pointers within the mind stuff and bike pointers
what we mean is readings like you can look at
up at an apparatus that measures something you can take
a yardstick and measure something you can look at a
scale to measure something but what are those those are
just readings what are those that's also mine stuff it's
mine stuff interacting with itself mind stuff interacting with mine
stuff producing scientific readings telling you valid ways of predicting
the future so you can predict how the mind stuff
will behave in the future that's what science is in
the business of doing making predictions science studies mind stuff
so they can predict patterns within the mind stuff successful
science is able to isolate those patterns whereas unsuccessful science
or religion or pseudoscience or plain falsehood is unable to
find those patterns it claims a pattern which doesn't turn
out to be valid in this dream maybe in some
other dream it would be valid but in this dream
it ain't he goes on to say quote the solid
substance of things is another illusion it too is a
fancy projected by the mind we have chased the solid
substance from the continuous liquid to the atom from the
atom to electrons and there we have lost it but
at least it will be said we have reached something
real at the end of the chase the protons and
the electrons or at least we have symbolic coordinates and
momentum and the quantum wave functions to represent these protons
and electrons but we have shown that by following this
course we reach a cyclic scheme a strange loop from
its very nature we can only can and and it's
we can see that from from this nature it can
only be a partial expression it is not reality but
the skeleton of reality the actuality has been lost in
the exigent exigencies of the chase having first rejected the
mind as a worker of illusions we have come now
in the end to return to the mind it is
because the mind the Weaver of illusion is also the
only guarantor of reality that reality is always to be
sought at the base of illusion and code I love
that he's so nailed it their reality his illusion and
illusion is the only reality the reason that you have
mistaken illusion for reality is simply because there can be
nothing but illusion whatever the mind weaves is all that
there is and can ever be the only problem is
that we have mistaken it for reality she also says
quote we have learnt that the exploration of the external
world by the methods of physical science leads not to
a concrete reality but to a shadow world of symbols
beneath which those those methods are unadapted for penetrating but
what do the symbols stand for the mysterious reply is
that given that physics is indifferent is the Monsieur the
the reply that is given is that physics is indifferent
to that it has no means of probing beneath the
symbolism to understand the phenomena the physical world is necessary
to know the equations which the symbols obey but not
the nature of that which is being symbolized feeling that
there must be more to this more behind this we
return to our standing point in human consciousness and there
we find other revelations than those conditioned by the world
of symbols it is just because we have a real
and not merely symbolic knowledge of our own nature that
our own nature seems so mysterious see he's talking about
the possibility of transcending symbols and representation he says quote
I assert that the nature of all of reality is
spiritual not material nor a dualism of matter and spirit
the hypothesis that its nature can be to any degree
material does not enter into my reckoning because as we
now understand matter the putting together of the adjective material
and the noun nature does not make any sense like
the symbolic world of physics a wave is a conception
which is hollow enough to hold almost anything we can
have waves of water of air of ether and in
quantum theory even waves of probability only we do not
get down to the intrinsic nature of things in this
way so after physics has shown us these waves we
have still to determine the content of the wave by
some other avenue of knowledge it is almost as though
the modern conception of the physical world has deliberately left
room for the reality of spirit and of consciousness end
quote that's precisely right quantum mechanics has left a gap
for non-duality quantum mechanics is a pointer pointing to the
moon a finger pointing to the moon the moon is
infinity the finger are the mathematical symbols the problem is
that most scientists and academics and thinkers they get stuck
at the symbols and they never go for the moon
because you can't get to the moon through symbols and
most scientists and theorists have always just assumed that I
can get to the moon using my symbols but you
can't because symbols are always apart and not the whole
now let's move on to Richard Fineman who I wouldn't
call a mystic but like I said before he knew
what was up he knew the limits of rationality he
said quote paradox is only a conflict between reality and
your feeling of what reality ought to be he also
said quote the electron is a theory we use it
is so useful in understanding the way nature works that
we can almost almost call it real almost but not
really he said quote you can know the name of
that bird in all the languages of the world but
when you're finished you'll know absolutely nothing whatsoever about the
bird and he said quote it is really quite impossible
to say anything with absolute precision unless that thing is
so abstracted from the real world as to not represent
any real thing you see the problem the more sophisticated
our math and science becomes the more abstract and conceptual
it becomes the less real it becomes and so the
better our science the more disconnected we become from our
being and that is unfortunately the sad state of modern
academia and modern science which needs to be corrected in
the future he also said quote a very great deal
of more of truth can be known than can be
proven which is a point I have already talked about
in the past and lastly he said quote I think
it is safe to say that no one understands quantum
mechanics do not keep saying to yourself but how can
it be like that because you will go down the
drain into a blind alley from which no one has
yet escaped that quote and that is because reality in
the final analysis is irreducibly mystical there is a mystery
there that science will never ever not in a trillion
years be able to adjudicate or erase all it can
do is sweep it under the rug for a while
but that bulge will still stick out from under the
rug you cannot get rid of that bulge it's there
all you can do is you can sort of stick
your hand in the sand which many scientists have been
doing lately but obviously not these guys this is all
the quotes that I have to read to you from
the fathers of quantum mechanics so in the end all
of this boils down to not believing one scientist over
another or one set of interpretations over another but deeply
contemplating all of these issues that were brought up for
yourself you need to do the work of contemplating and
in that contemplation you will discover what is true and
what you will discover is that the granddaddy's of quantum
mechanics were really good contemplate errs and they got there
before you did although they didn't go all the way
so even though I call some of these fathers of
quantum mechanics mystics they're not real mystics a real mystic
in my mind is someone who actually actualizes and fully
embodies the absolute the thing that quantum mechanics is pointing
to the transcendent they were not that what they were
was really good post rational thinkers who got pretty much
as far as you can get using your logic and
your reasoning which is more than we can say for
many people who are writing and talking about these topics
today compared for example these visionary physicists to modern day
academics and you can find videos of these sorts of
academics online and just take a look at what kind
of religion these academics and materialists are subscribed to it
is a religion of materialism scientism and rationalism the defining
characteristic of religion is not the content of what you
believe the content is irrelevant it's the clinging to the
content that is the defining feature so whether you cling
to a physical reality or you cling to some mystical
supernatural anthropomorphic deity or you cling to some other new-age
belief it doesn't matter what matters is that you cling
to it the real difference is between are you closed-minded
or are you open-minded and just how radically open-minded are
you that's what really matters so when looked at through
this lens you can see that many modern academics and
scientists are actually deeply religious people despite the fact that
they spend so much time criticizing and arguing and making
entire careers out of debating religion and denouncing religion I'm
talking about people like sam Harris and Daniel Dennett and
Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens and Bill Maher and even
scientists like Lawrence Krauss and Stephen Hawking in Neil deGrasse
Tyson and even Sean Carroll these people although they have
many remarkable qualities they can be great speakers they can
be great thinkers they can know a lot about some
particular specific domain of their field they can be very
rational and very eloquent but in the end they are
ignorant they are ignorant of the true nature of reality
and the fact that quantum mechanics points the way they
are ignorant of the fact that you cannot understand the
ultimate big picture through analysis models math traditional science or
through logic and reasoning and that's why they fall into
the trap of pitting science versus religion as though these
are two different sides that you must pick between one
or the other sort of like you're a liberal you're
conservative and you must be one or the other that
fails to recognize the transcendent truth which both sides are
misunderstanding and the reason both sides are so adamant at
fighting with each other is precisely because it keeps them
in a state of a circular self-deception and distraction so
they're always chasing their tail and never going up to
see the transcendent truth and why is that because the
transcendent truth is challenging it's scary it requires that you
lay your ego on the chopping block of reality and
it will get chopped in half and this requires that
you give up all of your intellectual positions no matter
whether these positions are Theological scriptural traditional positions from Christianity
or Islam or anything else or they are modern quantum
mechanical or evolutionary or whatever other kinds of positions you
have which you consider to be modern 21st century science
the common thread there is that no matter what positions
you take they are still just intellectual they are still
just at the level of symbols and therefore they leave
you trapped inside the mind and that ultimately what our
aim here is is to escape the mind to jailbreak
your mind to experience raw unmediated reality you see what
quantum mechanics points us to is the fact that the
observed and the observer the object and the subject are
one what that means if you really think it through
is it means that you are the object that you're
looking at literally you have direct immediate access to reality
you are not limited by perception you are not limited
by any kind of indirect process you are the very
reality that exists you are being itself the only problem
is is that you have this conceptual matrix which you
walk around and project upon reality which keeps telling you
that although this is just all this is all perceptions
these are perceptions and I'm over here and that person's
over there and I'm looking at that person through a
process of perception my brain is doing this neuro chemical
stuff and the neurons are firing off and I've got
a consciousness and they've got a consciousness and somehow there's
an external world and all these things somehow fit together
that whole picture that is what we're trying to destroy
if you can destroy that if you destroy that operating
system which is infecting your perception of everything then ultimately
what you're left with is raw unmediated being not perception
not consciousness not mind stuff but actually undefinable infinite being
which is what's happening right now as I'm speaking it's
not anywhere else it's happening right here it's a matter
of looking at exactly the same thing you've always been
looking at but now with fresh eyes at a higher
plane of consciousness not using your rational logical mind now
let's address some objections but Leo aren't you just cherry
pick cherry picking all these quotes isn't it the case
that you just went through and you look through you
spent a bunch of time you like picking out religious
sounding quotes from all these different people and then you
compile them all together so it paints an unfair picture
as though these people were really religious but really they
weren't actually know first of all I quoted at great
length specifically to address this objection I was quoting large
large chunks sometimes entire pages from these various thinkers I
wasn't cherry-picking I mean of course I was cherry-picking to
present you with the most juicy stuff not to waste
your time so in that sense of course I was
as I must but I was specifically picking ideas and
quotes that I feel a representative of how these people
thought I was I was actually delivering the essence to
you here I was distilling down the essence and if
you doubt me then what I recommend is you actually
go and study this for yourself then you can have
to put in your own time because I spent dozens
of hours researching all of these quotes selecting the best
ones go actually read I have plenty of books of
my book list from some of these scientists and some
of these physicists and in fact specifically for this episode
I'm going to add one extra book to my book
list I'm adding it right now so if you're subscribed
or just go log in you'll find it you'll find
at the very top I'll add it to the very
beginning of the list and it's going to be a
book of just purely quantum mechanical quotations and it will
list in great lengths quotations and articles that were written
by all of these speakers and a few others that
I didn't get time to mention and you'll be blown
away by the profundity of these thinkers and you will
walk away convinced that they were anti-realists for a good
reason another objection might be Palio aren't these just quaint
religious scientists sure of course scientists a hundred years ago
in the early 20th century yeah they their minds were
were still filled with the with the cultural indoctrinations of
religion so they were still struggling to break free of
that of that bondage and today in the 21st century
finally atheism has become acceptable and now scientists are really
free to be what and thinking and do science however
they want and now most of them are atheists and
so now our modern scientists these are the real scientists
and those those are just some quaint leftover dinosaur sort
of scientists it can certainly seem that way if you're
subscribed to the Atheist paradigm but what you will discover
if you really investigate this matter deeply for yourself is
that that's wrong that's exactly precisely backwards these granddaddy's of
quantum mechanics is they killed materialism with their own bare
hands and that must have been pretty painful for them
to do because they were hardcore scientists but they did
it because they had to because they were in the
pursuit of the truth regardless of what that means and
what they discovered is they discovered that science taken to
its ultimate conclusion rationality taken to its ultimate conclusion goes
full circle and eats itself alive as it must of
course as it must and they appreciated what they accomplished
but then the scientists that came afterwards the ones who
are not visionaries many of them subscribed to the culture
of now materialism and atheism which is starting to run
rampant through universities because the pendulum swings back and forth
between religion and science and so for a long time
we've seen the excesses of religion play itself out throughout
culture throughout history and so it's very easy for an
educated person to see these days that oh yeah much
of the nonsense that goes on with Christianity and and
some of the Islamic you know traditions and all this
sort of stuff is very corrupt it's very abused and
it's it's used for all sorts of evils and problems
arise from that and it's not very rigorous or intellectually
honest and so from that what happens is that you
say ah okay so we got a swing our pendulum
completely in the opposite direction towards materialism atheism and so
you do and you swing there and that's where I
was for most of my life is that that extreme
end of that position I was a serious atheist I
did believe in God or angels or any sort of
nonsense I read Darwin's On the Origin of Species on
my own effort like back in in 10th grade just
because I was curious they didn't force me to read
it I read it myself because I was curious what
is evolution how does it really work I went to
the original master original source and that was very instrumental
in shaping my worldview but see the problem is you
swing your pendulum so much to this side that you
commit the exact same sin that was committed by all
the religious fundamentalists but now you commit it in a
different style and now this style is the sort of
militant atheism that we see or the sort of just
run amuck materialism which denies phenomena denies consciousness starts to
equate reality with symbols and mathematical equations and starts to
equate the external world and deny the internal conscious experience
that every one of us is having and the only
thing that you really have of life the only way
you know that you're even alive and this gets denied
in the way that for example Dennett that daniel dennett
does in his work it's really remarkable it's a remarkable
feat of of mental trickery that is played on oneself
so the irony the very deep irony and i guess
it's the poetic justice and that the Karma of the
universe is that the very same sin that that these
atheists and materialists were so adamant and judgmental about of
the of the religious fundamentalists that they themselves as they
try to escape that sin they actually fall into just
an alternative version of that very same sin which is
just dogma blind belief faith faith in materialism faith and
rationality face that there is no paradox and that everything
can be logically understood and everything can be analyzed and
quantized it's the exact same faith which fuels religious fundamentalism
which is why when you look at debates between someone
like Richard Richard Dawkins and some religious person you actually
see that they're just mere opposites of each other their
level of consciousness is the same they're both in a
state of delusion and in a state of suffering and
they are emotionally clinging to their ideas they're just different
ideas another objection that will come up here but Leo
how is any of this stuff practical okay fine you
won the you won the philosophy game you won this
word game but it's just a word game after all
what difference does it make if if you call it
real or anti real material or immaterial physical or non-physical
dual or non dual what difference does that make to
my life well you're right it's just a word game
but are you conscious of the fact that reality is
a word game U is a word game death is
a word game fear is a word game anger is
a word game what are you doing in your life
what is controlling you everything that you are doing you
are doing to maintain and perpetuate your survival everything there's
nothing in your mind that even crosses your mind other
than that and you run around thinking you have all
of these problems depression anxiety panic attacks sadness disappointment frustration
suffering pain these are all word games your entire life
is a word game do you understand the significance of
this if what I'm saying seems impractical it's only because
it applies to absolutely every facet of your life and
that is actually so practical that is overwhelmingly practical it's
too practical it's too practical for me to tell you
that you cannot die it's too practical for me to
tell you that there is no reality so what are
you crying about when you don't get your money when
your boss fires you what are you upset about these
are all conceptual problems that you've constructed your entire identity
is something you've constructed all the judgments you have about
other people but especially about yourself you don't like your
looks you don't like your emotions you don't like your
financial situation you don't like your relationship you don't like
your family you don't like this you don't like that
you want more of this you want more of that
what is that this you that you keep hating that
you can't possibly accept that you're always disappointed by that
you're always frustrated you can't control because you've got all
these emotions pulling you in a million different directions what
is that this is not separate from science and reality
this is not separate from your emotions are not separate
from reality and from the truth when your emotions are
tugging you in a million different directions that shows you
that you're out of touch with reality see for the
materialists they need to actually make again a split or
a firm boundary between the rational world and the emotional
world because for them these are two different worlds and
of course they conflict and contradict and so at the
same time the materialist an atheist must live in this
sort of conceptual bubble where everything is rational and everything
is analyzable and quantized Abul but then at the very
same time he must still deal with his horniness his
hungriness his depression his anger problems his fears and anxieties
and his insecurities and his disappointments with life and all
the struggle and all the pain and all of that
and so while on the one hand he can tell
himself that all I'm a great theorist I'm a great
intellectual and I have PhDs and books that I've written
in all this and I have all these followers and
I popular and I'm successful and I'm all that deep
down inside he's a mess emotionally he's a mess because
you cannot master your emotions when you have a metaphysics
of materialism it's impossible it's impossible which is why you
have these great theorists or professors or academics and they're
on antidepressants or their relationships suck or they have anger
problems just as one sad example David Bohm take David
Bohm brilliant physicist one of the most brilliant physicists of
all time he understood this stuff he even went to
the extent of a he would agree with everything I'm
saying here but nevertheless he didn't actualize it he didn't
actually become enlightened he didn't actually become a full-bodied mystic
and therefore the end of his life he became very
depressed and his life ended in in great misery and
sadness and he was institutionalized for his depression later on
in life and he died having all this knowledge all
this theory but in the end what did it do
to him he got lost in the in the labyrinth
of his own mind because that's how powerful the mind
is it's not enough to know what I'm saying and
say okay you Netley oh now I know and now
I'm gonna be happy no you're not gonna be happy
now you know but it did nothing to change you
now what you need to do is you need to
take the next big step is you need to go
beyond merely knowing what I'm saying conceptually cuz that's just
more Theory all of this is just more Theory more
symbols and you need to go and actually embody and
become the thing the finger is pointing at and that's
where the real work of self-actualization and spiritual development and
non-duality comes into play this is not the end this
is the intro this is the intro I need to
say all of this to you just to deprogram you
from all the [ __ ] the materialist rationalist [
__ ] that our culture has filled your mind with
and even so we're not done because to fully eradicate
this mind virus of materialism which still exists in your
mind you will need to spend years eradicating it not
just listening to me listening to me won't be enough
this is just the starting point of your journey another
objection that comes up here is but Leo aren't you
just making a God of the gaps argument atheists like
to to make this kind of defense leo it sounds
like yeah quantum mechanics knows some stuff but then there's
some stuff that quantum mechanics can't really grapple with can't
really deal with we haven't quite figured it all out
quantum mechanics is still being done there might be revisions
in the future yadda yadda yadda so what you're saying
is you're saying that just because science hasn't figured everything
out and there's still some mystery left in the world
that now you're gonna stick God in there because you
love God and because you believe in God now you
just you don't want to stick God in there you
want to use quantum mechanics to justify your spiritual inclinations
no that's not what's happening here that's not what's happening
here I had no spiritual inclinations I was an atheist
and I didn't just read the Bible or go to
some you know Christian revival meeting under some tent and
found the Lord and was born again none of that
stuff happened to me what I actually discovered is that
God is the gap tada it's not God of the
gaps in the sense that oh there's some gap in
science so therefore we're gonna stew God in there no
no God literally is the gap within which everything is
transpiring it's precisely because God is a gap aka nothingness
emptiness void Sunita it's precisely because God is empty that
you don't see him it's precisely because God is empty
that you can't symbolize it how do you point to
emptiness you see it's the perfect self-deception the perfect self-deception
because God is hidden completely in plain sight this is
God the universe is God you are God and that's
the only thing there is is God there's nothing else
God is absolute infinity and all the finitude that absolute
infinity must contain to be itself God is the hand
and all the fingers of the hand imagine an infinite
hand with infinite fingers that's what we're talking about God
is the hand and God is also the finger on
the hand and God is both and all and also
neither so in conclusion what did we discover today first
and foremost I want you to understand that materialism is
dead it died in the 1920s and the people that
I quoted to you from they're the ones who killed
it and they understood the significance of what they did
but of course like a bad horror movie the dead
the dead monster doesn't want to stay dead it comes
back to life it still has some life in it
it's still kicking it wasn't completely put out of its
misery and so it lurched back and there's been a
revival of materialism and atheism and it's permeating science and
Western intellectual tradition and this is a problem it's like
a zombie that's arisen from the dead and this zombie
will infect your mind because it is a mind virus
and it will become your religion it already is and
it will become the religion of your children and your
children's children unless you make extraordinary efforts to undo this
programming these fathers have quantum mechanics they have proven and
shown that science and rationality eats its own tail as
it must that's a strange loop as it must be
in conclusion also we've learned that reality is irreducibly mystical
mysticism is not just some facet of reality that we
haven't understood yet and that we will in the future
if we just do more science that's not what I
mean when I say it's irreducibly mystical what I mean
is that being itself cannot be known because the actual
process of knowing is itself being so as odd as
this might sound it's actually impossible for God to know
itself because actually if you've ever wondered how come there's
this division between metaphysics on the one hand and epistemology
on their other hand metaphysics has to do with the
substance of things and epistemology has to do with how
we know what things are so what's the connection between
these two fields well with total non duality of course
all distinctions and dualities must collapse including of course the
duality between metaphysics and epistemology such that epistemology becomes metaphysics
knowledge is being the deepest way to know a thing
is to be a thing but the problem is that
when you're being a thing you're not knowing a thing
you're being it so in a sense what many of
these theorists and materialists have chosen as they've chosen knowing
over being and what I'm saying is that we need
to flip that around choose being over knowing and see
the radical difference that makes in your life and it
will make a radical difference it's not just gonna be
a word game it will transform your entire relationship to
life and all of your emotions and how you interact
with everything with everybody and maybe for the first time
in your life you will experience what true satisfaction and
joy feels like another conclusion is that popular science the
myth of science the idealization of science is has this
model of reality which is 300 years out of date
this clockwork universe model of Newton and decart and even
Democritus atoms and molecules bouncing around this is this is
dead this is dead it does not exist this is
just a fantasy a story in your mind it's also
important that I point out that non duality does not
hinge on quantum mechanics so it might sound feel like
I'm saying olio so what happens if like quantum mechanics
in the future is disproven in the same way that
Newtonian mechanics was disproven and replaced by quantum mechanics what
if something new comes along and replaces quantum mechanics will
that disprove and shake the foundations now of non-duality no
absolutely not because non duality is not dependent upon any
system of justification or theory so I am NOT saying
here that because of all this evidence from quantum mechanics
that because of that I think non duality is true
and God exists that's not what I'm saying what I'm
saying is that reality is absolutely infinite I have personally
become conscious of that so have other people and so
can you and quantum mechanics is a nice little bonus
that is a pointer that can be useful for people
who are stuck in the materialist paradigm who are completely
[ __ ] deluded to escape the labyrinth of their
own mind and so if quantum mechanics goes wrong in
the future and it's disproven and whatever else it doesn't
matter non duality is still be non duality your knowledge
and understanding of non duality does not hinge upon quantum
mechanics it's just a nice convergence you know it's a
convergence of evidence it's also important to enlarge our understanding
of what science is and that's something I'll be talking
more about in the future but what we have today
and what when we say the word science today most
people say it what they're talking about is traditional Orthodox
science and this sort of science excludes first-person experiences which
is the most real thing we have what we need
to do is we need to expand that notion such
that first-person experiences are also included and are studied by
science and are taken seriously this would be the domain
of philosophy called epistemology no not epistemology but a phenomenology
phenomenology is the study of phenomena this is a legitimate
scientific domain and in the future it will be treated
as such non duality is not really some alternative to
science it is science it's just the science of the
future which modern science because of its orthodoxy rejects and
doesn't take seriously but it will in the future because
the essence of science is not whether you can symbolize
things with mathematical formulas that really is not the essence
of sight that's a limiting case of how to do
science that's one way to do science there are many
ways to do science the essence of science is to
be radically open-minded and to investigate the nature of everything
that's the essence of science how you do the investigation
what instruments you use or whether you even use instruments
at all whether you use rationality or intuition or whether
you read tea leaves those are different methods and you
should be open to all those different methods because you
don't what the limits of each method are one method
could get you very far but it might stall out
at some point it might turn out to be a
dead end and it might not be able to let
you explore the entire domain and what science is about
is science is about understanding the entire domain and how
can you say that you're doing true science when you
don't understand why reality exists when you don't understand why
the domain exists how can you say you're doing real
science now you might wonder why does it exist well
that's something that's so profound that you can only discover
it for yourself by putting your ego on the chopping
block it exists because there is only one thing that
exists infinity and infinity must exist because it also includes
its own non-existence so in fact really nothing exists and
everything exists and that is infinity and it couldn't be
any other way so non duality is science Yoga is
science meditation is science phenomenology is science self inquiry is
science but you need to broaden your understanding of what
science is as science has always done throughout the entire
history of science there was never a consensus and agreement
upon what science is science has always had to construct
its own method on the fly as it got going
and it's precisely because science has become so successful recently
that this this feature of science has gotten lost on
a lot of people a lot of people take science
for granted as though science was just given to us
handed down by God here's the method to find out
everything that's true about the world no nobody gave you
such a method you are born into this world not
knowing anything not even knowing how to know something not
even knowing if it's possible to know something or what
method to use to know it that's the entire purpose
'ti of life that's why it's so interesting that's why
science is so interesting because it's so mysterious what's going
on here and not the least of which was what's
most mysterious is science itself is mysterious how does science
even work that's a deep mystery that's a strange loop
in and of itself make sure not to confuse everything
that I've talked about here as a defense for religious
dogma or a defense for some Christian interpretation of the
Bible or some Islamic law or something like that not
at all not at all that's not what I'm doing
here we're going way beyond that we're going to the
mystical non dual core from which all religions arose but
then these religions got corrupted in the same way that
science gets corrupted the corruption in religion stems from the
exact same force as the corruption in government as the
corruption within science and every institution and in fact every
individual human being because the nature of the ego is
too corrupt truth that's his job based on that you
are alive you cannot be alive unless you're ignorant of
the truth because the truth is that you're dead and
that you were never born and that you will never
die be careful about using things that I've said here
to justify certain beliefs or positions that you hold especially
using it as a weapon against other people other religions
other scientists or whatever that would be a big mistake
the proper application of this is is a deep inward
self-reflection that makes you pause about everything you're doing in
your life and makes you really ate everything makes you
re-evaluate whether you think you even exist that's the proper
application in the future non-duality will become common knowledge everyone
will know about it but not in our lifetime and
probably not in the next century and maybe not even
the next millennium because the reality is is that the
mind and the ego is so stubborn and so selfish
that it has consistently figured out ways to corrupt this
truth for over 5,000 years that's what's so remarkable quantum
mechanics is just that if the iceberg it's bad enough
that our cultural model of reality is 100 years out-of-date
for modern science it's even worse than that it's 5000
years out of date from the mystics and visionaries who
existed way back when and talked about this stuff but
you know they were killed they were burned at the
stake they were silenced their teachings were corrupted and distorted
and misunderstood by materialistic people because what do what do
people care about in general they care about practical stuff
they care about money sex survival success Pleasant emotions that's
what people care about they don't care about the truth
but then they become the victims of their own success
the victims of their own materialism the victims of their
own rationalism because in the end it's they who suffer
the pain of being in this cycle of ignorance chasing
chasing chasing but never finding infinity you can't find infinity
through materialism if you are a serious scientist or you
are an aspiring scientist in a university maybe taking a
PhD or doing a master's degree or a bachelor's degree
and you're going up and you're gonna be in academia
my biggest piece of advice for you is that what
you need is you need direct non-dual experience you cannot
be a serious scientist without this you will become this
technician and this materialist because that's what that Barak bureaucracy
and that cultural system will program you with you need
direct non-dual experience in fact what I suggest for you
is become a mystic become a mystic not just in
theory but in practice actually become a mystic and believe
it or not you can be both you can be
a mystic and you can still be a great scientist
in fact it's necessary being a mystic is necessary for
you to become a great anybody a great politician a
great scientist a great anybody a great inventor a great
artist a great teacher a great human being because you
need truth on your side because truth is all there
is what are you aligning yourself with if you're aligning
yourself with the falsehood with illusion you're aligning yourself with
nothing if all of this sounds radical to you consider
that it's only because of one thing it's only because
you have blindly taken for granted the metaphysics of your
culture that's the only reason you have subscribed to the
knowledge that has been given to you by your culture
both spiritual knowledge religious knowledge and scientific knowledge and you'd
never ever bother to ask yourself wait a minute is
this actually true you just accepted it because as soon
as you were born people were just feeding you stuff
you were so confused you didn't know what the hell
is going on people just gave you answers and you
just accepted those answers blindly and it started to make
sense for you because yeah what a culture is a
culture is a cohesive system it feels so real and
solid precisely because it's it's consistent it's self consistent but
self-consistency does not equate to the truth you can in
fact have an infinite number of self consistent systems which
are not true in the same way that you could
have an infinite number of self consistent novels which bear
no resemblance to reality they're just novels they're just stories
but hey there are great stories and they're very very
self consistent and they might make you feel very good
and they might even be very effective at helping you
to build the rocket ship or cellphone or whatever you
want to build but they ain't true and the reason
they you know that ain't true is because just investigate
your emotional system you're unsatisfied you feel incomplete and you're
in a state of suffering all the time you're never
satisfied notice that that's what tells you that you're out
of alignment with the truth and that's something that only
one thing can cure and that is true mysticism all
right that's it please click the like button for me
and come check out actualize Network that's my website I've
got goodies there for you to check out the forum
my blog the life purpose course my book list I
have a lot of books on my book list besides
the new one that I'll be adding I also have
a lot of books I have a whole category that's
called epistemology and metaphysics and I've got great books on
all these scientific topics so if you're into that go
check that out that will completely transform your understanding of
what reality is and lastly let me just say that
this issue of science is something that I'm still not
done talking about there's a lot more to be said
about science there will be more episodes about science and
it's very important that you don't misunderstand my position on
science I don't hate science I'm not anti science I
am the biggest advocate of science I love science which
is precisely why I criticize it because I want science
to be as accurate and rigorous as possible but what
happens when you have a whistleblower or someone who is
inside of our organization or a bureaucratic system who says
that oh there's corruption there's corruption what happens immediately the
ego the collective ego of that system reacts against it
and it labels that person as a heretic and as
an T the system so if I do this inside
of a religion I would be called an t religion
and I would be kicked out of the religion if
I did this within a political organization I'd be called
anti Republican anti-democratic be kicked out of that organization and
if I do this within a university I'm gonna be
called an anti academic and if I do it within
science I'm gonna be called anti science because every complicated
organization needs to maintain itself it's the ego it's a
collective ego and of course science is no different science
is a collective ego and it is just as adamant
at defending itself and surviving as any other organization any
other religion any political party and as yourself as any
individual because that's how it came into existence in the
first place but I do not hate science what I
want to see is I want to see science purified
of its dogmas I want to see signs of the
most radically open-minded sort visionary science not this sort of
bureaucratic run-of-the-mill technical science that they do in universities these
days that's not true science that's a bastardization of science
but of course those people will all disagree with me
which is why we must wait for them to die
out I want to leave you with one final quote
from the grandfather of quantum mechanics Niels Bohr you
