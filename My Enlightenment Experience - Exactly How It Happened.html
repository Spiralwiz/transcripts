hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about my enlightenment experience
so I just came back from a 10-day silent meditation
retreat and I had a really interesting experience at the
end of the retreat and that's on top of all
the cool insights that I got that I'm excited to
share with you in the upcoming videos but what I
got here is I got what I think I'm going
to call my second in lineman experience so I did
have one before this which was about a year and
a half ago when I first began this journey towards
enlightenment but the problem with the first experience that I
had it's it's hard for me to even understand what
was happening then because back then I didn't have the
concepts and framework that I have now to understand what
the hell is going on in these experiences this is
actually a common phenomenon for example for people who do
mushrooms or psychedelics is that they have this kind of
consciousness expanding experience but then they lose it and they
don't retain any of it and they can't even make
sense of it and it just seems like this all
is just you know just a cool emotional state that
I was in for a while but it's actually not
that and the problem is that you don't have the
intellectual framework that's necessary to really make sense of it
so the first experience I had was kind of murky
and it was hard to distinguish it from a hallucination
and my eyes were kind of closed I was very
sleepy and yeah um I won't talk about that but
this second experience this was something remarkable that I've never
experienced before in my life and here I was completely
awake completely alert eyes open no hallucinations and it was
a really extraordinary thing and what I want to do
is I think it would be valuable not to just
tell you about this experience as in all I had
awakening experience but to tell you about this experience as
a step-by-step process for how I generated the experience because
the experience was created this is something you do through
work this is not something you just happen to stumble
upon and if you're following my other enlightenment videos and
you're using that looking process that I talked about if
you're using sort of self inquiry process or if you
meditate then you'll see some very important points here because
I'm going to take you through every step after my
experience actually sat down and I made sure to write
down every step a lot of details so that I
could track everything that was happening in my mind to
create this experience so that I could recreate it later
and actually what happened is that I'm mom I was
able to just yesterday almost recreate it so I'm really
confident now that um there's a lot learned and breaking
down the process and I think it's going to help
you with your self inquiry so let me tell you
a little experience let me set it up for you
so what was happening is that I was at a
retreat and this was like a church ground where we
had little cabins and stuff and then there was like
a chapel but there weren't any church activities going on
we were just kind of using that complex and anyway
it's most folks were meditating off together in some hall
but I didn't want to do that I was just
meditating by myself and this was in Virginia and I
don't know if you ever been to Virginia I haven't
it's my first time there and it's really an amazing
beautiful natural scene because what they've got now here in
the summer is um the weather's very humid just like
super super humid and in fact we had rain storm
clouds for most of the week and on this day
it was raining and very cloudy and I was sitting
there by the chapel so the chapel's is cool little
modern design Church and it um it was on this
rolling green hill and the entire estate was just these
giant rolling green hills with dense like ancient forests and
huge trees and birds and insects flying around it's just
like a very natural ideal exceed so perfect for meditation
which is why I wanted to sit out there and
this this Chapel it was set up on this platform
that was kind of hanging over this rolling green hill
and I was sitting right on the edge of this
platform there's like a little balcony area out there in
a wooden bench so I was sitting on that bench
cross-legged with like a blanket over me and I was
just looking at the rain and the rolling green hills
and all the birds flying around at the clouds and
the giant green forest far off into the distance and
this was evening time the Sun was kind of setting
but it was so cloudy you can really see it
and I was sitting under a roof kind of you
know a roof area so that rain wasn't dripping down
on me so it was really the perfect setting and
I'm sitting here and what I'm doing is I'm practicing
this technique called do-nothing which is a new technique that
is practicing and I'll talk about that technique in detail
in other videos but what I'll say about it here
is that the do-nothing technique is a very interesting technique
where you literally just sit and you don't try to
do anything at all and in fact anytime your awareness
tries to go somewhere you try to control your awareness
you just completely detach and let it go seems simple
but actually I need it simple but it can be
a little tricky to do it right so does require
some practice and explanation which I won't really go into
here but anyways I just do the do nothing technique
and usually when you start doing the do-nothing technique and
you sit there your mind just kind of wanders around
and it's really indistinguishable from your ordinary monkey mind that
you have when you're not meditating so I was getting
that I was thinking about all sorts of things left
and right but then after a while all that stuff
kind of exhausted itself and my mind started getting more
and more and more focused focusing it and as I
was doing that then I started just kind of naturally
as part of the do-nothing technique my mind sort of
gravitating towards this notion that I learned called exploring spaciousness
spaciousness is an interesting concept which again I can't really
cover in too much detail here but basically what was
happening was that I was sitting there and I was
looking at the trees far off into the distance and
then what I kind of realized had this little mini
insight I had multiple mini insights to ultimately get to
my experience the mini insight was that when I'm looking
at the tree that actually there's nothing behind the tree
and there's nothing in front of the tree now this
takes a little explanation because if I just say that
in normal speak common parlance then we say well I
mean they're you know behind the first tree there's the
second tree in the fifth tree and a tenth tree
and a hundred tree they may be behind that there's
a road behind that there's a hill behind that there's
a a building or something like that right and in
front of the tree well there's empty air there's a
bird flying and there's and then there's me like it
all points back to me and I'm here at the
very front and at the very end is like the
vacuum of space now what's interesting is that that's all
a conceptualization that's not actually what's going on with your
phenomenal sensory visual field in your visual field like if
you're looking at me right now maybe you can get
a taste of this you're seeing my face you're seeing
the background now the question is what's behind that what
you're seeing give you a hint it's not pixels on
a computer screen it's not a desk it's not a
wall it's not your car it's nothingness literally nothing this
is behind it now if you get a little taste
of that you could take it the opposite direction what
is in front of me so now you would normally
think that well in front of Leo's face these pixels
on the computer screen are is what empty air uh
there's not really empty but it's there's air here and
then there's some space some distance and then there's what
there's you you are sitting there like a camera taking
all this in but can you get a taste that
actually that's not accurate that there's like nothing here nothing
that nothing there I kind of look working from your
perspective so if we're looking from your perspective then there's
nothing there behind behind your eyes there's nothing in front
of Leo right now these colors that you're seeing there's
nothing in front of that so it's like your sensory
field has this weird spaciousness this is what they call
spacious is going on is one aspect of spaciousness is
that there's like a like a almost like a flatness
to white whatever you're looking at there's nothing behind it
and there's nothing in front of it now it's cool
to philosophize about that and just kind of think that
all that's kind of interesting but when you actually sit
there and you meditate and you concentrate and you get
a real hit on that with your awareness and there's
like traction you get traction with your awareness it's not
just an idea then it's like whoa whoa that's [
__ ] eerie that's exactly what happened to me is
that I started to see this tree and I got
this hit that [ __ ] I'm not looking at
the tree it's just a tree there's not anything here
in front of the tree which normally we assume is
I'm here so that expanded my mind a little bit
my mind started to focus in more then what I
did is I use another technique that I learned a
while ago it's called the well I don't know if
there's a name for it but basically what I did
is I just took my finger and I literally try
to draw a line from the tree so I stretched
my finger out like this into the distance to where
the tree was like a mile or two away and
then I try to trace it back to what is
what is here what's in front of the tree and
if you do that very carefully and you're very conscious
and focused which we'll notice is that there's actually no
point at which the finger touches you it's it's weird
it's freaky so I did that and that reinforced this
sense of like whoa insight then what I did is
I focused my gaze and my vision downward at the
balcony floor which was had a stone so I moved
it much closer to me give me a bit of
a different feel and I was looking at the stones
and I actually started to just kind of blank out
and not really focus on the stones and I started
to get this my awareness shifting inside the sensations in
my body and so I just became mindful of all
the sensations in my body maybe you can do that
for yourself right now you could just kind of like
feel your hands and feel your chest and you'll stuff
flowing around in there so I got a sense of
that and then the inside hit me what if the
bodily sensations are just like the tree and I try
to in my mind go and kind of do that
finger pointing method with the body sensation I try to
track where are the body sensations like going to where
are they coming from and where are they going to
and what I discovered again is that oh [ __
] they're not coming from anywhere and they're not going
to anywhere so it's like your body sensations are surrounded
by nothingness just like your visual sensational field is surrounded
by nothingness but again you can't just understand this logically
you need to actually get a real conscious hit on
this which I got so then what I had is
I had this kind of mini awareness that there is
no one actually experiencing the body that it's kind of
like just free-floating around and then I kind of let
go of the do-nothing method because this was all pretty
much do nothing and then I did is I kind
of took a little bit of conscious control and I
started doing the self inquiry method and the self inquiry
is also what I call the looking process um this
is what I talked about in how to become enlightened
video if you watch that one basically it's asking yourself
the question Who am I Who am I or who's
the perceiver who's preceding all this stuff who's aware so
I started asking myself that question Who am I and
at first I noticed that I was just asking the
question asking the question and I wasn't really actually generating
an honest tangible answer so that's one real problem with
the technique is when you're just asking question but not
generating tangible honest answers then you tend to get stuck
but you know I've been um I've been doing the
self inquiry thing for about a year and a half
now so I've made a lot of mistakes and I've
gotten stuck a lot of times before so now I'm
a little bit more aware about those pitfalls so I'm
conscious enough now to see that Oh actually need to
generate an honest answer because the problem is that when
we ask who are you would you ask that question
of yourself what happens at your mind gets very vague
and it says like oh well you know I'm back
there I'm certainly back there you know I'm this I'm
I'm my body or I'm my mind or I'm the
thoughts or it comes up with something but usually until
you start doing this self inquiry you don't even have
anything tangible that it comes up with the mind just
kind of just vaguely senses that oh I'm back there
somewhere but where exactly are you what aspect of your
experience are you are you even an aspect of your
experience right now that's something you're gonna have to look
into for a good long while before you can even
start to just get your mind to generate some honest
answers now notice here that an honest answer isn't a
correct answer so I knew that when I was forcing
myself to generate this honest answer that it would be
the wrong answer because I already know logically that I'm
not my body or the mind or the thoughts or
a perceiver or even a physical entity I already know
all this logically but notice here the reason I'm going
through all these steps is that logic counts for nothing
here you need to actually get conscious traction and this
conscious traction is what I'm kind of showing you how
to get right so you kind of ask yourself these
questions and just kind of kind of like focus in
and focus in and focus in and try to get
it sometimes you're lucky and you get a little mini
insight sometimes nothing happens in fact usually nothing happens or
you just become very frustrated or you get some logical
answer if you get a logical answer you have to
throw that out and go for the traction don't be
satisfied with just the logical answer so I'm forcing my
mind to generate this answer and the answer that I
come up with is that I am this sense of
body and mind and fall and the one perceiving it
all so I'm just kind of like amalgamation and that
to me in the moment felt like a very honest
answer I really try to force myself to actually pin
that down and I pinned it down and as soon
as I did that I sat with that answer for
a few seconds but then my mindfulness a my awareness
now is high enough because I've practiced this long enough
that I could see that actually that's not who I
really believe I am who I really believe I am
is the one perceiving this body and this mind and
these sensations I'm like a point back there somewhere right
like it's kind of like you know the lens of
a camera I'm that lens of the camera back there
but then what I also noticed is that that's that's
what that's part of my thought stream I'm a lens
back there I'm a point back there somewhere on which
everything is converging what is that that's a thought am
i a thought is that what I am no I'm
the perceiver of the thought but who's that who's the
perceiver of the thought and when I got there my
mind expanded again another mini insight and this one was
new to me I've never had this one before but
I got a very tangible conscious sense that I quote
unquote I this thing I call I leo is just
a belief and that this this thing that I think
I am which is this body these sensations these feelings
you know the feelings in my mouth the feelings in
my mind all this stuff that feels so solid and
real and cohesive that in a sense what that is
is that's an arbitrary designation that has been made by
um not even myself I actually traced it back in
my mind I started wondering like Oh what if it's
like society and what if that's like my parents and
everybody around me who just kept pointing at me and
saying hey this is you leo you and I just
kind of bought into it and accepted it because I
didn't know any better and I traced it back all
the way to like my earliest childhood memories and then
I get that I got this conscious sense this my
mind opening up and saying oh [ __ ] what
if this identification that I have with this phenomenon happening
right here is just a rather arbitrary partition of the
whole it's like you know you take a large pizza
and you cut out one little slice and you say
that's it I'm that slice but what if that was
an arbitrary slice what if you were like the whole
thing before it was sliced up so I saw that
actually the social conditioning was there inside me and I
really saw the social conditioning and what I did is
that debt just kind of like expanded my mind even
further and also it focused it in even more so
by this point I'm sitting there and it's a really
intense meditation so I'm like I'm really focused my mind
is buzzing it's vibrating inside that's how it feels said
like that um and then what happens is a really
remarkable thing which is I get a real genuine on
a sense that I don't know who I am now
this sounds simple you might think like well you know
Leo I can just sit there and kind of get
a sense that I don't know who I am I
can just kind of like you know consider different theories
like well what if I'm in the matrix or what
if I'm a computer simulation or what if I'm something
else that's not what I mean here what I mean
here is I got a room honest real [ __
] honest sense of like [ __ ] I'm walking
around thinking I'm this phenomenon happening here but I can
see how that's arbitrary like I can actually see that
now how that could be arbitrary and what I did
that that expand my mind even further and it got
me asking in my mind the question of like who
the [ __ ] am I I don't know I
really don't know and this is a difficult state to
get to this state of true not knowing and it
turns out to be very critical for um doing this
work because you actually you cannot progress forward most of
the time in self inquiry because your mind thinks it
knows who you already are it's kind of like that
slot is already occupied you know your cup is already
full I believe in Zen they tell you that if
your cup is already full you got to empty your
cup first before they can before a Zen master can
not can train it right fill it with more knowledge
or new insights you can't fill a cup that's already
full so that's the problem that's going on there so
you actually need to empty your cup and that's what
happened here is that my cup truly got emptied umm
don't underestimate how difficult this is to actually do in
practice with your consciousness to get that traction to actually
empty your cup but that happened to me and and
then what happens is that it started to seem plausible
to me actually that I could be something that's not
physical and also not human just I became a possibility
alright I was open to it the mind was very
open and then what happened is that I looked back
out at the trees look at the trees again from
the stones on the ground and I started wondering who
am I really like a real sense of wonder and
what the minds are doing and at this point I'm
on total autopilot pretty much like I'm not even meditating
it's like the meditation is doing me as they say
like I'm just totally focused lasered in uhm like you
probably can't imagine unless you've done a lot of meditating
so I'm really focusing and I'm wondering who could I
really be and then you know ideas start popping up
in my mind like well maybe I could be that
thing or this thing or that or some idea I
had but you know as that's happening I'm tracking the
thoughts stream and I'm seeing that the thought stream is
not me because I've got mindfulness now over the thought
stream and I've kind of gone meta and I can
see the thoughts but I can see that the thoughts
have no truth or substance to them they're just you
know they're just sounds in the head or in the
mind or images in the mind so I'm seeing that
and then what I get is I get the answer
that pops up what if I'm omnipresent and as soon
as that pop up pops up I have a really
big insight and this is where the enlightenment Dawn's because
what happens is an amazing thing I actually then get
a sense it doesn't just become a thought so the
thought what if I'm omnipresent it goes I see the
fact that it's a thought I let that go but
then actually I get that the real conscious traction that
I could be omnipresent and then what happens is that
I kind of become omnipresent and what do I mean
by omnipresent the best way to explain it is you
know our standard model is that who you think you
are is like a camera moving through the world right
the camera turns and looks around well imagine an alternative
model for how reality is structured imagine you're not a
camera anymore but what you are is you are you
are space itself imaginative space was designed to such a
way that it was instantly conscious and aware of whatever
particle was occupying space so you would not be the
particles you would be the space and you would be
distributed evenly everywhere through space not just centered at a
point the way a camera is right so imagine a
three-dimensional camera not a camera that looks out like this
in a cone but a camera that just looks out
in 360 degrees and this camera is positioned everywhere and
anywhere kind of freaky so um so that's what I
got is I got a sense of that right and
what happens is that this this just is this moment
of like complete silence complete peace washes over me my
mind is still super laser focused my brain is just
buzzing it's just buzzing with tension um my awareness is
just kind of like expanding and zooming out and what
happens is that that flash lightning-bolt kind of hit to
the to the head and then what happens is that
the best way I can describe it is that my
my visual field it balances out and equalizes so your
typical visual field it's what I call unbalanced in the
sense that we put all the emphasis and priority here
everything is coming here right to the camera everything is
converging on the lens well what I got a sense
of is like Adi convergence right everything just kind of
stood in its place exactly where it is as though
the camera went from a a cone shape to a
360-degree sphere and I kind of just became everything in
my awareness I became the trees I became the clouds
the ground and everything and everything just started to stand
very still just like and there was this figure-ground reversal
as this happened right as the camera cone transitioned into
a sphere there was this figure-ground reversal and I don't
know it's just felt like ah this balancing out it
felt like finally everything was balanced and then my awareness
just popped and I got this real tangible sense of
omnipresence like I was everywhere so imagine you know what
they say about God God is supposed to be omnipresent
well that's what you get here everything becomes very very
still all the frustration and tension in my body that
was there as I was meditating I was probably meditating
for 30 minutes at this point you know there's aches
and pains and weird things going on when you're sitting
cross-legged but all that tension just went away all the
frustration all the mental noise went away and just peace
ah and absolute bliss washes over me just a blanket
of happiness it's like the bliss of being perfectly awake
perfectly clear minded is this childlike happiness where you're just
savoring the joy of existence itself because you have become
existence itself and you need nothing more and everything is
perfect in the moment and I got my first real
true sense of what they call the absolute now speakers
like Eckhart Tolle they talk about uh being in the
present moment you probably heard that phrase a lot gets
used a lot these days being in the present moment
the power of now that kind of stuff well this
is what they're talking about the problem is that most
people 99.9% people have no idea what being in the
present moment actually means when a Zen master or a
yogi or Eckhart Tolle tell you about the absolute now
the absolute now is just like is amazing it's like
a heavenly heavenly sense of presence it's not just this
normal sense of oh I got to be here now
and not be thinking about some [ __ ] that's
going to be happening to me tomorrow no the absolute
now is like [ __ ] um it's like you
feel like you're God looking at in on himself that's
what the absolute now feels like um it's it's it's
remarkable words really don't do it justice and you're not
going to be able to think your way to this
state you have to actually get that conscious traction get
there um and the other thing that I really remember
that was very vivid for me in fact the most
remarkable thing about this experience was that I became totally
lucid I like this word lucid it's like I could
sense and be aware of everything in my in my
field of awareness like every leaf on the tree all
the trees in the forest all the grass all the
birds all the sounds all the thoughts everything in fact
when I say that I became silent everything became silent
I don't mean that my thoughts became silent in fact
what was really remarkable for me is that the thoughts
were coming out very asked it was like a machine
gun just like a series of bullets like this thoughts
upon thoughts right thinking about this whole experience so thoughts
like holy [ __ ] look what's going on oh
my god this you know all these thoughts are coming
up but what's very fascinating is that the thought stream
and me we got separated so to speak so the
thoughts were kind of just like being themselves and seeing
themselves and I was no longer identified with them and
I was very very conscious of what a thought is
in this moment and this to me was one of
the biggest insights that I got because if you're doing
the self inquiry work like I have for the last
year and a half one of the real tricky questions
you're going to have to answer for yourself is what
is a thought really it's a lot trickier to answer
that um I think um and here I got a
real look at every thought as it was arising and
dying off and the next one was coming up just
like the stream of thoughts and also gaps between thoughts
and I was kind of looking at them and I
wasn't stuck inside them anymore and I was perfectly conscious
of what each thought was and what that is is
that the thought just is itself the phenomenon of having
a thought is the entire substance of the thought that's
a huge insight right there that's a huge hint for
you if you're doing this work if you can latch
on to that that the phenomenon of the thought is
all that a thought actually is and nothing more there's
nothing else behind it that there has no meaning to
it inherently other than it's phenomenal nature that's huge because
what does that allow you to do that allows you
finally to pull yourself out of the content of the
thought and see it as just an audible or a
visual phenomenon that's happening to you in the present moment
takes all the meaning strips all the meaning and significance
out of the content of thought so that happened to
me and it also felt like my my awareness I
didn't feel like I was totally like gone I still
felt like a sense of self um and my thoughts
were still talking about myself as I was sitting there
but what happened is you know that point that I
said that I thought that I was I was kind
of like sitting you know we usually think of ourselves
as being behind the eyes like eyes and nose back
there inside the head um that's right now where you
think that you live that point kind of moved and
it kind of like hovered about a foot above and
a foot behind my head so it's almost like I
was kind of like looking at the whole scene while
at the same time being kind of omnipresent and my
thought stream was kind of like going this way um
they're interesting in my mind I just kind of represent
the thought stream is going this way doesn't actually mean
that's how thought stream goes um it's kind of I'm
a little bit of a metaphor there but that was
my moment and I I was able to see reality
for what it really is I was able to kind
of like be reality and I sat there for a
good 20 30 minutes in this state just with a
huge smile on my face just complete happiness and bliss
it was like heaven right um it was the the
like the the highest joy and this another insight that
I took away from this is that the highest joy
is just being perfectly lucid in the present moment when
you're completely awake completely aware you feel complete there's nothing
more you need you don't need anything else to be
happy you are you are completely full it's like you're
full of yourself so to speak but in a very
different way than we normally say and so I sat
there and then what started happening is I started wondering
of course you know well is this it is this
enlightenment have I made it I sure hope I do
I sure hope I did and so I started wondering
that but also I had the intuitive sense that this
isn't it I started to suspect this is just a
peak experience um it's certainly felt like a huge breakthrough
but I started to suspect like man this is going
to probably pass from earthing I know about enlightenment this
is probably going to pass it's not going to be
permanent and I started kind of worrying about that I
really want it to be real really wanted to be
permanent so I just kind of sat with and just
see where I was going to take me as I
was sitting there for the next 30 to 60 minutes
just kind of basking in that lucidity uh the Sun
was now setting the clouds had parted the rain had
stopped everything looks green and wet and beautiful it seemed
like the colors were extra bright and vivid and like
you had God rays you know those God rays that
you see in the pictures shining through the clouds it's
just like this beautiful almost perfect like I couldn't have
engineered this scene better it was just amazing there was
even a deer that ran through the through the meadow
a bit later like an hour later while I was
still sitting there um so it was really like the
perfect moment but after about 90 minutes the effect did
wear off um I lost that sense of touch with
omnipresence kind of moved back into the the cone shape
of your typical camera not that 360 view um but
you know I still had that good buzz that good
feeling of calm and peace and I felt like I
had some insights that I took away from this experience
what I did later that night is I actually went
and reported it to the Zen master leading the retreat
he has like 40 years of experience um here so
he knows what's going on so I explained this experience
to him and he he laughs I mean he says
oh I know what you're talking about what you got
there is you got a glimpse of a few hairs
of the oxes tail a glimpse of a few hairs
of the oxes tail now what does that mean that's
actually uh there's a there's this ancient zen metaphor that
they use for enlightenment and they actually have this diagram
with ten pictures they're called the Ox herding pictures and
this represents your path towards complete enlightenment and there's many
stages ten of them so the first stage is that
you're just kind of it's a guy walking around in
a field completely unaware this is your typical person who
has no knowledge of enlightenment then the next picture is
the man is walking through and he looks at the
sand or at the mud and he sees some footprints
and he gets curious by the footprints that's him learning
about enlightenment then the next picture is he's tracking the
footprints through the forest looking for the mystical ox so
that's when you're really on track with this line lighted
process that's kind of where I am right now or
what happened for last year and a half the next
picture is the one that this guy referred to which
is a picture of the Ox going around a corner
behind a tree and all that the man sees as
he's looking up from the footprints is he sees the
hair like the Ox is tail sticking out from behind
the tree so he catches a glimpse of the tail
and then after that there's no further stages where you
actually catch the Ox you sit on top of the
Ox you ride the Ox home and etc um I'm
not going to explain all that here actually going to
shoot a whole video on that so don't worry I'll
shoot one in the future about all the ten ox
pictures but the point here is that what he told
me is I didn't even see the tail all I
saw was a few hairs on the tail um and
I said to him oh man so you mean I
only saw the tail and he says no he didn't
see the tail you saw a few hairs on the
tail and he kind of smiled at me and laughed
um and in my mind I'm thinking like man I
thought I got the whole tail or I got the
lakhs he's like no you just hair and so in
my mind was kind of bummed out in something in
like oh [ __ ] and I thought I got
more of it but then also it was great news
because that means that [ __ ] if I saw
that little and it was such a powerful experience how
[ __ ] powerful must the real thing be when
you're actually riding that ox home what the [ __
] could that be like incredible incredible it it staggers
the imagination makes me kind of emotional just thinking about
it so yeah so that was my experience now even
though the experience has passed and I'm not in that
state anymore the biggest takeaway that I think I left
with it was like a residue that's still left in
my mind I got a real look at what thoughts
are that was really big the other thing that happened
for me is I of course I just kind of
got a proof of concept that these techniques actually work
that there is some cool [ __ ] experience out
there that you've never had before in your life and
it's left my mind like permanently expanded not enlightened but
permanently expanded in fact right now I'm standing here with
you and I'm I'm shooting this video but right now
my mind is like it's a little zoomed out and
I can feel like I'm I'm half meditating right now
as I'm standing here talking to you which has never
happened to me before when I'm shooting a video um
which is so which is really [ __ ] cool
and and also yesterday a few days after the retreat
was over I was able to meditate and the meditation
I'm able to do now my daily meditation it's so
much more powerful it feels like meditation on steroids it's
like cheating I can meditate for fifty minutes and it
feels like five minutes and I was almost able to
recreate that entire experience again yesterday I was so close
so I'm feeling like I'm kind of like really at
the blank now and it feels like that that experience
that I had a few days ago at the retreat
um that even though it didn't make me permanently lighten
it just like it did jostle some things around and
it's like it's so much easier now I feel like
I'm so mindful I was walking around yesterday doing stuff
running errands and I felt like I was meditating while
I was running errands without even trying to meditate I'm
feeling that right now as I'm speaking it's incredible it's
really cool feeling but not even a fraction of what
enlightenment would actually be like so that's my experience hopefully
this motivates you a little bit to pursue some of
this stuff yourself hopefully it kind of convinces you that
there's something real out there for you that this is
not just philosophy um you know the real reason for
this video here I didn't want to just talk about
some awakening experience that I had like some people do
I wanted to take you step-by-step through the process that
I used in the moment to get me there in
fact after this experience was over I actually sat down
on my computer and rode every step out of my
thinking process because I wanted to make sure that I
actually got it down correctly and I didn't miss anything
I think I'm pretty accurate at this point and so
basically what you have here is you have a little
example of how to do proper self inquiry right so
if you're doing self inquiry at home or you're following
my other enlightenment videos then this thing here will show
you maybe some of the pitfalls that you're making maybe
go back and re-watch this again go through every step
and actually maybe take some notes and take a look
at where are you going through this process but then
getting lost in your thoughts dream or not being seeing
thoughts for what they really are or maybe you're not
at all going through this kind of process right maybe
you're just thinking about stuff logically or philosophically and of
course that doesn't work you need to be getting that
conscious traction which I was a stressing a lot at
each step um the other reason I wanted to talk
about this is because you know sometimes people criticize me
and say well Leo if you're not enlightened how come
you're shooting these videos and talking about enlightenment as though
you are enlightened what if you're wrong or whatever I
hear you that's a perhaps a valid concern but also
you got to realize that I am walking this path
and that in fact this is how I want it
to be I could have held off to shoot videos
about enlightenment for a couple of years until after I
did become enlightened but I felt like that would be
weaker and that would actually not be as persuasive because
when you can see a person who's just an ordinary
normal person who's not a yogi or a Zen master
or [ __ ] Eckhart Tolle when you can see
a normal person start from Ground Zero and kind of
work his way up and through the process and then
you can actually see the results of that process actually
materialize on film that has a very different psychological effect
on you just in terms of persuading and convincing you
of pursuing enlightenment then if you just go to some
yogi and he just tells you all these you know
lofty high consciousness ideas which you know nothing of what
to do with all so as I'm going through this
process I'm seeing all the obstacles right I'm trying to
report all these obstacles because I can easily see that
if I become enlightened and then I spent 20 years
deepening my enlightenment and then I teach you 20 years
later yes I'll know very much about enlightenment at that
point much more so than I do now except the
problem is that I will have forgotten this whole journey
to large extent and what I'll be teaching you is
some very advanced [ __ ] that's going to be
complete disconnect from your practical life and you're going to
be unmoved by it which is exactly why Zen masters
and Yogi's are so ineffective um it's also why even
someone like a heart tolay I think it's ineffective because
in a sense like he's not actually these people are
not actually taking through through the process right you got
to see the nasty gritty bits of this process like
your face in the mud you doubting yourself you taking
that leap of faith because you don't know what the
[ __ ] you're gonna find out there with enlightenment
you think I don't doubt myself you think on this
journey of a year and a half while I'm running
a business and doing all this other stuff in my
life and I'm so [ __ ] busy that um
it never occurs to me like oh [ __ ]
what if all stupid and pointless and wrong you don't
think that thought crosses my mind in the same way
that does yours it does right I want to show
you that I'm working through that doubt and you're gonna
have to work through that doubt - just because I'm
enlightened I could be enlightened like the Buddha won't help
you with your doubts your doubts will still all be
there you have to go through this entire process you're
not going to know what you're gonna find out there
even if I tell you it won't help you won't
help you my linemen won't help you really at all
um maybe I'll convince a little bit more but that's
about it um and also you know one thing I
want to do more with with my videos you know
sometimes I come off a little cocky as though I'm
here and I'm like Moses passing down the Ten Commandments
to you of personal development and that's really not my
intention the reason I take that cocky strident attitude sometimes
is because I like it when someone talks direct to
me and they don't waffle around and [ __ ]
around so I do kind of take that direct approach
with my style to personal development and the delivery method
but also I want to show you like the fact
that I'm working through this stuff constantly I don't have
anything set in stone even the non enlightenment stuff that
I share with you that stuff I'm always learning and
thinking about sometimes these are fresh insights that I've just
had the day before and now I'm sharing them with
you and they're not even fully baked yet sometimes when
I'm speaking in the middle of the video I have
a new insight and I share with you right here
and I haven't even thought it all through yet um
to me this is kind of like raw personal development
right um I don't really want to pretty it up
and you know like package it too much um I
want to be kind of raw the way that you
would do it if you were doing it so I
want to give you a little more that behind-the-scenes look
at how this stuff works not with just enlightenment um
but with any aspect of your life that you want
to improve relationships business career whatever right um I really
think that that's one aspect of personal develop that it's
been missing um from prior teachers not to say that
they haven't done great work um so hopefully you get
a little bit of taste of that here right I'm
walking the path if you're walking the path good if
you have doubts good if your doubts about me good
you don't need to believe in me there's nothing about
me to believe I'm sharing ideas with you the whole
intention of this channel and actualize that or use that
I'm sharing some ideas with you um I don't provide
any evidence really I don't provide you studies I don't
give you double-blind studies and you know peer-reviewed journal articles
or any scientific stuff what I do is I come
up here and say hey here's some [ __ ]
that I found useful in my life why don't you
take this idea open your mind up use it try
it out and see if it works well for in
if it does keep going and if it doesn't then
throw it away and try something else right so even
though I might come off all cocky and a little
bit like hey this is the only way to do
it that's not actually what I mean um there are
many ways to do it you gotta experiment around with
this stuff and this stuff is a dirty business right
there's a lot of struggle here it's not easy a
lot of struggle goes into this developing yourself is going
to be the hardest thing you do in your life
and the last thing I'll mention is that um I
had a lot of other important insights and lessons from
this retreat that I'm going to be sharing with you
over the next few months as I release more videos
there's gonna be at least eight more videos on different
insights that I had they're going to be very helpful
for increasing your ability to be mindful for increasing how
you meditate and improving that for helping you with moving
towards enlightenment and not getting stuck in all the different
traps that exist alright so you have something to look
forward to I'm Leo I'm signing off please leave me
your comments down below please click the like button share
this video with a friend and come check out actualize
org right here I've got a free newsletter there I'm
releasing new videos on a weekly basis like I said
there's also my life purpose course which I recently released
will show you how to find your life purpose and
we'll show you how to develop your dream career if
you're interested in that sort of thing check that out
which other resources there so go ahead and check it
out it's all free or most of it is and
I'm excited to continue going deeper with you what I'm
starting to notice more and more is that um to
live the kind of life you want you have to
learn the psychological laws that are governing your life success
and fulfillment these things are governed by psychological laws just
like the physical world is governed by physical laws right
and if you don't understand physics you're not going to
be able to fly to the moon and if you
don't understand your own psychology then you're not going to
be able to create the kind of life that you
want and your life is going to be miserable and
annoying and frustrating and much much less than it could
be on the other hand if you do master these
psychological principles then the level of profundity how profound your
life will be will be stratus it'll be so it'll
be so huge that um there's nothing I could even
say right now that would convey the concept to you
it is outside of your imagination how profound your life
could be if you seriously start applying these principles over
the weeks and months and years you'll start to see
huge results and you know I've been shooting these videos
for what is it a year and a half two
years something like that I'm starting to see more and
more comments from people that are following actualised at Oregon
using all this content the people that actually use this
content apply it I'm starting to get feedback like through
email and through YouTube comments and stuff that um they're
seeing results and I'm really happy that they're seeing those
results um because um that shows me that there's people
out there who actually applying it right and that could
be you if you want that could be you could
be seeing those results takes work take some patience but
have to have that vision of what you're shooting for
and I hope you're shooting for an extraordinary life all
right sign up and I'll see you soon you
