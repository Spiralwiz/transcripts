hey this is leo for actualize.org and in this video
what i want to talk about is i want to
talk about the differences of doing personal development doing it
professionally and doing it kind of as a layman personally
so what is this distinction well the distinction is this
when i was starting off it was really clear to
me that when i was doing personal development i had
some doubts so i went out and i bought one
of those tony robbins cds and don't get me wrong
i love tony robbins i don't want to bash him
or anything or say anything bad but one of the
things that immediately came to mind for me one of
the objections was well sure he can get the results
because he's doing this professionally whereas i'm the layman i'm
just going to buy one of these cds i'm going
to read one of his books and how can i
expect to get the same kind of results as he's
getting right so that was kind of an objection that
i had when i was starting this whole thing off
because i said well i'm not a professional person a
personal development guy i'm not out there running seminars and
i'm not out there coaching people and i'm not out
there teaching people and i'm not getting paid for doing
this stuff because i think there is a difference and
it's important to recognize that there is a difference between
when a professional gets results and when a layman gets
results so this can apply in other areas besides personal
development for example what kind of results does a professional
athlete get versus someone who plays a sport just as
a hobby or just for recreation different results right a
professional tennis player is going to get totally different results
than a weekend tennis player who plays tennis at the
country club same thing goes for golf you know what
is tiger woods able to get what kind of results
versus the kind of results you're able to get if
you play golf once every two weeks right kind of
different there's a different level of commitment there there's a
different level of of drive there's a different level of
practice that is going into this and i think the
same applies with not only sports but also applies with
uh pretty much anything in life where you're a professional
that's one of the perks of being a professional is
that when you're choosing what you want to be professional
in is that you can choose something that will also
give you other payoffs besides just money right one of
the nice things about being a professional athlete is that
then you are athletic and you get nice body get
nice energy you get these kinds of things one of
the nice things about being a professional like actor is
that you get to be out there talking to people
you get to be charismatic you get to express your
emotions you get to be good at expressing emotions and
then that carries over into your personal life and i
think one of the benefits of being someone like tony
robbins or myself who's entering into this field is that
you get to well you get to study personal development
and that you get to get a professional level of
result rather than a layman level of result but i
don't want that to discourage you because the reason i
got on this topic is that i was really thinking
about you know what can a layman expect to get
from this stuff versus someone a professional like myself who
does this for a living and i think the difference
is that yeah you have to understand that when someone
like tony robbins is getting amazing results in his life
the reason he's getting those is because he's fully invested
in this thing and the scope of what he's doing
is much larger than just taking a single book and
reading it and it's much larger than listening to someone's
seminar and don't get me wrong he does those things
i do those things but you have to go above
and beyond i think with personal development though there's a
case to be made more so than with other endeavors
in life like sports or business or anything else is
that it's almost a must for everybody the question is
are you going to really commit yourself to it and
decide that you're going to go all in and really
undertake a lifelong mastery of personal development or are you
just going to kind of dabble in it or do
it unconsciously because you know what most of us are
doing personal development on one level or another the only
difference here is right now if you're watching these videos
or if you're reading books stuff like that we're calling
it out right we're bringing conscious attention to it and
we're putting words to the stuff that's happening anyways because
if you take any person anywhere that doesn't even know
what personal development is has never heard of it they're
still undergoing growth and they're still learning things about themselves
it's just that that process when it's made conscious it
can be a lot more effective and it can be
ruthlessly effective and it can give you some amazing results
and when you're struggling through it on your own and
you've got nobody who's kind of helping you along or
giving you advice and you've got no one to bounce
ideas off of you don't have a book to read
that will give you some helpful hints and tell you
where you shouldn't go the directions you shouldn't go and
tell you the good directions to go and gives you
various techniques when you don't have those things then you're
kind of figuring it out on your own and that's
almost like if i wanted to become um an engineer
or if i wanted to master any other profession right
if i wanted to become an engineer and i had
to figure out everything from scratch without building or tapping
into the the the vast amount of wisdom that has
already been accumulated by humanity in the field of engineering
over the last couple thousand years then it's going to
be a big uphill battle right it's going to be
hard to create an engineer from scratch so to speak
where if i don't study textbooks on physics and mechanics
and mathematics and all this stuff and engineering ideas then
it's going to be very hard to develop yourself as
quickly and as efficiently as you would if you go
to school for that kind of thing which is why
school is so great with personal development though here's the
thing it's different than than other things because i'm not
going to sit here and make the case that you
should become an engineer if engineering is not your thing
nor should you become a professional athlete if being a
professional athlete is not your thing and of course i'm
not going to say that you should be trying to
be running seminars and coaching people if that's not your
thing don't go that route because there's a lot of
specific training and practice that you have to develop in
order to be an effective coach in order to be
an effective seminar leader an effective writer blogger whatever so
that's not your goal for sure but what i am
encouraging you to do here is i guess to take
a better a higher option with more commitment than what
i see some people doing with personal development some people
with personal development what they do most people is they'll
read a book once in a while maybe they'll buy
a cd course and they'll try to fix one little
problem here one little problem there and that's okay that's
better than not doing nothing but what i think you
need to really do if you're going to get into
personal development even if you don't do it professionally is
you still got to commit to learning what personal development
is and learning the principles and really becoming a student
a lifelong student of this stuff so what does that
practically mean and i kind of had an intuitive understanding
that this is something that has to happen in order
to get big results because when i got started i
knew that reading one book was not gonna be enough
in fact when i first picked up uh a tony
robbins book or it was actually uh wallace waddles uh
the science of getting rich when i first picked that
up that was my first self-help book and i that
just kind of opened my eyes to some of the
possibilities of improving my my health and improving my my
business and improving my my abundance and improving my finances
what i saw there was that this was not going
to be fixed by one book that i would have
to really commit and then i would have to start
studying this stuff and at that point i wasn't planning
to do this professionally at all i got into into
that idea many many years later but already when i
first read that book i already understood that you know
what this is something that's going to take um more
initiative than i originally thought and it's not going to
be just a one book type of deal this is
going to be something like i'm going to be reading
a book a week i'm going to be maybe reading
a book a month i'm going to be uh studying
this stuff for the rest of my life a because
well this is these are live top these are life
concepts that are going to be applicable forever right so
you don't want to outsource something like knowing how to
live life well knowing how to get fulfillment out of
life knowing how to be successful these are things that
you really want to take into your own hands there
are certain things in life that you can outsource effectively
and so other things that you don't want to outsource
because outsourcing them and trusting them to other people is
going to create problems i think personal development is one
of these things so that doesn't mean you have to
become a professional in it but that doesn't mean that
you have to have an understanding of it yourself kind
of like with taxes uh here's an example that we
can drop on right you can easily outsource your uh
your tax account and accounting nowadays to either a cpa
or you can even get one of those quick book
quicken programs or turbo tax or tax hack one of
those and it'll do your taxes for you real quick
and that relieves you of the burden of having to
go and learn all the tax code which is changing
all the time it's complicated it's boring right and so
a lot of people will prefer to outsource their taxes
i mean that's what i do i don't know really
much about taxes i don't want to know much about
taxes for me that's a burden for me learning that
stuff is just a pain in the ass it's changing
all the time and i have better things that i
can be doing with my time and my energy so
i'm happy to pay 50 bucks for turbo tax to
do my taxes for me and that's fine that tends
to work for me pretty well and it probably does
for you with taxes it's okay to do that because
taxes are not that important if you can get a
program or an accountant to do them accurately for you
then you can forget about taxes and your life is
not really going to be affected and you don't need
to sit there and learn the tax code but personal
development is different it's in a different league because nobody
can live your life for you nobody can make this
important life decisions for you nobody can can do the
self-evaluation that you need to know that you need to
do to get to really know who you are so
that the actions that you're taking in your life are
really aligned with what you ultimately want and they're going
to lead to the fulfillment that you're going to get
right and nobody can ultimately go out there and build
your willpower muscles for you build your prefrontal cortex nobody
can eliminate the negative thinking and the the the petty
chatter that's going on inside your mind that's preventing you
from from taking action or it's creating self-sabotage in your
life nobody can go out there and really motivate you
not on a consistent basis someone come and can come
in there and kind of give you a boost but
nobody can give you consistent level of motivation so these
sorts of things these are what come with personal development
right and that's why i think it's important to undertake
this this thing and to commit to it because nobody
can do these things for you and you want to
be able to be the master of your own life
and you want to be uh developing self-mastery as i
call it so that's where i think something like personal
development differs from learning the tax code is that you
have to kind of bite the bullet and say you
know what this is something that i have to do
anyways and that if i don't do it then i'm
going to be going through and i'm going to still
be facing all these challenges i'm still going to be
facing all the decisions that i have to make in
my life i'm still going to be facing uh relationship
issues and i'm going to be facing issues at work
with my career i'm going to be facing issues with
my business i'm going to be facing issues with my
finances i'm going to be facing issues with my inner
game like for example getting demotivated getting discouraged losing focus
having negative beliefs and limiting beliefs and negative self-talk so
all of these things really nobody else can fix for
you but yourself and sometimes it's really nice to be
able to be your own guide because you don't always
have someone there guiding you i'm here and i can
provide you with cool principles and concepts and advice but
in the end you want to be your own guru
so to speak and you want to be able to
coach yourself and you want to be able to be
resourceful and make strong decisions and handle all the things
that i've just been talking about for yourself and the
way to do that is by undertaking this process of
self mastery and personal development that means that you're going
to be studying this stuff that's why i'm creating a
lot of videos is because i'm trying to target an
audience of people who are not just going to come
to me for one bit of advice but who want
to do this on really as a lifelong journey for
themselves and what i think is really cool personal development
is that you can do that and still do other
things so you don't need to dedicate your whole life
to this this is just something that you do almost
as a hobby right just like you can have the
hobby of playing a little bit of a sport on
the side you can have a hobby of playing a
musical instrument or doing this or doing that these are
things you do they are not the core center of
your life so but they still give you a lot
of payoff and i think that's really what you need
to do with personal development is make it a hobby
of yours for me i started by making it a
hobby and it was a hobby of mine for a
couple of years and i was getting good results and
then for me for my own personal reasons it was
something that i really enjoyed doing so i made the
transition from hobby to career out of it and make
a business out of it but that's definitely not something
that's right for everybody that's not right for most people
so for you though i think making it a hobby
is important don't make it a one-off thing just like
almost you would do with your fitness and your nutrition
i think those are also things that you really need
to take control of you can't really outsource your nutrition
and you can't outsource your fitness these are also things
and you can lump them in with personal development but
i tend to think that they can almost be separated
out because for example learning how to keep yourself fit
learning how to go to the gym and building a
habit of it and knowing which exercises to do and
the same thing with your nutrition really studying nutrition and
knowing what foods are healthy for you and which are
not and the reasons behind all that those are things
that i found to really get my nutrition into shape
and to get my fitness into shape i really had
to go out there and learn those things i couldn't
just say that i'll go to the gym and then
maybe have a personal trainer that will be the master
of my fitness routine i had to really get in
there and read books i had to go watch youtube
videos i had to to study i had to experiment
talk to other people see how they do stuff and
only then did i feel like i got a really
a good sense of understanding about fitness to the point
where now i feel like i have a lot of
control over my fitness and which i think is really
a nice thing and i did that also with my
nutrition as i started studying nutrition not because i wanted
to be a professional nutritionist or even because i loved
nutrition i didn't it was just because i knew that
to get my nutrition handled to really know what's going
on there i had to study that stuff and the
way that it started was not that one day i
said oh i'm going to become really an expert in
nutrition it kind of started to build slowly over years
so at first i just wanted to get into shape
and start eating uh avoid like the worst foods and
then slowly i got a little bit more and more
interested in it and the interest kind of built and
built up and built up and built up until the
point where i ended up doing a lot of research
and then i discovered i had some health problems that
might be related to nutrition so that got me into
it a little bit more doing even more in-depth research
and at this point i feel like i've got quite
a bit of knowledge about nutrition in fact i've randomly
talked to uh to nutritionists out out and about as
i'm walking around and doing stuff and socializing sometimes i
run across nutritionists and i'm kind of shocked it kind
of makes me makes me chuckle to myself when they
start talking to me about nutrition and um i can
spot some of their or i can spot uh inaccuracies
in what they're saying or i can actually converse with
them and dispute with them and they're supposed to be
the professional nutritionists and i'm supposedly just like a hobbyist
i'm just doing it for myself and i sometimes feel
like i know more than they do about some of
these things so the point there being is that that's
a good example of what i want you to be
doing with personal development is i really want you to
ask yourself is it worth it for me to make
this a hobby and by hobby i mean this is
something that you're going to be doing consistently it doesn't
mean you do it every day but it's something you
do periodically and you do for the rest of your
life and i think what's great about personal development is
that you can make it into a hobby and then
it becomes really fascinating it becomes fascinating to read all
these books it becomes fascinating to watch these videos and
go to a seminar once in a while and to
talk with people about uh best techniques and best strategies
for creating an awesome life for yourself and it it's
also good to spend some time thinking about it right
not just receiving and soaking in information for me or
from a book but actually spending your own time sitting
there and digesting it maybe taking some notes maybe sitting
there and contemplating about these different things and maybe you
have different opinions about how to do personal development than
i do or that some book might tell you to
do and sitting there and trying to figure this stuff
out i think there's a very strong case to be
made that it's worth to make that investment both because
it can be really fun and exciting but also because
this is something that pays huge pays huge huge dividends
for you down the road because when you understand personal
development when you understand the principles of creating a successful
fulfilling life well i can almost make the case you
know what is more important what is more important for
you to be doing in your life than to be
understanding how to live a happy life a successful life
and exciting life i mean to me that's what i
love and that's why i committed myself to personal development
both as a hobby and as a career is because
to me that is one of the most important things
in life is to figure that stuff out you know
if you want to have a good life then you
probably want to start thinking about some of the principles
that go into that and doing a little bit of
studying studying there is really really good so but back
let's go back to the original uh question that i
had when we started uh this video and that was
about can you get the kind of results that a
professional would get you know can you get the kind
of results that tony robbins would get or even the
kind of results that maybe i'm able to get and
i think that you don't need to do that much
personal development and to get those amazing kind of results
i think that even if you just do personal development
as a hobby you can still get really big big
big payoffs and that of course it's nice the more
time you are able to put into personal development then
obviously the more you're going to get out of it
just like with anything else in life so are you
going to realistically be able to get the kind of
results that tony robbins has gotten probably not because you
know what tony robbins had to do to get those
results i mean he read hundreds maybe thousands of books
you know he went to uh dozens and dozens of
and maybe hundreds of seminars he talked and interviewed people
that were like the best in the world like high
performers people that you could never even get access to
like uh you know really high paid business executives and
ceos and world leaders like nelson mandela and world presidents
and uh and like high-paid actors so these are people
that you wouldn't even really be able to get access
to as a layman i can't get access to these
people so that's kind of like one of the perks
that he has of being this big hotshot personal development
guru is that he is a celebrity and he gets
access to celebrities and it's always nice to be able
to pick the brains of high performers because you can
learn a lot just from that process and so i
mean those are just a few of the benefits that
he has that you're really not going to be able
to match in what you're doing they're not even things
that i'm able to match and i'm still doing this
stuff as a business and as a career and of
course he has many other advantages over all of that
so you can't quite match that so you're probably not
going to get the kind of results that he's gotten
but then again do you really need those kind of
results i mean he's literally made like hundreds of millions
of dollars and his success is like phenomenal through the
roof maybe one of the most successful individuals alive today
out there so those kind of results are of course
atypical as they say and you're probably not going to
get them although if you really want them go for
it but that still doesn't mean that you shouldn't do
personal development and that there's no no benefit that you
can do that you can get from doing it on
a smaller scale right and i don't think you need
to be doing it uh professionally to get those big
results i think actually the most important element of doing
personal development is not to get caught up in in
the theorizing the philosophizing that can happen and especially when
you start doing this stuff professionally you really get involved
with the theory a lot and sometimes even to the
point where it's detracting from your ability to go out
there and take action for example there's actually some detriments
to being in this thing professionally because if you're doing
this as a hobby that means what you can do
is you can go out there and you can see
what the professionals have uh have kind of distilled for
you you can grab those golden nuggets and then if
you want you can really focus yourself and go out
there and take a lot of action execute execute execute
and put all the pieces together in your life and
you're going to start getting massive results and it's going
to be awesome and you can do that relatively effectively
whereas if you decided to make this a career of
yours one of the problems that you would run into
is that all of a sudden you need to start
bending over backwards and jumping through hoops because as a
career there's all these things that you have to do
that are not necessarily at all related to your own
personal development right for example me standing here shooting this
video i had to spend hours and hours and hours
figure out how to do this practice how to shoot
these videos buy the right equipment spend a bunch of
time figuring out how to deliver these messages how to
post it online how to make everything look professional and
doing that didn't really improve my personal development so much
if i would have spent that time actually hammering out
some of these principles that are for example in my
blueprint then i would have gotten better results and actually
because i am doing personal development i'm delivering a lot
of this content obviously i'm studying a lot of this
content so i'm reading tons of books i'm interviewing people
i'm talking with clients i'm analyzing my own results and
on one level that's really great because it gives me
a lot of awareness and it gives me a lot
of knowledge but on another level it's also problematic because
sometimes again just doing those things doesn't mean that i
end up mastering myself really what i'm practicing when i'm
doing that stuff is i'm practicing my profession and that's
very different than actually mastering myself so even though someone
can go out there and give a deliver a great
seminar or someone can go out there and deliver a
great speech about personal development and can tell you exactly
what you got to do that doesn't mean that they're
able to do it themselves in fact it's very easy
for me to go out there and say okay look
here are the top 10 things that you need to
do in your life to create an awesome life for
yourself or to become super rich or to have an
awesome relationship or to have an awesome family life or
here are the 10 things you need to do to
run an awesome business and just because i tell you
those things does not mean that i have those things
in my life and that does not mean that i'm
feeling those things i'm getting and i'm reaping the benefits
of them those are two different things and it actually
took me getting into personal development professionally just over the
last year is when i started to realize this because
initially i thought that those were more there's more overlap
between those two things than there actually are just because
i become a really good blogger or i become a
really good writer or i become a really good speaker
or i become a really good coach does not at
all mean that i myself have my own life handled
i can easily have crappy relationships i can easily have
horrible nutrition i could easily not be going to the
gym i could easily be lazy and be slacking off
i could easily have a bunch of negative thoughts going
through my mind all the time i could be frazzled
i could be over stressed i could have a horrible
work-life balance i could have all these things and still
deliver an awesome video to you in fact a lot
of times that uh that can that can kind of
be a tendency is to actually fall into that right
and that's where you get kind of this hypocrisy effect
that sometimes you will see for example you have a
preacher on tv like a televangelist and he'll be telling
you that you're sinning and that you're doing this wrong
and that wrong and you're breaking commandments and that you
need to repent and then that that preacher that televangelist
get gets caught doing uh exactly what he was preaching
you not to do so that's the kind of hypocrisy
effect that you get and the reason you get that
is because it's actually pretty easy to go out there
and preach it's not hard i mean if you want
to right now you can go into a book and
read 10 principles or 10 10 things that are important
to be doing and then you can read 10 things
that are that you should never do and then you
can go out there and you can preach to someone
you can preach to your kids you can preach to
your friends you can preach online you can gather a
bunch of people together and charge them and create a
seminar and teach them this stuff but then you wouldn't
be living it yourself and it would be very easy
to actually do that and people would still listen to
you because it's hard for people to see whether you're
doing it personally it's hard for people to see whether
you're feeling the effects of the development so for me
when i got into this i kind of realized that
this was a problem and one of the things that
i committed to when i started is that i really
have to walk the talk and that if i'm out
there researching these principles i need to really be careful
about not just getting into that preacher mode where i'm
telling people what to do and not doing it myself
because i didn't really care about the hypocrisy of it
what i really cared about is uh is for my
own for my own health because i think i would
uh i'd really be devastated if i was preaching all
this stuff and i was teaching people how to get
their lives in order and then my life uh 10
20 years from now ended up being in shambles and
i couldn't manage a relationship or i had finance problems
or i had uh health problems related to my nutrition
and my exercise so all those things i feel like
you know the reason i got into personal development was
to really improve myself and to get my life to
the point where i'm excited and really engaged and fulfilled
and i'm living a big life and then from there
i kind of thought well it would be really nice
to help people do the same because i i feel
like i have a talent for it but i always
need to keep my mind both on the fact that
i'm doing this as a profession and i'm also doing
this personally for me so for me there's actually uh
my energy my attention is kind of split and i
think that's what has to happen if you undertake personal
development professionally but that's almost kind of a downside right
that's one of the downsides of doing it professionally so
the nice perk for you doing this as a hobbyist
is that you don't need to worry about that and
that you don't need to worry about that hypocrisy effect
you don't need to worry about putting your energy towards
writing articles and shooting videos and learning all this stuff
and then learning how to communicate it which is a
really big factor not only do you have to learn
it you have to learn how to communicate it which
has nothing to do with really applying it in your
life it's just about the mechanics of communication and that
can take a lot of time and a lot of
effort so you don't need to waste your resources on
that if that's not your thing and you can just
focus on improving your life right if you're already running
a successful business in some other industry that's great keep
running that business and just take the principles and the
ideas that i'm talking about here and look for ways
to go out and directly implement them you can study
some of these principles and if you're curious about them
go ahead and study some of these topics you know
if you're curious about visualization you hear me talking about
it maybe go out there and pick up a book
and study visualization or if you're curious about life purpose
and you want to know more about how life purpose
works so that you can get a little bit you
know squeeze a little bit more out of that concept
for yourself that's a good concept to study and i
can show you some books that you can read or
maybe give you some programs that you can look into
to help you out with that but really what i
want you to do is i want you to take
the golden nuggets and then go and apply it so
that your life is made better by these concepts don't
just study visualization go out there and visualize the things
that you want use it to get you the results
that you want don't just study life purpose go out
there and create an awesome life purpose for yourself improve
your life purpose with this with these principles and ideas
that i'm showing you and that's what i want you
to be doing across all levels and that kind of
wraps up my thoughts on the difference between doing personal
development professionally and as a hobby ultimately i think the
thought that i want to leave you with is do
you want to pursue this as a hobby or do
you want to not pursue it at all because the
thing is if you don't undertake this as a hobby
then i can promise you that you're going to struggle
a lot and you're going to reach points in your
life where you really wish that you did so i
want to encourage you to think about that ask yourself
that question think about it and if you do want
to take it on as a hobby i think that's
awesome that's why i have a lot of these free
resources out here for you is because i want to
get you to buy into this idea that it's a
cool hobby and if you want to take it further
you can and just see where it goes run with
it see how it improves your life take it on
as a hobby try it on for a year and
see what kind of results you get and if you
like it continue forward and you're going to build curiosity
it's going to become fun for you and i'm here
