hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about how your mind
distorts reality and I'm going to tell you how to
start developing accurate perception I want to start off by
reading you a powerful quote quote the strength of man's
position in the world depends on the degree of adequacy
of his perception of reality the less adequate it is
the more disoriented and hence insecure he is and hence
he is in need of idols to lean on and
thus find security the more adequate it is the more
he can stand on his own feet and have his
center within himself and quote that's from psychologist Erich Fromm
this is a very foundational episode I'm going to introduce
you to a very important distinction that's going to serve
you throughout the rest of your self-actualization journey and it's
going to be very eye-opening for you if you stick
with me it's really worth it to stick with me
on this one the distinction that I'm going to introduce
to you here is one that actually comes to us
from Abraham Maslow who is sort of the father of
self actualization he coined the concept and the distinction is
this deficiency cognition versus being cognition we can also label
it as deficiency perception versus being perception so we're going
to be using the words cognition and perception interchangeably throughout
this talk so there's two kinds the deficiency kind and
the being kind now I'm going to go into some
lengths and give you a lot of examples and a
lot of nuanced compare and contrasting between these two so
you get a real good idea but a shorthand way
to talk about them is D cognition versus be cognition
right D for deficiency B for being or D perception
versus B perception so that's just technical jargon that if
you hear me using you understand what I mean so
this concept comes to us from Abraham Maslow the question
is though it's kind of nerdy sounding why is it
important how can we actually apply this in our own
lives actually it's very important because this is one of
the hallmark characteristics of a self actualized human being one
of the things that I want to do more of
is I want to introduce you and explain the concept
of self-actualization in more subtler shades and nuances because if
I just take let's say the average person on the
street and ask him what is self-actualization he'll give me
a blank look he'll have no idea now if I
take someone who's been watching my videos for the last
two years and I asked him what is self-actualization it's
still going to be a problem because what you're going
to do is you're going to tell me something like
well self-actualization is some sort of like synonym for self-improvement
it's basically self-improvement becoming the best version of myself yadda
yadda yadda is something like that right but this is
a very uh you know a very simplistic kind of
like the most basic definition of self-actualization that you can
have self-actualization for Abraham Maslow and for myself when I
say self-actualization to me it means a laundry list of
about 20 things very specific concrete attributes of a human
being that a self-actualized person has which contrast to the
ordinary human being who doesn't have these attributes it's ways
of looking at the world and interacting with the world
and ways of being and ways of using your mind
so the problem though is that you know self-actualization is
this very abstract high-level concept and that can be very
useful but also it can be very limiting because most
people can't wrap their mind around it because they don't
really know what the full definition of the word means
and to them it's just like an empty label so
to press that issue we're going to dress it in
multiple episodes but we're going to tackle it here in
this episode by talking about one very important feature of
self-actualized people and it is that they have being cognition
or being perception as opposed to deficiency cognition or deficiency
perception I'm going to be telling you a lot of
quotes from Maslow and some other amazing writers in this
episode so stay with me because these are very powerful
very insightful quotes so here is how Abraham Maslow describes
it very beautifully he says quote a self actualizing person
is more able to perceive the world as if it
were independent not only of him but also of human
beings in general he can then more readily look upon
nature as if it were there in itself and for
itself and not simply as if it were a human
playground put there for human purposes he can more easily
refrain from projecting human purposes onto it and in a
word he can see it is there in its own
being rather than as something to be used or something
to be afraid of or something to be reacted to
in some other human way a section of cancer seen
through a microscope if only we can forget that it
is a cancer can be seen as a beautiful and
intricate and awe inspiring organization a mosquito is a wondrous
object if seen as an end in itself and quote
so what is being cognition or being perception it's the
ability to look at things holistically as they actually are
in a very attentive way without judging or classifying these
things it's an ego less self agenda list form of
perception in Maslow's words it's unmotivated its impersonal its desireless
its unselfish it's not needing and it's detached so this
is your ability to perceive an object for itself and
not the way that it is for you for itself
meaning that your desires and fears and emotions and your
self agenda doesn't infect and get projected on to the
object itself now this object could be a physical object
like a tree or a car or a coffee table
or it could be a living object could be an
animal it could be a human being it could also
be an institution like government or the Republican Party or
the Church of latter-day saints or Mormons or a race
of people african-americans or Asians or whites or whatever so
you can start to see the potential ramifications of this
right because how you perceive an object is very important
because it dictates how you then react to that object
now if you perceive an object as it is for
itself you kind of get the most accurate representation of
it as you can yet if you perceive an object
as it is for you what you get is you
get a tainted perception you get a perception which is
got baked into it your own issues in life whatever
they happen to be and you can have all sorts
of different issues in life or other people could have
all sorts of different issues in life and in fact
what could happen if you're not the one doing it
you could be on the receiving end of this so
other people could perceive you not as you are for
yourself but as you are to them does that ring
some bells has that ever happen to you people don't
take your words or your presentation or your message or
your work just as it is they project their own
issues onto it and onto you and when that happens
to you that usually is not something that you like
you think it's unfair and you think it's inaccurate and
you think it creates problems well likewise when you do
it so being cognition is the ability to avoid this
kind of projection that the human mind tends to do
you could say it's the most accurate form of perception
that's possible for a human being it's a passive and
a receptive form of perception in the sense that you
don't add a lot of stuff to it and it's
also a benevolent form of perception which is something that
Maslow is going to explain as I read one of
his quotes let me read some more for Maslow because
he's got some brilliant descriptions of all this stuff he
says quote self actualizing people take a non valuing nonjudging
non-interfering non condemning attitude towards others a desire lessness and
a choiceless awareness this understanding permits much clearer and more
insightful perception and understanding of what is actually there and
quote he also says quote concrete perceiving of the whole
of the object implies also that it is seen with
care the carrying my Newton as' with which a mother
will gaze upon her infant again and again or the
lover at his beloved or the connoisseur at his paintings
this will surely produce a more complete perception then the
usual casual rubra sizing which passes for perception illegitimate Lea
and code so you starting to see this difference it's
the difference between really looking at something and seeing it
as it is versus what we normally call perception which
is this kind of rubra sizing putting the perception into
a conceptual framework so let's now contrast and compare this
being cognition with deficiency cognition D cognition what is this
well this is ordinary perception when ordinary people talk about
perception we like to say that it's just like oh
it's just you know it's perception is the fact it's
how reality is when I perceive something when I see
a tree or a car or a person or a
government organization I'm looking at it objectively I'm seeing the
facts that's how we tend to present it to ourselves
but is that really what's happening what Maslow would suggest
is that this is a actually a partial and incomplete
form of experience it's an anxiety based and a deficiency
motivated way of perceiving the world because it's driven by
the ego and by yourself agenda so the degree to
which you have deficiencies that agree to which you need
security or safety or emotional comfort or money or whatever
your ego happens to need in life that's the degree
to which you're going to evaluate the things you look
at to see if they're going to give that to
you or if they are not see your mind is
very brilliant at automatically and unconsciously for you filtering out
what's relevant and what's not relevant so if we're not
careful and if we're just going about perceiving the world
in a deficiency motivated way what will happen is that
we're going to look at the world and we're going
to perceive all sorts of things happening in the world
that aren't really there but we perceive them that they're
there because of what these things mean for me for
my ego and my self agenda does this thing make
me happy or does it make me sad does it
make me angry or does make me calm is this
good for me or bad for me how's this for
my family how is this for my business how much
money is this thing going to make me is it
pretty is it beautiful or is it ugly all these
judgments and evaluations that we project this is a more
active form of perception than being perception because with being
perception all you got to do is you got to
sit back and let in whatever is there with deficiency
cognition though what you're doing is you're you're actively manipulating
the perception but this happens so automatically by your mind
that you don't really notice that it's happening this D
perception this deficiency perception is also an through Panther eccentric
an anthropocentric form of perception what this means is that
it's a way of looking at the world from the
human species perspective like Maslow said as though the world
was a playground and a tool for human beings this
of course is not the case but we often forget
this we tend to look at everything as though it's
made for human beings what can human beings do with
it does it serve humanity and if it doesn't well
then we either ignore it or we destroy it or
we discount it in some way this is very commonly
seen in science where supposedly the scientists are supposed to
be very objective thinkers and yet they take a very
anthropocentric view on reality deficiency perception it also tends to
be rigidly rational overly rational hyper left-brain thinking because it
tends to be very abstract to be very good at
deficiency cognition what you need to do is you need
to abstract from the facts that are there to whatever
concepts and models you want about reality so what's your
you're abstracting from the concrete from the facts you're abstracting
some kind of inference or theory or a model or
some sort of little handy mnemonic or a tool with
which to manipulate these concrete facts but that's very different
than the concrete fats themselves but see what happens a
lot of times is that we abstract but then we
forget and we tell ourselves oh no we never abstracted
in the first place we tell ourselves that our abstractions
are perceptions when in fact that's not the case also
with Dean with with deficiency perception what tends to happen
is that the person is not really able to hold
paradox very well that's that rigid rationalism which demands things
to fit into a certain conceptual framework and into our
rubrics of how reality ought to be also this kind
of cognition D cognition tends to be dogmatic and ideological
very interesting let me reduce some more for Maslow on
this point he says quote in ordinary cognition the object
is seen not so much per se but as a
member of a class as an instance in a larger
category this kind of perception I have described as quote
rubra sizing and again would have to point out that
this is not so much a full perception of all
aspects of the object or the person being perceived as
it is a kind of taxonomy a classifying a ticketing
off and a putting away into one file cabinet or
another to a far greater degree than we ordinarily realize
cognition involves also placing on a continuum it involves a
kind of automatic comparing or judging or evaluating it implies
a higher than a less than a better than a
taller than etc and quote he also goes on to
say quote it is as if less developed people live
in an Aristotelian world in which classes and concepts have
sharp boundaries and are mutually exclusive and incompatible for example
male-female selfish unselfish adult child kind cruel good bad a
is a and everything else is not a that's how
it is in Aristotelian logic and never the twain shall
meet but seen by a self actualizing person this is
fact is this in fact is not that a and
not a interpenetrate sorry it's a fact that a and
not a interpenetrate and r1 that any person is simultaneously
good and bad male and female adult and child end
quote he also goes on to say quote abstractions to
the extent that they are useful are also false in
a word to perceive an object abstractly means not to
perceive some aspects of it it clearly implies selection of
some attributes rejection of other attributes and creation or distortion
of still others so that we create it we manufacture
it he also says quote let us take for example
the perception of a painting or a person in order
to perceive them fully we must fight our tendency to
classify to compare to evaluate to need and to use
the moment that we say this man is for example
a foreigner in that moment we have classified them and
performed an abstracting act and to some extent curse elves
off from the possibility of seeing him as a unique
and whole human being and quote and he also says
quote fully disinterested desireless objective and holistic perception of another
human being becomes possible only when nothing is needed from
him and quote and finally he says quote my studies
of self actualizing people have found them simultaneously the ability
to abstract without giving up concreteness and the ability to
be concrete without giving up abstractness end quote so the
key insight that I want you to get from this
talk is that your own egoic deficiencies warp your perceptions
try to realize just how significant this is what I'm
telling you do you understand what I'm actually telling you
are you hearing me I'm saying that your own egoic
deficiencies your own neuroses warp your perception of reality what
I'm telling you is that the very interface between you
and reality is compromised by your lack of mental health
and that the accuracy of your perceptions depend on your
emotional maturity and your mental health and that this distortion
that's created this is not a small Distortion this is
not something we can just say oh yeah yeah Leo
I know there's a little bit of distortion between what
my ego wants and my self agenda and between what
I actually see no what I'm saying is that it's
a highly significant Distortion it's not a small Distortion we
can sweep under the rug and say everything's okay it's
a massive distortion which leads to many of the issues
you have in your life so this is not just
you know a philosophical considerations is not a theoretical consideration
is a very practical consideration this explains many of the
issues and recurring dysfunctional patterns that happen in your life
that you just can't eliminate and can't stop and you
don't know why you can't well you know why because
your perception is so inaccurate of reality that you can't
even see that the problems you have in your life
are being created by your perceptions and so what happens
is that you go out there in the real world
and you try to change things in your life you
try to get a new job you try to change
your girlfriend or you try to change your husband you
try to change your kids you try to change the
city you live in the country you live in you
try to change how much money you have in your
bank account you try to go to the gym and
change how you look you change how you talk you
change how you dress you change all this stuff and
yet all the problems basically still remain for you that's
because the problems are largely a function of your flawed
perception of your deficiency cognition and your inability to have
being cognition so if you want to really self actualize
you need to start to see the importance of this
and to start developing being cognition you need to start
to notice not just to hear from me intellectually and
just to believe me but you need to actually experientially
start to notice how your mind warps reality and how
it rubra sizes reality by rubra sizing reality this is
Maslow's word what we mean is we just mean that
your mind creates kind of a conceptual rubric or framework
and then it tries to get reality to match your
concepts of reality rather than just seeing what's there in
reality without any kind of rubric or judgments or evaluations
or stipulations of your own it really is sobering to
come to a point in your own psychological development where
you look around you and you realize like you really
grasp that you live in an augmented reality augmented reality
is not some technological fantasy of the future where computers
and virtual reality goggles will project onto ordinary reality some
kind of computer images augmented reality is already here it's
what the human mind is a genius at doing this
is what makes the human race such a powerful and
also destructive force on this planet is that we are
probably the only organism on this planet that lives in
an augmented reality augmented by our concepts and our images
and our fantasies and our desires augmented in such a
way what we don't realize that this augmentation is happening
and yet at the same time our minds tell us
that we are the only self-aware creatures on this planet
and the mind it plays this little trick it says
no but Leo what are you talking about human beings
are the most self-aware creatures we know ourselves were awake
so to speak it's all the dumb animals that don't
really know what they're doing human beings we know what
we're doing but the more you grow psychologically the more
you discover just how big of a sham this narrative
is society tends to feed that narrative to us even
science tends to feed into this narrative that like human
beings that are that you know the intellectual top of
the food chain and the the intelligence chain on this
planet and while you know human beings unquestionably have some
remarkable mental abilities the problem is that we don't acknowledge
that the ego creates a kind of smog through which
we can't clearly see reality I love this concept ego
smog from david bohm beautiful concept David Bohm is a
quantum physicist well he was he's no longer alive but
he's a really brilliant thinker and a very a great
example of a scientist who's both rational but also post
rational and highly intuitive and was very very attuned to
this problem that I'm speaking about here he was one
of the scientists one of the few scientists who really
got it who really saw the limits of the human
mind and how it creates this ego smog which distorts
your ability to see and to think and then from
which all most of your human problems stem in fact
what I want to do is I want to quote
David Bohm here because he has a very insightful ways
of wording this he says quote thought is always doing
a great deal but it tends to say that it
hasn't done anything that it is just telling you the
way things are but thought affects everything what thought takes
to be perception what we ordinarily call perception is actually
highly affected by thought thought can produce experiences without our
being aware that they are being produced by thought it
is this deceptive feature of thought that we have to
watch out for this is the point I'm trying to
make thought is affecting what you see in many subtle
ways you may miss the fact that this is coming
from flawed itself what is really missing is that we
have to be able to see that flawed is actually
participating in perception we are infusing our imagination our past
and our knowledge into what we see and eventually it
models up the brain from that going wrong it spreads
and becomes a systemic fault that spreads into everything and
quote that's all various excerpts from the physicist David Bohm
so what do we do about all this it seems
like a pretty deep systemic problem and it is we're
only scratching the surface of how deep and how systemic
this problem is this problem is like a bug you
might say in the minds operating system the mind is
blind to the minds own biases and this plays out
in your life they're practically creates a lot of your
practical problems in life relationships business financial problems emotional problems
inability to be satisfied and fulfilled with life depression stress
anxiety nervousness all the many neuroses that you have they
all ultimately stem from this but also it creates a
lot of problems collectively for society war genocide governments abusing
their citizens famines religious intolerance and so forth all of
these problems are also ultimately stemming from this problem the
systemic Fault in the way that the human mind works
this is a deep study there's a lot we could
say about this but I don't have that much time
maybe I'll cover it more in the future in other
episodes because I really want to talk about the the
social problems of all this because it really goes way
beyond just your own personal development so what's required here
is practice we need you to get awareness over the
fact that this is happening on a daily basis in
your life and that you're living your life from deficiency
perception you're perceiving life from your own deficiencies but this
is hard to just believe and it doesn't help you
to just believe me you have to actually see it
for yourself you have to develop awareness for your own
projections how you project your own agenda and your own
rubric onto reality onto people onto things onto situations in
your life onto your business onto your your spouse onto
your children this happens every day for you see to
turn this around what needs to happen you just start
looking at objects at people for themselves as they actually
are and not how they are for you and to
do that let me point out some important things for
you the following list of things are all projections of
your mind which do not actually exist in the external
world and which are not a feature of reality itself
firstly labels and names that we give to objects these
are all projections also every category taxonomy and hierarchy that
we impose upon reality is artificially constructed by the human
mind it's a projection it doesn't actually exist in reality
even more importantly meanings judgments values usefulness and purpose are
all projections of your mind onto reality so whenever you
look at a situation or an object or a person
and you get a meaning from that or you judge
that or you put a valuation on it like you
say well that's valuable or that's not valuable or you
say that's useful to me or that's not useful to
me or you say that has a purpose or that
has no purpose all of that activity is a projection
of your mind and a part of deficiency cognition are
you taking this in are you seeing the severity and
the magnitude of what I'm talking about here this is
so pervasive the tentacles of this issue go into every
facet of your life this thing is like a cancer
deficiency perception is like a cancer and it's like a
cancer that's at a at a very you know advanced
stage where it's starting to infect every organ and every
tissue in your body it's not just localized into one
little area think about how many meanings you assign to
situations and people and objects in life how many judgements
you make how many valuations you create how many things
you evaluate based on its usefulness to you or not
can you stomach the fact that all that stuff is
a mental abstraction a projection of your mind and if
these things don't actually exist in the real world I'm
talking about some heavy stuff here that means like when
you're when your parents get cancer and one of them
dies whatever meaning you assigned to their death that's a
mental projection of your mind or when your child gets
sick and you're worried about your child because you really
fear for their health or something like that or for
their future your child let's say gets into some you
know dangerous situation again that's a project of your mind
or when you're when you're dating somebody and you're trying
to find you know that dream girlfriend or dream boyfriend
or spouse that you want to marry and whatever feelings
you have about this person whether positive or negative whatever
evaluations you make of them however you see them fitting
into your life that all of these things are actually
not that person they're all creations of your mind they're
part of the ego fog or the ego smog as
David Bohm explained it also emotional triggers so this one's
really important to watch out for and this one's very
practical for you because any time that you get emotionally
triggered by situation whether it's someone yelling at you or
someone calling you a bad name or someone even doing
you harm or someone stealing some money from you or
someone breaking your heart rejecting you annoying you frustrating you
taking advantage of you abusing you physically or emotionally the
emotional triggers you have from that are also all creations
of your mind that's huge can you see how huge
that is those triggers are not in the situation or
in the object they're completely in your mind also and
this one's really huge see if you could follow me
on this one it's very advanced insight relationships between objects
do not actually exist every relationship between one object and
another object is a projection of the human mind in
reality everything in the universe is infinitely related to every
other thing in the universe the relationships are infinite the
only question is which relationships does your mind focus on
you see you actually try this out as an exercise
sit down in a room by yourself and just look
at any object and notice its relationship to you and
then notice that that's actually one out of an infinite
number of billions and trillions of relationships that that exact
object has with everything else in the universe and yet
your mind D focuses all of those and just focuses
on this one your relationship let's say to the lamp
or your relationship to your spouse but the reality is
that your spouse is related to you as much as
she or he is to to the moon to the
Sun to the president the United States to the person
you hate next-door like your neighbor to you know whatever's
going on on on Pluto who's actually picking out the
relationship who actually establishes that a relationship even exists the
human mind it projects it it projects it as a
function of self survival it's part of your ego agenda
for whatever reason is helpful for you to perceive this
one relationship here and then not only do you perceive
a relationship but then of course you add so much
more to it you know what is the relationship how
do you feel towards this person who is this person
nice to you do they owe you do you owe
them is their guilt going on is their shame as
their embarrassment you know all this stuff all week we
get so emotionally tied up with relationships and I don't
just mean with people I also mean with objects what's
your relationship to your car you do have a relationships
your car if you're like most people because you know
if you walked out tomorrow and you saw that a
tree had fallen on your car and crush it in
half uh you would have an emotional reaction you wouldn't
just stand there and be like oh my car just
got destroyed by that tree that's not how you would
actually react you would be like holy [ __ ]
and you actually probably feel sad for your car or
you'd feel pissed off that a piece of property that's
yours another relationship is that you own that piece of
property another fiction of your mind but see that relationship
is there as well so this whole web of relationships
comes into your mind and now all the sudden you
know you're upset by this your car has been destroyed
and now you're reacting emotionally to all this and you
really feel like you lost some value that was a
thirty thousand dollar car it was brand-new I just bought
it brought it home from the dealership last week and
now it's destroyed and my insurance company you know what
are they gonna do they're probably bastards not gonna pay
me what it's worth another relationship you have is your
relationship to your insurance company and what do you feel
about your insurance company how do you evaluate them what
kind of judgments do you make about them what kind
of meanings do you assign to that do you see
how these tentacles reach very far in your life that's
in some ways what makes them so difficult to track
is because they just it's like a web write it
just like a chain and it goes many many many
levels deep and it's all nested in each in itself
which makes it very hard to untangle this giant mess
in your mind which is why when you have some
kind of psychological problem in your life like let's say
you're depressed or you have low self-esteem you don't like
how you look you're not confident with women or with
men or you're insecure with business or you're insecure about
your money situation all these things you think this is
just like a little individual isolated problem but actually it's
not it's a consequence of this web just giant web
and relationship and beliefs and judgments that you project onto
reality it's really a a defect or a bug within
the mental software that you've been spinning in your mind
you see but it doesn't feel that way because it
takes so much work to become conscious of this it
takes years of work to become conscious of this and
lastly the thing that doesn't exist is separations and boundaries
objects themselves are creations of the mind this thing goes
so deep that even you're looking at a car and
calling it a car and thinking of it as a
physical object a car with four wheels and it's colored
red or whatever that itself is a separation or a
mental boundary that your mind carves out of a completely
unified phenomenal field which has no objects in it reality
does not have any objects if you look upon reality
ever in your life with complete lucidity and this is
possible with complete lucidity and being cognition you will see
that there is not a single boundary or object in
reality but that's going to take some work take a
lot of work to see that that's not something you
can get to just from hearing me talk about this
stuff the most important thing you gotta understand here is
that everything I'm talking about is just mental noise to
you even if you like it and you agree with
it and you believe it and it sounds all very
eye-opening it makes no difference because it's just another piece
of knowledge and your knowledge graph in your web of
beliefs what really makes the difference is when you actually
are able to change how you perceive and just getting
another thought into your mind does not change how you
perceive so how do you change how you perceive well
in practice the situation is pretty bleak it's very difficult
to grasp what I'm telling you experientially and most people
will not grasp it which is actually from the problem
and the place from which virtually all of social problems
stem the reason we have all these social problems social
inequality wars and terrorism all these things is because it's
just so freakin hard to grasp but I'm telling you
experientially if everyone on earth was able to grasp it
all these problems would mostly be solved instantly but nevertheless
you as an individual can do it if you really
see the importance of it and you're willing to allocate
the time and energy that this topic deserves not just
a casual you know listening to me talk for an
hour that's nothing that's a drop in the bucket this
requires practice and if you're not willing to practice it's
not going to happen for you what's going to happen
you're just going to listen to me you're going to
forget all this you're going to fall back asleep next
week and you're just going to go on with deficiency
perception perceiving reality through the go explore that you have
and all the agenda that you have and not as
reality actually is if you ever gazed upon reality as
it actually is you'll discover that there are no problems
in reality every problem is a fabrication of your mind
think about the most deepest problem you have that just
bugs the hell out of you that you think is
just completely insurmountable you have one of those most of
us do whatever that is pick one for yourself right
now and now try to imagine that thing is a
complete fabrication of your mind and doesn't exist at all
you created it below how could that be that's not
possible not with my bromley you understand my problems a
real problem like I got a real leo I got
a real serious problem like my child is a drug
addict how can you tell me that that's a projection
of my mind that's a real problem uh yeah it's
um it's tough to to convince someone who's so unconsciously
absorbed in their deficiency perception of reality that it's even
possible to perceive reality from a position of being perception
and this is exactly what differentiates an ordinary human being
from a self actualizing human being is that the self
actualizing human being maybe not always maybe not fully not
a heart set at the time but at least to
a significant degree is able to look upon reality from
outside themselves in an objective fashion outside of the smog
of their ego so how do we actually practice this
let's say you're really committed and you're saying like leo
okay you've convinced me I really want to change something
here how do I change my perception how do I
get this self actualized form of perception well here's a
little exercise for you that you can start to use
to do this it's real simple select an object or
a person that you either hate or you love and
then see it for itself as it actually is and
not how it is for you see it independent of
its value or its meaning or its purpose or is
usefulness to you or to humanity look at the object
as though God up in the clouds was looking at
the object totally dispassionate in other words but not in
a sort of like left-brain highly analytical way because that
can be a trap to a lot of times scientists
or rational people will convince themselves like well Leo I'm
already doing this you don't understand you know I'm a
I'm very rashly - scientific minded personal truth is something
that I'm a champion of yeah and uh and and
so therefore you know I already am doing what you're
saying I already am perceiving from a being cognition perspective
no you're not not at all in fact your rationalism
is a is a very big example of deficiency cognition
it's not a complete perception because your rationalism includes all
the mental categories concepts knowledge frameworks in which you place
the object that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking
about something very different something you probably haven't ever done
in your entire life maybe you did it when you
were a child before mainstream society filled your mind with
modern-day rational ways of thinking that's what we're taught right
we're not really taught religion nowadays we're taught rationalism that
is the new religion rationalism but it's even more dangerous
than old religion because old religion you could tell it
was [ __ ] and you could tell that it
was like it was religion and you can see that
it contrasts to practical everyday logic but with modern scientific
rationalism you can't see that anymore so you pick an
checked that you hate or that you love and you
try to sit there and look at it in the
present moment not even as an object because even calling
it an object is already you rubra sizing it this
takes some work when you first try it it's going
to seem weird it's going to seem like what the
hell am i doing you might be sitting there looking
at a lamp for 30 minutes trying to see the
layout as it is for itself and not how it
is for you the fact that you see it as
a lamp is how it is for you not for
itself for itself it's not a lamp for itself it
doesn't have any function for itself its purpose is not
to light the room for itself it's not even an
object it's not big it's not small it's not tall
it's not short it's not beautiful it's not ugly it's
not old it's not you knew it's not worth $10
or $100 or $1,000 or however much you paid for
it it's none of those things what is it actually
so your job is to sit there and just to
look at it until you can get to the point
where you can be with it completely from a position
of being conditioned and then contrast and compare that experience
with the everyday experience you have a lamp which is
deficiency cognition so one thing I don't want you to
do is I want you to trick yourself here into
thinking like well Leo I already do being cognition all
the time no you don't all your ordinary perception that
you have from the moment you wake up to the
moment you go to sleep nowadays unless you've done years
or decades of meditation work or enlightenment work is all
deficiency cognition so don't fool yourself thinking that you're somehow
immune or exempt or above what I'm talking about here
you're not above it at all and act let's do
this little experiment right now as you're watching me or
if you're listening to me on audio from right now
until the end of this episode which will be other
five or ten minutes I want you to practice this
perceive me for myself not for yourself perceive me without
any evaluations about whether I'm good for you or bad
for you whether I'm right or wrong whether I'm beautiful
or I'm ugly whether what I'm saying make sense or
it doesn't whether it's logical or it's illogical whether I'm
Leo or not leo or whether even I'm a human
being or I'm a mammal or I'm a physical object
however you classify me throw all those away for a
minute and just try to stay conscious for the next
five minutes let's say of what you're getting for me
the actual perception of me - your ego smog -
all your rubrics whether positive or negative try that right
now and try to stay conscious and I want you
to notice if you forget as I'm talking and you
fall back asleep so a couple more points I want
to make here one is the connection of all this
being cognition to enlightenment and mindfulness so the connection is
very direct enlightenment basically is the dissolution of your ego
so it is the removal of the ego smog if
you're wondering why I keep talking about enlightenment so much
now you can start to see because it removes the
ego smog which allows you to perceive reality in the
most accurate way that's humanly possible sounds rather important now
doesn't it same thing for meditation same thing for mindfulness
work I talked a lot about these topics and I'll
be talking more and more about these topics in greater
and greater depth in the future and I want you
to stay with me on these topics because these topics
are the ones that will transform the quality of your
life the most if you are just open-minded enough to
it and also if you take action on it and
don't just take it all as theory and beliefs so
there's a very direct connection between all this and enlightenment
and enlightenment experience is pure being perception but you could
increase your being perception without having an enlightening experience so
you know enlightening seems pretty rare might take you a
few years to get one so don't think that all
just you know until I'm enlightened then I'm not improving
no you can work and improve your being perception just
by improving your neuroses you know every neuroses that you
identify and fix in your life every emotional dysfunction that
you remove means that your deficiencies are reduced means that
they have a less of a distorted effect on your
perception of reality have you ever this is an interesting
example have you ever interacted with a human being who
is like a total victim like very pessimistic very negative
everything you tell them they just tell you no that's
not going to work it's not going to work for
me I can't do that no don't do that that's
gonna lead to failure you ever try talking to these
kinds of people maybe you have some of these in
your family hell maybe you are one of those types
people yourself and kind of struggling with that right what
do you tell these people because you can see you
can clearly see that this person is stuck in deficiency
cognition everything they look at is tainted by their own
you know dysfunctional filters and their own need for love
like you ever had a needy girlfriend or boyfriend and
at first it's kind of cute but then it gets
real old real fast when they get real needy with
you and they start demanding love from you and they
want compliments from you and everything you tell them just
isn't good enough all the love you give them they
just they they can't really take it because you know
their whole perception of reality including the relationship you have
with them and their perception of love is all being
perceived through deficiency cognition and the more you try to
change them or to help them the the worse it
gets because even your attempts to change them they because
they're their deficiency is so great they perceive as you
actually not loving them or you know trying to change
them in some egotistical or narcissistic manner or you threatening
them they take your attempts to change them or to
help them or to give them like a self-help book
or you tell them hey come watch one of these
videos and they are threatened by that they get offended
by that or they start to attack you for that
they start to tell you no why are you listening
to this New Age hippie nonsense you're listening to this
stupid bald Leo telling you all this [ __ ]
you know filling your mind with crap next thing you
know you're gonna become some [ __ ] yogi in
a in a cave somewhere it's gonna be all his
fault right you experienced that very common so yeah you
know some people are really far gone with it but
it's a spectrum so it's not like you're either black
or white you know you're either perfect or or you're
neurotically dysfunctional most people are somewhere in between uh it
varies quite a bit but the average person is quite
a bit uh dysfunctional and deficient in their perception so
that's that point also let me talk briefly about the
connection of this to rationalism so I have an episode
that I recently released called why rationality is wrong it's
basically a critique of rationality and this episode here really
should dovetail with that one that you can consider this
one kinda like a sequel to that one because everything
I talked about there the limits of rationality and the
limits of thinking and the distinction between awareness and thought
well that's what I'm talking about here now just from
different perspectives giving you more detail on it this is
where rationalism really fails rationalism as a system fails to
see its own systemic flaw which is its own blind
sided nassif act that thoughts warp and distort perception what
the rationalist tells himself or what his mind tells him
rather is that the mind says hey look we're thinking
and our thinking is so good that we got it
all down but actually what's happening is that that thinking
as David Bohm was saying that thinking is influencing the
rationalist perceptions and tainting it to the point where what
the rationalist is perceiving is actually a construction of his
own rationalism and in this way he tricks and deceives
himself into seeing things that are not actually out there
but they're actually just figments of him at of his
imagination and one of the greatest figments of the rationalist
imagination is that rationalism is the end-all be-all system of
analyzing and arriving at truth when in fact it's not
not at all so that's my point about rationalism let
me wrap up now I hope you can see how
powerful this is I'm I'm frankly at a loss of
words to convey to you how I don't know what
I have to do to have to jump up and
down to convey to you how how deeply significant this
is for you to make a study of this you
cannot self actualize without changing your cognition you can't be
self actualized and looking at the world from deficiency cognition
which is basically another way of saying that you cannot
self actualize while maintaining your ego which is another way
of saying that you cannot self actualize without enlightenment ultimately
how can you I mean you could improve your life
without alignment sure you can improve your life you can
earn more money and you can have better relationships and
stuff so you can do improvement but you're not really
going to get to like the the part of life
that's really juicy and satisfying the self actualizing part so
you have to make a choice and the choice for
you is the following are you going to stay faithful
to your self agenda or to reality what's more important
to you your self agenda or reality and these two
things are at odds because you're selfish Enda distorts reality
so if your full loyalty goes to self agenda then
reality will be distorted okay that's guaranteed it's kind of
like a law of psychological physics you might say and
just you know the flip side of that if you
are totally loyal to reality then reality will distort your
self agenda which are you less comfortable with the distortion
of reality or the distortion of your self agenda do
you realize that self agenda is the distortion of reality
that's what self agenda is you have to distort reality
to create a partition within an unpartitioned reality for there
to be space for an ego because there's no actually
ego the ego is a fiction that's where all this
is ultimately rooted in is that the ego is a
fiction your self agenda is a total fiction to maintain
it you have to distort reality because if you didn't
distort reality you would see that it's a fiction and
then it couldn't exist and on the other hand if
you're going to pay all your allegiance to reality then
you can't do that and also maintain your current self
agenda because your self agenda is a distortion of reality
so if you're going to straighten out reality and perceive
it as it actually is eventually I mean you can
you can do that for a while and still have
yourself agenda but eventually if you get real serious about
it what will happen is that you try to straighten
out reality completely the self agenda is going to have
to completely crumble so in a in a sense can
you handle the truth do you want the truth or
is what you want yourself agenda but then recognize that
if what you want is your self agenda then you
shouldn't be too surprised when you have problems in your
life because of the inaccurate perceptions of reality that you
have do you see what the problem is with an
inaccurate perception of reality it's the same problem that a
child has who believes in monsters that live under her
bed right if she doesn't care about reality in that
situation and she's just adamant that what she cares about
is herself agenda which is you know her safety and
her survival then she what she will do is she
will insist that there's a monster under her bed and
she will insist on taking all sorts of measures to
prevent the monster from attacking her and she will waste
a lot of her energy and a lot of her
life defending herself against monsters that to an outside observer
we would just say hey I mean wouldn't it be
easier to just like straighten out your perception of reality
like look under the bed and see that there are
no monsters and then you don't have to go through
all these you know back backflips and all these mental
gymnastics to protect yourself from things that don't exist you
know but the problem is that if you're so unconscious
that all you care about is yourself agenda then I
can't help you and nobody can help you and the
really sad part is that you can't even help yourself
because you've basically committed to a life of inaccurate perception
of reality and you better believe that will deeply affect
many many many facets of your life and of course
the most important thing to you which is the quality
of your life the emotional quality of your life which
is all you really care about is the emotional quality
and fulfillment of your life that is the cost of
your self agenda very paradoxically because the self agenda tells
itself that the reason that it needs to protect itself
is because it needs to defend and protect and ensure
its own emotional well-being in the future but as with
many things in life you know too much of a
good thing becomes a bad thing and that's the case
with you so make your choice what's it going to
be all right this is Leo I'm signing off please
click the like button for me post your comments down
below I do read most of them share this episode
with friend and lastly come check out actual eyes that
run right here it's my website I have some good
resource resources for you there I have a newsletter that
keeps you on track with new material that I release
and I'm also going to be releasing more exclusive content

in the future make sure you sign up and stay
tuned for that the topics I talk about going forward
are going to get deeper and deeper and deeper and
what I want from you is I want you taking
action on these things that I tell you because quite
frankly what's going to happen is I'm going to lose
a lot of you a lot of you come in
here you listen to my ideas and like all these
are cool I like these and you know they're helpful
but then what happens is that you listen to more
and more and more and then you can get to
the point where it's like leo is just going off
the deep end you know he's going to some crazy
land with with this person development stuff you know this
enlightenment stuff is just getting ridiculous and this nut it's
because you're not actually taking action on the things I
tell you take [ __ ] action do the little
exercises I tell you your life will transform in ways
you can't even imagine yet and then as a bonus
you'll be able to listen to me in the future
to more and more advanced stuff and then that's when
self-actualization work really gets exciting is when you kind of
get past the newbie stuff and then you start to
listen to all the really advanced stuff and you start
to practice it and apply it it gets so exciting
because you can see it working and you can see
the potential of it you know where it's going to
take you 10 20 years from now and it can
take you to some extraordinary places and you start to
see that picture you really start to like feel it
in your bones that it's possible for you to transform
your whole life that's kind of where I'm at in
my life and man it's like it just gets better
and better every month it just gets better and better
and at the same time it's still painful for me
no every month is is still painful and painful sometimes
I have really painful months because this work is brutal
this work of clearing your ego smog it's not easy
business is hard business which is exactly why you need
these kinds of resources so I'm here to help you
to provide the resources that will take you all the
way to what you can fully be what you can
fully be is extraordinary it's extraordinary but it takes commitment
from you to want that to work towards that to
make sacrifices especially sacrifices of your self agenda because you're
wise enough to see the greater good that will ultimately
come to you you put that quote but if you
do have that wisdom man you're so lucky don't squander
it act on it embody it live it live the
things I tell you live the things that resonate with
you and that makes sense to you that you into
it are true and valuable in the ultimate existential sense
do that and your life will become something that you
will have tears over tears of joy and beauty anyways
