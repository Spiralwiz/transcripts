hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org and in this
video I want to tell you how to stop being
a victim alright let's talk about what it means to
be a victim in life and how to stop being
a victim this is such a critical point and in
fact this video is going to be my most important
video of all the video that I've shot so far
this is going to be the most important and this
is actually the fifth time then i'm reshooting this entire
video and that's because every time I shoot it even
though the video comes out pretty good I need to
come out amazing I need to make this point very
strongly because I know that this video has the potential
to transforms people people's lives the most if they listen
to it and that's because so many people are not
getting the results they want in life because they are
playing the victim and they're not taking responsibility for their
life and the way they need to in order to
have a foundation from which to do personal development so
that's what I want to cover in this video I
go into a lot of detail very important detail to
build the case for why you are being a victim
and why you need to stop doing it and how
to stop doing it and how to take control back
of your life if you're stuck in your life if
you feel like you haven't been getting the results you
want if you feel frustrated in any area of your
life this is most likely the reason why is because
you are behaving like a victim you're thinking like a
victim and you don't even realize that you're doing it
that's what's so dangerous and crippling about victim mentality I
want to help to turn that around for you it's
very important because I personally know people people that are
close to me people that I've come into contact with
they're not going to get anywhere in life if they
keep thinking the way they're thinking like a victim thinks
so I read a lot of comments in my YouTube
video on my YouTube videos because I shot a lot
of video already so I have a lot of commons
from a lot of people and sometimes I will see
people who are really really stuck of a real problem
in life maybe they can't get that girl or boy
they want for a relationship or maybe they're struggling with
their finances or their business or their career or their
health or whatever else and you can just read a
comment from a victim and it's going to have victim
energy soaking all through it and when I read that
and I start up to talk with these people try
to give them advice or have a debate with them
it just becomes more and more than piling on of
stories and excuses and rationalizations and blaming and complaining and
with this going on they're not able to move forward
and take the action necessary to get the results that
they really want in their life and the worst thing
about it is that they believe that they're really stuck
when in fact the only thing that's keeping them stuck
is their own thinking and it's a really dangerous thing
because it's a self-fulfilling prophecy this victim thinking and that's
what we want to end right here right now today
what is a victim a victim is somebody who gives
away control when we say that you've been victimized or
she's been victimized or he's been victimized what do we
mean we mean that something happened to that person against
his or her will and that he had no control
over that situation no ability to respond or react to
it it just happened and now he or she has
to live with it and suffer through it and there
are no options that's the cards that that person was
dealt that's what I mean by being a victim the
foundation of all personal development is to believe that you
have the power and ability to respond and to create
any kind of life that you choose and now while
this might sound very nice on paper in reality is
a challenge it's hard to do it's hard to live
and embody this principle if you think that this video
is just targeting people who are total victims total pessimists
in their own lives then you're mistaken because I can
guarantee that if you're frustrated in any area of your
life no matter how small the reason that you're frustrated
they're the reason you're not getting the results you want
there's because you have victims thinking if not across your
entire life then in a specific point in a specific
narrow area of your life and that is something that
needs to be worked out so they open for me
now after I've done many years of personal development I
don't have a overarching general victim mentality I used to
have a lot of that I've worked a lot of
that stuff out of my psyche but now I still
have victim energy in pinpointed areas in my life and
I always have to be on the lookout for those
I have to be very careful to find those and
to to pull them out by the root and that's
what I want to encourage you here to do today
so whether you're depressed or you've got anger control problems
or you've got major frustrations with your health or your
relationships or you're just very pessimistic thinking type of person
then this video is for you but if you're just
a person who has a pretty decent life but then
isn't getting the result he or she wants in one
specific area like career or finances or health or relationships
or anywhere else then this video is also for you
and what I want to do at the end of
this video is I'm going to give you a list
of signals that a victim will use these are going
to be words and phrases that the victim will say
to him or herself in order to reinforce their victim
thinking and this can be a very powerful tool for
identifying victim thinking within yourself and also within others is
by just knowing these labels and just knowing that these
all of these labels are just playing in and creating
more and more self-deception within you so we're going to
go into all of that like I said this is
the foundation of all personal development because what I'm advocating
in this video is a very radical thing what I'm
talking about here is taking 100% responsibility for your life
100% and there's a really fundamental question that you have
to ask yourself when you sit down and really think
about how life works and what you want out of
your life when you sit down to try to design
your life when you sit down to try to do
personal development and here's the question who is ultimately responsible
for the quality of your life who is that is
that your parents is that your family is that your
environment is that the country you grew up in is
it your friends is that your co-workers is it your
boss is that your husband or your wife or your
kids is it that girlfriend or boyfriend that you've got
is it your genetics is it the economy is it
the political climate that you're living under is it the
media is it society is it entertainment is it Hollywood
is it the news is it your own genetics is
it your own history is that how you were raised
what is responsible for the quality of your life see
if you answer and but me to this question then
you're thinking like a victim and you're going to get
the results that a victim gets which are not very
good results and you're going to feel the emotions that
have that a victim thinks or that a victim feels
and those are not very pleasant emotions so what I'm
advocating in this video is something very radical and it's
going to be something that you're not going to want
to accept what I'm advocating here is taking complete utter
100% responsibility for everything in your life that ever happens
that means that all these other factors that I just
listed off that those are not going to be used
as excuses or as justifications or as stories or as
any kind of obstacles for you to create the kind
of life that you want what does this really mean
to take 100 set responsibility I want to really drive
this point home there's six areas I think that are
very critical for us to take responsibility in and most
of us get the first area very easily the first
area is success most of us will take responsibility for
own successes right how about that promotion that you got
of course you get a promotion you're going to take
responsibility for it yeah I got that promotion I worked
really hard you know I earn that promotion through all
the studying and the work that I did that I
put into to get that maybe the relationship that you
got maybe you work really hard to make that relationship
work so you could take some responsibility for that success
yeah I worked really hard to to make this friendship
work or I work really hard to keep this marriage
together so you'll take some responsibility for that and that's
good but of course that's the easy right that's the
easy thing to take responsibility for what's the hard thing
the hard thing to take responsibility for is your failures
and that's the next area where you need to take
responsibility is your failures what about all in situations where
you're not getting the results you want in your life
what about that weight that you try to lose but
it didn't work that diet you went on that didn't
work that gym membership you got that didn't work what
about that relationship that was dysfunctional that didn't work what
about the lack of money that you're having something's not
working there what about the negative thinking that's going on
all the time in your head the worrying the anxiety
the fears something's not working there see failures and failures
happen but what a victim does is a victim will
blame others and situations for those failures rather than take
responsibility for him or herself so that's the second areas
failure the third area is emotions man this one's big
I have a video about how to master your emotions
which goes into a lot of depth about how to
take responsibility specifically just in this one area alone because
most people do not get this part right in their
life either is that they believe that emotions are caused
by the external environment either people will cause emotions or
situations will cause emotions so that promotion makes you feel
happy or getting fired makes you feel sad or having
a breakup makes you feel depressed or somebody saying an
insult to you makes you feel angry well in fact
you're the one who's generating all those emotions and so
you have to start taking responsibility for all the feelings
that you have in your life and not be putting
those on other people or other circumstances that are out
in the real world so that's area number three check
out my other video on that which will go into
a lot of depth area number four is accidents this
is where starts to get a little bit freaky when
I say taking herps that responsibility for your life I
mean everything I don't just mean the obvious stuff like
promotions and getting angry at people and failing at a
job or failing in a relationship that's pretty obvious stuff
I'm talking also about accidents what is accident mean that
means that if you if you go to work and
you lock your house but then you come back and
you come back that and you find that your house
has been burglarized then you're responsible for that even though
you locked all your doors that means that if you're
sitting there at a red light on your way to
work and you're sitting there at a red light just
minding your own business waiting for the light to turn
green and then someone rear-ends you crashes right in the
back of your car out of the blue that you
are responsible for that that means that if you invested
some money in the stock market and the stock market
crashed if the whole economy collapsed you're responsible for that
this is a little bit radical and you might say
well Leo why would I take responsibility for that kind
of stuff I mean that stuff's not in my control
is it and I'll get to that in a second
but you need to start taking responsibility for even the
stuff that is seemingly out of your control because the
bottom line here is that what is in your control
is how you're responding to the situation in the present
moment and we're going to talk a lot more about
that in a second the fifth area area number five
is circumstances so the circumstances of your life what the
circumstances means circumstances means stuff like the family that you
grew up in that's a circumstance of life the country
that you live in now that's a circumstance of life
how about the genetics that you had when you were
born that's a circumstance of life how about the money
the amount of money that you have now in your
bank account or the political system that's empower in your
country these are all circumstances and most people really like
to use circumstances as reasons for why they can't do
what they want in their life why they can't create
what they want their life but this is where we
nip this in the butt is right here by saying
that you take responsibility 100% for all the circumstances to
accidents and circumstances and lastly the sixth point is relationships
this is a very huge area a lot of people
are miserable their lives because of the low quality of
relationships that they have whether with friends bosses spouses girlfriends
and boyfriends or whoever else family all of that stuff
and the reason that's happening is because how much do
we like to point the finger at the other person
when something's not going right in a relationship almost every
time right almost every time we do that and that's
a huge problem every single relationship that's making you feel
frustrated it's making you feel bad you're completely responsible for
that feeling and you're completely responsible for the dynamic that's
going on between you and that other person so these
are the six areas if you take responsibility for all
of these plus anything that's left out by these six
areas so anything that's left over you have to take
responsibility for that too if you cover all of that
then you're going to be good that's going to set
the foundation that you need to really do the personal
development work that you want to do to create the
kind of life that you want to have now if
you refuse to take responsibility here then you're going to
experience a lot of suffering and bad results what I
want to do is I want to I want to
show you a a model a model of the possibilities
that you have within personal development see I see a
lot of people in life what happens is that they're
born they go through their early childhood years then they
get into their teens they go through school then they
get into college and during that time you have a
pretty natural upward growth like this in their life an
upward growth of progress personal development is just pretty natural
then after about twenty-one what tends to happen is that
natural growth starts to plateau starts to level out and
it plateaus and for a lot of people that Plateau
just keeps going and going and going and going for
decade after decade after decade until they're dead and that's
not even the worst case scenario I see a lot
of people what happens with them is not only does
it just Plateau but their personal development and their results
in life they actually start to decay after 21 so
it gets worse worse and worse and worse for me
personally my expectation is always at least what I want
to have in my life is a linear upward growth
like this right from the year that I was born
to the year that I'm going to be dead I
want it to be like this straight upward slope like
that and that's kind of what you would expect life
would be like right now you're growing you're no donor
and you just keep growing but see that doesn't work
out that way for most people because once they get
out of school and once they get in the family
situation they just kind of become stuck in life because
a lot of those mindset saw that conditioning just kind
of gels and congeals and basically hardens and then that
is the trajectory that then they carry throughout their whole
life for me that's a very very sad thing I
would hate to live a life like that and I
hate to see people and I see a lot of
people who live those kinds of lives that are plateaued
or are decaying and actually over the last five years
if I really think about it then my progress it
hasn't just been a linear growth it's been an exponential
so exponential growth because every year I'm building up myself
with new mindsets new techniques new ways to think about
the world going out there taking lots of action generating
the results that I want to generate and then those
inspire me even more those motivate me even more those
empower me literally empower me because I'm creating tools that
then allow me to have new capabilities and so what
happens is that I get experienced exponential growth and to
me that's like oh that's what I want out of
life is I want exponential growth it feels so amazing
I want that for me now I want that for
you guys so let me show you the model this
is kind of the model that you could go through
if you really wanted to if you really took the
personal development of seriously so at this end of the
spectrum we've got a spectrum here at this end we've
got victims we've also got at this end low consciousness
or total unconsciousness at this end of the spectrum we
have high consciousness or maximum possible consciousness for you as
a human being and then we've got various degrees of
consciousness along this spectrum and various stages of life various
stages of personal development so I want to cover four
stages stage number one is victim victim thinking a victim
believes that they don't have much control in life and
what the the victim often feels is a sense of
frustration and a sense of apathy a victim doesn't even
want to start taking action because they believe that they
don't have the ability to succeed they believe that there
are obstacles and roadblocks that are insurmountable that it's simply
impossible and that they can't do it and so this
is where they are the problem is that a victim
is doing all this unconsciously he doesn't really understand what's
going on here he's not even making the choice to
be a victim it's being almost made for him by
default but nevertheless this choice is being made and is
very very crippling and what's most scary about it is
that a lot of times people just don't see that
they're doing it so if that's lowest possible consciousness then
what's one step up from that if you get a
little bit more consciousness and you evolve from a victim
where do you go you go to stage number two
and this is what I call the fighter this is
the victim this is the fighter what's the fighter all
about the fighter is all about conflict it's conflict energy
it's this idea that we live in a dog-eat-dog world
the world is harsh reality is harsh I need to
fight for my survival I need to fight to protect
my family always always needing to fight you need to
compete it's believing that life is zero-sum game and that
if I win then somebody else has to lose and
if somebody else wins then I have to lose and
so there's this constant tug-of-war or this constant clashing that's
conflict energy you probably know people like this people who
are angry a lot people who are combative people who
really get in your face people who get get very
easily frustrated with life feel like they have to out
there and slave themselves in order to succeed slave themselves
in order to be happy well that is a fighter
and although a lot of this fighting energy this conflict
energy can be very nasty very unpleasant especially if you
have friends like that or family there like that can
be very nasty to be around people like that but
it's actually you could make the case it's actually better
than being a victim why is this well because the
fighter at least the fighter believes that he or she
has some control see the victim believed there was no
control the fighter believes that there is control but he
has to really worked very hard for it and he
has to take that control from other people in order
so that he could have it so that's the fighter
stage and now we move up even further along the
consciousness spectrum we move from fighter and we start taking
more and more responsibility as we move along this spectrum
and once you take quite a bit of responsibility you
get to the phase which I like to call Creator
the Creator what is the Creator the Creator is someone
who realizes that life is what they make of it
the Creator someone who realizes that yes even though there
are obstacles and challenges in life that every single obstacle
has some sort of workaround to it everything that is
blocking you in life can be made to either dissolve
or it could be made to be coped with to
be dealt with to be made at peace with to
be happy with so the Creator is all about creating
the kind of life that he wants and that's because
he's taken more responsibility than the fighter and the victim
and the difference between the fighter and the Creator is
that the Creator is really focused on putting out right
making stuff making stuff with his life making stuff with
this business making stuff with this career making stuff with
his health whereas the the fighter is always fighting stuff
he's always fighting his own health he's fighting his own
nature he's fighting people at work he's fighting people in
relationships the Creator doesn't believe that fighting and competing is
the best way the Creator believes that it's much better
to just focus on what you want to create and
leave the competition for others if they choose to do
it but not engaging it yourself and then there's the
final stage this is an advanced stage that very few
people ever reach but this should be the aim of
personal development for you and in fact this is the
vision right this is my vision for you this is
what I want you to be shooting for this is
why I want you to be watching my videos and
to be working on yourself all the time doing the
hard work to get here and what is this final
stage this final stage I would call it being at
peace even better than being a creator is getting here
this is maximum consciousness and what happens here is it's
very it's very funny it's almost like you go for
full circle because when you're at peace you no longer
believe actually that you have any control at all that's
where it goes full circle just like the victim used
to think that he didn't have control well the person
that's at peace that is just being an existing he's
simply in existence and he is a creative person but
he almost believes like he has no control over that
creation process it's almost like life force is just flowing
through him and doing the stuff that it does and
his job is simply to get out of the way
remove every single element of resistance within himself to this
life force and then life just carries itself out and
it rolls very very smoothly it's hard to believe that
this is actually even possible this is actually possible life
but it is this is possible for every human being
it's just that if you're a victim and you're all
the way over here or you're a fighter over here
it's hard to see all the way to this end
hard to see that this could be true but it
is true it's just difficult to develop - it takes
a lot of inner work it's not something that happens
naturally and spontaneously but I want you to be shooting
for this but let's not worry too much about this
right now because our main objective here is to just
get you from the victim to at least the fighter
but really the Creator I want you to be a
creator in your life so substitute victim energy for creator
for creator energy and you're going to be doing really
good that's going to set you up to then move
on to better and greater things so I mentioned six
areas in your life where you should take radical 100
cent responsibility and some of the stuff that I mentioned
that probably didn't make a lot of sense to you
with stuff like accidents and circumstances of life and maybe
relationships too so one thing you might be wondering here
is you might say well Leah all this sounds really
good in theory but you're telling me to take responsibility
for a car accident that I didn't cause you're taking
they're telling me to take responsibility for my genetics which
I had nothing to do with you're telling me to
take responsibility for who my parents were you're telling me
to take responsibility for what my name it was was
when it was given to me you're telling me to
take responsibility for that [ __ ] who insults me
or that person in my family was very negative and
is abusive towards me what what on earth are you
thinking let's make a distinction really clearly right here between
responsibility and blaming I'm not trying to get you to
blame yourself and to be hyper self-critical and negative about
you so the objective here is not to say that
you are to blame for your genetics you are to
blame for your bad relationships you are to blame for
all the abuses and in Justices that you've suffered in
your life and all the accidents that are unfortunate what
we really mean here instead is we mean responsibility this
means how you respond in the present moment see a
lot of people especially victims will tend to think well
Leo I can't move on because all of this negative
stuff that happened to me in the past I had
bad relationships at a bad family all sorts of dysfunctions
various unfortunate things happen to me how can I get
over that and see what you fail to realize there
is that problems in the past the pass itself it
doesn't actually exist the only way in which it can
exist is that exists in the present the past is
couched in the present so in order to even be
thinking about the past in order for the past to
be holding you back you have to be thinking about
it in the present moment and that's where you have
control because you always have control over your reactions you
always have control over how you interpret a situation you
always have control over how you want to choose to
act despite what has happened to you in the past
if you're conscious if you're conscious you have this control
you have this this option but see many victims they
believe they don't have this option because they can't see
it because their unconscious and they don't want to see
it they don't want to believe that they have the
ability to respond in the present moment however they choose
to the situation despite how difficult it is so even
though you were abused you can respond to it now
in a different way you choose how you can respond
if you want you can you can create a whole
story about it if you want you can label yourself
a victim if you want you could say that you
have been served an injustice and then you can go
out go about the rest of your life thinking that
you can't get better results because of all the stuff
that's happened to you that's one option another option is
to say I don't want to do that I want
to create my life I want to have a happy
amazing successful life I want to have an extraordinary life
I want to self-actualize I want to grow and I'm
not going to let anything that has happened to me
in the past hold me back I'm not going to
let anything that's happening to me in the present hold
me back I'm going to choose the most resourceful interpretations
of my circumstances I possibly can and I'm going to
take complete responsibility right now for everything I'm going to
choose how I react so that if I'm sitting there
at a stoplight and someone crashes into me and I
had no control about that at least I have now
control over how I'm going to think about that car
accident I'm going to have control about how I react
to that car accident I'm going to have control over
my actions going forward and if I was born in
a poor country a country that didn't have all the
opportunities that some of the first world countries have then
I'm going to take responsibility for that and even though
I can't go back and change that and even though
that is what it is I can respond to it
right now I can choose to think about it empowering
way right now I can choose to shape my future
right now I can choose to move to a different
country I can choose to try all sorts of different
options to change my circumstances and if I can't change
my circumstances stuff then I still ultimately have choice because
even the things that I can't control I can control
how I think about them how I deal with them
I can control how they make me feel by choosing
which thoughts I think and so through this process either
I will create the circumstances of life that I want
or I'm going to fail to do that but I
will create the happiness that I want so either way
I will win that's how a creator thinks very different
than a victim right yeah it's a it can be
a 180 degree shift a paradigm shift which is why
it's very important for me to talk about all these
various details in this video because I want to hit
it from different angles because if you're a victim then
just telling you one little tidbit of information here -
a bit of information there it's not going to do
much for you because your brain has gotten really really
good with the stories excuses the blaming the complaining the
whining it's gotten really good at that and your brain
is one of the most amazing mechanisms for creating excuses
it's like an excuse creation machine and it will create
excuses and stories and justifications for just about anything to
keep you from going out of your comfort zone to
pursue something bigger and greater your brain will do that
so you have to be becoming more conscious about how
much self-deception is going on here self-deception self-sabotage manipulation of
you by yourself right you almost can't trust yourself it's
kind of a paradox of personal development then on the
one hand you have to trust yourself a lot to
get good results in life but on the other hand
you can't trust yourself at all a victim victim cannot
trust himself but once you move out a victim to
creator and into the peace category then you can trust
yourself completely but that's going to take some work for
you so right now if you're heavily heavily soaked in
victim mentality then you have to be very careful about
how you trust yourself even the things that you're saying
to yourself as you're watching this video all the little
excuses and counter points and counter arguments your brain is
coming up with just automatically by listening to me to
every point I'm making you're maybe making a counter point
in your own head and say oh but Leo what
about this oh but Leo what about that that right
there is what I'm talking about got to be really
careful about that because that's keeping you stuck one thing
that's really important to understand is why do victims want
to stay victims why do people become victims and get
really stuck in that for me it's baffling because when
I see it in other people and sometimes I'll go
and I'll talk to them I'll try to explain what's
going on here but then that person doesn't want to
listen in fact usually when you tell a victim that
he's being a victim what does he do he doesn't
just say oh thank you and then change usually what
happens is that that person gets defensive that person gets
angry and frustrated with you and then he'll start blaming
you for accusing him of all this negative stuff or
she'll start saying but you don't understand I actually am
a victim you don't know what it's like to be
me my life is so miserable my life is so
hard all these different excuses and stories are coming up
and what's really scary is that these excuses and stories
they seem incredibly real they seem very real very tangible
almost inevitable in the victim's head right but that's not
the case in fact I can think of about four
areas in my own life where I've gotten massive results
massive personal growth the most personal growth that I've ever
gotten and those were all areas where I was a
victim for a long time and then what happened is
I had some sort of epiphany or realization that I
don't have to be a victim anymore and then my
results skyrocketed because I made a critical decision to say
that no more victim thinking and then as soon as
that happened all the bad results I had vanished where
did this happen for you in my life one of
the places that happened to me is my education when
I was going through through high school I wasn't really
good academically but then something triggered in me when I
was in at the end of ninth grade when I
finished my first year of high school where I got
really focused on education and in the next three years
through high school and through college I just studied really
really hard what was really hard on academics and in
many ways that have set up a an amazing foundation
for me now that I can work from the hard
work that I did back then but that didn't happen
until I made a very clear decision in my mind
that I really want to take control of my education
so that's the earliest place where really happened then at
the beginning of college the next thing that really happened
for me is I don't know if you notice about
me but I used to be overweight my whole life
since I was a kid I was 65 pounds overweight
and I was that way through all of school and
early college and then in the middle of college I
really had an epiphany there that I could get fit
that I could be responsible for my own health I
could get that taken care of and that was very
challenging for me to accept that line set that I
have control over this that I can take full responsibility
because I was very much a victim about my way
to my health and my eating habits and so when
I did that my health completely turned around I lost
those 65 pounds at about five months and I was
able to keep them off to this day which has
been probably about eight nine years now so that was
that was a big result for me and another area
where this really happened for me is with my career
and my work the first job I got it was
quote-unquote my dream job the job that I really wanted
for me since I was a kid but then I
got it and I realized that it wasn't really the
job that I wanted I was frustrated and miserable with
that job and I was also really angry at the
world - I was angry at the world because I
had all these amazing ideas I wanted to be a
game designer and I was actually working as a game
designer and I was working in the studio and I
had all these amazing ideas for the games that I
wanted to create but then I started getting beer at
the world because I saw that to create these games
I would need capital and money how many millions of
dollars to fund some of these projects and ideas that
I had but I didn't have any money I had
like five or ten grand in my savings account that's
it not enough to do anything and the company I
was working at I was barely able to make ends
meet so I wasn't saving away any money so I
just saw that if I kept going with this company
and doing what I'm doing even though it's a great
job great opportunities I would never build the capital that
I need to build to create these ideas that I
have and I thought that I really had amazing ideas
and so I started to really become very toxic inside
because I had these fancy ideas but I thought the
world was not letting me express them and that was
become a very problematic and miserable for me it was
ruining my relationships at work it made me really impossible
for me to work and what I had to do
is literally one day I just had to realize that
wait a minute I actually have control in this situation
all these obstacles with money and opportunity and business problems
that I see out there those are there but I
can take them on as a challenge I can decide
to take it on as a challenge and go out
there and work really hard and find that the tough
solutions that I don't have right now and that's what
I did within a few months then I quit my
job start an online marketing business and that business to
this day has generated over a million dollars of cash
profit just from from that at one point of taking
responsibility and I clearly know that if I did not
have that decision point and I didn't take responsibility there
then I would have I would have stay stuck and
I would have continued more and more toxic and miserable
and my life instead of having the exponential growth that
it's having now it would have plateaued and in fact
it would started to decay because that toxicity would be
building up inside me and then the final area in
my life were I took a lot of responsibility was
with dating and relationships I was extremely bad as bad
as you could possibly imagine a guy being with attracting
women understanding how women work and getting into relationships I
was horrible at it and this and it was late
in my life I was already 25 26 when I
just started to to really take responsibility for this problem
and I remember again it was a very specific moment
where I took responsibility for the fact that I control
my sex life I control how attractive I am to
the opposite sex I control what kind of relationships I
get in I get to control who I'm gonna be
with in the end and when I did that my
results with the opposite sex skyrocketed as well did a
lot of lot of hard hard hard work to make
that happen but but man that was there were that
resulted in some of the deepest personal growth that I've
ever gotten is by doing that that was extremely challenging
for me it was it was harder than losing weight
it was harder than studying it was harder than starting
a business so these are four areas personally for me
I'm sure you have some in your own life you
know stuff where you really have to overcome a big
challenge a very big obstacle and specifically you have to
tell yourself I have to take responsibility now I can
take on the challenge see and this leads us to
the point that I was making earlier is why do
people be become victims and stay victims it happens because
it's [ __ ] scary I mean it's scary to
admit to yourself that actually you're responsible for all of
it why is that scary because that means that you
have to now work right a lot of work has
to go into you a lot of personal development has
to happen that's tough stuff that's not easy people want
to stay in a comfort zone they need to start
thinking radically different though to start becoming a creator if
you're really stuck with a top-off tickle like you don't
have enough money to start a business or you're just
miserable with opposite sex and relationships or you've got health
problems or anything else then the problem is that the
current way of thinking that you have going is not
going to be enough to get you to where you
want to go because you've probably tried it but you
keep heading your head against the wall right so what
does this mean does this mean that this wall is
there and it can't be broken down no it just
means that you're you're not capable of it right now
given your growth level imagine that you have a rating
of your personal growth from a 1 to a 10
now if you're faced with a a level 2 challenge
and you're a level 1 human being in terms of
development then the challenge is going to be greater than
you are so you're not going to be able to
surmount it and this will make you think that this
is an insurmountable challenge but there are many people who
are level 3 or level 4 or level 10 human
beings who easily step over this challenge it's not even
an obstacle for them at all why is that it's
that because the challenge is any different it's that they're
different and it's not they were born different is that
they develop themselves to a higher level they're more resourceful
little more capable they're just more developed this is what
I love about personal development is that it's the best
tool for overcoming sticky challenges maybe there's a challenge in
your life right now you can overcome with your present
level of development there are plenty of challenges like that
in life so that's great you all overcome those but
there's also challenges in your life that are so big
you can't overcome them maybe you've got a level 8
challenge and you're a level 2 person that's a very
big gap that's not something you're just going to be
able to hop over that's something you have to really
work on yourself to raise yourself higher and higher and
higher until you start to become a little four person
level five level six level seven level eight then you
get to level nine all the sudden that challenge stops
being a challenge but raising yourself on this scale that's
not easy work that's really far that's really hard for
can work really hard like the amount of work that
I had to do to get myself the education that
I wanted the exceptional education that I got ridiculous quantities
I'm I'm talking about thousands thousands of hours of hard
work a lot of emotional labor goes into that most
people don't do that the results I got with my
with my fitness and my nutrition and losing all my
weight ridiculous quantities of emotional labor and challenge went into
that I have to be extremely honest with myself extremely
brutal had to really not kid myself not [ __
] myself break down my ego to achieve the results
that I achieved and to maintain them to really lock
them in that was really challenging to do and that's
not something the average person wants to do with my
business same exact thing incredible amounts of hard work emotional
labor when it's in making that succeed because the only
reason succeeded was because I grew myself along with the
business and I continue to do that right now and
with my relationships oh man that was that was the
hardest thing for me the amount of time and energy
that I put into that was so ridiculous that most
people would not believe what I went through to make
that happen it makes me emotional just to think about
it because literally I would I would invest thousands of
hours doing this studying going out there practicing just to
learn how to get that one girlfriend out that I
wanted like really hard really massive action goes in here
and this is the problem and this is also the
solution the problem is that you're not taking enough action
if you're a victim if you're a victim in life
you need to you need to take massive action and
the only way you're going to take massive action is
by believing that you can and also cutting out the
excuses in the blaming as long as there's excuses and
stories there cannot be any action and I'm not talking
a little bit of action sure you do a little
bit of action know what I'm talking about is massive
[ __ ] action massive action see most victims they
go out and they try some stuff and then they
say but leo I tried that it doesn't work I
went to the gym I worked really hard it doesn't
work I really I tried meditating you know I'm depressed
but I tried meditation and I tried it five times
and it doesn't work and you know I don't have
a lot of money I went out and I submitted
twenty resumes and it didn't work I didn't get a
good job I tried really hard at studying you know
I'm really bad at math and I'm really bad at
this and at that subject I tried studying really hard
a couple times and it just doesn't work for me
or I really tried to improve my health I try
to improve my nutrition but that doesn't work for me
either it doesn't work for you because you're not taking
massive action and you're going to say leo I took
a lot of action no you didn't you think you
took a lot of action you didn't actually take a
lot of action and you didn't take that action effectively
when you take effective massive action almost any obstacle will
crumble before you or it will find a workaround but
see your brain doesn't actually know how much action is
necessary we always underestimate how much action is necessary we
always like to think to ourselves because it makes us
feel good we like to tell ourselves that we've taken
a lot of already massive action when in fact you
haven't done that at all that's why it's good to
be around really exceptional people that's why it's good to
have Mentors that's why it's good to have role models
in your life that's why it's good to have people
who are way way way better than you because when
you see them taking action when you see the way
they think when they see it when you see the
way that they work how hard they work to achieve
the results that they get you start to realize like
oh damn like damn like that guys taking massive action
I'm a [ __ ] I'm not taking any action
at all compared to that guy you've probably had moments
like that in your life or you see somebody getting
results and you're like huh I wonder why they're getting
some such amazing results in this area of their life
and then you go and you talk to them a
little bit you kind of like duels snooping and then
you realize like oh [ __ ] like that guy's
taking so much action like the lengths he's going to
to get the results he gets or credible incredible like
I don't even I don't think I could even do
that and you're right you can't do it right now
but you can build yourself up and that's what I
want for you here I want you to cut out
the excuses in the whining and the blaming in the
story making and be very honest with yourself really say
[ __ ] it to the ego and say you
know what [ __ ] the ego I want results
in my life I want happiness in my life I
only got this one life I got to make it
happen and to do that I'm willing to take massive
massive massive [ __ ] action on this problem this
challenge that I've got I'm going to hit it from
every single angle every single direction until I find a
solution or I find a way to cope with it
to deal with it to be happy with it either
way something's going to happen something's going to work for
me that's how it creator things do not trust yourself
do not trust your brain in telling you that you
know how much action is necessary to be good at
what you want to be good at in life do
not trust your brain to tell you that you're doing
enough because I can guarantee you that you're massively under
estimating how much needs to be done to be good
at things you want to be good at the thing
that I want to leave you with here is I
want to leave you with a list a list of
phrases that victims will use to speak to themselves and
to other people this is stuff that I hear in
the comment sections under my videos all the time for
victims this is stuff that I hear from people who
are really stuck in life this is what keeps the
stories and excuses in place I want you to really
look for which of these you use yourself and in
what areas of your life do you use them because
when you can start to identify this negative self-talk this
victim self-talk you can start to then say okay that's
where I'm being a victim and then you can start
to say to yourself oh I need to take much
more massive action right there much more massive action right
here or maybe I need to learn a new technique
or new strategy right so it's not just about working
hard it's also about working smart you need to work
hard and work smart at the same time so here
are the labels I can't this is probably the biggest
and the worst thing that victims will say them to
themselves into other people I can't Leo I can't do
that That's not me how can i I can't next
it's impossible another another really big one it's impossible that
can't be done I can't start a business I can't
lose that weight that's not possible some of these things
maybe they're possible but this thing right here is not
possible next it's too hard next life is unfair Leo
isn't the world evil is in the world bad how
can we be happy in an evil and bad world
next I must I need to I have to believe
you don't understand I have to be doing this I
must be doing this I need this there's nothing that
you need or must or should do in your life
all that stuff is up to you but a victim
will believe that they have to do stuff it's a
big trap next leo I've never done that you're telling
me to go out there and do this crazy thing
I've never done that you're telling me to go do
some public speaking I've never done that you're telling me
to go start a business I don't know how to
do that I've never done that you're telling me to
go start working out and working on my nutrition I
don't know how to do that you're telling me to
do this personal development stuff you're telling me how to
meditate I don't know how to do that I've never
done that before well time to learn right that's why
you got a brain next but what if I fail
Leo what if I start a business and I fail
Leo what if I trust that guy in a relationship
and he he abuses my trust and I fail in
that relationship what if I go to the and I
fail what if I meditate and I fail what if
I watch your videos and I fail well you know
how that goes if at first you don't succeed you
try try again that's why massive action is required because
there's going to be massive failure next but it's his
fault only oh you understand all this stuff is nice
but there's just this one guy it's all his fault
he's not letting me or this one girl is her
fault it's my wife's fault it's my husband's fault it's
my girlfriend's fault it's my boyfriend's fault blaming other people
remember we talked about this this is a huge huge
obstacle for victims another one leo I've already tried that
leo I already tried meditation I already tried the diets
I already tried the gym I already try starting a
business I already tried so many some resumes for better
job I already tried public speaking none of that stuff
works well massive [ __ ] action take more action
and it will work for you you massively overestimate how
much you've tried stuff most people they haven't really tried
stuff they tried stuff once or twice sometimes you need
to try something a hundred times before it works a
thousand times before it works you need to have the
persistence to do that next never and always victims love
to talk like this that'll never happen or this always
happens I always get bad luck I always fail I
never get any luck I never succeed I never get
it easy I never get a break watch for those
next I'll try alright Leo I'll get a shot I'll
try it out sounds good I'll give a shot I'll
try it I'll try to start a business I'll try
to lose some weight I'll try to work on my
depression all I'll try a little bit of meditation I'll
try how far do you think you'll get if you
just keep trying stuff how about this one maybe or
I think you know I think that could work you
know I think I'd like to be passionate about my
life I think I like to have a nice wife
or husband I oh I think I'd like to lose
some weight maybe I'll lose some weight next year maybe
I'll set a goal for my business next year maybe
a little bit earn a little bit more money next
year maybe next I'm not good enough Leo but how
am I going to do that build a business I
don't know how to build a business study really hard
I don't noticed I'm not good at studying relationships I
suck at relationships how do you expect me to do
all that stuff grow myself do personal development I don't
know how to do that I can't do that I'm
not smart enough I'm not capable enough I've got some
sort of limitation next but Leo there's no point what's
the point what's the point of doing all this hard
work what's the point of working on yourself growing yourself
developing yourself life's so pointless it's all gonna be bad
in the end anyways we're all going to dining in
anyways what's the point next it's too much effort below
I know okay I get what you're saying I get
what you're saying you know you got to work really
hard to get the results you want but what if
I don't want to work that hard you're telling me
to take this massive action to improve this area of
my life I don't want to do that that's too
much work too much work why would I want to
work so hard to be happy next leo that's all
great for young people but it's too late for me
if I saw this video ten years ago maybe it
would have done some good if I saw it 20
years ago maybe we're doing some good even if I
saw it a year ago maybe we're done some good
but now it's too late it's too late to start
a business it's too late to lose the weight it's
too late to go back to school it's late to
be smart it's too late to do personal development it's
too late to start meditating it's never too late next
surely oh all this sounds great it's easy for you
easy for you leo you're doing this professionally you had
a head start you had a good childhood you had
this you had that I don't have all that stuff
I have the following list of disabilities and handicaps and
incapabilities how am I going to do it that's why
you grow yourself the way that I did because I
didn't have all this stuff I worked really [ __
] hard to get it next but how Leo you're
telling me all this stuff and it even sounds good
I got really excited about it the other day and
I really drew out my goals and all this stuff
and I had this big vision for what I want
to be and I'm going to accomplish all this amazing
stuff I'm gonna have an amazing relationship I'm gonna lose
all this weight and I'm gonna have this a ton
of money coming in from my business but then I
sat down to think about how I might actually do
it I don't know how how am I to do
it it's not possible how am I gonna do it
well that's called doing research you go out there and
you look for role models you read books you study
you watch more videos you go through a process of
trial and error again massive [ __ ] action and
then you'll know how and until then you have to
trust yourself so that's it I know this is a
long video but there's a lot to be said on
this topic what I want to leave you here is
just with the recap the takeaway from this video is
very simple right now all the stories all the excuses
all the blaming all the whining all the complaining stops
it stops right [ __ ] now you decide to
take full responsibility for your life 100% no more blaming
of anybody or any other circumstances but but taking full
creative authority over your own life because in the end
the quality of your life is only determined by you
your thoughts and your actions that's it all right this
