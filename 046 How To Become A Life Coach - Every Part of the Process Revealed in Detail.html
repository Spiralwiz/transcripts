            <ul>
    <li><b>Qualifications and Certification</b>: In order to become a credentialed life coach, it is recommended to attend a credible life coach training program and gain certification through the International Coaching Federation (ICF). This accreditation is accepted worldwide and enhances credibility as a coach. The certification isn't necessarily essential, but it equips one with foundational coaching principles.
</li><li><b>Recommended Training Program</b>: A program such as 'iPeK' is highly recommended which is not just credible but also accredited by ICF. The program costs approximately $9,000 and is completed in roughly ten months.
</li><li><b>Features of the Training Program</b>: This particular program is organized in four modules, with each module followed by time for homework assignments and practising coaching. This flexibility allows for participation while maintaining a separate job. The program facilitates learning the nuances of coaching through practical in-person and telephone-based coaching experiences in group environments, offering immediate feedback.
</li><li><b>Learning Beyond the Program</b>: To become a proficient coach, it is advisable not just to adhere to the training program, but to extend beyond its requirements. Partnering with fellow participants or connecting through message boards to get more coaching hours is recommended for honing the coaching skill set. Around 100 practice calls can help novices become comfortable and confident with the coaching process. 
</li><li><b>In-Person and Over-the-Phone Coaching</b>: The program's training techniques also cover coaching sessions conducted both in person and over the phone, emphasizing the unique requirements of each method.
</li><li><b>Reduced Pressure through Group Coaching</b>: The program pairs its students with other novice coaches in a low-pressure, low-risk environment to facilitate practical learning experiences. This setup allows the trainees to gather experience and refine their coaching skills.
</li><li><b>Importance of a Coaching Program</b>: Joining a coaching program is crucial as learning how to coach in isolation isn't feasible. Coaching programs provide professional guidelines and principles of coaching.
</li><li><b>Business and Marketing Support</b>: Coaching programs also equip you with business and marketing support, crucial for running a successful coaching practice. The coaching itself isn't difficult to master; however, setting up a business, marketing yourself, and finding clients prove more challenging.
</li><li><b>Entrepreneurial Mindset</b>: Working as a coach means working for yourself and requires an entrepreneurial mindset. Understanding business, money, marketing, sales is essential, and so is the ability to source clients both online and in person.
</li><li><b>Specialization</b>: Specializing in a particular aspect of coaching is beneficial. Areas could include life purpose, spirituality, career, money, or fitness and weight loss. Sub-specializing within these categories can further increase your marketability and success.
</li><li><b>Building a Business</b>: Treat your coaching program like a business investment; put in more effort than required, go beyond homework assignments, coach more people, and study books on coaching. With effort and dedication, you can outcoach and outmarket others in your program and establish a successful coaching business.
</li><li><b>Helping People vs. Business Aspect</b>: Balancing the desire to help people with running a successful business is key. Being business savvy and having the capability to market yourself is essential for sustaining the work.
</li><li><b>Being a Living Example</b>: As a coach, you should embody what you're selling: a lifestyle of personal development. You must live what you preach to gain your clients' trust and belief. Constantly immersing yourself in personal development is the most reliable way to do so. 
</li><li><b>Useful Resources</b>: Websites like actualize.org provide valuable content and advanced professional development techniques helpful for both your coaching practice and personal growth.
