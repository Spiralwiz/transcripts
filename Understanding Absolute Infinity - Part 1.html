hey it's Leo for actualised org and in this episode
I'm going to be talking about understanding absolute infinity part
1 [Music] you this is going to be a multi-part
series exploring the logic of infinity the structure we might
say of infinity the mechanics of how infinity works and
what exactly it is we're going to require multiple episodes
to accomplish this because it's no small topic and it's
difficult to wrap our minds around some of this counterintuitive
and very paradoxical stuff and also I want to introduce
it's a very juicy and interesting historical context which will
come in the latter episodes this right here is the
deepest thing you could possibly understand as a human being
I haven't found anything deeper this will completely and utterly
blow you away we're going to be looking at the
question of what is existence that's primarily what we're concerned
about here what is existence itself not what is the
content within existence that's what I usually talk about is
the content of existence that's what science usually talks about
that's what everything that you ever see on TV or
ever read about in the books or ever think about
yourself is mostly concerned about is the content of existence
but nobody really asked the question what is existence itself
the substance of existence the substance of everything the substance
of all the content that we see and I got
news for you it's not molecules it's not chemicals it's
not atoms it's not strings it's not energy it's not
fields it's not mathematical equations or numbers it's not any
of those things all of those are yet more content
within existence none of those actually explain what existence is
in this episode we're actually going to answer the question
it's not going to be speculative it's not just going
to be mere philosophy we're actually going to answer this
question without beating around the bush we're not going to
evade the question we're going to leave you the satisfying
answer at least as far as is humanly possible using
our intellect we're going to go as far as the
intellect allows us to go right here so stick with
me this question of what is existence really belongs within
category of some other questions and there's different angles at
which we can come at this topic from so we
can ask ourselves what is distance maybe you've pondered that
when you were kid and you're curious about that that's
good we'll answer that today another question along those lines
is what is reality that's really the same thing what
is being what is truth with a capital T what
is the distinction what is awareness what is consciousness what
is the biggest picture possible for our understanding what is
God what am i what is death all of these
questions they might seem different from each other but really
they're all trying to ask the same thing and the
answer to all of them is the exact same answer
the answer is I'm not going to withhold it from
you it's absolute infinity that's it that's the answer now
of course that probably doesn't do much for you because
you don't really understand what absolute infinity is and how
it could possibly answer all these questions so that's why
we dispense of time attacking this now maybe you're the
type of person who thinks that such questions are impossible
to answer and you might think well Leo who are
you to stand up here how arrogant of you to
presume that you could possibly answer these sources questions after
all there have been thousands of very intelligent human beings
for since the beginning of human history tackling these questions
and struggling with them and trying to answer them and
they all disagree and there's no consensus and we know
that there are no definite answers that have come up
about from that and so therefore it's very arrogant to
assume that you can answer this right now well be
careful who you're calling arrogant because actually I'm coming at
this from a very open inquiring position where I'm not
sure whether the answer can or can't be found I'm
interested in the inquiry whereas people who take the position
that these questions cannot be answered notice that that actually
is the true arrogance that's not humility that's arrogance in
disguise because to say that these things cannot be answered
that's a definitive statement that you're making so you're saying
I know that these things cannot be answered and the
fact is that you don't know that have you tried
all the possible ways of finding these answers have you
even tried a dozen different ways I bet you that
if you honestly look at it you'll see that you
haven't even tried a dozen different ways so be careful
don't jump to conclusions about things that we really don't
know let's start from the very beginning and just assume
that we don't know anything and we're just going to
do some inquiring and let's see how far we can
get and hey you know let's leave the possibility that
we might get lucky and we might stumble on to
some amazing answers that we couldn't have even anticipated we
would get so let's get to work before we start
to philosophize here I want to read you a quote
from a Roman poet and philosopher named Lucretia's and his
dates were 95 to 55 BC so this was before
Christ before Julius Caesar right about that time and the
reason I want to quote this to you is because
he hit the nail right on the head in a
very few short stunts as he describes the nature of
all of existence and here's what he says quote the
universe is not founded in any direction if it were
it would necessarily have a limit somewhere but clearly a
thing cannot have a limit unless there is something outside
to limit it in all dimensions alike on this side
or that upward or downward through the universe there is
no end and quote now that unpacks this notion of
absolute is going to be a little bit more but
still it's too condensed to really make sense of although
he's exactly right and as we keep going you'll start
to see why now let's begin our investigation by thinking
about this little thought experiment and the way we're going
to think about this is we're going to think the
way that God might think about how to create reality
now don't be put off by this word God I'm
just kind of using it tongue-in-cheek here for a thought
experiment so imagine that you were God and you were
sitting there and you decided to create all of reality
how would you do it that's an interesting way to
think about this problem of existence and as soon as
we start to think about it this way we immediately
start to see that we run into some very fundamental
problems this is what I call the bootstrap problem and
the self reflection problem what is this well let's just
say in a very naive sense that God is up
there somewhere in the heavens and he wants to create
the universe how would he do that well he would
like think about it snap his fingers something would happen
some sort of magic in them out pops the whole
universe and all in reality something like that right that's
the standard notion of the kind of religious creation but
then of course we have to ask how is God
doing this and more importantly where is God sitting in
order to do this because we're interested here our question
is about all of existence so basically all of reality
and all of reality means even larger than just our
universe because we don't know maybe our universe just one
out of many universes out there scientists have put forth
all sorts of you multiverse theories so we have to
be open to that possibility so we're not just talking
about our universe we're talking about all of reality here
everything now notice that when you talk about all of
reality that presents a very interesting problem for us because
that leaves no space or room for anything to be
elsewhere outside of it so if God created all of
reality then where is God located wherever he's located he's
outside of reality where that space where he supposedly lives
or resides or where he came from well that needs
to be included in reality - I mean that's supposedly
real right what else would it be so see we
where this problem of self-reflection and bootstrapping how do you
get something from scratch what is God made out of
what's the substance of God what rules does he operate
under see now religion usually this is this question says
odd well the you can't really understand God he's beyond
our understanding but see that explains nothing and so we're
just kind of like left without knowing where all of
existence came from science also runs into this problem which
we'll see as we go on how could anything come
about from scratch and what would it even mean to
explain the origin of all of existence because whatever explanation
you have or whatever cause you come up with is
itself subject to the question of where did that come
from and how does it work so this is a
very uh tricky sort of chicken and egg problem now
to understand and to answer this question in this problem
we're going to synthesize a lot of different domains of
understanding different notions need to come together and it needs
to be a pretty big synthesis of course as you
might expect because we have the ultimate biggest question that
we try to answer so here the different categories we're
going to talk about I just wanna give you a
preview so we're going to talk about limits and physical
laws we're going to need to think about standards foundations
and grounding we're going to need to think about arbiters
who's who who's different who's that are out there perspectives
and relativity if anything about duality boundaries contrasts and distinctions
relationships and hierarchies form and also formlessness and impossibility power
and weirdness all of these notions will come together for
us to unravel this puzzle but before I start talking
about all those let's do a quick thought experiment to
get right to the heart of the issue so what
I'd like you to do and I really want you
to actually do this right now is put on your
thinking cap and use your imagination to imagine for me
an infinite object do that right now as best you
can I know it's a tall order to fill but
imagine some kind of infinite object you got it right
I hope you got one okay pause it if you
need to and think about it and really imagine an
infinite object there's no right and wrong answers here just
imagine something okay so what did you imagine well if
you're probably like me or like most people than what
you imagined is let's say for simplicity sake a sphere
a very very large infinitely side's sphere expanding out into
infinity that's good that's a start but what we should
notice about that is that you actually didn't imagine an
infinite object there what you imagined and this is commonly
what we do when thing about infinity is you just
imagine something very very large in one dimension so here
you imagined a sphere which is not an infinite egg
it's a finite object but you gave it an infinite
diameter or radius and that's a start but notice that
that's only in really well you could say it's in
three dimensions breadth width and height but that's all just
in space so you gave it infinite spatial dimension so
we'll call that one dimension of infinity all right but
that's not what I asked you for what I asked
you for is to actually imagine an infinite object now
notice that the sphere is finite because it has a
certain finitude it has certain limits it's a fear for
example and it's not a cube it's got a certain
color and on a certain other kind of color for
example maybe you imagine a transparent sphere so in that
case it has no color at all or maybe you
imagined a blue sphere or a white sphere and then
that means it's white or it's blue but then if
it's white it's not yellow and if it's blue that
it's not green you see so therefore it's finite in
its color and it's finite in its shape because the
sphere when it's a sphere it's not a cube and
when it's a cube it's not a pyramid and when
it's a pyramid it's not something else so let's take
that understanding and now what I want you to do
is imagine for me a sphere in two dimensions an
infinite object in two dimensions let's keep it a sphere
so it's got infinite space station Asoka but now give
it a second infinite dimension let's say color so what
that would mean and I want you to actually try
to imagine this right now it's very important is that
this object is sphere not only is it infinitely wide
but it's got infant colors that means red yellow green
blue and white and black all together and transparency altogether
plus all the infrared and ultraviolet magnetic spectrum that we've
never even seen before with its human eyes put all
of those properties into this sphere so that it has
them simultaneously so it's got infinite color so do that
right now and notice that what you've got there is
you've got two dimensions of infinity infinity this way and
infinity in terms color so that's good but now let's
take it up another notch and imagine infinity in three
dimensions so what other dimension of infinity we can imagine
well how about smells now be honest when you were
thinking of this sphere or this object did you imagine
that it has some kind of smell probably not you
don't usually think of spheres or geometric objects as having
smells but why not let's give it a smell so
it could smell like a fish it could smell like
strawberries it could smell like flowers etc etc you get
the idea but now to make it infinite let's give
it infinite smells so all of the smells that you've
ever smelled and could possibly smell that any human being
has ever known every other creature in the entire world
or universe that it's ever encountered to smell put all
those smells and stick them on this sphere simultaneously so
do that in your mind and now you see you
have a sphere in three dimensions now you can probably
tell where I'm going with this now I'd like you
to imagine a truly infinite object an absolutely infinite object
an object which is infinite in infinite dimensions try to
imagine that what might that look like give it your
best shot now notice right there as you're imagining that
that's as close as you can possibly get to imagining
God or absolute infinity now again don't be thrown off
by this word god if you don't like the word
God just substitute it with reality or existence or absolute
infinity these all point to the same thing but right
there you just imagined it except notice that you've run
into a problem didn't you because what form did this
object take it couldn't fear because it also needs to
be a cube and a pyramid and every other possible
shape so it needs to have infinite smells infinite colors
infinite shapes infinite everything infinite size and not just large
so don't confuse infinity with just largeness that's not infinity
infinity includes the large and the small all together every
single property in characteristic possible needs to be in this
object so immediately you notice a problem here is that
your mind literally cannot imagine infinite object because just by
the very fact that you're using your imagination and your
thoughts and thoughts are mental images and also verbal labels
inside your mind those are things and so whatever image
you have of this thing it isn't it you see
whatever image you have is not it even if you
say it's nothing it's just emptiness that isn't it either
because that's some kind of form in your mind see
so we run it against this very interesting obstacle of
how do you actually imagine the infinite and it kind
of makes sense that it would be a problem because
after all we're trying to imagine every possibility of everything
that could ever possibly be and not be all at
once using our limited brains and our limited Minds and
it doesn't seem to work and maybe that's not an
accident that it doesn't seem to work maybe that's how
it should be all right so now you got a
little taste we'll come back to that hold onto to
that image let's dig into some of these different domains
that we need to talk about so first let's think
about limits and physical laws so notice that our reality
is defined by physical laws that's how science thinks of
reality and also what we call reality is basically just
a set of limits by limit we mean that things
are limited to being a certain way they are not
any which way they want to be the planet is
a certain way the Stars are a certain way the
Sun is a certain way the Milky Way galaxy is
a certain way all of our universe have certain laws
and is a certain very particular way that science is
discovering every single year so if we think about a
soap bubble that's just a little example take a soap
bubble and you can see that it's a limited object
it has a certain shape has a certain size has
a certain color has certain features and properties why is
that well we think obviously it has to be that
way because it's a physical object so it has a
certain number of molecules in there that are making it
up so this soap bubble can't just be infinitely large
in diameter because as soon as it gets too large
there's just not going to be enough molecules connecting with
each other to make that shape work and it's just
going to burst open you see and also because it's
mat of water or what other chemicals you know it's
not made of gold it's not orange colored it's the
transparent sort of color right it's not every possible way
it could be it has to be a very particular
way to be the soap bubble that we know it
to be and so forth for all of reality for
our entire universe but it's easy to understand why the
soap bubble is limited because we can appeal to things
that are outside of it so the reason we say
the soap bubble is limited because of physical laws and
various other forces that exist outside the environment that it's
in and yada-yada-yada but now let's think about reality as
a whole what limits reality as a whole that's very
interesting that's something science does an answer very well even
though people sometimes think that it does you might say
well we have these physical constants and laws like we
have the law of gravitation we have certain electrochemical and
magnetic laws and these basically define and constrain our whole
reality and things like the gravitational and all these other
physical constants that are very finely tuned which create our
universe and make it the way that it is that
these are what give our universe its limits but the
question of course is what enforces these constants like the
gravitational constant well if you ask the scientists they'll tell
you we don't know or nothing enforces it it just
is that's how it is these constants are how they
are there's nothing more fundamental but you got to ask
what exactly is a gravitational constant and where does it
exist is it like sitting outside of reality and somehow
constraining it no it can't be that way because as
soon as you put something outside of reality automatically areia
that our concept of reality expands to now include that
thing that you stuck outside and so all the sudden
now it's inside so the question becomes what limits the
gravitational constant or whatever kind of constant you can imagine
or any kind of force or any kind of any
kind of limit whatsoever what's beyond that limit and then
beyond that limit and beyond that limit what enforces each
limit higher and higher up the hierarchy so you see
we start to run into the infinite regress problem and
a scientist will tell you well like you can't ask
those questions we just don't know we only know what
we can see and what we can figure out with
our equations but see that doesn't explain anything at all
because to say that the universe is the way it
is because of a gravitational constant is really no different
than saying that reality is the way it is because
of god because in both cases you're just positing some
kind of entity gravity or God or anything else and
you're just saying it's there we don't know how it
got there or what it's doing there or how it's
enforced but it's there and it makes everything else be
the way that it is but that didn't explain anything
because we want to know what is reality as a
whole so contrary to popular opinion science and religion both
ignore this question because it's a very tricky question to
answer many philosophers who are supposed to think about this
stuff actually never bother to go this deep with their
philosophy and to to ponder at this level they usually
satisfy themselves with some kind of answer which is just
some sort of hand-wavy some kind of excuse it's not
really an answer well one possibility you want to consider
is that maybe there is no ultimate limit and that
maybe this infinite regress is not really a problem but
is actually a feature of reality see a lot of
times most times when human beings run into an infinite
regress we say well that's clearly a mistake can't be
like that but you know we're doing this investigation from
scratch we're not making any assumptions about anything here we
can't take anything for granted so in our investigation we
are going to be accepting maybe uncomfortable truths and one
of these might be that we have our infinite regress
and maybe that's how it should be and maybe reality
has no ultimate limit so let's just keep that in
mind as we move on to cover some of these
other notions so the next notion we want to talk
about is standards foundations and grounding so the interesting philosophical
question here is what is the standard by which anything
is judged or assessed this is a very tricky topic
because I'm not talking about your personal judgments of like
oh that's beautiful that's ugly that's good that's evil I
like that I hate this not these kinds of judgments
I mean judgments and assessments of all of reality how
can you assess any of it by what standard what
standard shall we use to make sense of reality you
see why this is tricky because the standard itself whichever
one we choose is itself part of reality and part
of the problem and could easily be disputed by somebody
else so let's say we wanted to simplistically measure reality
with a hard stick just a yardstick well that yardstick
we would think like okay well we can just walk
around the universe and just kind of measure from here
to there we can maybe measure how many yards sticks
there are across the Sun across the whole galaxy and
so forth and that would be good and now we're
understanding what the universe is except notice that really this
yardstick is a piece of the problem it's a piece
of reality itself and it only works relatively speaking we
can't take this yardstick and then now somehow move it
outside of reality and now measure reality from outside as
though like we wanted to measure the the diameter of
all of reality you notice we can't do that you
see because if the yardstick was able to somehow become
outside of reality a reality would automatically expand to now
include that yardstick and rubber that yardstick is outside of
reality would have to be included inside of reality see
very tricky but not just yardsticks all methods all standards
that we could use to make any kind of measurements
or sense of reality are subject to this problem because
they are all subsets of reality itself for example the
scientific method or some kind of religious method or reasoning
or logic or any other kind of method or standard
that you could imagine is also part of the reality
that's trying to be explained here and that creates a
problem because it's like we're trying to reach outside of
a reality to grab a hold of reality but we
can't do that because the reaching outside is the reality
you see and we're trying to do the impossible feat
here of explaining the ultimate or the superset using a
subset you see how every single method whether sign typically
or anything else or philosophical is going to be a
subset a small piece of the entire whole you see
that it's very important keep that in mind as we
keep going another question we can ask ourselves here there
a fundamental one is what could ground anything how could
anything be a foundation for anything else this question of
grounding is very important and a good example just to
illustrate what I mean by grounding is we can ask
the question what's the grounding for my standing here before
you I'm standing right now on my feet what we
could say okay so I'm standing on the carpet so
the carpet is the grounding for me but what's the
grounding for the carpet well it's the foundation of the
building and what's the grounding for the foundation of the
building it's the earth and what's the grounding for the
whole earth well we would say it's the vacuum of
empty space but what's the grounding for the vacuum of
empty space that's a little tricky now we might say
well it's the space-time continuum that Einstein described what's the
grounding for that then and now we just say well
that's as far as it goes that is the ultimate
ground space-time that's it but is that really it that's
an interesting question another way to think about grounding is
we could say well we can zoom in see if
we zoom into you and to your feet and to
the earth we could see that there are molecules in
there and we break those molecules apart there's atoms in
there but what's the foundation for the atoms well it's
the quarks and what's the foundation for the quarks we
split those apart and then it's some smaller subatomic particles
and what's the foundation for those well we go all
the way down into the deepest bowels of modern physics
and it's something like string theory and these are little
vibrating strings that make up everything but then what's the
grounding for strength for strings what do they matter what's
their substance and then we say of course you don't
know there's the strings aren't made out of anything they're
just little vibrating strings or we could even say they're
like equations so are we now saying that mathematical equations
are the grounding for everything is that really correct so
here we potentially also run into an infinite regress problem
you see because we can go lower and lower and
lower into our foundations and discover more and more foundations
underneath those and the only thing that seems to limit
that is our is our limited tools and microscopes and
telescopes and ability to round to count to the 100
decimal points so that just becomes an observation problem for
the most part but we have to also be open
to the possibility that hey maybe there is no ground
for all of reality maybe there is an infinite regress
and there's an infinite chain of objects going all the
way down and it never ends like those Russian nesting
matroska dolls and if they go on forever there's never
a doll at the very end that you reach to
where you say ah that's the one that's the one
the innermost one the most fundamental one and there might
not also be the outermost one now that's a pretty
weird notion we don't like to think of reality as
being the set of infinite dolls because there's actually a
very interesting truth that we have to admit in that
case if it truly is infinite like that in both
directions or in all directions then ultimately what is the
substance of everything it might have to be nothing literally
so so just keep that in mind for now let's
move on and talk about who's arbiters perspectives and relativity
now don't be confused by this word whose I just
mean who who is like you and me and your
dog these are all whose and basically what that just
denotes is a perspective on life that's what who is
we think of the world as being constituted of these
various perspectives don't we you have a perspective which is
different from mine different from your spouse different from your
dog different from your kids different from your co-workers and
so forth very obvious but many people don't really think
about the ramifications of this because that means everyone is
looking at reality from their limited perspective and we acknowledge
that every perspective is limited isn't it because well that's
almost true by definition that's what a perspective is it's
a viewpoint onto the world which means it's not the
whole world is just a viewpoint and if we're very
careful and honest we have to admit that really all
we know of the world is just our viewpoints of
the world we never see the world or the universe
or reality in any kind of raw direct sense we
only see it through our perspectives don't we isn't that
true check for yourself right now now the very fundamental
question that arises here is if that's the case who
is the arbiter of what is real who is the
arbiter of objective reality whose perspective shall we use as
the standard to adjudicate between all the other perspectives that
are available hmm this is a very deep epistemic problem
because if you say well my perspective of course my
perspective is the right one well how do you know
well I just know it's mine it's right but then
that's just another perspective if you take that perspective you
see and if you say well okay what we'll do
Leo is we'll just take all the most intelligent human
beings and we'll we'll Greg we'll gather a consensus a
consensus of all the scientists all their perspectives combined together
and averaged out through some sort of democratic process that
will yield the ultimate perspective that's how we'll know which
perspective is correct but what is that but another perspective
and even if you do that I mean it's quite
obvious that what you're doing is you're taking some sort
of average or is you're using sort of democratic process
to adjudicate truth and reality that that just doesn't strike
you as correct right because in a democracy many people
are still left out in many opinions and perspectives are
left out how do you know that you're including the
right ones and you're not leaving out the wrong ones
and why would just a majority consensus be the right
way how do we know that's right isn't that just
another perspective you might say well we have the perspective
of science but what is the perspective of science that's
also a perspective a partial perspective you might say no
leo science is the right perspective we all know that
right that's a perspective no Leo it's really right yeah
that's another perspective you see you can't get out of
this problem you're always stuck in a perspective and if
you take a close look it's always your perspective you
don't have access to really anybody else's perspective but yours
so even this notion of Sciences perspective well that's a
rather conceptual notion there really is no such notion there
is your perspective and there's a perspective a bunch of
other scientists individually speaking but then the side if they
don't agree a lot of scientists disagree about how to
view the world and what it really is so this
becomes a big problem whose experience set is the ultimate
one how can we claim that there even is an
ultimate reality or an objective reality out there when we
don't have direct access to it and all our perspectives
are ultimately different and they disagree pin or hole agree
not even close are we to say that all these
perspectives are equally correct well no we don't want to
say that we would never want to say that we
want to say my perspective is correct or our perspective
is correct and theirs is wrong but based on what
are you saying that your perspective is correct based on
your perspective can you see the vicious circularity there the
question begging when you say your perspective is correct or
our perspective is the best that's your perspective to somebody
else their perspective is different you see now here's a
very interesting thing to think about what might the ultimate
perspective be like if we're thinking about God what would
God's perspective be the ultimate perspective not the limited human
perspective and notice by the way that we were talking
about human perspectives but human perspectives you know there's a
lot more than going on in the rule in the
world than just human perspectives so we might think that
okay Leo here's how we can solve this problem Humanity
is advancing and you know technology is becoming a big
thing now so we've got the internet that seems like
a potential solution here if we upload all the world's
information to the Internet and then somehow we're able to
like hook our brain directly into the internet matrix-style now
we've got access to the whole Internet and that gives
me a much wider perspective than ever before millions of
books injected straight into my brain and also if we
interconnect all 7 billion people on the planet in this
way we've got this sort of hive mind this board-like
organism the super organism of minds and now we've got
a much broader perspective and now we've got God's perspective
right well not so fast because notice you are still
infinitely far away from God's perspective in that case why
is that so because scientists estimate that there are right
now on this planet alive 10 quintillion insects 10 quintillion
insects those are all individual perspectives so if we wanted
God's perspective truly we would have to incorporate not only
all 7 billion people but 10 quintillion insects and not
just that but every single living entity on this planet
and not just that because that would still leave out
a lot of inanimate objects trees and old trees aren't
inanimate but it would leave out trees it would leave
out grass it would leave out rocks and mountains and
everything but I mean we need to include that to
really get the full God's perspective wouldn't we you might
say well a tree doesn't really have a perspective so
we don't you include it ah but even that in
a sense is sort of its perspective that isn't how
a perspective so we conclude that - and we don't
really know what a tree's perspective is maybe it does
have some kind of very rudimentary perspective very non-human but
still we need to include that in any kind of
aliens we find out that we include so not just
this planet not just the solar system every single star
hundreds of millions of billions of stars billions of galaxies
throughout the entire universe and that would just be our
universe if there are multiple universes we include everything there
as well now if we did all that now we're
getting a little bit closer to God's perspective you see
so this is a really tricky we're very very far
away from God's perspective if such a thing is even
remotely possible now Albert Einstein a little over a hundred
years ago released the theory of general relativity and he
proved that time think about this time itself is relative
[ __ ] time itself really get this right now
because this is very important to this line of reasoning
of all the things that we know about reality one
of the things that we think of is the most
absolute and sure thing that is certainly not relative to
other people and other creatures is time itself right surely
time is absolute and yet Albert Einstein proved it was
otherwise time is relative and people lie sometimes here are
people complaining when I talk about moral relativism and they
get offended about moral relativism Leo moral relativism how could
that be [ __ ] time is relative physical time
and space are relative that's what our science is demonstrating
and we have a lot of technologies like GPS systems
and so forth and a lot of successful predictions using
Einstein's general relativity it's quite well supported by the empirical
evidence so time is relative now what this opens us
up to is an interesting possibility what if there's no
mistake what if we have all these perspectives and that
that's what constitutes reality and that what reality is is
not some sort of objective physical world out there behind
the scenes but actually it is an absolute relativity that
reality including physical reality and everything you've ever known is
absolutely relative it is that way from your perspective and
it's a totally different way from some other perspective and
that there's a there's no mistake about that that's how
it actually is that's not just how it seems that's
not just an appearance that's not just a subjective thing
that is reality now that the rather elegant solution to
some of these very tricky problems it might allow us
then to bootstrap everything from nothing see because all we
need to do is actually create a perspective and that
in a sense is creating reality as we create more
perspectives we create more reality and without perspectives we might
say there is no reality or the reality is that
everything is absolutely relative alright so I know that's kind
of a weird notion to think about but put that
on the back burner and let's move on to the
next topic which is let's think about duality boundaries contrasts
and distinctions these are very fundamental to how we experience
reality notice that everything you know and experience is actually
a set of opposites otherwise known as dualities or distinctions
up versus down left versus right North versus South the
top of the earth versus the bottom of the earth
big versus small black versus white sharp versus dull pretty
versus ugly smart versus stupid rich versus poor and even
existing versus non existing really notice right now in your
experience directly that the only way that you know anything
or experience anything is by contrast that's how things are
known that's what things are in a sense is they
are contrasts from the things which they are not so
if I have a dog the dog contrasts against the
background I'll get around what you see him if there's
no contrasting the dog in the background maybe there wouldn't
be a dog and a background not just that you
couldn't see them I'm not just talking about color here
I'm talking about contrast in a much more fundamental way
try to imagine right now a perspective which has zero
contrast what do you get notice that you can't even
get a perspective going because a perspective is contrasted with
no perspective lack of perspective or we might say everything
is right you don't even have that let alone any
kind of content within that perspective you can't have any
kind of content there can't be any physical objects or
things in that perspective of no contrast because how would
you tell it apart from everything else it would just
be sort of a a whiteout or a blackout but
even that isn't quite accurate because the only sense we
can make of white out or black out is because
they're opposites so what would you have if you didn't
have any contrast notice that you couldn't even point at
an object within this no contrast perspective because to point
at a thing requires that the thing is contrasted from
the background and whatever you're pointing with has to be
contrasted from the thing because if there's no contrast between
the thing and the pointing it's one see very interesting
so contrast we can also call these distinctions one thing
is distinct from another thing and that it's not it
it's different from it so a cat is distinct from
a dog why is that because the cat is this
way and it's not the dog way if the cat
looked and behaved exactly like the dogs you couldn't tell
them apart now these distinctions are very interesting things because
we tend to hold them as objectively true but this
doesn't pass muster if we look at it even a
little bit in depth because we know that human beings
make all sorts of different distinctions for example there's the
cliche example of how they say that Eskimos have what
10 or 20 different words for different types of snow
because they make that many fine distinctions within snow or
as us Westerners who don't live in the North Pole
we only make two distinctions snow and ice sea so
distinctions are in a sense relative what kind of distinctions
you make shapes the kind of world that you see
you see that a lot more significant that you would
initially think a good artist or a good mechanic or
a good carpenter will make many many more distinctions about
their domain of mastery like let's say carpentry than you
would to you you walk into a carpenter's shop you
see a bunch of different type of wood and you
call all of it just wood because you never bothered
to study wood but to a carpenter he makes 20
different types of distinctions of wood and even the same
type of wood he'll look at it he'll make all
these micro distinctions within that take a look at this
wood look at the grain in the wood look at
these holes look at the knots in the wood all
the sort of stuff the flexibility different characteristics of the
wood see but to an uninformed person it's just wood
and that person just walks into the shop and seeds
wood whereas the carpenter walks into a shop he something
different something more refined what if distinctions are relative as
well what if all contrasts are relative after all how
do we arbitrate between different possible distinctions you make a
distinction that way I make my distinction this way how
do we tell who is right see we run at
that problem we ran into the four about perspectives and
arbiters it's also interesting to think about how the opposites
are joined so notice that you have a bunch of
distinctions in your experience but it's not like these distinctions
just live off by themselves everything in your experience is
a unity so it's not like there's a cat floating
up over there and a dog down there and you're
you're a tree in your house over there and a
car over there no it's all unified together so even
though we say that black is not white and up
is not down where exactly is the boundary there see
it's tricky a good way to look at it is
take a coin take a coin and look at its
two sides you got the tails and the heads now
we say that tails and heads are totally opposite things
and yet when we look at the coin look at
the edge of the coin where exactly does tails end
and heads begin is there any clear demarcation or boundary
there notice that the sides actually touch and that technically
speaking heads actually is tails in tails as heads they
can't be separate from each other you see maybe this
is not an accident maybe there's something deep and fundamental
about that maybe all these polar opposites and all these
dualities have to actually be together because they're all unified
in our experience they don't just float around somewhere how
can anything be separate from anything else and who says
what constitutes a legitimate boundary so for example there's the
boundary called leo you think of the boundary called leo
as being this right here or this right here right
that's the boundary and if I ask you well how
do you really know that this boundary here is what
constitutes Leo you say well look it's very clear like
the skin clearly you're you're encapsulated by this skin but
if we take that line of reasoning a little bit
further we ask well but zoom in on the skin
the skin has all these little pores and it has
little hairs do these hairs count as Leo - we
would probably say yeah these hairs must count as well
okay but what about one of these hairs which is
like half detached so when it's half attached it's still
part of Leo and you say yeah it is okay
but what about when it's actually detached it stops being
Leo at that very second and now it's something else
and then what about the pores and the oxygen that's
going into my lungs right now oxygen carbon dioxide nitrogen
all this all these chemicals so these are now actually
going into my lungs little tiny pockets and my lungs
are holding all these so is that oxygen a part
of Leo we could probably say no it's not okay
but what about the oxygen my cells it's at a
part of Leo and we've said well yeah that probably
should count as part of Leo but see when you
really get down into it you start to see that
actually this notion of a boundary doesn't actually exist maybe
boundaries or something we create now think about the significance
of that that boundaries are not things that exist in
objective reality but that these are things that we create
or we project onto reality after all who's to say
which boundary constitutes a boundary it might if I bring
a chair to you you would say that's obviously a
chair versus a table and you say that's obvious a
table those are two separate boundaries those are objective boundaries
to see if I take a chair at a table
and I bring it to someone who lives in the
Amazon to them they're not going to have that boundary
between chair and table they don't they don't really distinguish
these things to them it's all the same and if
I bring you two chairs that are very similar looking
you say they're the same type of chair but then
I say all I know but they're totally different because
look this chairs this way now chairs this way so
see this the social boundary might be more subjective than
you ever thought who's to say which contrasts in the
world are of any significance and notice that it's not
just a matter of drawing boundaries it's also a matter
of which boundaries do we give significance to because there
are millions of boundaries in the world that you completely
ignore and honestly you only care about the ones that
somehow affect you in some significant way that have value
to you all other boundaries you ignore and science keeps
making new boundaries as we learn stuff we make more
boundaries more distinctions so maybe boundaries are actually relative and
maybe significance of these boundaries is also relative you got
to wonder what is the substance of a distinction or
a boundary or a contrast so you could take a
look at your hand right now look at it and
see whatever background is behind the hand and just ask
yourself okay so there's this contrast of the hand and
the conscious of the background but then the the fact
that these things are contrasting what is the actual substance
of that distinction don't fall into the trap of thinking
is something like atoms or molecules it's not that contrasts
and things are not made of molecules molecules are themselves
a contrast you see notice this is very tricky because
any kind of physical object that you might pause it
as the substance of a distinction is itself a distinction
very interesting so what the hell is the distinction then
I'll let you mull that over as I keep talking
and by the way what about distinctions from God's perspective
are there any so from your perspective you make a
bunch of distinctions and I make my own kind of
distinctions and so does everybody else what kind of distinctions
does God make does he make no distinctions does he
make all possible distinctions does he cherry pick which distinctions
he makes are some distinctions more important to God than
other distinctions what is reality but a collection of distinctions
can you think of any object or anything that even
constitutes reality which is not a contrast to something else
and therefore a distinction so maybe what reality is is
just distinctions interesting what then would reality be to God
because God's perspective would have to include everything we would
think but if a perspective is only made out of
distinctions what does that mean for God now here's a
mindfuck for you what if there is no difference between
existence and non-existence because after all existence the non-existence is
what it's a distinction can you grab that with your
mind try to grab it who arbitrates between the significance
between existence and non-existence so of course we want to
say but Leo existences is surely different from non-existence these
things are clearly objectively distinct they're very different things but
be careful here who's saying that from whose perspective from
your perspective aren't you biased isn't it the case the
reason you find the distinction between existence and non-existence so
damn significant is because you think of yourself as existing
and you fear non-existence above all other things so in
a sense you hate non-existence you're completely opposed to it
everything in your life you do goes against non-existence so
that you may exist isn't that true and isn't it
true that that is your perspective and that could be
a relative perspective so what about God from God's perspective
is there a significant difference between existence and non-existence mm-hmm
imagine God's perspective as being the most unbiased the most
objective objective and close here the most objective perspective possible
like a very honest judge in a courtroom mmm interesting
see one of the mistakes that science makes is that
science tends to latent Lee assumed that boundaries are objective
things and that's just not the case at all there
is no canonical set of boundaries for all in reality
what science does the science draws relationships and interconnections between
different boundaries that it itself draws and that it itself
says are significant and descriptive of reality and yet all
of these boundaries are relative very interesting so now we're
going to do is I'm going to take a quick
intermission because what I've discovered is that when I talk
for longer than an hour standing here it's quite exhausting
because I can't move I just and it one spot
very still to be right centred on the camera so
I'm going to go grab a drink and take a
break you stay here because we still need to talk
about more and all of the seeds to be talking
about at the same time because your mind needs to
connect all these dots together and then maybe it'll have
some sort of a deeper insight so you stay here
and I'll be back in a minute alright I'm back
let's begin our investigation and continue where we left off
so let's think now about the domain of stuff called
relationships and hierarchies this is important so notice that in
our dealings with the world everything we see around us
is composed of relationships and everything we describe scientifically is
also relationship based now of course I don't mean relationship
as in intimate man-woman relationships Here I am talking about
relationship in the most universal sense so if you have
two objects we can say that they are in relationship
with each other they hold some kind of relationship like
the relationship of my head to my body is that
my body is on top of my head and the
relationship of me to the earth is that I am
located on the surface of the earth and we are
both the earth and my body exhibiting gravitational force on
each other and in fact my body as its here
we know scientifically is exhibiting gravitational forces on the planet
Pluto even though the planet Pluto is no longer a
planet and we can even take it so far say
that every single atom in the universe is exhibiting a
gravitational force on every single other atom in the universe
even thousands of light-years away so that is the extent
to which we talk about relationships here now interestingly enough
though we don't just take all relationships into account we
in fact dismiss virtually all relationships that exist and we
only focus on the ones that personally matters to us
so the question we should be concerned about here is
who's selecting which relationships are of significance and which ones
we should be focused upon and it's important to notice
that which relationships we pull out from reality to work
with or to care about or to speak about that
these are just a tiny tiny less than 1% of
all the possible relationships that exist and that in fact
if you look at it objectively all objects are infinitely
related with all other objects in our universe and within
reality that's in a sense what it means to be
a part of reality is to be in a certain
relationship with it and with every other member of the
entire system now because we're biased and we have certain
values and needs as human beings we only care about
a tiny sliver of all those relationships and even science
notice only cares about describing certain types of relationships and
notice that what science is really is the systematic study
of the relationships between certain types of variables or phenomena
that's one way to look at science in a very
abstract sense you take two different variables you say ah
these must be related somehow and then you find a
relationship through a mathematical formula but the things you're picking
out to find formula for what are those but a
finite number of things out of an infinite number of
things which exist you see so this kind of puts
this whole business of pulling out relationships into perspective fundamentally
we have to wonder what makes one relationship more important
than another and if we look at it very objectively
we have to admit that it's nothing other than our
own biases so of course to me as a human
being and to us as humanity and to us maybe
a scientist there are certain things we care about more
than others but ultimately and perhaps from God's perspective these
relationships are all relative now of course the objection comes
up but leo some relationships are clearly more fundamental and
more important than other ones like gravity for example it's
very important phenomena and the relationship that it exhibits on
all other objects is very very important and much more
important than other types of stuff but we have to
be very careful about that because that might just be
our bias sneaking in there and skewing our view of
what's really going on remember that we failed to find
a ground for anything so to say that some relationships
are more foundational than others well that is a problem
because we never found a foundation in the first place
also remember that we concluded that boundaries are relative and
that these are also things that are being drawn so
if boundaries are relative then which object I see out
there is relative to my perspective and then of course
if the objects are being defined by me then the
relationships are also being defined by me there are no
relationships out there really it's all functioning as one unified
Symphony if you want to think about it that way
in some poetic language how can you really say that
one thing is more important than another thing when Cygnus
itself is subjective you're defining which things you call things
and which things you don't call things if everything in
our universe is infinitely interconnected then this opens up an
interesting possibility that there might not be such things as
hierarchies in the conventional sense now by hierarchies what I
mean is like what a scientist does when they study
and create hierarchies so entire a scientist will go and
study the animal kingdom and then come up with different
hierarchies for the mammals and the reptiles and the birds
and so forth and draw all sorts of interconnections say
well these came before those and these depend on these
and so creates a hierarchy and this is generally what
human beings do is we create all sorts of categories
like this hierarchies and we mess them in each other
and say well this one's more basic this one depends
on that one like that but that might also be
a bias of how we do our science we tend
to do our science in a very reductionistic sort of
manner and we say like well we can take an
animal like a bird and then we say well that's
not really that foundational let's break the bird down into
cells let's break those down to molecules into atoms those
are much more foundational and the physics that put all
these things together that's all foundational the bird itself is
not foundational that's what we would say but we have
to be very careful about that because to do that
kind of analysis we have to lose our holistic view
of what's going on with reality because really all of
reality depends on every other part of reality and interestingly
enough science often likes to speak of reality as though
it's a deterministic system which means that everything is governed
by very strict rules and that if we were given
the initial condition of our universe we could just run
that we would get the exact same everything I would
be standing here talking just the way that I am
right now if we rebooted the whole universe from scratch
given the exact same initial conditions now there seems to
be some debate between scientists about whether reality is deterministic
or it's not deterministic we're not sure let's just keep
that as an open question but if we think of
reality as a deterministic system it's actually very interesting because
then what you realize is that there's no fundamental element
that's most important really you might think that this bird
or take a kangaroo you might say well a kangaroo
is a very arbitrary thing you know obviously the laws
of physics and gravity and so forth that these are
the foundational things of reality and then a kangaroo a
bird other creatures these are all variable they may or
may not come about from gravity but actually if everything
in our universe is infinitely interconnected then what that means
in a sense is that if I gave you a
kangaroo and you do nothing else about our universe none
of the laws none of the constants nothing you in
theory could reverse engineer our entire universe from that one
kangaroo because that one kangaroo in a way that I
give it to you can only exist given everything else
in the universe being exactly as it is so this
sort of flipped this idea of hierarchies on its head
and it flips this notion of reductionism on its head
from certain perspectives reality makes sense when we reduce it
then from other perspectives it does not and one thing
we have to wonder is from God's perspective is it
really the case that hierarchies exist or are hierarchies perhaps
something that the human mind projects upon reality that's interesting
to consider perhaps from God's perspective everything is equally important
after all what sense does it really make to say
that well this part of reality isn't very important as
if you could take a piece of reality and and
throw it out and still keep everything else the same
see the human mind because it likes to simplify reality
because you can't deal with the complexity of reality likes
to think as though we could change circumstances around and
make them however we want and we can just get
rid of kangaroos birds this this not none of that
is essential we like to think about some stuff being
essential stuff not being essential but I would submit to
you that perhaps from God's perspective everything is equally essential
including of course of stuff you don't like maybe even
the stuff you hate and see this is one of
the bribes that we have as it egos as individual
human beings is that of course as an ego we
have to survive and to survive we have to dislike
certain things which threaten our survival so again we have
a bias here and as egos there certainly are things
that are very important essential to us and other things
which we can take or leave but is that true
from God's perspective is that true from the perspective of
the entire system of reality I would submit that all
of reality needs all the pieces nothing is expendable nothing
is unnecessary nothing is unimportant so let's keep that in
mind as we move on to the next domain which
is let's think about form and formlessness this ends up
being a very important and it starts to also tie
in with distinctions and contrasts and that original example that
I talked about that infinite object so consider that all
the objects that you've ever known in your life are
formed objects even formless objects like you might think well
electricity is not a formed object or a cloud you
might say well that's not a formed object no that's
still totally formed object what I mean we mean by
formed is that it has some kind of shape and
form to it or it's a distinction as opposed to
it being formless which literally means it has no form
not that it's a more like a cloud not that
it's vague but that it's actually formless form is synonymous
with being finite to have some kind of form you
have to be some kind of way like my hand
has this form and it is this way and if
it wasn't this form it was some other form then
it would be that thing and not my hand so
my hand is also in this sense finite now the
formless what might the formless look like well the formless
might be something infinite something whose characteristics are not defined
in a particular way you might think of the formless
as the potential versus the actual whereas the formed is
the actual the formless is the potential like maybe I
have the potential to draw a painting but since I
haven't drawn it yet I haven't committed this intention to
a particular painting as a form it remains as a
potential and therefore it's not actualized but also it's sort
of still there there's all sorts of possibilities there that
are open notice that all forms are distinct and everything
that's formless is indistinct so we've touched on this before
and that turns into a very interesting duality and notice
that even the distinction between the formed and the formless
is also a distinction and it's also you might say
a kind of form very interesting so keep that in
mind and now let's talk about the final topic and
then we'll tie all this together and this is the
topic of impossibility power and weirdness so the question here
is how can anything be impossible for reality a lot
of times we like to think about reality but we
forget that when we're talking about reality as a whole
which has no limits on it from the outside that
perhaps to it everything is possible and this is difficult
for us to accept because when we live in our
ordinary world we know that odd finite objects have certain
possibilities and certain power that is limited and there's a
the law of conservation of energy you can't get something
from nothing right so if you have some energy in
a battery you can only use so much of it
to get stuff done and then it will deplete and
you don't have perpetual motions machines and if someone told
you about a perpetual motion machine you would say that's
impossible but then people make the mistake of carrying that
logic over to the whole of reality and this is
the problem because this means that then when we start
talking about some very weird ways in which reality of
the whole could work they say well that's impossible because
they think that there might be things for reality as
though it's like a human being like oh well certain
things for reality are impossible and are difficult and we'll
put the word difficult in close here as though reality
doesn't have enough power to be infinite or to be
a certain way but if you think about it why
should it be any more difficult for a reality to
create one atom versus a trillion atoms or to create
one human being versus a trillion human beings or to
create one planet versus a hundred billion planets and if
you're willing to buy into that line of reasoning then
maybe it could be true that reality could even be
infinite and that would be no more difficult than for
it to be finite because after all how are you
judging this difficulty or this limitation in power where is
this coming from this is just coming from if you
admit your own human experience and you're a limited human
being and the objects around you you see are limited
but that doesn't necessarily have to be decay for reality
as a whole because as we've talked about already the
limits of reality we never found a limit we never
found any kind of reason why there ought to be
a limit and in fact it makes no sense why
a limit could exist because how would that limit be
enforced and then the other question here is well that's
just very weird a lot of these notions have been
talking about some very counterintuitive how could reality be so
weird and see a lot of people get trapped about
proper understanding of existence or reality because they don't appreciate
that weirdness is also a relative thing after all who
are we to say and judge what is normal and
what is weird can you see how this is completely
culturally determined it's determined by your own private experiences it
has no absolute meaning you say that well this is
normal and we'll do what you're talking about is weird
and it's not normal but that's a completely subjective judgement
I mean after all if you take a human being
from 5000 years ago and you take that human being
and maybe somehow you take a time machine you you
warp them into our present time and you tell them
about all the stuff that's going on in the world
and you show them all the technology we have he
would be flabbergasted just absolutely floored by all the stuff
he sees all of it would seem very weird and
if you can remember when you entered this life all
of life felt weird to you there is nothing normal
normal is just a sense that you develop based on
a past accumulation of memories and consistent phenomena you've seen
and then that's what defines your set of normal and
what that is of course it's completely relative what's normal
to you might not be normal to a kid who
grew up in Africa to a kid who grew up
in the Amazon to a kid who grew up on
a Martian colony normal would be completely different for these
people and normal is completely different for people across time
from 5,000 years ago to a thousand years ago 200
years ago - today - what's going to be the
case in 10,000 years normality is going to completely fly
out the window I mean really think about this today
you're sitting at home and you're watching porn on your
computer and you're jerking off to that and you have
an LCD screen this LCD screen is part of a
computer which is doing millions of calculations per second just
to display your porn and you're sitting there jerking off
to this thing this thing is being powered by a
nuclear power plant which is getting its power from nuclear
fission and this is happening while you're sitting on top
of a ball of Earth which is spinning around the
Sun at 30 kilometers a second the Sun itself is
spinning around the center of the galaxy at 200 kilometers
a second this whole thing is happening and you're sitting
there drinking off and you think that that is normal
and now you're saying that wallah Leo you're talking about
some sort of paranormal ability you're going to talk about
infinity that's so weird Oh what is what is weird
and what is normal there's nothing weird about existence at
all just the very fact that you exist is a
very weird thing if you've ever thought about it it's
extremely weird everything is weird the only question is how
complacent have you become about it that's really what we
mean when we talk about weirdness and normality so that's
a completely relative notion so now let's take all these
different domains and put them all together imagine if you
will that actually there are no whose in reality there
is no ultimate who either God is not some grand
who sitting up in the clouds or outside the of
all reality God is actually the absence of whose what
that means is that reality is absolute groundless it has
no ground and that's no mistake that's exactly right because
it couldn't possibly have a ground and what that means
is that reality is an infinite regress of infinite regress
--is in infinite dimensions with no limit reality is absolutely
relative in that it is so relative everything is so
relative that it's absolutely so and the relativism goes full
circle from relativism into absolutism now a lot of people
don't like this idea of relativism and they start to
dispute it and they refuse to accept it but I'm
not just talking about some light form of relativism like
moral relativism I'm talking about metaphysical relativism I'm talking about
the very structure of what anything could possibly be it
must be relative absolutely so because who would there be
to arbitrate nobody there's nobody to arbitrate anything all perspectives
are just perspectives and from God's perspective which is the
no perspective perspective well that's a very interesting perspective we
need to think about that a little bit more so
reality what I'm saying here is sort of like a
cemetry of all the possible asymmetries it's sort of like
a hodgepodge of every single possibility that could be expanding
out to infinity where the whole and all the parts
are really one and to illustrate this so that you
really get it because I want you to really grasp
this I want to give you two very powerful analogies
for understanding absolute infinity the first is the infinite sandbox
analogy and what this is is this imagine if we
have an infinite block of sand which is just a
gigantic block of sands just stretching out forever like in
the vacuum of empty space we just have a bunch
of sand from the beach and it's there it's like
in this giant block now we can make sand castles
out of that sand but this gets way trickier and
interest more interesting than that rather than making sand castles
using some kind of tools think of the sand castles
as already being a part of that block of sand
can you use your mind's eye to see that in
this infinite block of sand we have the sand castle
whatever sand castle we can imagine it's already in that
sand can you see that we don't need to carve
it out unless we really wanted to we're just going
to use our minds eye here we're not going to
carve anything out can you see that in this block
of sand there are all sorts of potential shapes there's
a circle there's a sphere there's a there's an ellipse
there's a star you know three-dimensional shapes of all kinds
there's all kinds of sculptures you could carve a house
out of it a castle whatever you want the Statue
of David in full size could be carved out of
that sand and in a sense it's already in that
sand we don't even need to carve it out so
that's what reality is like that's what absolute infinity is
sort of like is that all the possible shapes are
already there and they don't even need to be cut
out you see the Statue of David is there in
a sense we could say that on every Beach on
this planet there is a statue of David in the
sand already you don't have to go there and carve
it out it's already there and not only that but
can you see how many different kinds of sculptures are
in this infinite block of sand infinite right every possible
sculpture that you could carve ever if you had a
million billion years is already there the only question is
do you want to invest your time to actually carve
it out if you really want to make it very
obvious see our minds tend to be materialistic and so
we want to card it out in order to consider
it real but consider that from God's point of view
it doesn't really matter whether the sculpture is actual or
potential because again actual and potential this is another dichotomy
another distinction that human beings make to us it matters
if we carve out the statue or not but from
God's point of view it's already there see but now
let's take it one step further imagine that rather than
just having particles of sands because after all sand is
is sand it's a very specific type of substance because
reality is not sand so let's make it closer to
what it actually is take this sand particle because it's
finite it has certain shape and properties and let's make
this an infinite object so this particle of sand rather
than being hard and brown and squarish and and all
this kind of stuff let's make it infinite by making
an infinite of course it has to be formless so
it has no form so you can't imagine it as
anything and in fact it makes no sense to call
it sand anymore because what we mean by the label
sand is a particular type of object with certain properties
but here we're removing all that so now imagine this
block of sand I'm still going to call it sand
but now it's called infinite sand so this block of
infinite sand now out in the vacuum of empty space
and now look into it and see that it contains
every single thing that could ever possibly be and it's
already there and that it doesn't even matter whether it's
actualized or not because actual or potential is really identical
if you were the Statue of David in that infinite
sand from your perspective you would feel like you exist
as a statue but at the same time the space
you're occupying could also be taken up by other statues
you see all those potential objects and sculptures are all
encased in that block of infinite sand it's all there
and that's what we mean by absolute infinity can you
see how total that is in accounts and includes absolutely
everything it even doesn't exist or non exist or not
exist it both exists and doesn't exist at the same
time can you see because again that's another duality that
we think in terms of but in terms of this
incidents and it even has every little particle sand even
has the property of existence and non-existence it has to
include those because it's infinite and of course it's not
a particle anymore it doesn't have size it's not small
or large it's not large and it's not small it's
both and neither at the same time it's everything you
see it's every possibility superimposed upon itself and that's what
existence or reality ultimately is from God's point of view
it's just pure potential from your point of view it
is a particular way because you're like that Statue of
David in the sand being a particular way and so
it's allowed to be both and neither at the same
time so your point of view doesn't really conflict with
God's point of view although when you are attached to
being a statue of David well you're not at that
time also allowing to realize that your the whole thing
it doesn't mean that you've disconnected yourself from the whole
thing you still are the whole thing but because you've
chosen to identify with being a statue of David well
that's your freedom to do that and so there you
are and you have created your perspective and everyone is
allowed to create their perspective but also at the same
time your perspective is still part of the entire whole
you never separate yourself out from it you see you
see the the elegance and ingenious nough second analogy which
will make it even clearer imagine a zip file a
zip file is an interesting thing a zip file is
a file which is one file into which we compress
a bunch of other files let's say I have a
hundred photos I want to compress them so it's easier
for me to to email them to somebody all compress
them into a single zip file now the question is
does that zip file or rather is that zip file
one thing or is a hundred things it's both you
see that's its function that's what makes the zip file
useful is that simultaneously it's both and the zip file
has this interesting property that we can unzip it or
then zip it back up when it's zipped app back
up we see it as one when it's unzipped all
the files come out we see it 100 but really
when you look at that zip file it's always both
it's always one and it's always a hundred even when
it's compressed or uncompressed can you see that it depends
on which perspective so to speak you look at it
from now we because we care about using the files
we have a preference for uncompressing these files and we
say well it could be an uncompressed a compressed eight
but actually for a certain perspective it doesn't really matter
which state it's in the information is all in there
see and then how you use it is up to
you depends on what your objectives are for certain situations
it's good to uncompress for others it's good to keep
it zipped that's how reality is except what I want
you to picture in your mind now is an infinite
zip file as if file that contains every possible file
you could ever create ever ever ever ever all of
them are created inside and souls zipped up and it
also zips up in there every single property that could
ever be every smell every color every shape every form
everything existence and non-existence it's all zipped up together and
you might ask yourself well does this file exist the
file zips itself up to such an extent that it
both exists and does not exist at the same time
and you might ask well where is this file located
on some computer like God does God have a computer
that holds the zip file called reality no the computer
and the zip file are all zipped up together into
one it's all one and there's no space there's no
there's not even a vacuum for for where this zip
file is located you might think all the zip files
just floating out an empty space no space is zipped
up in the file a vacuum the notion of a
vacuum is lift up in the file it's all in
this file what this file is it's an infinite collection
of every single possible contrast or distinction or finite shape
that could ever possibly be all zipped up together and
now to really bring this home I want you to
actually look around you right now look at your hands
look at me look around you look at your dog
look at your cat look your spouse in the eyes
and notice that what you're seeing right now is exactly
what I'm describing not describing something far out there you
know in the ether I'm describing exactly what's happening right
now what you're seeing before you is this at the
collection of finite contrasts which are actually simultaneously infinite my
hand right here is infinite at the same time as
it's finite what I am what leo is is just
an animated Statue of David so to speak in this
zip file in this block of infinite sand which is
of course animated and it's talking right now and here
it is doing everything it's doing and it's just kind
of playing out as a movie but all of this
is infinite every single piece of it is infinite it
has no ground this hand if you zoom into this
hand you can keep zooming into it forever it will
have no end and if you keep zooming out of
the universe it'll have no end you can just keep
zooming out forever forever and ever and ever and ever
and the substance of everything is ultimately nothing nothing nothing
is everything that's the zip file like nature of reality
can you see it look around you and actually connect
what I'm saying to what's going on in your direct
experience right now try to see the infinity here the
infinity is not somewhere else it's right here that's what
existence is existence and non-existence are right on top of
each other they're not separate things infinity by its very
nature must contain all finit ease can you see you
can't have infinity but not have something else you might
say well Leo how come I'm sitting here right now
this particular way and not some other way because if
you weren't here this particular way if I wasn't here
in my particular way speaking the words that I'm speaking
then absolute infinity would not be absolutely infinite see me
you and everything around is a consequence of the fact
that reality is just everything it's so everything that it
also has to be nothing because to truly be everything
it has to go full circle and become nothing because
if you exclude nothing from everything you don't have everything
you see and in a sense everything cancels everything else
out that's what I meant by it's a it's a
cemetry of all asymmetries I'm a particular asymmetry you're a
particular a symmetry but it's all balanced out in the
end and it's all just one little fragment of absolute
infinity and this is all not happening in time and
in space it's all happening simultaneously like one giant nuclear
explosion but even an explosion is not the right word
because you think of an explosion happening quickly but still
across time reality is not a Big Bang event not
really it's just simultaneous everything it's like a it's like
God loaded up a shotgun with everything imaginable and then
fired it at himself in the face all at once
and at the same time it never even happened you
see like it's really hard to come up with analogies
for this stuff because all analogies are finite and all
analogies take place within space and within time so you
have to kind of jump ahead and see where the
analogies are pointing you to here's a beautiful poetic way
to think about it Finity is a precipitate of infinity
in the same way that rain is a precipitate of
a loud actuality is a precipitate of potentiality limit is
a precipitate of unlimitedness form is a precipitate of formlessness
reality as we know it is a precipitate of God
but even to call these things precipitates is really not
quite right because you get the image of like rain
coming out of a rain cloud and then it actually
has to come out here to really precipitate finitude from
infinitude nothing needs to happen you don't need to actually
carve out the statue from the sand it's just already
there all you sort of need to do is just
see it in your mind's eye as such and of
course your mind's eye is the very object that's there
your mind's eye is not something sitting behind the scenes
I'm not telling you that this stuff is happening in
your brain your brain is all part of this what
you call a brain which we call space which you
call time which you call reality all this is just
contrasts within this cloud of infinite potential and you might
say well who is experiencing it and of course that's
the beauty of it is that nobody nobody is but
you'll say but I'm experiencing right now it feels like
I'm experiencing it yes exactly but in the very place
where you feel like it's being experienced that it actually
is at the very same time it is not here's
a brain twister for you have you ever wondered that
maybe what you consider existence is actually non-existence so you
say right now you exist and everything you see exists
but how would you know that you're just very familiar
with in so you call that existence but what is
actually at the same time non-existence as well I know
it doesn't really make much sense but then again ask
yourself how would you know what non-existence looks like or
feels like maybe non-existence feels exactly the way that you're
feeling right now maybe existence and non-existence are actually superimpose
right on top of each other because there's nowhere else
to be and nowhere else to go because reality by
virtue of the fact that it's one unified thing there's
no place to escape it to see you can't go
on a holiday to the Bahamas and escape reality wherever
you go that's where reality is existence or non-existence can't
be in different places but of course because we're so
preoccupied with existence we only tend to focus as human
beings on existence are you seeing this this is epic
what I'm telling you is epic when you really get
it what I'm telling you that reality is a groundless
infinite singularity and that it contains absolutely everything reality is
not a physical system it's not about brains or molecules
all that stuff is just content within reality all of
it is existent to non-existent at the same time what
reality really is at a substance level rather than molecules
and atoms or particles it has a system of contrasts
everything is a contrast to everything else and what are
these contrasts consisting of nothing these contrasts are not made
out of molecules these contrasts are contrasts and the nature
of being a contrast the very substance of a contrast
is nothing what this amounts to is reality being a
holodeck the Star Trek holodeck you know that it's a
holodeck without an actual deck just the hollow it's just
the stuff in the holodeck but then when you ask
yourself but where is that coming from what mechanics are
creating it the answer is absolutely nothing it's just a
hologram the whole thing is just one giant hallucination that's
what it is a hallucination is just a collection of
phenomena or contrasts without any substance underneath them and now
you're going to say but how could there be contrasts
without any mechanism creating them or any substance to them
that's impossible that's too weird but this is where I
bring you back to that point about weirdness being relative
and impossibility not being a problem for reality as a
whole in fact this is the most elegant and direct
solution you see reality is so powerful it has so
few limits it's so unlimited in other words that is
a mechanical it actually does not need a mechanism for
it to be appearance is the mechanism of what you
call reality finding other mechanisms the way science likes to
do is not really going to the core of the
substance of reality that's just exploring more content within reality
it never actually boils down to what the content is
made of its just content upon content about content because
science doesn't want to admit the irreducibly mystical nature of
reality it's a mechanical miss if you think about it
this is how it must be it's the only way
that you can encapsulate everything into one because if you're
always positing some other mechanism you need an explanation for
that mechanism and so on ad infinitum and that's what
we find in physics is infinite levels of hierarchies up
and down from atoms to universes with no end in
sight and yet still nothing is explained you don't actually
explain why the stuff is there whereas what I'm telling
you explains why it's there because it both is there
and isn't there simultaneously it is simultaneously everything in nothing
and this explains absolutely everything there is nothing left unexplained
by this it's total total total total total total so
total that you can't even fathom how freaking total it
is it's so total and then what's left for science
to do is to go out there and explore all
the content science could spend a billion years researching every
little nook and cranny of reality finding new content within
reality but what the substance of it is it will
never explain because it's what I just told you and
that's exactly how you really should expect it to be
because how can you expect science which is a limited
finite process within reality to be able to reach outside
of reality to explain it it makes no sense whatsoever
even in theory let alone in practice do you get
it I really want you to get it this is
the most remarkable thing you could ever possibly get it's
just remarkable you're alive in it right now it's happening
right now it's not a theory it's what's happening right
now can you see that to grasp this is to
be dumbstruck to really grasp this is to is to
go weak at your knees and fall to your to
your knees on the floor and to start weeping like
like a little girl that's what it means to to
know this because you've solved all of the existence you've
coggan eyes everything you know the heart of God and
when you really get there that's how it feels it's
not an intellectual oh yeah I think I understand it's
not like that it's like oh it's an insight that
kills you it's so powerful it's an insight that melts
your heart that obliterates every single belief in every single
notion that you've ever had in your whole life about
who you were and what's going on here it's that
profound I could stand here and talk for an hour
and I would not be able to convince you of
how profound it really is when you actually have this
insight for yourself that's how total this is once you
get this insight your life will never be the same
again now you might think oh my god leo now
I finally understand know the sad part is that you
don't understand what we've done in this episode is we've
gone to the limits of what the intellect can do
we've gone to the limits of conception conceptualization I've given
you a concept you don't really understand because if you
really understand I'm telling you it would literally kill you
and you would be sobbing tears if you really understood
the significance of what has been said here what needs
to happen is that you actually need to have a
direct experience of this and experience beyond all experience you
need to actually become God what I described to you
is God's perspective the non perspective perspective it's the absolute
aspect of all of relativity is to see that everything
is relative absolutely so and to to actually live as
that it's to stop being you as a human being
because to be you as a human being is just
to be a little Statue of David within the larger
scope of things but as you cling to being the
little statue of David you can't be and realize your
full infinite expansiveness so your job is to find any
way you can in life to experience this whatever that
takes for you everything that I said here is not
the truth it's just words it's just finite distinctions and
concepts because that's all I could ever do this is
where the road ends and then you have to go
off on your own to see the ultimate truth for
yourself where there are no words because words attempt to
reach outside of reality to grasp that reality but we've
seen that that can't work because your mind cannot grab
on to infinity because your mind is Finiti how can
Finiti grab on to infinity and yet while that's true
simultaneously Finity is infinity but you need to actually get
that and not just hear it for me or just
to think about it or just to imagine it because
everything you're imagining is not infinity it's very finite and
it's very limited so you can think of everything I
said here has not a scientific discourse not a philosophical
airtight argument this is just poetry I'm up here doing
poetry and the question for you is is whether you
can register the poetry and whether it can strike the
right chord in you so that you can have the
particular kind of experience that poetry is supposed to elicit
in you that's all this really is I'm not doing
science here I'm not really doing any serious philosophy here
to think that you can that you can grab this
with science or with philosophy or with religion or with
anything else is to delude yourself you're taking all your
mind stuff way too seriously and you're failing to register
the point that this will never happen through your mind
is this paradoxical hell yeah the very essence of reality
must be ducks I hope you can see that paradox
is not proof of our failure here paradox is actually
evidence that we've succeeded because we've had to join every
single distinction that ordinary conventional human experience is built upon
we've had to join all those in particular we've had
to join existence and non-existence together and that's something that
the rational mind can't handle very well because the rational
mind operates upon dichotomies but then of course it doesn't
understand that these dichotomies are its own fabrications and if
we want to get underneath all fabrications we have to
destroy all the dichotomies to see not from our perspective
but from God's perspective and now you can start to
appreciate why science misses absolute infinity and why religion misses
absolute infinity you're not going to get to absolute infinity
through a collective effort you're only going to get there
yourself you're not even going to get there with me
it's not you and me that are going to get
there it's only you who's going to get there of
course once you do get there you'll discover that you
were me the whole time and that the collective was
you the whole time and that was really all just
you I hope that you get to experience this at
least one time in your life for yourself because this
is the ultimate experience of life that's it please click
like button for me post your comments down below share
this with a friend and make sure that you stay
tuned next week for part two of this series probably
next week maybe it won't be next to go I'm
not quite sure yet but probably next week or if
not next week then sometime soon I'll shoot the part
2 which is going to have a lot of you
see historical interconnections about absolute infinity and I want you
to get those two because it's some pretty beautiful stuff
so we're going to continue down that road but the
very heavy metaphysical lifting we've all done here today watch
this episode several times and really follow along with some
of the arguments that I presented to you go through
the logic so that you really understand because after this
you should not have any more philosophical questions after this
you should start to actually work to have a direct
experience of this alright stay with me for more you
