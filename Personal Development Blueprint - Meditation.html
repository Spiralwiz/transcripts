hey this is Leo for actualised org and here we're
continuing on with my blueprint series which is over 100
of the greatest personal development concepts of all time that
can be found on actualized org slash blueprint and the
concept the recovering here is meditation alright so I want
to actually make this really simple because meditation is a
simple thing but first let's talk about before we get
into the specifics of how to do meditation we're going
to talk about what this is as a concept for
personal development and then why it's important so it's a
cause of personal development why is meditation important and what
is it what is it it simply means that you
make a practice daily I'm underlining and stressing the word
daily of sitting down in a chair or wherever you
want to sit down for 20 minutes closing your eyes
or maybe even opening your eyes leaving them open and
just clearing your mind of everything and sitting in silence
for 20 minutes that's it that's all it is but
beyond what meditation is is the really important aspect is
that this is a habit this is not a thing
that you do once and we're going to get into
that a little bit more in the body now as
for why it's important I think meditation is really really
important for human beings for every human being because what
it does is it helps us cope with all the
stressors in our lives and there's multiple benefits to doing
meditation and all of them have been very well documented
scientifically also anecdotally and throughout millennia of practice by humans
from from the ancient East and now to the West
doesn't really matter here's what meditation will do for you
number one is going to eliminate a lot of stress
it's going to be much more calm and peaceful and
when you're are when you are common peaceful that's a
position that you can make much better decisions from that's
a position that you can act powerfully from that's a
position that you can create an amazing life from you
can't do that when you're always stressed and bogged down
with the miss of life so there's that it also
eliminates those ants those automatic negative thoughts that we always
have right whenever you're having a negative one of those
negative thoughts spirals where you just say like oh well
he did that to me and she did this to
me and I'm gonna tell him this and she's going
to say that and you have this whole concocted argument
in your head going on and you worry about your
business collapsing or your career not working out or dropping
off your weight-loss plan or just any number of things
that you can be worried about that is ruining the
quality of your life but even beyond that it's also
ruining the performance of your life you're not going to
you're going to be living a very mediocre life if
you're always bogged down in automatic negative thoughts in meditation
is a really good way to to unhook yourself from
that it also unhooks you from stimulation because we're always
so overstimulated by the environment we're stimulated by food we're
stimulated by TV we're stimulated by a hangout with people
we're over stimulated at work and by our computers and
we never just take the time to just kind of
calm down and be happy in the moment when you
do a lot of meditation you end up being happy
just for being alive and for existing that's basically what
it is it's getting you back in touch with how
you felt as a kid because as a kid you
can have all these things that you needed all you
really needed was you needed you need some food ease
the water you need some safety and some shelter but
basically you didn't care about any of that because it's
all provided for you and so you're just kind of
happy being in reality and just existing and exploring what
is here right now and being totally in the present
moment not worrying about stuff and as an adult you
get away from that and you get hooked on various
sources of stimulation needing this hit of alcohol here needing
to watch some TV needing some food needing this so
getting hooked on that is is a problem meditation also
just it makes you happy this is something you should
want to be doing because it's a really good way
to make yourself feel good in your body is to
just sit there and be calm and be relaxed and
connect with reality connect with existence rather than always be
being be connected to like the social matrix that we
are growing up in by social matrix I mean society
all the demands of work and and politics and career
and and family life like those are all like social
obligations and social responsibilities but then sometimes you just want
to hook yourself from all that and realize that everything's
ok in the moment meditation is also good for improving
your work performance especially if you're a very creative person
if you're a high achiever type if you're an executive
type and your thought process is important to the work
you're putting out then you want to make sure that
your thought process is clean it's streamlined it's not overly
negative and it can be focused that's another thing that
messes the meditation helps you with is it helps you
with building up the free parental cortex building up your
willpower muscles so that you can actually use your brain
for being a really effective tool people that meditate a
lot will have more willpower more discipline it's going to
be easier for you to stay on your diet it's
gonna be easier for you to stay and work extra
hours at work if that's what is called for it's
going to be easier for you to generate creative ideas
so that's really good if you only do meditation just
to get performance then that's still a really good reason
to do it just for the performance that your brain
gets and studies have also shown that just the health
of your brain is going to get better meditation on
a consistent basis will help prevent things like Alzheimer's disease
and just keep your brain really healthy and active because
you're using it you're stressing it when you're doing meditation
you're like flexing a muscle and then lastly this is
kind of a more obscure and spiritual point but you
can actually use meditation to reach appointment alignment which I
talked about in other videos I'm not going to cover
here it's a really deep topic but if that's something
that you're interested in then definitely check out some my
other videos where I'm going to cover what enlightenment is
and how you can reach it through the use of
meditation but if you do meditation for a very very
long time and you're very very disciplined of it you
eventually can reach the point where you become so connected
with reality that you feel like you are one with
reality and all the pettiness in your life all the
emotional hang-ups you have all the psychological and stability everything
you worry about all that just melts completely away and
I have not reached that state so don't hold me
to that but that's what that's what the Guru's say
when they get there so that can be a point
that you can reach through meditation so that can be
like your long long long long distance vision of maybe
why you're doing it all right so let's get into
the body of what meditation is some of the some
of the subtleties of it and actually how to do
it alright so the reason we do it is to
control negative thoughts and there is this Buddhist idea the
way that they label our mind is they have this
analogy for the fact that your mind is like a
drunk monkey not just a drunk monkey having that monkey
chatter but it's like a drunk monkey who's been stung
by a scorpion so just imagine imagine that imagine that
image and isn't that true isn't that how our days
are sometimes maybe for most of us too much of
our days are like that wouldn't it be nice to
back away from that and to calm that monkey down
so that it's not always running around stung and drunk
and doing crazy things kind of rein that thing in
that's really why meditation is really useful okay as far
as how to meditate there's a lot of stuff out
there especially now because meditation is getting so popular in
the West you've got so many books classes courses manuals
videos look meditation at the bottom line is extremely extremely
simple and there's way too much around it so I'm
going to make it really simple as to how to
meditate here's how you meditate alright if you follow this
advice you're going to be doing it as efficiently as
you can be doing it so you're not going to
need to innovate on this it's really simple here's what
you do you get a chair simple chair with a
back on it you put it down you sit on
it every morning you get a timer you put that
timer on your cellphone for if you've a smartphone for
example you put that timer for 20 minutes you sit
down put your arms on your legs back up straight
close your eyes and just breathe deeply normally slowly at
a consistent even pace and sit there for 20 minutes
straight and try to empty your mind of any specific
thoughts that's it that's meditation and when some kind of
thought does creep in there that gets ahold of you
like for example you're sitting there and everything is peaceful
and calm right is there everything's nice and then all
of a sudden it's like oh oh I need to
answer that email oh oh what happens if I if
I stay in at work an extra hour then I
won't be able to pick up the kids when you
ask for having those questions in your mind you just
realize that you're off track and you just let it
go you let them go kind of like water passing
under a bridge and you try to clean your mind
and you sit there and you wait and you try
to last it out and see how long you can
sit through another period of meditation without getting hit by
another thought and when you start initially this is going
to be extremely extremely challenging because right now if you've
never tried it then you probably think it's not I
mean I know what you're talking about I can do
that it's just going to be boring but we actually
do it you're going to find out how challenging it
is it's very simple but it's very challenging to actually
do it because you're going to have thoughts creeping into
your mind every thought is going to come in and
you're going to realize you can very very keenly aware
of just how many negative thoughts you're having and how
automatic they are and how little control over them you
do really have at least right now what's going to
happen is that as you do this consistently every day
for weeks and months and years you're going to recognize
that you have more control and you're going to build
up your willpower muscles to the point where your meditation
sessions are going to get longer and longer and longer
and you're gonna be able to go without having these
thoughts get ahold of you and grab ahold of you
and have some emotional effect on you now is the
discipline that you're building has to discipline of meditation so
very simple see there's no you don't need to take
some class you don't need to read some book you
don't need to go buy a pillow you don't need
a special mat you don't need special shoes or clothes
you don't need some special position you don't need to
cross your legs in the full lotus position you don't
need to do any of those things you can but
you don't need to do any of those things in
fact what I'm going to say is that all those
are distractions those are rituals that people have built around
in order to sell you stuff or because there's Dogma
involved and ancient traditions of ritual that you don't need
to get the core effect of meditation meditation is just
sitting quietly and not thinking about anything it's just quieting
your mind that's all it is and there's slight variations
on it but that's basically what it is you can
focus on your breath if you want to you can
focus on on one particular launch or that you have
maybe an affirmations you have something like I am peace
I am peace I am peace and just keep repeating
it and focusing on it but none of those things
are necessary in fact I think the best way is
to do it very simply and take all the extraneous
superfluous stuff out because here's the problem is that even
though I've given you the process it's a very dead
simple process you're still going to want to be tempted
to innovate on this process and somehow complicated which is
the exact opposite of what the point of meditation is
it's supposed to unhooked you from all that when you
try to go and you take all these classes and
read all these books and buy all this equipment that's
the exact opposite of what meditation is intend to do
meditation is intended to make you calm in the moment
just being who you are as you are right now
your current experience not needing to add anything to it
so you don't need any of that stuff plus it'll
save you some money save you some time and the
biggest thing that'll save you is excuses for procrastination because
here's what's going to happen is that this thing is
so simple that your mind can't accept that it's that
simple so it us is in the in its infinite
wisdom and it's infinite trickiness is what it does it
convinces you that it can't be this simple there must
be something more maybe I need this maybe I need
that I need to take a class to make sure
that I do it right and you start coming up
with excuses for not to do it any sort of
reason for not to do it to the point we're
going to be sitting there on your chair doing your
meditation and you're going to be doing it and then
halfway through you're gonna have a thought like hmmm these
this one thought keeps coming up I must be not
meditating like some for some reason I'm just doing it
wrong and so you get all butthurt about the fact
that you can't meditate and you're going to start judging
yourself for that and maybe you get through twenty minutes
and you barely barely make it through you're almost about
to quit but let's say you finally make it through
to the 20-minute mark in your alarm rings and you're
like god damn I made it through but something must
be wrong this is like the fifth time in a
row that I barely made it through I must have
a second meditation I must need to go take a
class or read a book or something or maybe I
should just quit because I'm not getting I'm not getting
any peace or calm from this I'm getting even more
agitated that's totally normal anything that happens in meditation is
totally normal the key thing is that you just try
to Center your mind and clear it of thoughts that
does not mean that to do a successful meditation your
mind needs to be always clear of thoughts very very
common misconception I think where people get totally misled for
me this was a big realization is that literally anything
that happens within the meditation session as long as you
last out for 20 minutes and you at least try
to keep your mind clear that's it some days that's
going to be much easier than other days if you
just had a break up the night before with your
girlfriend or boyfriend good luck having a clean smooth meditation
session the next morning you're going to be frantic and
all over the place because that monkey chatter is going
to be coming around and it's going to be running
circles in your mind and you're basically going to be
totally out of control but you know what you still
do it and that 20 minutes that you put in
is still 20 minutes of meditation even if it was
little windows of two seconds here in two seconds there
where your mind was clear and the rest of it
was filled with a bunch of garbage and nonsense so
it is that's fine that's the process and when you
start it is going to be challenging that's what I
mean by this thing being really difficult because you're not
going to be able to do a smooth even minute
of meditation all of this meditation but you're not going
to be able to do a smooth minute of no
thinking is more accurate way to put it and that
that's going to frustrate you because you're going to assume
that you've got it all handled and that your mind
is clear and you've got good willpower and you're totally
in control but you're going to become very quickly shocked
and awed into how little control you really have because
what's gonna happen is maybe going to last for like
15 seconds before some negative thought creeps up or your
imagination kicks in and you start fantasizing about something and
what you gotta do is you're just going to say
okay I recognize now that I'm thinking about something that's
off track and I'm just going to let it go
like water under a bridge and clear my mind you
just keep clearing your mind and you don't judge yourself
for the fact that you weren't able to clear your
mind sooner because sometimes what will happen is that train
of thought will carry you so far like let's say
you're sitting and meditating and you've done the first minute
and it's all clean and good and then something something
snaps into your into your brain some thought and it
just carries you and it carries you along maybe for
two whole minutes and it sneaks up so suddenly on
you that you don't even realize that it's been carrying
you along for two minutes and then by the time
you realize you're like oh damn that must have been
a long time that I've been thinking about this this
stupid situation and then the next thought you're gonna have
is oh damn I messed up two minutes worth of
meditation the fact is that that's just the process of
it you're learning to build your willpower muscles and don't
judge yourself all you do in that case is you
clear your mind when you realize that you've wasted two
minutes thinking about some thought you clear it and you
begin anew you're still going for twenty minutes so it
doesn't matter those two minutes still count towards you twenty
minutes but you clear your mind and you forget about
it you let it go you don't get hooked on
it and if you do get hooked on it which
of course you will at the beginning you'll start to
doubt yourself and you'll start to judge yourself and criticize
yourself recognize that you're doing that and let that go
you just keep going through that process sometimes it's a
really kind of stop and go stop and go stop
and go grindy kind of process it's not smooth when
you do for a long time and become silky smooth
and polished that's kind of the state that you want
to get to and when you do that when you
get out of meditation you'll find that your life becomes
silky smooth - not always but it's going to be
more smooth than it was if you didn't do it
okay so that's how to meditate and some of the
common concerns that people have about it let's talk about
actually turning this into a practice because if you're not
going to do this daily I'm telling you right now
don't even start don't start meditation unless you're committing to
do it for at least 20 minutes every day doesn't
matter what in the day morning is better because you
have less your energies are still within you you still
have a lot of energy you're not falling asleep because
you just woke up and has to be quieter in
the morning less obligations more obligations at night less distractions
in the morning so morning is best 20 minutes every
single day weekends and weekdays every single day and you
don't do this for a month you do this for
the rest of your life this is one of meditation
practices this is one of those things that's subtle you
have to appreciate the subtlety of what meditation is it
is not this huge supercharging effect on your life at
least not initially it can be that way after months
and years but it's not going to be that way
in the first month and it's not even going to
be that way in the first five months I'm just
telling you the way it really is I'm not being
pessimistic or having some limiting beliefs this is how it
is Buddhist monks will meditate for six hours everyday for
decades before they get the full effects of meditation so
you got to figure that if you only do it
for 20 minutes you gotta at least do it once
a day to get some sort of effect and that's
what is so important is that you do it daily
you have to do it daily I'm stressing this because
people just don't do it they don't do it daily
I'm guilty of it myself so you gotta do it
daily and to do that here's a secret is you
have to convince yourself of the importance of meditation because
I rattled off a list of all the benefits that
you can get better brain health and better performance at
work less stress more happiness potentially enlightenment I told you
these things but right now your mind isn't bought into
it yet you're not bought into it you don't see
how it could practically improve your day to day you
don't see that and that's what you got to change
is you got to change your relationship to why meditation
is important because really if you don't see that it's
not going to be a Praia nuff priority for you
to do it consistently throughout your day and you're going
to get distracted by everything else and you're just going
to say ah it's not important I'll I won't do
it you have to really treat it as something important
the way I do meditation right now is I do
an hour of meditation every morning and I've committed to
doing it I just started I've done I've done 30
day challenge of meditation before but right now I just
started really doing it much more seriously because I have
recommitted myself and I made a mental shift into why
meditation is important for me and the way that I'm
doing is I'm using an audio program to help me
along it plays like nature sounds in my ears and
it also plays by Arnold beets which actually helps to
put your brain in the right meditative frequency I'll talk
more about that in other videos which is actually a
really powerful tool it's called holosync and there's other programs
out there but the point here being that I've committed
myself because in my mind I painted a vision of
what I'm going to be like a year from now
two years from now 10 years from now 20 years
from now when I do my hour of meditation every
morning for me that means creating a business that's many
many many times more profitable than it is otherwise for
me it means being much more fulfilled and happy for
me it means having amazingly smooth relationships and being like
really calm and imperturbable emotionally having full control of my
emotions it means having a really healthy and strong brain
that I can use to solve complex problems creative problems
analytical problems that I'm faced with all the time in
my business in my life for me this is it
and also for me that vision includes letting go of
all the stuff from the past that I'm still holding
on to because that's another effective meditations that gets you
psychological development it's almost like doing therapy but on a
more subtle scale so it's kind of like my therapy
and to me to release all those negative blocks that
I have it's going to literally move me and evolve
me to new levels of of consciousness and just like
performance so I'm doing it for both the performance but
then also for how it makes me feel and the
health benefits and I'm just like I'm really bought into
that vision right now so for me committing an hour
every morning now is easy because I'm committed but for
you it's probably not because you don't have that vision
yet so you have to do whatever you have to
do to build that vision for yourself it's probably going
to mean that you're going to try meditation out if
you haven't before and you're going to try it out
you're going to just experiment with it then maybe you'll
quit maybe you'll do a 30 day challenge like I
did when I started out and you'll last through the
whole thing and you like it but then you you
don't see the benefit of it in 30 days and
so you drop it but if you read the literature
and you listen to enough videos you listen enough self
help products you're going to start to understand the subtle
benefits add up big big big big time and then
you're gonna be bought in and you're gonna be doing
it so go ahead and get going on that journey
and then of course what I want to mention here
is a lot of people will tell me oh I'm
not meditating because and they give a bunch of excuses
like I'm not meditating because I don't have enough time
in the morning I'm not meditating because when I sit
down and meditate my mind is going all over the
place and I find it difficult I'm not meditating because
I haven't I haven't studied the techniques I'm just going
to go and take a class next month and then
I'll meditate after I take the class or I'll read
this book or I don't have the right pillow to
put under my ass when I'm sitting down in the
half Lotus position all of those are excuses because meditation
is super super simple all you do is you sit
down close your eyes and sit there for 20 minutes
so the real reason that you're not meditating is because
you're lacking discipline and you're lazy and your lower self
is coming up with all sorts of excuses to keep
that laziness in place it doesn't want to crank it
doesn't want to crank itself up to a new state
it likes being where it is it likes being comfortable
exactly where it is that's your lower self that's your
reptilian brain and your reptilian brain wants you to be
lazy and so it'll come up with a thousand excuses
literally you can come up with a thousand excuses for
why to procrastinate and why not to meditate and the
real reason behind all that is that you're lazy and
you have it geared yourself into action you haven't created
a vision for yourself so go ahead create that vision
and then you will be on track alright this is
it for me I'm going to be signing off go
ahead comment as always I love to get your comments
share and like this and then go to actualize that'll
work for more videos on advanced personal development just like
this and check out my personal development blueprint
