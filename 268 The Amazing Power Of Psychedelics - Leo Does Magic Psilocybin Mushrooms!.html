            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/ypDRRcMKj7E' target='_blank'>The Amazing Power Of Psychedelics - Leo Does Magic Psilocybin Mushrooms!</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Experiencing the effects of magic psilocybin mushrooms</b>: Leo describes the subtle changes in awareness he experienced within 20-30 minutes of consuming magic mushrooms. He likens the heightened meditative state and hyper-awareness achieved from mushrooms to sensations he would experience after a 10-day intense meditation retreat.
</li><li><b>Psychedelic effects of mushrooms</b>: He explains noticing intricate, organic floral and tribal patterns emerging on flat surfaces like carpets, walls, and ceilings. The colors of these patterns are vibrant and saturated, and he describes the patterns as being hypnotic, capable of pulling one's mind in. He also mentions experiencing changing mood in the room, which took on an "Amazonian feel" of being in ancient jungles or civilizations.
</li><li><b>Mindset and attitude towards psychedelics</b>: Leo emphasizes his positive experience with magic mushrooms, attributing it to his extensive background and interest in meditation, self-inquiry, non-duality, psychology, and metaphysics. He believes this exploration and curiosity about the nature of reality possibly insulate him from having a bad trip.
</li><li><b>Experiencing psychedelic trances</b>: He describes the onset of trances during his trip as powerful waves that are overpowering and completely consume him. These trances cause him to lose his sense of self, place, and reality. The trances only recede after an unspecified duration, leaving him more aware of the psychedelic experience.
</li><li><b>Trance state during mushroom trips</b>: Leo describes a recurring experience during his mushroom trips where he enters a trance-like state and loses consciousness. Coming out of this state, he feels like he has been away in another dimension but has memories of profound insights, wisdom, and even moments from his past. These trances usually last about 15-20 minutes and happen multiple times throughout his trip.
</li><li><b>Animal-like behavior</b>: During the trips, Leo notes that he begins to act and move like an animal, going back to a primitive, basic state of being. He describes this as a liberating experience where he feels loose, authentic, and uninhibited. This animalistic behavior is juxtaposed with his usual reserved and conscious movements.
</li><li><b>Insights about authenticity</b>: One insight Leo takes from his trips is the importance of being more authentic, especially in his physical interactions. The mushrooms showed him how unconstrained and natural his movements can be, giving him a new perspective on his typically restrained and artificial way of interacting with the world.
</li><li><b>Delusional elements</b>: Whilst experiencing profound insights, Leo acknowledges the delusional elements of the mushroom trips. He finds himself laughing hysterically and feeling deeply connected to reality but also recognizes that he is hallucinating and that some insights may not be as profound as they initially seem.
</li><li><b>Amazement at reality</b>: Leo describes a sense of amazement at everyday realities, like the existence of his body, his face, and his hands. He compares this to the fresh perspective of a young child, noting that mushrooms bring him back to a state of pure existence and reality, free from familiar concepts and burdens.
</li><li><b>Experiencing Flower Patterns on His Face and Head</b>: Leo describes noticing similar flower patterns that he saw on the carpet now appearing as tattoos all over his face and head, equivalent to tribal art tattoos of Maori and tribal people of New Zealand, but with pure light making them glow.
</li><li><b>Psychedelics Providing a Childlike Experience of Existence</b>: Psychedelics gave him a fresh, magical experience of just pure existence, free from adult stories and baggage, bringing him back to childhood.
</li><li><b>Realization of Existence's Fiction during Second Mushroom Trip</b>: During his second trip, Leo experienced a rapid onset of reality where he realized that his life's narrative was a complete fiction, leading to a loss of ego and surrender to the mushroom state.
</li><li><b>Understanding Reality through Meta-analysis during Psychedelic State</b>: The power of psychedelics is that it allows for a meta-analysis of reality when juxtaposed with everyday life, helping to understand that neither everyday life nor the psychedelic state is the ultimate reality but just different states of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Experiencing an Ontological Orgasm</b>: Leo describes a profound experience as an ontological orgasm, when he sees the distinction between real and unreal as groundless and it gives him the feeling of divine bliss and wisdom being directly injected into him.
</li><li><b>Breakthrough into Divine Love</b>: He experienced a breakthrough into divine love and complete rapture when he realized the infinite nature of existence, which brought him to tears of joy and love.
</li><li><b>Deep Connection with the Essence of Reality</b>: By understanding what reality is, Leo felt a deep connection with the essence of existence, leading to a profound experience of divine love, bringing him to tears. This divine love is not romantic, but is related to seeing the infinite nature of existence for the first time and feeling enveloped in it.
</li><li><b>Experiencing non-dual perception</b>: Leo describes achieving a state of non-dual awareness during his mushroom trip. In this state, Leo felt his sense of self dissolve and believed he became one with the entire world. He compares this perception to the world as an eyeball observing itself without any particular direction.
</li><li><b>Experiencing profound love and appreciation</b>: He details his profound love for a dirty mop bucket and a ball of pubic hair, lint, and dirt, which he describes as the most beautiful things he has ever seen. He expresses his love by hugging the bucket, rolling it around on the floor, and holding it tightly to his chest.
</li><li><b>A profound realization about time</b>: During his trip, Leo studies a clock and perceives time as a human invention and a joke, dismissing it as an illusion. He believes he's in absolute now with no past or future.
</li><li><b>Comparing religious experiences to his trance</b>: He equates his experiences with profound religious experiences seen in documentaries of individuals praying fervently in Mecca. He finds himself bowing and praying in gratitude and reverence for the beauty of existence.
</li><li><b>Understanding religion in a new light</b>: Leo explains that his experiences helped him understand the true nature of religion, seeing it not about beliefs or rituals, but about experiencing divine love and wisdom.
</li><li><b>Entering a thick state of enlightenment</b>: Leo describes feeling as if he'd reached the pinnacle of spiritual realization, comparing his enlightenment to wisdom comparable to famous sages and saints. During this phase, he believes he's reached nirvana and feels there's no deeper place to go.
</li><li><b>A desire to share his experiences and insights</b>: Following his spiritual realization, Leo expressed a desire to share his intense, ineffable experiences and insights, viewing it as his life purpose to share these profundities with his audience.
</li><li><b>Decline of the trip</b>: After basking in this profound, heavy state of being for nearly an hour, Leo describes how the feeling gradually evaporated, signaling the closing stages of his mushroom trip.
</li><li><b>Authenticity and enlightenment</b>: Leo explains that one of the insights he gained from his psychedelic trip was the need for authenticity in his life. Psychedelic experiences, according to him, provide deep insights that reveal the illusory and meaningless nature of typical life aspirations like career, family, and business. He encourages people to tireless dedication to the pursuit of enlightenment, as it brings about profound, transformative joy and beauty of existence that cannot be found elsewhere.
</li><li><b>Talking about profound experiences</b>: Leo shares his struggle in communicating the depth and significance of his enlightening experiences. He laments that many people dismiss, underestimate or are apathetic towards his teachings and shared experiences, denying themselves the ability to attain enlightenment and free themselves from their metaphorical prison cells. He emphasizes that accepting these teachings passively is not enough; one must devote their entire life to pursuing enlightenment for a true appreciation of existence.
</li><li><b>Challenging societal norms and belief systems</b>: Leo criticizes societal norms, life goals and belief systems, which he views as constructed stories that distract individuals from pursuing true self-actualization. He states that when compared to an enlightened life, the concerns and joys associated with conventional life pursuits pale in comparison.
</li><li><b>Effective communication about enlightenment</b>: Leo voices frustration about the challenge of effectively communicating enlightenment and its associated benefits to his audience. He states that he resorts to a blunt, obnoxious teaching style to rouse his listeners from their ignorance. He acknowledges that while he might seem to exaggerate the significance of enlightenment, anyone who has achieved a permanent state of non-dual awareness would consider his statements as understatements.
</li><li><b>Ephemerality of societal constructs</b>: Leo contends that societal constructs like prestige, success and relationships are ephemeral distractions from the more meaningful pursuit of self-actualization. He emphasizes that these constructs lose their allure once one tastes the profound joy and beauty of existence that arises from reaching a state of enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Resistance to enlightenment messages</b>: Leo discusses the backlash he often faces when sharing his teachings on enlightenment, stating that many listeners become defensive when their life values and practices are criticized. He notes that while these reactions are understandable, they hinder the transformative potential of enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Depth of ignorance</b>: Leo highlights the deep-rooted ignorance in society, likening it to a prison cell that prevents individuals from appreciating the 'beauty of life.' This ignorance, he says, is the primary obstacle in the journey towards self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Necessity of blunt teaching style</b>: Leo asserts the necessity of his blunt, sometimes obnoxious, teaching style. He believes this style is vital in rousing individuals from their deeply ingrained ignorance, thus facilitating their journey towards enlightenment and self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Enlightened Person's Silent Duty</b>: An enlightened person may not explicitly encourage or promote the concept of enlightenment as this understanding is often understated. These individuals typically refrain from "selling enlightenment," a role Leo Gura assumes, expressing truths bluntly.
</li><li><b>Limited Perception and Psychedelics</b>: Regular people often struggle with limited vision or understanding of reality, due to their preoccupation with mundane life. Psychedelics can potentially provide a direct experience of a deeper reality, serving as a wake-up call.
</li><li><b>Preparation Before Psychedelic Use</b>: Most people misuse psychedelics as they lack the necessary foundation or mental preparedness before their experience. This misuse can lead to psychological harm or false spiritual dogmas. Psychedelics should be used responsibly only by those already engaged in self-actualization work.
</li><li><b>Misconceptions on Psychedelics and Enlightenment</b>: The belief that taking psychedelics could lead to enlightenment is a delusion. Most individuals who heavily use psychedelics lack emotional stability and encounter numerous life challenges. Psychedelics are tools that can further enhance consciousness work, but not a shortcut to enlightenment.
</li><li><b>Therapeutic Potential of Psychedelics</b>: Psychedelics can be used for therapeutic purposes, such as healing and addiction treatment. They can also provide deep insights into life, encouraging interest in reality and truth. However, their use should be approached responsibly and foundational self-actualization work is essential before their use.
</li><li><b>The Emergence of Psychedelic Research</b>: The field of psychedelic research is growing, with neuroscience playing a key role. There is potential for using these substances in curing addictions and in other legitimate ways worldwide. 
</li><li><b>Impending Psychedelic Use Discussion</b>: The forthcoming episode will focus on how to use psychedelics responsibly for personal growth. Practical guidelines, potential substances, and their effects will be discussed. This is an essential watch before experiencing psychedelics.
