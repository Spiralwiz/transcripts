            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/OgtPGEBGUWw' target='_blank'>The Many Facets Of Awakening - List of Top 30 Enlightenment Insights</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Overview of the Video</b>: An advanced discussion on the many facets of spiritual awakening and enlightenment. This video lists over 30 insights on spiritual awakening that Leo claims to have personally verified and believes can be personally verified by viewers undertaking a spiritual journey.
</li><li>- <b>Enlightenment as a Complex Process</b>: Enlightenment is not a single realization but a complex process with varying facets and degrees. It's more accurate to view it as a mountain range rather than a single mountain as there are multiple paths and peaks to explore. 
</li><li>- <b>Purpose of the list</b>: The intent behind sharing this list is to provide viewers a checklist to track their progress on their spiritual journey and to prevent one from overlooking important aspects. It also helps prevent self-deception where individuals may think they've reached full enlightenment when they've only experienced a few facets.
</li><li>- <b>Spiritual Awakening Insights</b>: Several different facets of spiritual awakening are discussed:
</li><li>    - *Experiencing Samadhi*: This involves entering a non-dual state of consciousness where the duality between subject and object is erased, revealing the oneness of everything.
</li><li>    - *Realization of "No Self"*: This realization involves understanding that the individual self is imaginary. 
</li><li>    - *Recognition of the Universal Self*: Often referred to as the "I am" or the Atman. It is the understanding that one is pure existence itself, not just a human or a physical object.
</li><li>    - *Realization of Omnipresence*: The understanding that pure consciousness or the "I am" is completely omnipresent, meaning it is everywhere and nowhere simultaneously.
</li><li><b>Note</b>: Leo constantly reminds listeners not to confuse intellectual understanding of these concepts with true realization, which goes beyond mere belief and involves a profound feeling of self-realization.
</li><li><b>Understanding Consciousness</b>: Leo asserts that understanding consciousness requires a shift in perspective and a distinct awakening. Through this awakening, one realizes that consciousness is all there is, and there can be nothing outside of it.
</li><li><b>Awakening</b>: Awakening is described as a literal experience, like waking up from a dream. Upon awakening, one becomes truly conscious and aware for the first time, experiencing the world in a way that was previously impossible.
</li><li><b>Non-Duality and Oneness</b>: Leo suggests that upon awakening, one realizes the unity of all things, concluding that all separations are imaginary and all things are interconnected in a unified field of consciousness. The concept of non-duality is also realized, and all differences are perceived as relative and imagined.
</li><li><b>Truth with a capital T</b>: Awakening leads to the realization of absolute truth. This truth is not a verbal concept, but rather an absolute reality that is akin to consciousness.
</li><li><b>Absolute entity and Infinity</b>: Awakening to the absolute means realizing something that is universally true under all circumstances. Infinity, in this context, is understood as the realization that consciousness is endless, not in terms of size or number but as an absolute concept. Everything that exists is a manifestation of this absolute infinity.
</li><li><b>Absolute Nothingness</b>: Closely related to the concept of infinity is the realization of absolute nothingness. One understands that everythingincluding oneselfis constituted by absolute nothing. This realization also answers the existential question: why is there something rather than nothing?
</li><li><b>God and the Godhead</b>: Upon awakening, one can directly encounter and realize God, finally understanding the true essence of what the concept "God" truly refers to. Leo also refers to an additional facet of awakening known as the realization of the Godhead, which signifies the very essence or peak realization of God.
</li><li><b>Consciousness as God</b>: Leo explains that becoming aware that you are God is an important facet of spiritual awakening. This realization involves acknowledging oneself as the creator of all reality and the universe, embodying all the qualities typically associated with God. Realizing and accepting oneself as God is said to be key in achieving full awakening. Alongside this, is the collapse of the boundary between self and others, recognizing all other beings as extensions of ones own consciousness.
</li><li><b>Understanding Love</b>: Explaining another facet of awakening, Leo discusses the realization of absolute love. Initially described as a shocking realization, he explains that love is not an emotion, but the very substance of consciousness. He makes a strong connection between truth and love, claiming they are identical. This comprehension of love also challenges previous notions of evil, as all actions are perceived as manifestations of love in this state of awakening. 
</li><li><b>Consciousness as Infinite Mind and Self-design</b>: Leo discusses the concept of infinite mind, where reality is imagined, or a product of infinite mind. This includes all aspects of physical reality and extends to the recognition that one's individual existence is also a creation of their own infinite mind. This realization or facet is referred to as self-design, reflecting the understanding that one actively designs and creates their own reality, including their physical self. 
</li><li><b>Understanding of Birth</b>: Leo elaborates another facet of awakening as the understanding of the concept of birth. Here, the realization is that our existence does not begin with our physical birth, but that we have, in fact, existed forever. The notion of having been physically born is understood to be a fictional story, further extending the understanding of self-design and oneself as God.
</li><li><b>Concept of birth and time</b>: Leo delves into the mental constructs of birth and time, challenging the traditional views and understanding of both. He explains that our idea of birth is purely imaginary and emphasizes the illusion of time, stating that one has actually been alive forever. Future, past, and even the idea of birth are projections made in the present 'now' which is all there is.
</li><li><b>Eternal existence</b>: The video touches on the idea of eternal existence. According to Leo, everything that happens and has ever happened occurs in the perpetual now. This 'now' is eternal and outlasts the imagined construct of time.
</li><li><b>Concept of death and immortality</b>: Leo dismantles the common perception of death, asserting it as imaginary. The concept of death falls under the category of future ideas, equally imagined as the past. As everything happens in the now, there is no room for death. Leo suggests that one's realization of this fact brings an awareness of immortality. 
</li><li><b>Concept of paradise or heaven</b>: Upon the realization of immortality and the elimination of fear, Leo argues that one then inhabits a state of 'paradise' or 'heaven'. Paradise, therefore, is not a physical location but a state of consciousness characterized by the awareness of immortality and ultimate freedom from fear.
</li><li><b>Realization of absolute love and bliss</b>: Leo further elaborates that the state of paradise is accompanied by the experiential realization of absolute love and a feeling of ecstasy or bliss. The bliss and ecstasy arise from the state of awareness of the absolute goodness in everything and the release from fear that comes with the realization of immortality. 
</li><li><b>Infinite intelligence</b>: Leo expresses that one comes to understand that everything in existence, from the human body to all natural and man-made systems, function as a product of infinite intelligence. According to Leo, this intelligence exists inherently within the physical aspects of reality and is behind the "well-oiled machine" of life itself.
</li><li><b>Absolute goodness</b>: He further explores the concept of absolute goodness. In this awareness state, the binary distinction between 'good' and 'bad' dissolves, and one realizes intrinsic goodness in everything, even in what was previously thought of as evil.
</li><li><b>Infinite will</b>: Leo concludes this section of the video by discussing the realization of 'infinite will.' The infinite will of God, according to Leo, creates all experiences and manifestations in reality. He also explores the idea of human will as a minor aspect of God's infinite will, manifesting as individual actions and behaviors.
</li><li><b>Understanding of God's Will and Unlimited Power</b>: Leo suggests that humans use a fragment of God's will in their everyday lives, but expanding this will to an infinite extent allows for the creation of anything and everything. God, being purely unlimited, has infinite power, and with this power, anything can be created, be it physical or logical. Limitations exist only when God chooses to limit itself, for instance, in the creation of humans who don't possess unlimited power.
</li><li><b>Concept of Omniscience</b>: Omniscience, according to Leo, is not about knowing everything conceptually but about being aware at the level of being. A person can achieve total omniscience without knowing everything. For instance, one can be totally omniscient but may not know what their neighbor had for lunch.
</li><li><b>Realization of Divinity, Magic, and Mystery</b>: Leo elaborates that the human perception of reality is divine and magical. This realization occurs only after deep awakening. With awakening, the reality becomes mysterious because the being is prior to knowing. Another aspect mentioned is the realization that consciousness is divine and is the substance of reality.
</li><li><b>Understanding of Life and Purpose of Existence</b>: Leo suggests that the entire universe is alive and the question of where life comes from becomes obsolete since everything is alive in different forms. The ultimate purpose of existence, according to Leo, is love and everything is a manifestation of this love.
</li><li><b>Communication with God and Healing</b>: Leo mentions the ability to communicate or channel with God, ones higher infinite self, and gain direct insights. Another aspect discussed is the capability of healing oneself and others due to the connectivity with the will of God.
</li><li><b>Collective Consciousness, Extinction of Perception, Paranormal Phenomena</b>: Other facets of awakening include the realization of collective consciousness, the total extinction of perception (which Leo has not personally experienced), and various paranormal abilities like clairvoyance, telepathy, past-life regressions, hyper intuition about the future etc.
</li><li><b>Interaction with Alien Entities</b>: The final point discussed involves communicating and interacting with alien entities. Leo clarifies that these aliens, like everything else, are projections of one's own mind and are relatively real. He encourages viewers to explore this possibility through personal experience.
</li><li><b>Understanding Truths Beyond One's Own Experiences</b>: Leo Gura outlines that he explores facets of spirituality based not only on his personal experiences but on wider possibilities as well. He illustrates examples of communicating with aliens or tapping into past lives as experiences that he has not personally had but recognizes as possible elements of spiritual awakening. 
</li><li><b>Simultaneous and Gradual Realizations</b>: He describes how facets of spiritual awakening can either occur simultaneously or individually. They can also appear in various orders and depths of realization, furthering the complexity of spiritual understanding. He compares this process to constructing a jigsaw puzzle where aspects are intermittent and require integration for a full comprehension.
</li><li><b>Possible Distortions and Self-Deception</b>: Leo warns about the risks of misinterpretation and self-deception in the process of gaining spiritual insights. He mentions how societal beliefs and outside influences can create doubts and distort realizations. He advises viewers to seek help from those who have experienced similar depths and breadth in their spiritual journeys.
</li><li><b>Variations in Spiritual Teachings and Teachers</b>: He states that spiritual teachings and their proponents may focus on specific aspects while neglecting others. This can lead to a lopsided understanding and application of spirituality. For instance, a guru from a Buddhist tradition may emphasize nothingness or emptiness while discounting the realization of oneself as God. 
</li><li><b>Engaging with Multiple Facets of Spirituality</b>: Leo encourages engaging with multiple aspects of spirituality for a holistic understanding. He suggests that instead of adhering strictly to a singular path or teaching, exploring different traditions and their teachings would offer a broader perspective and deeper realization of spirituality. 
</li><li><b>Limitations in Teacher's Knowledge</b>: He mentions the limitations in a spiritual teacher's knowledge, often due to their exclusive adherence to a specific tradition or dogmatic path. He stresses the importance of independent study and exploration beyond what is taught. 
</li><li><b>Possibility of Narrowing Spiritual Awakening</b>: He points out that narrow practices like self inquiry or meditation, while they can aid in spiritual awakening, also hold the potential to limit the process. The emphasis should be on understanding the full scope of spirituality, including facets that a particular practice may not directly address. 
</li><li><b>Comparing Spiritual Teachings and Gurus</b>: Leo emphasizes critical analysis and comparison of different spiritual teachings and gurus to gain a wider perspective. The knowledge and depth of understanding that each guru possesses can vary significantly, leading to diverse interpretations and teachings of spirituality. 
</li><li><b>Creating a Holistic Picture of Spiritual Awakening</b>: Leo concludes by explaining how understanding and integrating various facets contribute to creating a larger, more holistic picture of spiritual awakening. The process may take time, and different facets may be realized intermittently, but he emphasizes the importance of bringing these disparate pieces together to fully comprehend the totality of one's awakening.
</li><li><b>Questioning Gurus and Teachers</b>: Teachers and gurus can be dismissive of questions around aspects of their teaching that they themselves may not fully comprehend. This could lead to a form of spiritual closed-mindedness. For instance, if a teacher has not experienced love, they may dismiss it as a human emotion unrelated to awakening. Teachers can dismiss queries about things like omniscience or infinite intelligence if they havent realized those aspects for themselves. 
</li><li><b>Role of Psychedelics in Awakening</b>: Psychedelics can make the differences in depths and facets of spirituality more apparent. They offer different perspectives on awakening and allow for diverse insights. Different psychedelics like LSD, mushrooms, DMT, and MDMA can highlight different facets of awakening, and that can help in understanding the broader spectrum of awakening compared to singular techniques like meditation or yoga.
</li><li><b>Effect of Intentions and Questions on Awakening</b>: In the process of awakening, our intentions and the questions we are genuinely curious about can significantly influence the facets we unlock next. Quality questioning, contemplation and self-inquiry can guide our mind in particular directions and trigger certain insights. High-quality questioning is crucial for self-actualization work. 
</li><li><b>Use of Different Tools for Awakening</b>: Psychedelics can be effective for hitting different facets of awakening. While its possible to achieve these insights through practices like yoga or meditation, psychedelics can offer a broader range of experiences. However, one should focus on the understanding of consciousness, regardless of the method used. 
</li><li><b>Perceived Contradictions in Different Teachings</b>: Different traditions and teachers can have different perspectives and interpretations of the facets, potentially leading to apparent contradictions. However, these could also be a result of different language or framing. Dont assume that a guru or teacher knows everything or has fully realized every facet. Even great gurus may lack knowledge in certain facets.
</li><li><b>Importance of Critical Analysis of Teachings</b>: It is important to critically examine spiritual teachings and compare perspectives from different gurus. This will help in gaining a more comprehensive understanding of awakening. Some gurus are highly skilled at certain facets but lack understanding of others. The depth of a gurus understanding can vary, and the differences in teachings may arise from these different depths and facets of understanding.
</li><li><b>Responsibility in Spiritual Awakening</b>: Leo encourages viewers to take responsibility for their own spiritual journeys rather than blindly following gurus. He notes that gurus might not always reveal their full understanding, or they might dismiss certain questions to avoid revealing their own ignorance. It is crucial not to make assumptions about all awakenings being the same or all gurus being equally enlightened.
</li><li><b>Contradiction between Gurus</b>: Variations and disagreements in spiritual teachings are due to contrasting depths and different facets of spiritual understanding among teachers. Disparities in teachings can be due to partial realizations, which can lead to misunderstanding other perspectives and potentially promoting imbalanced teachings. A complete awakening involves understanding various facets of spirituality, like love and the notion of God, both individually and collectively.
</li><li><b>Exploring Spiritual Insights</b>: Leo highlights the varied nature of spiritual insights and encourages exploring these aspects independently. He suggests using a variety of spiritual techniques, which may give different insights into awakening and reality, to prevent a limited perspective. Spiritual awakening doesn't guarantee other aspects of personal development, like emotional mastery and eliminating undesirable habits. Thus, the understanding and embodiment of spiritual insights should be part of a continuous development process.
</li><li><b>Facilitating personal insights and enlightenment</b>: Awakening is a process that involves gaining significant insights. However, realizing an insight doesnt guarantee its permanent embodiment in one's life. This embodiment requires a considerable amount of work and consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Struggling with the fear of death</b>: Leo admits to struggling with the concept of death despite knowing its illusionary nature. Fully embodying this realization can be a difficult process that might take years and intense spiritual awakenings. 
</li><li><b>Difficulty embodying love</b>: Just as with understanding death, embodying love at all times, especially when others are unkind, can be challenging. While comprehending everything as love is achievable, consistently expressing it can be complicated, especially during moments of anger or unhappiness.
</li><li><b>Understanding and questioning reality</b>: Various aspects of reality, beyond the major facets like God, infinity and absolute love, can be questioned and understood more deeply. This includes minor yet important topics like science, evolution, art, relationships, leadership, and society. Questioning these aspects is not considered frivolous but practical and useful for the betterment of society.
</li><li><b>Deepening understanding of reality</b>: The end goal of Leo's teachings is to deepen the understanding of reality, with the ultimate measure being one's consciousness of reality. This understanding, in turn, determines how well someone can embody it.
</li><li><b>Encouragement to seek personal experience and insights</b>: One can validate Leo's teachings by pursuing their own experiences and gaining insights. Believing Leos words without personal validation is discouraged.
</li><li><b>Personal growth and spiritual journey</b>: Leo talks about his own plans for personal growth, including deepening his existential work, potentially becoming a monk, and moving away from his current work. The plan for the future is uncertain as personal growth and deepening spiritual awakening might lead him towards new paths. Despite these uncertainties, he is committed to inspiring others through his teachings. However, his ultimate goal is to embody his teachings fully and influence people through his personal presence.
