[Music] welcome to spiral dynamics stage purple this is a
continuation of my multi-part series on the developmental model known
as spiral dynamics i have many episodes in this series
in a sense this is the end of the series
but also the beginning because stage purple is really the
beginning of where you want to start with spiral dynamics
and then everything else goes up from there now before
we get into that i want to give credit here
to the developers of this model claire graves don beck
and christopher cohen and also the website spiral dynamics integral
dot nl a lot of the phrases and information that
you'll find in this episode i pulled directly from the
website or i pulled directly from the book called spiral
dynamics or from the work of claire graves who was
the originator of the spiral dynamics model before it was
even called spiral dynamics it was a series of value
systems so spiral dynamics again just to recap for those
of you who are just joining in if this is
the first episode you're watching it's a developmental model that
looks at the evolution of culture and human psychology through
time both at an individual level and also collectively and
a lot of it is about collective evolution because culture
is sort of a collective human invention so every stage
is a more advanced form of culture no one stage
is better than any other stage but they do come
in a particular order and generally you don't skip stages
you have to go through each stage to get to
the next stage this model is extremely useful for understanding
your own development throughout your life the development of those
around you your family members your friends your co-workers and
then also the development of your society and the real
value of this model is that you're able to take
uh all of the crazy cultural stuff that's happening around
you and make sense of it because really what you
start to see is when you look at culture and
you strip it off of all of its superficiality you
get down to the root of culture and what that's
about is about a certain level of the psyche uh
a certain level of cognitive development of the psyche a
certain level of moral development and really a set of
values so each stage corresponds with a set of values
here we go i'll show you again the chart of
the various stages purple is the beginning of the spiral
we might say there's one below called beige but it's
not really pertinent to us here in our work so
we're starting with purple then we go up to red
blue orange green yellow and turquoise and as we're going
up this ladder of levels as we might say there's
an increase in the level of consciousness and increase in
the level of complexity to the culture and to one's
psyche or to one's mind and so generally what we
try to do throughout life is we try to evolve
up these stages in a sense as quickly as we
can trying to get to tier 2 which is yellow
and turquoise that's what we're trying to do personally and
that's kind of where our understanding of culture intersects with
our own individual development so you yourself if you're joining
actualize.org in the effort to actualize yourself to develop yourself
then you're probably joining me around stage orange maybe green
maybe even blue and then my job is to help
to take you into uh high green solid green yellow
and to turquoise and uh and basically all of the
content that i that i share with you is trying
to get you to yellow and turquoise and to see
reality from those higher uh elevation perspectives uh higher stages
of consciousness more complex ways of looking at the world
more nuanced ways of looking at the world okay so
let's talk about the essence of stage purple stage purple
is about being a member of a tribe and a
clan in a sense this is where mankind began mankind
has lived this way for hundreds of thousands of years
in a clanish tribal sort of little community it's about
survival as a tribe it's about sacrificing oneself for your
own tribe being an individual subordinated to the group today
because most of us if you're listening to me you're
probably living in a relatively developed part of the world
uh maybe a western democracy in europe or in america
or in canada some something like that and therefore you're
probably at spiral dynamic stage blue or above probably around
orange maybe orange slash green and so at this level
of development our culture has so indoctrinated us with this
notion of individuality individual consumerism individual property rights my right
to have a house my right to have you know
my wife my right to have my children my right
to have my car it's a very we're living in
a very materialistic individualistic age and culture we might say
uh all the culture that comes out of hollywood and
so forth that is now spread all around the world
if you're watching movies and tv shows and all this
it's all very individualistic minded and it can create sort
of a false notion that this is how mankind has
always been we've always just thought of ourselves as individuals
surviving this there's just kind of this libertarian myth that
i've talked about in my episode about why libertarianism is
nonsense this sort of myth of the rugged individual the
sort of john wayne character um who survives by himself
is self-reliant and if anybody messes with him you know
he's got his gun and he defends his right and
his property and his family and his wife and this
this sort of mentality but this is not how the
majority of mankind lives not even to this day but
certainly not for the majority of human history the majority
of human history was communal life you lived as part
of a tribe when you're living as part of a
tribe there is not this sense that i have a
individual right to a piece of land and to a
house and to a gun and to whatever you're part
of a tribe and in fact your larger identity sees
this is all a function of identity and we talk
about identity a lot in my teachings uh because identity
is the crux of of all development and really everything
that goes on with humans is all about identity so
here we're talking about a very collectivist identity and uh
you need to start to wrap your mind around the
idea that having an individual identity is something that's relatively
modern it's maybe a couple hundred years old maybe a
thousand years old you know depending on which parts of
the world we're looking at but even today i would
say probably half the world lives in such conditions where
being an individual is simply impossible survival as an individual
is impossible survival means surviving as your tribe and your
tribe is extremely valuable and important to you it's your
whole life it's your whole identity it trumps everything else
it trumps your own personal satisfaction of your ego needs
and your your desire to play video games or to
watch a movie or to have sex all of those
are subordinate to the survival of your tribe because if
your tribe died dies out nothing else is possible in
many parts of the world see but then in the
most developed parts of the world we've sort of outgrown
the tribe our tribe has become so big that we
forget that we're even part of a tribe and that
humans are a tribal species and this leads to all
sort of absurdities which i talk about in my why
libertarianism is nonsense episode go check that out if you
want to understand at a deeper level the problems that
happen there so the essence of purple is that life
not only is it communal but it there's it's it's
deeply mystical in the sense that it feels like life
is part of this being alive within an enchanted magical
village so there's this element of spirituality of mysticism that
that's part of stage turquoise because at state turquoise there
is not advanced rationality there is not advanced science or
advanced technology so there's not this mechanistic materialistic worldview that
is so common today that again we also take for
granted we sort of take for granted this idea that
well everybody since the dawn of human civilization has just
assumed that there are physical objects and that the universe
is just this physical logical clockwork machine it's like a
computer it's like a computer simulation or something like that
and this is just not the case at stage purple
life is magical life is mystical stage purple seeks harmony
with nature's power there's a sort of reverence of the
power of nature because people who live at stage turquoise
they generally live very close to nature they're not living
in apartment complexes or high rises in giant cities they're
living in the forest in the jungle on the savannah
in the desert and their survival depends upon the water
the earth the fish the animals the sun the moon
and so on there's an animistic spirituality shamanistic spirituality it's
mystical we'll talk more about that as we go forward
what that really means this notion of animism uh purple
obeys the desires of mystical spirit beings which are just
thought to be part of nature nature is seen to
be mystical there's a deep connection to nature and there's
a sort of uncivilized and i'm putting this in quotes
uncivilized quality to stage purple now in many ways stage
purple is more has more wisdom and is more advanced
in a certain sense we could say than stage orange
which is extremely materialistic and disconnected from nature and the
wisdom of nature but in a certain sense also we
don't want to romanticize stage purple tribes too much because
there's a reason that mankind grew out of stage turquoise
or stage purple tribes is because they are uncivilized and
we'll talk about those uncivilized aspects as we go forward
here so when does stage purple emerge really the beginning
of homo sapiens there was never a time in the
history of homo sapiens where we lived as individuals i
remember when i was a kid i sort of thought
that that's how mankind used to live i thought that
well we were all just individuals living by ourselves and
then as we became more advanced we kind of came
together and we started to cooperate together and you know
build pyramids and build cities and things like that but
before that we were just individuals and then later when
i when i did a deeper study i was surprised
and shocked to learn that no there was never such
a time there was never a time when human beings
were rugged individuals living in forests by themselves we were
always part of a tribe and if you look at
our nearest ancestors the chimpanzees and the bonobos you see
that they don't survive by themselves you never find a
alone chimp walking through the forest the chimp is always
part of a troop it might be 20 members 30
members 50 or 100 members depending on the you know
the species of the of the primate and so forth
you know it tends to vary uh but there was
never this time when humans even lived as an individual
family you might say well the smallest unit of humanity
is just a family of four no you can't survive
as a family of four in in the harsh wilderness
of the jungle or the the savannah or in the
deserts or in the mountains it just it doesn't work
it never worked so what happened was that our nearest
common ancestor with these apes and and primates was was
something like between you might say like a chimpanzee and
a human and even back then this was like maybe
a million years ago or so even back then they
were already highly social highly communal creatures and they didn't
survive by themselves and uh and also so that's sort
of collectively where stage purple emerged it basically emerged probably
a million years ago or so uh even before our
species existed it basically emerged we can see a sort
of a a crude proto form of it in chimpanzees
and in in bonobos they have a certain very primitive
culture they even have tool use and other things like
that that they that they learn and teach each other
and so on but individually for humans uh in early
childhood you know we're raised a little bit isolated if
we're if we're children you know the first few years
we spend mostly at home but then they throw us
into kindergarten into preschool and then quickly elementary school and
then quickly you're learned and uh sort of socialized and
taught how to be tribal how to play in a
tribe with other kids how to get along how to
share things and you know all the challenges that come
with that so you remember what it was like to
learn and and that's difficult it can be difficult to
to learn how to integrate with other human beings and
to navigate the dynamics there there's a certain kind of
game that you know social game that's played you have
to be polite you have to be able to read
their signals their emotions you don't want to be too
mean to them you don't want to be too much
of a bully you got to make friends there's a
sort of a politics game that's going on now you
know so all of these social dynamics you start learning
this really young as a child you start learning what
to say you start learning that you need to do
the right things to fit in so other kids don't
ostracize you so they don't ridicule you and laugh at
you they don't bully you and so then that whole
thing and then it just it it keeps evolving beyond
that through middle school then into high school you know
high school becomes very much social and about playing these
politics games of who's the coolest kid in school and
how do you be cool how do you hang out
with the cool kids and there's different groups and all
these social dynamics so this is where stage purple starts
to emerge for you as an individual think back into
your early childhood and teenage years where you struggled with
that and i'm willing to bet that many of you
struggled with that and still struggle with it today especially
if you're an introvert like me so purple emerges because
social life goes way beyond personal survival purple emerges because
it's a natural extension of the family unit so if
we take the family unit it's just sort of the
basic unit of human survival uh but we expand that
because you're not surviving as one family it's a collection
of clan of families surviving together that you're going to
have to interbreed with and so forth and so basically
the tribe is one big family so you have your
little local family that you deal with now just apply
those similar dynamics scale them up by a factor of
10 or 20 and now you're looking at your tribe
in this tribe everybody knows everybody else it's not this
cold calculating business-like transaction where you are trying to profit
from somebody else in your tribe it's much more like
your family like in your family think about it when
your mom or your dad needs something from you they
don't you know they don't they don't call you and
arrange some formal get together where you pencil them in
you know they don't call your secretary and set up
an appointment and then you ask them for you know
you sen you send your mom a bill for seeing
you for doing some favor for her no it's like
she needs some favor don you do it and then
when you need something from her maybe she does it
and so everybody helps everybody out that's how a family
works well that's how a tribe works as well and
because the tribe is relatively small it might be 20
members 50 members 100 members even at 100 members this
is still a small enough number that you're able to
know everybody in the tribe by name and so there's
not that sense of alienation and anonymity which exists today
if you're living in a big city where you hardly
know anybody you probably don't even know your neighbors let
alone somebody across town yet in this tribe you knew
everybody you knew their business you know you know their
strengths and weaknesses you know their faults and problems there's
a lot of gossiping going on there's not much privacy
everybody sees everybody else everybody's knows and is in everybody's
business and the reason it is that way is because
it's like a team it's almost like a sports team
because we got to survive together we got to coordinate
we got to communicate we got to go on hunts
together we've got to organize our division of labor you
know who's going to be doing the hunting who's going
to be doing the gathering who's going to be doing
the laundry who's going to be doing the the cooking
who's going to be sewing the clothes and all these
sorts of things we've got to organize this people have
different roles and usually these roles are very fixed at
stage purple and cooperation becomes extremely necessary for us to
survive as it is for apes that's why chimpanzees live
in in groups because that's how they survive through cooperation
they're able to survive much easier than they would and
as just individuals walking around looking for scraps of food
to find as a tribe we can hunt together we
can share new inventions that we come up with and
we can develop a culture and all these things become
very powerful especially later on as we develop even further
so here's a list of values for stage purple now
values is the core of the stage values is really
what spiral dynamics is modeling in a sense so here's
the value set for purple purple values the tribe and
the clan and the community above all else family and
tribal bonds are deeply valued blood relationships are valued living
together and contribution to the tribe is extremely valuable and
important group activities and group celebration group hunts group ceremonies
group rituals many things are done as a group and
the meaning of life comes from being part of this
tribe and part of this group so you don't want
to let your group down you're trying to do what
you can to contribute and in a sense this adds
an extra layer to survival because if you were just
living by yourself in the forest life would be very
minimalistic and sparse there wouldn't be much you can do
you couldn't do a lot of group activities there wouldn't
be you know a dance you could do with somebody
else or a party you could go to or or
some celebration that you can do like all of those
you wouldn't have that extra layer of meaning it would
just be you and maybe your wife or your husband
and your kids and that's it it would be much
more limited so this gives a little extra spice to
life is that you know at the end of the
day once you've done all your survival activities you've hunted
you forged you cook your food then you can enjoy
yourselves you can you can do art you can do
dance you can do drumming and music and other things
like that which adds something extra to life beyond just
life as an animal this is probably the first layer
at which human life goes beyond just mere animal life
the way that like a wolf pack survives a wolf
pack i mean they just eat [ __ ] and
have sex and maybe they they they lay around maybe
they play a little bit with each other by biting
each other that's it that's all they do it's just
very simple and so humans were able to take it
to the next level through culture and through having a
larger community purple values honor purple values humility purple values
self-sacrifice purple is willing to sacrifice the individual for the
tribe in fact every individual sort of takes it as
their responsibility they don't do this begrudgingly they they are
willing they are happy to sacrifice themselves for the tribe
because they believe in the tribe this is not some
burden that's imposed by some dictator from from up above
this is this is like you being willing to sacrifice
for your own family if your mother or father was
sick would you be willing to sacrifice to work a
little bit harder for them to provide for them to
make sure they get better of course you would same
for the tribe there's an extreme importance placed upon respecting
one's elders ancestors and customs the customs of the tribe
and not only are there customs there's also taboos things
that you're not supposed to do there's a lot of
emphasis placed upon ritual and ceremony tradition there's a very
traditional way that this tribe your tribe does things there's
a traditional way that we go to hunt there's a
traditional way that we cook our food there's a traditional
way that we cure diseases which medicines we use there's
a traditional way that we dance and celebrate there's a
traditional way that we handle funerals and death of loved
ones and so everything is very traditional there's not a
lot of creativity you're not making stuff up there's not
a lot of room for innovation here you're just learning
the the rituals the customs and the taboos those things
you're not supposed to do and then you're obeying those
without question and then your sense of life's meaning comes
from that at stage purple purple values mother nature and
harmony purple values magical powers the spirit realm and spirit
deities purple values mystery and mystical intuition rites of passage
sacred objects and places traditional music and dance and dress
and oftentimes there's costumes and other sorts of artifacts like
maybe masks tattoos jewelry and other sorts of adornments that
that are traditional to your tribe purple values myth and
the sharing of stories because this is a pre-literate culture
these are cultures that existed before there were writing systems
so they had spoken language of course but mostly the
history of the tribe you know it wasn't written down
in a book because that didn't exist it was memorized
through stories and myths that were shared in past from
ancestor to ancestor and to ancestor and to make sure
those stories were kept intact and they weren't corrupted there
wasn't a lot of room for creativity and embellishment you
had to learn the stories that your ancestors told you
and then try to pass them down as face faithfully
as you could to uh to your children and then
to their grandchildren and so on so there's a lot
of emphasis placed upon that and the history of the
tribe because it is important for us to retain a
sort of a a track record of where did we
come from after all if our tribe didn't maintain a
shared history through a mythology and through sharing of stories
how would you even know where you came from you
see this actually plays a very important existential role in
one's psyche because today we have science modern science that
tells us that oh we came from you know a
sperm and an egg and through some genealogical record of
ancestors and so forth but this kind of science and
this sort of rational materialistic explanation didn't exist uh thousands
of years ago and there was no historical record you
couldn't go to google and just you know look up
different wars and events that happened throughout 5 000 years
of human history it was basically you had no idea
it was deeply mysterious life at this stage was deeply
mysterious because you didn't know how nature worked you didn't
know how the gods worked you didn't know about science
or evolution or any of these sorts of things so
it was really just you relying on your tribe's verbally
uh shared history to give you a sense of grounding
and a sense of identity of who you are and
where you came from and how you're supposed to behave
and your tribe has this collective memory and these rigid
rules and rituals because without these rules and rituals and
traditions you could easily do something that would kill you
you could eat the wrong plant eat the wrong mushroom
hunt the wrong animal and all of those things if
you do them the wrong way they could easily kill
you and survival here is very precarious because if you
eat the wrong plant and it poisons you there's not
a hospital you can go to there's not a 911
paramedic that you could call that will come and save
you there's no medicine that will save you so life
is very fragile and so that's why there's this emphasis
on tradition because the traditions have been time tested for
hundreds and thousands of years by your ancestors by your
early ancestors they were tested they figured this stuff out
through trial and error many of them died but they
figured it out and now you are relying upon those
to keep you alive so you follow them faithfully and
you respect the ancestors and the traditions so there's a
great value placed upon retaining ancestral and tribal memory because
your survival literally depends upon it it's not just it's
not just kind of like oh wishful thinking and a
nostalgia for our ancestors no your survival depends upon it
when you're living in the wilderness and there's no wikipedia
there's no google there's no encyclopedia there's no books how
do you know how to survive in the jungle if
we took you right now a modern human and we
put you in the jungle you'd be dead within a
week you see because you wouldn't know you wouldn't have
those traditions and rituals and shared ancestral memories and knowledge
and wisdom of how nature worked you would die you
wouldn't know how to find water you wouldn't know how
to find the right food and so on there's a
strong emphasis on the value of reciprocity sharing and cooperative
interdependence all of our lives depend upon one another so
we all have to cooperate share and reciprocate there's a
value of warding off evil spirits at this stage you
believe in evil spirits you also believe in good spirits
there's a value of cursing and hexing one's enemies there's
a value on psychic abilities and powers there's a value
on out of body travel astral realms there's a value
of respect for one's elders and for their wisdom and
experience there's a value of family relics and heirlooms religious
medals lucky charms wards shrines artifacts of that nature and
sacred words words have magical powers because words can hex
words can be prayers and blessings words can summon the
nature spirits and ancestors they can be used to communicate
with the spirit realm so words are not just something
you find in a dictionary words are sacred and magical
and powerful they are used in dances and rituals and
so on here are some more characteristics of stage purple
it's pre-industrial usually pre-agricultural and basically hunter-gatherer although of course
uh stage purple is also capable of being agricultural but
generally as humans became highly agricultural we settled down we
became less nomadic less hunter gather and then quickly we
moved up into spiral dynamics stage red and blue uh
so it was agricultural but maybe like farming on a
small scale not on on a massive scale we're talking
about small cohesive groups with very tight kinship bonds family
bonding is central and in a sense your tribe is
your whole family your extended family that's how you think
of the tribe so just think of currently what we
call the nuclear family in developed nations now you know
your mom your dad your siblings imagine that but just
expand it out to 50 people an entire tribe so
it's it's sort of like a very uh robust family
that you're a part of and you're treating others the
way that you would treat your mom your father or
your uh brother sister cousin grandmother grandfather that sort of
stuff there's a deep emotional bonding between members of the
tribe just like in a family there's a deep sense
of tribal history as we've talked about there's lots of
implicit unwritten rules to how this tribe works the tribe
over centuries of survival has developed certain rules for how
they hunt how they dance how they celebrate how they
talk to one another how they eat and and many
other things and so one of the challenges that westerners
face when they discover one of these new tribes and
these tribes they still exist there are tribes tribal stage
purple people who live in papua new guinea in africa
and south america in the middle east and elsewhere and
westerners sometimes western scientists and anthropologists they will go and
they will try to study these tribes one of the
challenges is that a lot of these tribes have their
own unique customs and implicit rules that aren't written anywhere
that you have to follow in order not to offend
them and in order to fit in and so one
of the challenges that they have to go there and
have to spend years real really going you know full
native as it's as they say and living in that
tribe and learning you know through trial and error learning
these implicit rules and then once they do then you
can fit into that tribe and then you can function
but these rules oftentimes they're not scientific they're not very
rational they're just sort of intuitive and their heuristics for
survival in that particular environment and of course it varies
from tribe to tribe because every tribe is living in
a unique environment in many cases these tribes have fixed
social roles there's the role of the chieftain of the
medicine man of the shaman of the hunter of the
warrior of the you know the the fertile young bride
who is sold to you know to some to some
man to have children and so everybody's playing their their
role there's a more communal way of raising children where
the child is not just being raised by the mother
and father but by the entire village by the entire
tribe and so that gives a little bit of a
different dynamic and in a sense it helps to socialize
the child more so than maybe even today because today
the child probably grows up just with the mother and
father for several years and then we send him off
to preschool or kindergarten uh but then the child doesn't
really know anybody in preschool in kindergarten it's all strangers
and foreigners and the child doesn't really know how to
deal with them it feels strange it doesn't feel as
intimate the bonds because you're moving between different preschools different
kindergartens you know as your parents move around they move
you around and so there's not that deep sense of
of communal connection that is developed and in a sense
that's a negative because that later produces sort of socially
crippled awkward humans which are not able to to work
well in teams so you know there's pros and cons
to that um there's a sense of communal property at
stage purple so it's not just my house basically my
house is part of the village and of course it
can be considered my house but in a certain sense
it's the entire village's house and we cooperate and collaborate
and we share our resources our food our property to
to maximize efficiency there's no strong sense of property rights
there's no strong sense of individual rights there's no sense
of profit motive where i'm trying to like set up
a a stall or a business and i try to
profit as much as i can from you the way
that we do today sharing is a necessity for survival
in this sort of environment and so this creates a
sort of a natural insurance policy the insurance policy is
that if i have a little surplus supply of food
i'll share it with you if you for example go
on a hunt and you're not able to find any
animals today or you're not able to fish you have
a bad fishing day hey you know i'll share some
of my surplus with you and your family you can
come to my house and eat my food and then
next week when i have a bad fishing day you'll
share some of your fish with me and in this
way we survive it's a natural insurance policy there's usually
a gender-based division of labor women do the cooking maybe
or they do the the sewing or they do the
gathering of the plants whereas the men go on the
hunt and they do the the defense you know they
manage defensive perimeter and other things like that there is
a emphasis on the protection of fertile women because of
course the woman plays the central role of reproducing the
tribe and usually in these sorts of tribal cultures women
have many many children over five children 10 children you
know like a lot of children because these children usually
don't survive probably half those children will die soon after
birth simply from lack of sanitation or diseases or lack
of food or whatever and so the woman has many
many children and only a few of them end up
surviving which is actually very similar to how many animals
breed they have many children only a few of them
survive to adulthood there's a prioritization of social bonding versus
business schedules so one of the challenges that westerners face
in dealing with stage purple societies and cultures and for
example don't think that stage purple is only literally limited
to tribes in the amazon which are totally isolated from
the west no you're going to encounter stage purple culture
for example in the middle east in india in the
philippines in indonesia in hawaii in many other parts of
the world in south america right even outside of the
deep deep deep amazon you're still going to find it
in cities you can still find it in villages and
rural areas so don't think that it's only confined to
super isolated tribes that would be just you know that
would be solid solid purple but you can get examples
of purple which is still part of modern society to
a certain degree and in in these cases as a
westerner you might for example go to india or you
might go to hawaii or you might go to indonesia
or wherever or to the middle east and you know
you try to run a business deal with these people
and it doesn't really work because you know you as
a sort of a western business person you want them
to show up on time and to do x amount
of labor at x amount of time this many hours
in a week and then get the job done you
know build the house by x date that's how we
westerners are sort of programmed to think but in these
purple cultures they don't have rigorous schedules if you know
if if the neighbors are throwing a party they're not
going to go do your business and build your house
they're going to go join the celebration of the party
because there's a marriage a wedding whatever some ceremony that's
happening they're going to go do that because social bonds
are prioritized over any kind of business productivity and so
usually these purple cultures they're not very productive materially because
that's not something they really value very much it's not
about how much money you can earn it's not about
working 14 hours a day to get ahead to you
know buy a better car buy a better house these
things don't exist really the most valuable thing when you're
living in this kind of tribal simple culture because there's
not a lot of material goods you're not going to
buy a latest video game or you're not going to
go you know go to the strip club there's not
much to do other than social bonding that's probably the
most valuable thing in your life at this stage rather
than any kind of material objects so one of the
challenges with stage purple is that it's so deeply tribal
that there's an intense in-group out group dynamic us versus
them which leads to tribal warfare blood feuds potentially ethnic
cleansing and racial violence because even though there's a very
deep social and emotional bond between this little tribe which
is seen as your own personal family what happens when
another tribe interacts and intersects with your tribe they're going
to be seen as foreigners because they have different traditions
different values different culture different ancestry different myths different stories
how are you going to make those two mesh together
this creates a very serious problem which ultimately will lead
to the necessity of higher stages of the spiral because
while stage purple seems to work well as a little
group it does work well but what happens is these
little groups they don't just stay little groups they grow
they balloon they take up more resources more of the
environment and there's more of these groups they start popping
up everywhere on the planet and then pretty soon they
start to interact with one another and then of course
that's when you get tribal conflict especially because every group
is so beholden to its own traditions it's very very
inflexible so therefore what happens is that you know one
group is rigid about its traditions as is the other
group and then they they're they're both closed minded they're
both rigid they're both traditional but the traditions they clash
so the two groups will clash because they can't understand
each other's traditions they can't see the relativity of each
other traditions that comes much further up the spiral these
uh purple cultures tend to have a natural attitude towards
sex sex is not seen as bad or dirty it's
not repressed the way that it is at stage blue
so that's why you see women who are half naked
or even fully naked in these national geographic documentaries in
these tribes people just very comfortable with their sexuality the
repression of sexuality comes at stage blue with the advent
of orthodox religion and the sort of discipline that comes
there and the sort of sense of morality which tends
to want to repress sex so this is prior to
that most of the labor that is done in these
cultures tends to be manual labor arranged marriages are very
common the selling of daughters is very common women young
women usually when they're only 12 years old or 15
years old are sold off by the father and the
mother to the highest bidder who can pay a high
dowry for for the woman the more beautiful the woman
the more reproductive value the woman has uh the the
higher the dalary dowry will be and she doesn't have
any choice about this so it's both a good thing
and a bad thing depending on how you look at
it these cultures tend to have a preference for boys
over girls because survival is difficult and when survival is
difficult the boys tend to be physically stronger and a
little bit better at survival than the girls and because
of this that's why the girls are sold off often
times and uh demand a dowry because that dowry is
sort of the the the extra payment that the parents
get for nurturing and raising this girl because she was
weaker than the boy but to compensate because she has
reproductive value then she gets payment from the boys who
grew up who are going to marry the girls that's
how it tends to work nepotism tends to be a
strong characteristic of purple because it's so family oriented if
you get a stage purple group of people trying to
form a business or a government what's going to start
to happen is they're going to naturally start to put
their own family members even when they're not qualified into
positions of power because blood bonds are more important than
competence many times in these cultures and that can create
a problem these cultures tend to be polygamous they tend
to have naturally emerging leaders based on seniority and experience
so the chieftain in one of these tribes will tend
to be old very experienced survived many ballot battles went
on many hunts has a lot of wisdom and you
can see how valuable that is because you know in
our modern culture we can go to some university professor
at harvard and they are sort of like our repository
of wisdom or we can go to google and we
can go to wikipedia we can get you know information
that is contained in books and from other humans who
have lived a hundred years ago you know we can
pick up a book by einstein we can pick up
a book by isaac newton you know these sort of
towering intellectual figures who are our wise men today but
you don't have that in a pre-literate society so literally
it's it's the most experienced person who's still alive and
so there's a lot of value placed upon the elderly
in these cultures which is less true today in our
developed societies where we tend to discount the elderly as
you know feeble and not young and useless and we
locked them in nursing homes that's not the case here
the chieftain is interesting the chieftain is not a dictator
you might think the chieftain is a stage red authoritarian
mafia figure no that's not how it works at stage
purple the chieftain is not an absolute ruler he's there
to selflessly serve the tribe he's very experienced he's usually
competent and wise and he facilitates and guides provides wisdom
to the tribe he's not in it for personal gain
to you know to build his own personal mafia and
to get the gain the most wealth and to you
know suck everybody dry who's underneath him it's not a
a very authoritative hierarchical structure it's not a pyramid structure
it's it's a loose uh it's a loose distributed sort
of uh hierarchy and um the the chief is going
to be on a close emotionally bonded basis with with
all of the other people that he's dealing with so
it's not going to be a a case where he
has a bunch of lieutenants and a bunch of layers
where he doesn't even know who's in the bottom of
the hierarchy the chief will will be intimately connected with
with all of his uh all of his sort of
followers we might say there's a very strong emphasis placed
upon individuals being willing to sacrifice for the tribe sacrifice
itself for the tribe because competitive individualists put the tribe
in danger if you're part of this tribe and you
just want to do your own thing that's not going
to work you need to be a team player see
because if you're off doing your own thing that could
put everybody else at risk at stage purple there's a
a serious concern with natural phenomenon stars the sun water
rain lightning seasons plants earthquakes sky fire earth mountains because
this is the environment you live in all these things
are life and death for you are important you just
study the stars you need to know when the sun
is rising and setting because that tells you when to
plant the crops you need to be able to predict
the rain and tell where the lightning is and what
it means and understand the sky and the mountains because
you're navigating these mountains and you need to know where
to go hunt and so forth there's a worship and
reverence of nature spirits so oftentimes there's the sun spirit
the water spirit the rain spirit the plant spirit the
mountain spirit the sky spirit the fire spirit this is
that animistic sense of spirituality there tends to be a
magical sense of cause and effect things are not seen
in a mechanistic materialistic framework reality is not there to
be quantified and formalized with mathematical equations there is no
formal science yet at this stage so there's a mystical
sense of cause and effect for example the shaman might
do a rain dance and then that is believed to
cause the rain to come and to water the crops
or if for example as a tribe we dishonored our
ancestors for some reason then that might mean that the
crop season next year will be bad there will be
famine or disease will come and because there's not enough
scientific basis of understanding of cause and effect stage purple
can get away with the sort of magical thinking because
there's just not that scientific basis and evidence and there's
we're not doing double-blind placebo-controlled studies here on how diseases
work we don't know where diseases come from at this
stage we don't even know for example where lightning comes
from we don't really know how to explain it we
don't know where earthquakes come from other than from the
you know angry earth spirits we don't really understand what
fire is what is fire it's you know the fire
spirit we don't know that fire comes from some sort
of chemical reaction we don't know what chemicals are we
don't know what atoms or molecules are we don't know
what electricity is we don't know even what weather is
we don't even really know what the earth is like
all this stuff is deeply mysterious and unknown so it
seems magical and we can start to draw causes and
effects which are superstitious or fallacious and so superstition tends
to run rampant in purple cultures and that's why they
have various kinds of traditions and taboos if you break
the taboo then superstition says that you know you see
a black cat and then that means that something bad
will happen or you know you break a mirror and
now you violated some spiritual law and then because of
this something else will happen to you and so on
stage purple tends to be more right-brained than left-brained it
tends to be more intuitive and feeling oriented body-oriented heart-centered
rather than logical rational scientific emotional attachment is placed on
places and things and people and these become important and
the reason it works this way is because you're using
your intuition basically at this stage to navigate through life
and through reality because there's not a writing system you
can't carefully document and codify and formalize everything there's not
mathematics and science and you know strict logical axioms and
syllogisms that you do in order to understand the world
you're operating on gut instinct and you'd be surprised how
far you can get with that and in fact stage
purple people who are very experienced like shaman and medicine
men and wise men basically they can be very keen
with their senses they can be extremely perceptive because they
live like for example been living in their junk in
the jungle for for 50 years going on hunts and
doing whatever they do and they've become very very attuned
to how to track animals how to see you know
footprints in the in the leaves how to how to
look at weather patterns predict when lightning is going to
come when rain is going to come they can they
can learn to hear different you know sounds of birds
and based on the sound of the bird they hear
they can tell whether it's the springtime or the fall
or something's going to happen you know because they become
very very sensitive through intuition and through feeling and this
allows them to survive much better than logic all the
logic in the world is not going to help you
to survive if we throw you into the middle of
the amazon you need keen perception subtle distinctions between all
the different natural phenomena that exist there which comes with
massive experience and uh and then that that stuff is
better handled by intuition than by the logical mind the
logical mind is more about analyzing and categorizing things which
is good for science for scientific purposes it's good if
you're writing a book it's good if you're a university
professor but it's not so good when it's a matter
of survival in the jungle stage purple tends to blur
the lines between reality and imagination there's not such a
clear distinction which is where this animistic spirituality comes from
stage purple tends to confuse fables with scientific facts these
are not distinguished carefully good and evil spirits must be
kept in balance and there's usually a multiplicity of spirits
so stage purple is not monotheistic but polytheistic there is
a sort of a a marketplace of different spirits that
you have to appease and work with and it it
it creates for sort of a rich and interesting mythology
and mysticism because you're not just praying to one god
there's all sorts of interesting conflicting different spirits and usually
they have they have good ones they have bad ones
they have petty ones that have their own you know
sort of mischievous characters and then you you can you
can find these sorts of figures all throughout mythology nature
and objects tend to have a life force and intentionality
of their own this is that notion of animistic spirituality
trees have spirits in fact that particular tree might have
a particular spirit because that's like an ancient oak tree
that our ancestors worshipped and it has a particular spirit
has a particular name which is different from that other
tree over there who our enemies worship that's the evil
tree over there it has an evil spirit and an
evil name whereas ours is good the stars they watch
over us at night the rivers they give us life
and they feed our crops and if we anger the
river the the river will stop flowing and our crops
will die or the river will overflow and it will
flood our crops and then we will starve so we
must appease the the river by giving it you know
uh sacrifices by praying to it by performing rituals and
and ceremonies for the river making sacrifices to it the
mountains are inhabited it's this sort of animistic spirituality ordinary
events are often seen as having mystical signs if a
bird flies over the head it's not just a bird
it's a crow and a crow means that our enemies
are coming because the bird was flooded the crow was
flying from east to west our enemies are in the
we are are in the east so that's what that
means and uh and so on this this there's a
lot of these sorts of mystical signs that purple reads
into reality of course a lot of this is projection
of the mind but purple doesn't recognize that it's a
pre-literature culture but it's rich in folk stories songs drawings
dances artwork crafts and elaborate customs so they compensate for
their lack of writing with these other forms of art
and culture which can get very sophisticated and uh and
beautiful and worth admiring and in fact that's a lot
of what anthropology does is it travels the world collects
the stories and songs and drawings and artwork and dances
and writings and not writings but uh like artifacts is
the word i was looking for the artifacts of these
various cultures and then we can put those in museums
we can marvel at them some of them are beautiful
some of them are are weird and foreign or hideous
and just strange it tends to have vivid myths legends
and parables spirits are seen everywhere this is where the
notion of sprites and pixies and elves and gnomes and
trolls and magical creatures comes from and basically every culture
european culture russian culture chinese culture japanese culture polynesian culture
all these cultures have their own sort of if you
if you go into their folk stories it has stories
of mystical creatures uh who are often mischievous tricksters uh
have agendas of their own have uh personalities of their
own who people are sort of forced to deal with
to reckon with to appease or to fight and battle
against this is a very common theme totems charms curses
and hexes witchcraft and shamanism sorcery white magic black magic
fertility symbols omens spells sacred herbs and plant medicine all
of this is characteristic of purple purple tends to have
not a linear but a cyclical sense of time because
their time very much is connected to the the movement
of of the uh of the sun and uh the
stars the seasons and the the zodiac signs so all
of that tends to be very cyclical rather than linear
they don't understand evolution the way that we do in
the west in modern culture and of course this sort
of purple animistic spirituality as you should see is the
early origin points of all the major religions of christianity
islam of uh of buddhism even and of judaism and
every every major religion today it all originated from these
polytheistic animistic spiritual mystical traditions which then later got systematized
and became very orthodox and then many of the many
of the sort of black magic elements and so forth
were stripped from them the mysticism was stripped out of
them and then it just became this monolithic monotheistic religion
and you can see especially in christianity for example how
almost all of christianity as orthodox christians consider it today
has been stolen from pagan earlier pagan cultures perhaps the
most obvious example is the birth the birthday of jesus
jesus is born on the 25th which corresponds with the
winter solstice which was an important point in the in
the whole solar cycle for for these hundred gatherer tribes
because you know when you're farming the land you need
to know when winter is coming and when winter is
gonna end that point the 25th of december is basically
sort of the the peak of winter after that it
starts to go uh towards spring and then based on
that you know that's sort of the the life and
birth cycle of every season of the crops and so
your survival was completely tied to that so you have
this sort of cyclical sense of time uh yeah so
so many of the traditions and customs that are part
of christianity or islam today or part of judaism this
this was all actually coming from uh stage purple for
example the the injunction not to eat pork was something
that would come or you know shellfish that exists within
judaism and exist within islam today where did this come
from came from purple pagan customs and traditions because that
was just part of how they survived back then there
were certain foods you're not supposed to eat because they
could they could rot faster they could cause diseases that
can't be cured and so forth so a lot of
these got carried over many of these purple cultures are
seen today to be sort of peaceful and easy going
and the reason that is is because when you're living
in an isolated tribe somewhere in the middle of the
amazon yeah life is easy in the sense that there's
not a lot of competition you're secluded your only competition
is just with the animals that you're trying to hunt
basically and maybe one or two nearby tribes and you're
not competing very much with people in your own tribe
because it's a low scale system with only 50 or
100 members all of you are like one family so
there's no there's no sense to compete and you guys
have a low impact on the environment due to your
small scale the problem is that we though we tend
to romanticize this and we say oh well that that
was the good life back then that's the kind of
life we need to return to today and this is
extremely naive because that kind of life is only peaceful
and it only works when we're talking about 50 or
100 people it doesn't work when you scale it up
to a million or to a hundred million or to
a billion people a billion chinese can't live that way
today 350 million americans can't live that way today we
have nuclear weapons we have jumbo jet airplanes we have
tanks and missiles and rocket launchers and grenades and flame
flamethrowers and automobiles and trains and cars and god knows
what else we have all of this complex stuff that
can't work at that kind of low scale and because
we've got millions and billions of people of course now
the environmental impact is major so although it might seem
like well these ancient or ancient ancestors they were so
environmentally friendly they were so environmentally conscious well in a
sense they were because they were living so close to
nature they had to be it was part of their
survival today we're more disconnected we're living in giant cities
in concrete jungles so we are more disconnected in that
sense but also in a certain sense they don't overestimate
how environmentally conscious they really were because they didn't need
to be very environmentally conscious because they were just so
small in scale relative to the environment they lived in
that they simply couldn't pollute it all they didn't really
need to worry about their pollution and their coal fire
power plants and you know dumping toxic chemicals in the
river because they didn't have these things so actually true
environmental consciousness only evolves at the high level of stage
green if true environmental consciousness existed at purple that means
it would also exist at red and at blue and
at orange but it doesn't see so that means it
didn't really exist there to begin with it existed in
a sort of primitive level but it didn't exist in
the in the true sort of uh deeper systemic understanding
of how our actions create all sorts of collateral damage
to the environment with modern technology so it's easy to
be environmentally friendly when you don't have any advanced technology
like advanced chemicals and plastics and oil refineries and and
you know uranium extraction so forth then it's easy to
be environmentally friendly because all you're using is wood and
plants and all this stuff is biodegradable so of course
yeah it's easy uh but the trick is to develop
an environmental environmental consciousness once we do have all that
advanced technology and that requires getting to stage green and
beyond at stage purple culture is taken completely for granted
and these people are unconscious about their culture they don't
even have the notion of a culture because the culture
that they are living in is their way of life
it is their reality it's not culture it's reality for
them and it takes many stages to to get to
a point where you start to see culture as something
that's socially constructed and something that could be otherwise something
that we could change stage purple has no idea that
culture is something that we can consciously manipulate and that
culture can be counterproductive culture can be destructive culture can
be a form of brainwashing sage purple doesn't understand any
of this because its culture was something that was created
unconsciously as part of its survival activity for hundreds of
years by its ancestors and there was no reflection there's
no reflection of stage turquoise stage purple about its culture
there's no sort of sitting sitting down and wondering like
well is it is it proper is it rational that
we perform this rain dance every time we need rain
for our crops is that rational is that scientific there's
no there's no self-reflection like that there's no sense of
wandering but what is the cause and effect relationship between
my rain dance how does my rain dance cause the
rain to fall and to grow the crops no we
don't think of it that way at stage purple and
we also don't think of alternatives so we might say
that well in our tribe we perform the rain dance
this way and in that tribe they perform the rain
ants the opposite way well maybe maybe their way is
better than our way no our way is the only
way it's the right way their way is the evil
way we don't understand their way we only understand our
way because our way came from our ancestors and we
value our ancestors we don't value their ancestors see so
now we start to get into some of the challenges
of stage purple is that it doesn't really handle diversity
and alternative world views and alternative belief systems and alternative
cultures and and rituals and ways of doing things very
well and this quickly becomes a problem once the isolated
bubble of this tribe is punctured and we start to
interact with other tribes once we get more trade once
we get conflict with our tribes this this creates a
problem because now we're exposed to new perspectives and new
world views but we're so traditional and so closed minded
and so rigid in our ways of doing things that
we don't know how to deal with it and we
tend to deal with it quite poorly which leads to
conflict and battle and death and an inability to adapt
so there's an attachment to rigid traditional ways of living
and it's difficult for stage purple to imagine other alternatives
for living or other ways that you could look at
the world it tends to be very limited blindered paradigm-locked
world view and there's an inability to adapt to changing
life conditions that's probably the ultimate downfall of stage purple
it's because they're so rigid their world view is so
limited and narrow that as soon as their environment changes
if it ever does and it hasn't for hundreds and
thousands of years probably those those tribes that were living
in the amazon that are still living in the amazon
today they've been living there for a thousand for like
10 000 years and their environment has not changed but
the problem is that today the environment is changing today
the climate is changing the rainforests are being burned down
there's a there's new types of food and crops there's
new diseases there's new technology there's jumbo jet airplanes flying
overhead imagine living in a tribe in the middle of
the amazon rainforest and then you see a jumbo jet
airplane flying overhead as you're going on your hunt how
do you make sense of it what is that is
that an evil spirit is that god is that are
those aliens what what do you do about it first
of all it's frightening because you don't have any control
over it you also don't understand what the hell it
is but then also it's not just frightening in the
sense that oh you're paranoid and it's just sort of
unknown what it is but it can be frightening like
literally that airplane could fly over you and you know
dust some chemicals on you and those chemicals could be
toxic could kill your whole tribe so it's not a
sustainable way to live because the rest of the world
is evolving very rapidly modernizing with technology and so forth
and if you don't keep up with that you can't
just keep living in your isolated bubble forever and that
ends up sort of being the downfall of purple all
right now we're at my favorite part which is the
list of examples here are all the purple examples that
i came up with and i came up with some
of them some of them i grabbed from the sprout
dynamics book so here it is carlos castaneda's don juan
and all of the carlos castaneda books these are brilliant
books amazing books filled with a lot of ancient wisdom
go read these books if you haven't there's like 10
of them or more uh so if you have read
the the don juan carlos castaneda books and you've sort
of marveled at the wisdom there and you've also marveled
at the sort of world view that don juan has
don juan has this very animistic worldview where again he's
reading signs he you know a crow flies over over
his head and he's in attributing all sorts of mystical
things to that crow and you start to wonder like
how could he believe these things well because he's from
stage purple in a certain sense he's kind of naive
you get that but in a certain sense he's very
wise so yeah it's both at the same time it's
primitive and naive but also there is deep mystical wisdom
there to be found in these cultures and uh and
that's actually a lot of what stage green is doing
today stage green is sort of looking back because it's
reacting against the materialism stage or just kind of looking
backwards at our ancestors and and wondering well when when
did we live in harmony with nature that's sort of
like what the hippies are doing they're looking back and
they're saying ah yeah we need to go back to
our ancient roots to our tribal sort of uh communal
way of living and draw inspiration from that and so
therefore there's a there's a reevaluation of the value of
shamanism and psychedelics and plant medicines and organic farming and
agriculture sustainable agriculture and and drum circles and all this
sorts of hippie stuff and uh and that's that's sort
of where the carlos castaneda books fit in historically they
they arose after the 1960s counter culture revolution they became
extremely popular sold millions of copies because after the 1960s
psychedelic revolution people were looking for that sort of tribal
wisdom which the carlos cassida books fed very well and
they sold extremely well other examples the amazon tribes african
tribes indonesian tribes the tribes of papua new guinea the
native americans of course all the various tribes the comanches
and the lakota and the god there's so many of
them the apache and yeah dozens of them many tribes
still exist in the middle east in the rural parts
of the middle east especially in places like afghanistan um
in saudi arabia in iraq syria uh uzbekistan and so
forth a lot of tribal cultures there still in bosnia
in africa the zulu the boiti hawaiian culture the original
hawaiian culture is very much purple with the hawaiian chiefs
the kahunas and various kinds of hawaiian ceremonies and so
forth they tend to be a very kind of traditional
tribal um even yeah those lays that they put up
on you when you arrive in hawaii with the flower
garlands and uh all the the the ceremonies they have
the ceremony ceremonial food and cookouts and so forth and
lua luau's luaus is that what they're called anyways yeah
so hawaii uh indian culture there's a lot of tribal
stage purple stuff going on in india still today uh
a lot of indian spirituality is very tribalistic there's like
a hundred different languages spoken throughout india every tribe has
their own little language which sort of shows you the
limitations of stage purple because see one of the problems
in india is that they can't even get their [
__ ] together where they can just speak one common
language i mean they speak english because the british sort
of forced it upon them but if the british didn't
come and force english upon them like the indians they
don't all speak hindi they have like different dialects and
sub-dialects and all these different subcultures all throughout india and
so they're very fragmented see for india to be able
to rise to sort of a modern level to become
a first world country first one of the things it
has to do is it has to pick like one
language that everybody has taught at school and it has
to get rid of all the other languages but of
course every tribe is going to complain about that because
everybody wants their one language to be the best one
and they don't want to get rid of their traditional
culture which is based in their language and so forth
and so uh see they're they're not well unified and
the problem with having 100 different languages is that it
creates unnecessary friction and barriers for commerce for business for
culture and so forth you know if you're going to
create a movie what language is it going to be
and you can't create a movie in 100 different languages
has to be in one language so this slows them
down uh and they have all sorts of really weird
arcane spiritual traditions in india uh just and i mean
beyond just yoga and beyond the kind of basic stuff
that we understand as westerners here like there's a lot
of very weird spiritual [ __ ] going on in
india if you go there you probably spend a whole
lifetime exploring it all uh and a lot of it
will be based on herbal medicine and psychedelics or weird
like black magic witchcraft voodoo type of stuff they have
that going on there so very fascinating but also strange
and foreign arab culture also has some of that going
on the japanese shinto religion is a stage purple in
its origins it's uh it's actually separate and distinct from
buddhism so the japanese most japanese subscribe to buddhism but
also to japanese shinto and japanese shinto is very ritualistic
and it all revolves around the worship of kami k-a-m-i
kami which is sort of their word for god but
it's not this monolithic monotheistic god it's more like a
the spirit the life spirit that pervades all of all
of nature really similar to what is called the force
in star wars it's the sort of disembodied notion of
god which is actually true that's the most accurate form
of god that's what god is god is the force
god is kami if you really uh become conscious of
it it's also you but they don't understand that probably
um what else do we have tibet a lot of
tibetan spiritualities sage purple in rural china they have a
lot of stage purple spirituality still the aborigines in australia
super stage purple that's like the purple prototype also the
maori uh aborigines in uh in new zealand also sit
the same pocahontas shaman shaman is actually a term that
comes from siberia i believe the siberian shaman but now
we've adopted that term to refer to all sorts of
different cultures we talk about shaman in south america and
so on but originally it was the siberian shaman um
the medicine man in avatar the movie avatar james cameron's
avatar those blue cat-looking creatures the the navi they're a
great example of stage purple they're basically kind of a
ripoff of the native americans a legend of zelda is
a is a good video game example because in legend
of zelda the whole appeal of that game is it's
kind of set in this animistic spiritual mystical world which
basically is kind of like i assume where like shinto
japanese shinto religion came from so i think that legend
of zelda probably draws a lot upon the shinto tradition
with its shrines and various kinds of water and fire
spirits and so on so that's very much shinto stage
purple and it gives you that kind of vibe when
you're playing it's sort of this magical mysterious world with
artifacts and different races and different people a lot of
times the people are half animal half human that's also
very common sort of those egyptian gods like that patapon
one of my favorite games of all time if you
played it on the psp uh patapon is amazing it's
it's a it's a solid purple game it's all about
uh controlling this this group of little tribal guys who
go and fight war against other tribes and defeat defeat
creatures and it's a it's a rhythm game it's actually
quite challenging to play it but also very rewarding uh
turok the dinosaur hunter if you play that on the
n64 uh that's kind of a stage purple dances with
wolves with kevin costner that movie the medicine man the
movie with uh sean connery um gives you an ex
gives you sort of an intimate look at stage purple
he's sort of a white western guy living in the
middle of uh of the amazon rainforest with these natives
and he's looking for a cure for cancer it's a
great movie go check it out it's a 9 early
90s movie they don't make them that way anymore uh
the whole notion of sort of the noble savage uh
refers to stage purple various kinds of ancient mythologies if
you study mythology through the works of joseph campbell and
so on that's all about stage purple voodoo is purple
witchcraft tends to be purple curses and hexes animal sacrifice
tends to be purple the gift economy is a purple
idea this gift economy for example is is used in
in burning man and various kinds of burns that are
held around the world so if you participate in burns
or go to burning man a lot of the vibe
and values behind burning man it's spider-dynamic stage green but
also it borrows from stage purple as well the sharing
of resources paganism is purple those uh cannibal tribes that
we hear about i don't know if that's actually a
real thing or just a western stereotype but that would
be purple if it was real sun worship um animal
gods and spirits the idea that animals and have you
know a spirit of their own and a life force
of their own this is a very pagan sort of
idea which is kind of anti-stage blue christianity which doesn't
believe that animals have souls and basically at stage blue
humans tend to treat animals as just personal property which
is not the case at stage purple ethnic cleansing is
a purple sort of a force the paleolithic cave paintings
like you see at lascaux france and other places in
spain and elsewhere in europe stonehenge those large monuments that
are found around the world different kinds of stone circles
ubuntu ubuntu is not a piece of software ubuntu actually
means an african it means i don't know which which
part of africa it's from but it means i am
because we are ubuntu i am because we are that's
how it's literally translated so it's sort of like we
are all one tribe it's that idea suicide bombing is
actually also a stage purple sort of dynamic because and
that's one of the things we as westerners don't really
fathom very well is you know how could how could
people in the middle east involve themselves in suicide bombing
it seems uh it seems so irrational to kill yourself
but it's not irrational when you consider that many people
who engage in suicide bombing they are pulled from sort
of middle eastern very underdeveloped parts of the middle east
where it's still staged purple very tribal very clannish and
the culture there the value system there is that you
sacrifice for your tribe so if you see your tribe
is getting exterminated or treated unfairly then you will gladly
strap a bomb to your chest and ball yourself up
in the defense of your tribe so suicide bombing is
sort of a hijacking of that stage purple sacrifice self
for one's tribe value system hijacking it combining it with
sort of a toxic stage red as well and then
kind of weaponizing it uh same thing with uh kamikaze
pilots in world war ii that was also sort of
a very self-sacrificing force uh that was part of japanese
culture human sacrifice is stage purple eating one's enemies you
know that sort of uh i guess it's it's a
trope where you will defeat your enemy then cut out
his heart and then eat his beating heart that might
be purple chanting in drum music herbal medicine ayurveda from
india acupuncture energy from asia shrines totem poles ayahuasca ceremonies
peyote ceremonies salvia divinorum was used by mexican shaman for
their divining purposes in witchcraft mushroom magic mushrooms is also
used by mexicans by mexican shaman as part of their
ceremonies detura is also used that way iboga is used
by the bouiti african tribes in similar ways and as
a as a rite of passage for their young men
i don't know about the women but the men for
sure uh amadine muscaria mushrooms which were used by the
siberian original shaman sweat lodges vision quests tribal tattoos take
a look at the tattoos that the maori of new
zealand paint on if you've ever taken magic mushrooms and
you look at yourself in the mirror you will see
those sort of maori tap pattern tattoos uh on your
face and on your body it's it's quite cool uh
the notion of the evil eye magical healers ancient burial
grounds knocking on wood that old um superstition the lucky
rabbit's foot black cats prayer altars the day of the
dead halloween urban legends fertility goddesses astrology fortune cookies now
of course i'm not saying that fortune cookies existed 5000
years ago i'm just saying that fortune cookies are sort
of any a holdover that's the sort of superstitious holdover
that we we keep today and in asian cultures you
find this uh because there's a lot of purple still
in asian cultures uh for example in in japan you
will find the uh you know that cat that you
see at japanese restaurants it's called actually the maneki neko
it's this golden cat with this paw and the paw
usually kind of moves back and forth like this is
sort of like a good luck charm similar to a
lucky rabbit's foot this is this is popular and in
asia all throughout asia they have all sorts of little
statues and lucky charms and stuff like that which kind
of comes from this from this purple tradition that's also
i think where the fortune cookies come from originally something
like that um [Music] don't think that purple stuff needs
to have an origin all the way back thousands of
years ago purple stuff still gets sort of like invented
and reinvented today so like the maneki neko i don't
think that's something that goes back thousands of years it's
probably only 100 years old or something or 200 years
old but it's still purple folk tales and fairy tales
are great examples of purple graffiti gypsies face paint symbolic
costumes and ceremonial dress secret handshakes mating ceremonies i remember
reading about the most astounding and odd mating ceremony from
the philippines i don't i don't know if they still
do this today but supposedly they did this so in
the philippines like a couple hundred years ago or even
further back they had this mating and marriage ceremony where
basically the male would have his penis pierced with some
sort of like almost like a bone like a sharp
bone or something it went perpendicular into the penis like
this don't ask me why they i didn't do it
so they stick this sort of bone or toothpick through
the penis and it stays there then the way that
it works is that he gets married and then you
know they have the honeymoon he has a honeymoon with
his wife and they they like i think they might
even tie a rope around the penis around the uh
around this bone through the penis then they they sort
of they move the bone like this so that you
can insert it into the vagina they insert it into
vagina then the bone sort of goes horizontal like this
and it gets stuck in there literally lodged in there
and they're supposed to mate for like 24 hours straight
and they can't pull it out because it's too painful
it gets stuck in there and so they're supposed to
do this very slow it's not a fast pumping mating
the way that we have sex in in western culture
it's this very slow methodical like joining together it's just
kind of like this spiritual ritual marriage mating thing that
they did in the philippines and i don't know exactly
how they got it out afterwards somehow they did but
so this this is what they did uh so so
stuff like this uh circumcision i imagine originally also came
from this sort of stage purple mating ceremony thing dowries
blood oaths communal eating missionaries going to tribes now of
course missionaries are stage blue but when missionaries go to
tribes that interact with tribal cultures and try to convert
them they're converting the stage purple heathens burial rituals burial
grounds also small company work environments so if you're doing
a little startup and you're just starting a little team
of 10 people working together in in a in a
garage somewhere that's going to have even though it's a
modern invention it's not something from thousands of years ago
it's going to have that sort of tribal communal stage
purple dynamic to it it's going to feel like a
like an extended family you're going to know everybody and
you're going to work that way the notion of the
sacred tree of life the circle of life from the
lion king very stage purple don miguel ruiz and his
popular books the four agreements and others that he's written
a lot of that wisdom is sort of ancient old
mech mexican shaman type of wisdom the book the alchemist
has a very stage purpley type of vibe to it
and i shot an episode called aztec non-duality where i
talk about toyota and the nawa uh notion of spirituality
and how it's very non-dual if you like that episode
i mean i pulled that from a from a sort
of a purple source which is the sort of nawa
notions of spirituality in toyota so you can see that
that episode shows you that there's a lot of profound
effective and practical wisdom to be found within these purple
mystical spiritual traditions it's not just all [ __ ]
and fairy tales and magical thinking there's some serious deep
profound spiritual wisdom there so it's correct that when you
get to stage green spelling stage green you will look
back at purple and you will reappreciate what's there you
will go and mine for it and from that you
can get stuff like neo-shamanism the resurgence of psychedelics you
know new discoveries of old spiritual texts and scriptures and
you can find meaning and value from those um i
think yeah i think that episode that i did of
aspect aztec non-duality go watch it it's one of my
best episodes i mean it's got some really powerful spiritual
insight in it and i was amazed when i found
that that material and that information because i thought that
you know nonduality was this modern advanced you know thing
and then it's amazing to look back and to say
and to see that like no our ancestors from thousands
of years ago had it all already figured out you
just got to go and look so those are some
examples here are some sayings that exemplify stage purple all
for one and one for all don't say it or
it might come true you'll jinx us blood is thicker
than water this is how we do things around here
there's no place like home we must honor our ancestors
that would upset the spirits if we did that so
we can't do that we are all part of mother
nature or the great spirit now what triggers stage purple
not showing respect to tradition elders ancestors and spirits that's
a huge no no that'll probably get you killed lack
of bonding and reciprocity not being a team player trying
to do your own thing or acting like some libertarian
individual this will quickly trigger them because this is extremely
selfish it's rude uh because it it puts the entire
tribe in jeopardy arrogance ambition selfishness and greed purple is
very sensitive to this the sort of arrogance you might
get if you get like a wall street ceo or
wall street trader who maybe goes on some ayahuasca retreat
in the amazon in brazil or in peru or someplace
and you know he walks in there he's all arrogant
he thinks he understands the world and he he doesn't
take all the ceremony seriously he doesn't take their their
sort of mystical visions and shamanism seriously he thinks it's
just all a joke that kind of attitude of arrogance
and and you know he's just throwing money around he
thinks he can just like bribe the shaman because he's
got a bunch of money but the shaman can't be
bribed because hashana is not interested in money the shaman's
interested in spiritual wisdom but the the wall street guy
you know he's stage orange that doesn't compute for him
and likewise you know the shaman will get offended if
you try to bribe him with money you know you
might want to pay some extra money to get a
nicer room a nicer ceremony for yourself the shaman doesn't
you don't want this the shaman wants to keep things
traditional the shaman wants to do it the way it's
been done for thousands of years another thing that triggers
purple is innovation new ideas progress and changing things purple
wants to keep doing things the way the ancestors have
always done them he's not interested in evolution and innovation
and of course this ends up being his downfall because
culture is evolving society's evolving technology is evolving so you
can't just not innovate you can't just keep doing the
same old [ __ ] all the time but purple
is stuck on that what else might trigger purple is
other cultures and other tribes who have different customs and
different ways of doing things in different world views which
conflict with his own he can't wrap his mind around
them he can't understand them it's confusing and it might
threaten their existing ways of doing things they might see
it as corruption you know maybe there's a better way
to do the ayahuasca ceremony maybe like for example i
might go to an ayahuasca ceremony in peru and i
might try to show them something like five and meow
dmt and it's pure synthetic form but the shaman will
say oh no no that's not the traditional way that's
not good that's inferior but is it really inferior maybe
it's actually superior maybe it's superior to actually get a
vape pen with pure freebase dmt rather than trying to
get it from some ayahuasca vine it's gonna be better
it's gonna be more potent i can guarantee you synthetic
psychedelics are mo more potent and better and more spiritual
than anything you can get from some ayahuasca vine or
from some magic mushroom that grows in the forest it's
going to be better i've tried both it's the synthetic
is better but a lot of these shaman type people
they don't want to listen to that because they don't
want something new they don't want something better they want
the old way of doing it um another thing that
could trigger purple is domination exploitation profit motive strict schedules
and strict productivity this desire just for materialism to produce
as much as possible to work as hard as possible
the sort of workaholic attitude that we have in the
west this will probably upset them very much because it's
dehumanizing it breaks human bonds for the sake of what
some material productivity that doesn't mean much to purple they'd
rather have their bonds now what are some downsides and
unhealthy aspects of purple well of course tribalism is probably
the biggest one when people are deeply tribal this ultimately
will devolve into tribal warfare blood feuds ethnic cleansing and
genocide in the worst case scenarios and we see this
around the world uh it also has the downside of
being extremely isolated and tends to be fearful of outsiders
like i said it tends to have a narrow world
view which limits its ability to adapt which is a
huge downside maybe this is the biggest downside of purple
is that it simply isn't able to adapt like many
of the native americans when the westerners came over here
to america uh many of the native americans died out
because they weren't able to adapt they weren't willing to
modernize they weren't willing to adopt the technology and the
advances of western culture and so they got pushed off
onto reservations and now they live miserable lives on these
reservations and in a sense i mean of course it
was a genocide by white europeans against the natives so
of course the white europeans are to blame in a
sense for that but also in another sense they're not
to blame because the nature of life is constant evolution
everything is evolving everything is advancing you can't put technology
back in the bottle you have to work with the
new technology that is available and you have to be
able to integrate multiple cultures because the globe is one
interconnected system we can't have little bubbles of societies and
cultures living completely isolated from each other because they're afraid
of each other and because they don't want to integrate
what the others have developed that's just not going to
work so really what the native americans should have done
is they should have integrated with the west with the
westerners then they would have been more successful uh but
if they just insist on being traditional and live you
know living by their old customs well those old customs
are not going to be able to survive against the
industrialized modern western technological machine that is society with its
giant populations and its cars and planes and trains and
all of this stuff it's just not going to survive
and many of those you know native americans who are
still living on these reservations uh they have it really
bad because they don't have a sense of purpose anymore
uh their their their natural habitat habitat they've been relocated
from those or it's been destroyed and many of them
are now just alcoholics they're out of work high crime
rates in these reservation communities they don't have a sense
of purpose they don't have a sense of community don't
have a sense of connection so um really they need
to be reintegrated into the west but a lot of
them don't want to so they sort of are damned
if they do and damned if they don't that's exactly
what happens when you sort of stay a dinosaur and
you don't evolve other excesses of purple is that it
tends to be overly traditional and conservative sort of ties
into what i just said it tends to be overly
superstitious too much magical thinking versus rational thinking there is
value to mysticism but there's also value to being rational
and practical and material at times sometimes you just need
to have simple rational material plans and goals and you
got to be pragmatic sometimes another downside of purple is
it can be fearful of natural phenomenon it can overly
mystify natural phenomenon treated as though it's not understandable through
science which a lot of it is and it can
be too slow to adapt technology or can resist technology
or reject technology which is a shame and and i
see that even within the spiritual community for example you
know i talk about awakening and enlightenment and then when
i bring up psychedelics as a new technology that has
been invented in the last 60 or 70 years you
know psychedelics are very new in the sense of you
know modern chemical synthetic psychedelics that's very new the ability
to extract find new molecules and then to to use
the exact molecules that are the best for each type
of you know work that you're trying to do whether
it's trying to access god or trying to heal some
childhood trauma wound or whatever or work on your relationships
or whatever you know there's different molecules that are good
for different things but when i talk about it like
this people who are like into the old school awakening
they criticize me by saying that oh leo but this
is a drug and it's not real awakening because it's
a drug well that that's what i mean by this
sort of rejection of technology you're not actually thinking for
yourself of the potential that this technology can can offer
us why do we need to resist technology if it's
able to produce enlightenment in 15 minutes why not make
use of that technology why meditate for 10 years when
you can do it faster now of course i'm not
saying there's no value to meditation but those people who
completely reject psychedelics like a lot of yogis will reject
psychedelics but it's clear to me that they've never even
tried it or if they have they tried some inferior
psychedelic and so they're they're judging all psychedelics based on
one you know bad tab of lsd that they took
or something and so uh they're not fully appreciating the
power of this technology and how it could transform the
world see they just want to be you know strict
yogis they have a particular yogic system and yoga is
of course comes from stage purple originally and there's all
these different yogic systems there's hundreds of different yoga systems
they all have their own dogmas their own rituals their
own ways of doing yoga each one says that they're
the best and that they're the only correct method of
doing yoga but of course that can't possibly be true
because there's lots of yogis who've used lots of these
different systems to become awake and yet none of them
are communicating with each other none of them are integrating
each other and so this is part of the problem
of purple purple can be very gossipy uh another problem
of purple is that it only tends to work at
small scales when you get into the millions of people
purple doesn't work it breaks down and ultimately it's just
not innovative enough it's not creative enough it's not progressive
enough and it's not adaptable enough to work in the
modern world and that's why purple is quickly dying off
but also there's a lot of valuable stuff there that
we need to mine before it all dies off so
that's that here's some statistics on purple about 10 percent
of the adult global population we could put at staged
purple but it only has about one percent of the
world influence so very little influence on the world simply
because it's so outdated so archaic and so out of
touch with modern times and modern technology so it's been
left in the dust purple is sort of like the
uh the dinosaur stage it's like the crocodile of the
animal kingdom uh the style of government of purple is
small-scale communism basically this is true communism is the way
that the natives live in in the middle of the
amazon it's the way that the native american tribes lived
before the westerners came over from europe there's no formal
legal system there's no court system there's no laws at
least not officially there's no formal market there's no military
there's no taxation it's all very distributed it's loose it's
based on custom there's a council of elders usually who
run the the tribe or a group of tribes and
coordinate things but it's not autocratic it's not dictatorial it's
not about power hungry monarchs these elders are usually well
respected and they serve the tribe selflessly there's a sort
of a burning man gift economy that we've talked about
and the chief usually distributes goods based on the needs
of the people in the tribe so it's not about
climbing some sort of ladder and becoming the wealthiest and
richest and most powerful as billionaires and millionaires love to
do today it's it's about who needs what and that's
how resources are distributed so again stage green socialists and
marxists today they sort of look back at stage purple
um fondly and they try to take examples of this
gift economy and the sort of communal way of living
and they try to scale it up and they sort
of ask the question well how can we turn the
globe into this sort of gift based economy how can
we distribute the resources of the world on a per
need basis because they see the limitations and the toxic
effects of stage orange run amok of capitalism run amok
and so stage green is trying to figure out how
to do that but also that's difficult to do because
it doesn't scale so well it works well when you
have 100 people or a thousand people but it's difficult
to do when you have 100 million people or a
billion people so those are new challenges that we need
to invent new solutions for that we haven't figured out
yet as a species here are the top lessons that
you need to learn from stage purple so you might
be wondering well leo i'm already stage orange or i'm
already stage green or yellow so why do i even
need to listen to stage purple what's the point what
do i get out of it it seems so archaic
but remember you were already sort of raised into a
culture that's orange or green based on where you grew
up in a modern culture modern society it's very easy
for you to have skipped over and to have gaping
holes in your development from the lower stages like red
and purple so it is worth going back and looking
at the lower stages and seeing what are the things
you might have missed and not fully integrated or fully
developed or have insufficient experience with maybe something that you've
turned into a shadow so here are some of these
things building intimate social bonds and learning how to socialize
and being comfortable with socialization this is something that i
think a lot of people struggle with today because of
the internet because we're very alienated um we were bullied
in school we didn't get properly socialized for whatever reasons
and so we developed a chip on our shoulders and
uh we have a shadow and we have social anxiety
and we're not sure how to socialize in this this
hurts us in many ways first of all it's not
fulfilling because socialization is just fulfilling knowing how to socialize
is fulfilling it helps you to get friends it helps
you to get wives and girlfriends and husbands if you're
struggling to get laid many in-cells are struggling with this
they simply don't know how to socialize it's not that
women don't want to sleep with you it's not that
you're not hot looking enough it's not that you don't
have a sharp enough brad pit looking chin or something
like that the way that in cells like to uh
whine about uh the fundamental problem that incels have is
that you're so alienated you spend so much time playing
video games on the internet you spend so much time
watching anime and being on these toxic in cell forums
uh masturbating about how women don't like you that you
don't actually spend any time socializing with women face to
face that's your biggest problem if you want to get
laid you need to start socializing and many of these
these in cells they didn't learn how to socialize properly
when they were younger for whatever reasons and so now
they suffer from that see if you grew up in
a proper purple healthy culture you would have learned these
things by the time you were a teen and your
life would be a lot more fulfilling and you'd be
a lot less suicidal and you'd be a lot less
depressed and all that another lesson you can learn is
that humans are a deeply communal species so those of
you who are stage orange libertarian types and think that
you are this rugged individual that you can live life
all by yourself and that this is how mankind is
supposed to live property rights and all that uh well
you didn't really learn the lessons of purple you got
to go back and learn that if you're a libertarian
then you can start to appreciate what it really means
to be a human and you can see yourself as
part of a larger global phenomenon that's happening a larger
society and community and you realize that to be part
of a community means making sacrifices it can't just be
all about you it's not just all about what you
want and what you need it's also about what you're
willing to contribute to your society what kind of sacrifices
are you willing to make see then you wouldn't have
these silly views of taxation being theft you would see
that taxation is something that is necessary actually good for
the benefit of your community that would be much more
healthy you can also learn the lesson of caring for
the entire community and treating the entire human species basically
as a family of yours rather than treating other humans
as strangers or aliens or illegals or other races that
are inferior that have lower iqs and all this kind
of nonsense that is so common these days in the
conservative right uh rather than that approach you can start
to see that we're all in the same boat we're
all together we're all part of earth we're all part
of the greater spirit of gaia and all of our
actions collectively add up to what our community is doing
and that really what we should be doing is building
a global community multi-racial multi-ethnic imagine if you treated every
race every ethnicity every gender every sexual orientation as though
they were your family members with that same love and
kindness without demonizing them without making them scapegoats without blaming
them and trying to distribute resources fairly amongst all of
them see wouldn't that be something another lesson of purple
is life beyond individual profit many of us are so
lost in this trap of materialism and chasing profit at
the expense of everything else what if life though is
about the quality of your social bonds more than the
material possessions that you lust after another lesson of purple
is the value of nature living more organically more harmoniously
with nature just being out in nature more going for
hikes and communing with mother earth so to speak go
to the deserts go to the mountains go to the
forest go to the jungle appreciate that there's uh there's
a spiritual quality of just being out in nature which
a lot of us are disconnected from again those incels
who are on these forums who just keep writing these
troll comments about how women don't like them and how
they're depressed and want to kill themselves when was the
last time you were out in the forest listening to
the birds looking at the sun looking at the stars
without all the light pollution of your city probably not
in years you would feel a lot better about yourself
if you did that and you would feel even better
if you did that with some friends and um as
part of a group as part of a party maybe
go camping with your friends if you have some but
of course you probably don't because you live in your
mother's basement watching anime and jerking off to [ __
] porn and stuff another thing you can learn from
purple is to connect more with your emotions and intuition
versus your logic another thing i noticed with these in
cells is that they're so logical everything is about science
and facts and all this you know facts over feelings
this this sort of nonsense but actually the quality of
your life is much more contingent upon the quality of
your emotions and your intuition rather than your logic and
even to be able to talk to girls to be
able to attract girls to date girls you need to
become much more emotional and intuitive rather than logical and
stuck in your mind living from your body and your
heart rather than your head and psychedelics can help you
to open up your heart and to get in touch
with your body and out of your head speaking of
psychedelics that's another huge thing we can we can glean
from stage purple ayahuasca mushrooms peyote combo amino muscaria mushrooms
and another salvia deterio although i don't recommend you try
that one that's dangerous uh but there's a lot of
there's a lot of herbal medicines and psychedelics and so
forth that that we can we can rediscover and we
can modernize we can turn these into modern technologies for
for deep healing and personal development amazing stuff and you
can also take from purple the importance of spirituality mysticism
and psychic powers this is not just [ __ ]
it's not just wishful magical thinking there's something very profound
in spirituality and mysticism psychic powers are real and you
can develop them to various degrees start taking that seriously
as a possibility and start to pursue that stuff and
you will see the quality of your life improves as
you go away from chasing material pleasures and being stuck
in survival and getting into being mode another thing you
can take from purple is simply slowing down your life
being rather than doing living a simpler life minimizing your
life getting rid of all the unnecessary distractions and stuff
spending less time online spending more time spiritually spiritually connected
to nature and to people you can also glean from
purple the wisdom of the elders also the wisdom that
is baked into ancient traditions ancient traditions aren't just always
stupid and silly there can be deep wisdom in them
don't take that for granted listen to your elders seek
out that wisdom of the elders and actually build your
life upon it and you'll see how much better it
is than whatever else you're doing right now and lastly
what you can glean from purple is a natural wholesome
organic diet you know people sometimes ridicule this whole organic
foods movement as though like oh organic oh that's that's
some sort of elitist luxury thing but you know what
all of your stage purple ancestors they lived on organic
food their entire lives and that's why they didn't have
much cancer or heart disease or all the other modern
conditions depression and adhd and erectile dysfunction disorders and premature
ejaculation and uh acne and eczema and autoimmune disorders a
lot of this stuff comes from the kind of toxic
diets that we eat our ancestors ate high quality organic
grass-fed food so adopt some of that and then you're
gonna start to feel better and then you're gonna start
to live better how do you transcend stage purple well
i assume that very few of you who are watching
are actually stuck in solid stage purple you've already transcended
it basically but just for sake of comprehensiveness if you
are stuck in purple what you're gonna have to do
is you're gonna have to develop a sense of personal
ambition which is gonna lead you into red remember red
comes after purple uh you're gonna have to let go
of tradition question tradition and let go of your ancestors
question your ancestors and be willing to go out into
the world and to expose yourself to more of the
world especially today there are so many different cultures and
tribes that you can experience so go start to open
your mind to those experience more of the world which
will break down the narrow kind finds of your old
traditions and perspectives be willing to abandon old traditions and
also let go of that magical thinking and start to
think more rationally more strategically and more scientifically study some
western philosophy and so forth and through that you will
ascend into red and then beyond so in conclusion remember
that stage purple is not good or bad it is
fairly primitive by today's standards but also i hope you
can see here that there's a lot of amazing stuff
from purple that is worth your time studying and reading
about there are many great books that i recommend some
on my book list and more that i'll add in
the future there's many great videos that i've shared and
will continue to share on my forum and on my
blog of different stage purple cultures and traditions that i
think are are valuable for you to study on your
personal growth journey and in your spiritual work as well
if you're doing spirituality there's a lot of spiritual wisdom
that you can find within these purple cultures and you
can find many great documentaries today about it that are
available on youtube and elsewhere so remember that purple has
both healthy and unhealthy manifestations what we're really interested in
is understanding the unhealthy manifestations and avoiding those and then
taking the healthy manifestations and integrating those into our lives
and then benefiting from those remember that if you're stuck
in purple you'll have to evolve through red before you
can go higher you can't just skip red and jump
straight to blue or green um so it is what
it is so go through red and then blue and
all the way up the spiral all right that's it
i'm done here please click that like button for me
and come check out actualize.org that's my website there you
will find my blog you will find the life purpose
course you'll find the book list with some good books
that will introduce you to purple uh you'll find resources
on sproutdynamics on my book list stuff that i haven't
shared through the public free videos so check that out
come to the forum and on the forum you will
find of course threads we call the mega threads for
every stage of the spiral where we give tons of
examples dozens and hundreds of examples videos images quotes and
so forth so you can really learn spiral dynamics through
these examples that's one of the best ways to learn
it is through these examples so you'll find a link
down below to the forum come check it out you
don't even even need to sign up to see the
examples look for the mega threads you will see a
stage purple mega thread you'll see a stage red and
blue and green and everything up above that you can
support me on patreon by going to patreon.com actualized and
chip in five bucks a month that helps to support
uh the funding of this work and uh future work
that i have planned for you guys and uh and
the last thing i'll say here uh this is me
wrapping up the spiral dynamics series uh but also in
a sense not because there's still a lot more to
say about spiral dynamics and i'm going to be covering
topics on developmental psychology which will be closely related to
spiral dynamics i will still be doing more future videos
on spiral dynamics now that i've got an episode on
each stage you understand the entire model if you watch
all these episodes but still you're going to struggle fully
integrating them and fully seeing how to get the practical
consequences how to apply the model in the real world
how to apply the model to politics to society to
culture how to apply the model individually in your own
life to grow so i will be probably doing more
episodes in the future with a focus on application and
like the really practical benefits of this model now that
uh i assume most of you following me will be
well familiar by having watched this episode so make sure
you stick around for those and make sure that you
take the time to integrate the lower stages i think
a lot of people today simply because our culture is
roughly orange green in most parts of the world that
are watching me orange and green we take for granted
but the lower stage is like purple red and blue
i think that a lot of you guys are missing
that as you're part of your foundation you're missing the
self-discipline and work ethic of blue you're missing the assertiveness
the assertiveness and courage of red you're you're missing the
connection to nature and to community that communal mindset of
purple the ability to socialize effortlessly and naturally you're missing
that from purple and probably you're missing a lot more
than than that but those i would say are probably
three major things that many of you guys are missing
and that you're suffering from and that's why you can't
get laid that's why you can't get a husband that's
why you're like a doormat people keep walking over you
and abusing you because you're not assertive enough from stage
read and that's why you struggle to hold a job
and to pay your bills because you don't have enough
self-discipline or that's why you struggle with your life purpose
because you can't discipline yourself enough to work every day
or to meditate every day or to go to the
gym every day that's why you're fat or you struggle
to eat healthy foods and that's why you're fat or
whatever you see every stage builds upon the previous one
and you need that foundation i get a sense that
a lot of folks that are following me now because
my newest content is so advanced it's so metaphysical and
abstract and spiritual and so forth you're you're you're jumping
the gun too much you need to spend a good
five ten years just building a solid foundation for yourself
with stages purple red blue and orange be able to
survive be able to navigate your way in the world
be able to be effective be able to be assertive
to have courage to have discipline have a work ethic
to get your material needs met in a healthy way
avoid all the toxic elements of all these stages and
then we can start to talk about enlightenment and awakening
and advance spiritual metaphysical stuff see so just make sure
you you get your priorities straight i should not be
your only source of self-improvement advice i should be one
of your sources i am like a meta source i
am probably one of the most advanced sources you will
ever find a source that integrates so much stuff i
am like the umbrella in your in your plan but
then you need all the smaller stuff underneath i don't
spend that much of my time giving you super practical
dating advice or super practical business advice or super practical
financial advice or super practical you know nutrition advice you
can find other youtubers and courses and books on that
stuff you know one person can't do it all i
don't have enough time and energy to do it all
anyways so i focus my attention on really the big
stuff to give you the big picture the thing that
ties everything together that's the most valuable thing i can
offer you that's my forte and then you will still
need to go and find individual experts who could help
you with the other stuff you see it's a lot
of stuff it's a lot of material it's a lot
of work but also don't like don't treat this as
a chore don't treat this also as something you have
to accomplish in the next year or five years this
is we're talking about the rest of your life right
i'm i'm giving you a development plan for the rest
of your life there's gonna be more than one lifetime
of work here for you to do uh don't treat
it as work though do this because you're excited about
it do this because what else is there to do
in life i mean what are you gonna do in
life you're here to be alive and to live the
best life possible to grow yourself in every way possible
to optimize your life in different ways nutritionally fitness wise
psychologically emotionally socially politically spiritually and so on right so
you're optimizing all these different areas and um for that
you need a big overarching plan and a vision of
where you're going and why you're doing it why would
you do this stuff unless you saw you know some
um some light at the end of the tunnel so
i'm here to sort of give you that light at
the end of the tunnel and to inspire you to
see the the full potential of this work see because
when i started out reading about self-help and self-improvement i
didn't know what the full potential of the work is
nobody told me that's very rare nobody ever tells you
the full potential of it uh so that that's one
of the roles that i serve is that i try
to i try to just show you how much there
is here there's so much here and all of this
that we're talking about is really just your own potential
all i'm ever talking about is your own potential this
is your true potential as a human being it's enormous
it's astounding how much potential you have of what you
can become and of the role you can play in
the world if you really get your [ __ ]
together and you stop being lazy and you develop some
self-discipline and you start to take your life seriously and
you start to treat it like a like a project
that you're working on and you treat it like a
work of art and you make your life a gift
that you give to the rest of the world because
you're part of a larger global community of a larger
global tribe you see so i'm the one who's helping
you to interconnect the dots to create that vision which
will be the fuel that then allows you to get
all the rest of your ducks in a row and
there's still so much more work we have to cover
there we're not even close to done with that project
so stay with me for more because there's still a
lot more that we haven't covered you
