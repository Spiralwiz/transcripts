hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
quick self-help segment I'm going to tell you how to
find your passion hey all right so let's crack into
this and this is a favorite topic of mine is
living a passionate life that's what I'm about that's what
I want for you guys so let's really dig into
some of the details of what it takes to find
your life passion now if you're looking at this video
then you do not have a life passion and most
people do not have a life passion I would say
99% of the population does not have this part of
their life handled and they are missing out on so
much so first of all realize that your normal you're
kind of in where most people are second of all
realize that it takes time and effort to find your
passion your passion does not just come and land on
your lap by accident very very rarely does that happen
passion is something that you need to think about something
you have to work towards and something that is also
worth putting the energy into finding all right this is
critical because I find that most people do not have
their passion for this reason you know why it is
it's because it actually takes some work to find your
passion and they they they have an intuition that it's
important to do something that they're passionate about but then
they realize and we're see that it actually is going
to require some work or some action in the real
world to to figure that out and then they forget
about and they say well yeah but I'm not going
to go do that I'm not going to go do
this I really am NOT going to do the work
to find my passion I just want to fly my
passion just give me my passion what's my passion right
now I'm going to find my passion and I'm just
going to go and do it and that's the end
of it and then I'm never going to look back
at this question again and with that attitude this attitude
where they expect it to be easy effortless totally they
never find it because it does take some work it's
kind of like saying give me a six-pack I want
a six right now you can't have a six-pack without
the work you have to put some work into it
but here's the silver lining the silver lining is this
the silver lining is that it's so goddamn rewarding it's
so powerful to have actual real passion in your life
and you don't probably even know what that really means
what it feels like to have real passion for your
life it's so powerful that it's literally worth spending years
of your life to finding your passion it's literally worth
it I would say that it's worth almost anything sacrifice
whatever you got to sacrifice sacrifice the TV sacrifice your
your bank account whatever sacrifice whatever you got to sacrifice
to find your passion it's super important because the quality
of your life will just go through the roof when
you figure this part out I spent five years five
years alright so don't tell me that it's hard for
you I spent five years and I'm still working on
it on my own passion that is okay so enough
of the ranting let's get into how this really works
so what is passion really about here's the core of
it passion is about authenticity to know what your passion
is this is something that you partially discover partially create
so discovery and creation the problem is that you really
have no sense of identity right now you don't really
know who it is that you are because if you
did know who you are then your passion would be
completely glaringly obvious to you and you would not be
able to ignore it it would in fact be driving
your whole life the problem is that you're inauthentic you've
been conditioned by society parents lack of education limiting beliefs
that you got from your friends and maybe you even
developed yourself and so you have no authenticity to you
you are not really in touch with what you truly
love and truly do not like and so a lot
of the things that you're doing in your life right
now are actually things you should not be doing and
you think they are important but they're not really important
they're important - you're in authentic self but they're not
important to your authentic self this is a very deep
idea I'm going to talk about authenticity in many other
videos so you'll be you'll want to check those out
for more on authenticity but this is just kind of
setting the foundation here for our discussion is that you
don't really know who you are so if that's the
case and if you did know who you were then
you would have instant passion then what do you think
the solution here is what do you think the ultimate
solution is to finding your passion right it's finding out
who you really are and developing a very strong sense
of identity now that doesn't mean ego in a sense
you are going to be building up your ego but
also it's kind of expanding your horizons and just living
like exploring exploring is important and I would say that
the bottom line for why you do not have certainty
about your passion or maybe you don't even know what
you could possibly be passionate about is because you have
too little life experience you've locked yourself away in your
closet or in your bedroom or in your office or
in your relationship or at your job you've locked yourself
away into a little bubble this hermetically sealed bubble from
the rest of the world and you are so focused
on that that you've got your blinders on you've got
your blinders on and you don't see what else is
out there maybe you were lucky that the first thing
you saw when you had those blinders on was something
that you really loved and it somehow just coincidentally aligned
with your authentic self and in that case you probably
have a purpose right now and that's why some people
naturally have a purpose cross into purpose is that they
just kind of fall into it but most of us
don't get that lucky most of us have to go
out there and do some discovery work and this is
an iterative process so by discovery work I literally mean
whatever job you're working at right now if you don't
like it you know it's valuable to know that that's
a valuable piece of information okay you don't like your
current job good I mean it would have been nice
if you would have found something you loved right off
the bat but don't beat yourself up for for not
having done that because it almost nobody can it's too
hard what you got to do is you got to
explore around in the workspace you know what kind of
jobs are out there have you tried five even five
different jobs how do you know what you're going to
like it what you don't like until you try it
it's almost like this is a I think a very
app analogy is if you're just let's take someone who
is just born into the world and imagine they kind
of grew up I don't know how they grew up
but they just kind of grew up on an IV
right they were fed through an IV they never ate
any food and then now they're fully grown human being
and we take them to a restaurant to this Grand
Buffet I live in Las Vegas we have these grand
buffets here we take this to this ridiculous buffet of
buffets where you could have everything humanly imaginable from seafood
to lobsters to steak to to caviar to whatever you
want breakfast food it's just like desserts it's all lumped
it's like anything you want it's there and it's all
delicious and amazing and also extremely unhealthy but let's take
that Sud take that point in another video we'll talk
about that so we'll take this person to this buffet
and now this person he has never ever ever in
his life eaten anything so he doesn't know what anything
tastes like now you asked that person go pick one
dish just one dish you only have one dish to
pick go pick that one item from the whole buffet
and be really passionate about it like really love it
fall in love with it is that is that going
to happen how is that going to happen it's like
I'm telling him to go and pick out his favorite
food when he hasn't tried any food yet it's not
going to work because he hasn't he hasn't sampled it
you need to literally start to treat your life and
life in general as a buffet with all this variety
out there and what you got to do is you
got to do a little bit of sampling now of
course this doesn't mean you have to go quit your
job right now there are smart ways to do sampling
there are smart ways to do this in life so
this doesn't literally mean that you need to go and
have five very different jobs practically that's that's challenging to
do it's challenging to go be an engineer then be
a doctor then be a lawyer then be a politician
and then be an artist you can't realistically do that
but what you can do is you can start testing
the waters this is where it has what have to
do become smart and this is where the work process
comes in so if you're working let's say as an
engineer right now and you found out by working at
an engineering firm for a few years that engineering is
dry it's boring it's not really your passion something about
it is rubbing you the wrong way okay so that's
fine so you know that's not where you're going to
end up in the long run that means that you
need to now start thinking about what else you could
be passionate about so you have to start to ask
yourself what is it about this place that I'm in
right now that's rubbing the wrong way because there are
hints there and these hints are very powerful so we
can look at those hints and we could say okay
so engineering why don't I really like engineering well the
two biggest things that don't like about engineering are because
I sit in a cubicle too much and I don't
get to interact with people let's say that's that's item
number one is that I'm just too isolated and I
feel myself coming alive when I'm talking with people I
feel myself coming alive when I'm in a group meeting
but we just as an engineer we don't do that
enough we don't have enough meetings and most of my
work is just sitting at a computer punching away at
some spreadsheet or drawing some schematics or whatever so that's
problem number one and maybe problem or two the thing
that I really don't like is I found out that
I don't really like working for a large corporation like
I've been working in this company of 10,000 people and
our division has 300 people in it and my boss
is overseeing a team of 50 of us and all
we're all working on this one project and just don't
I don't like working in that kind of environment so
those might be two things that you don't currently like
about engineering now those are valuable so you can now
use those two intelligently decide what your next test in
life is going to be so you're testing stuff out
right this is almost like being at that buffet and
you go and you say you know what I'm going
to start with seafood let's see if I like seafood
I'm going to go take a shrimp and I'm going
to try a shrimp so you try that trip and
you say you know what I don't like seafood it's
kind of like I don't like the texture of it
it's slimy it's raw I don't like this like I
don't I don't like the the seafood like flavor the
this the smell of the sea in the soul I
don't like that I don't like the sweetness of like
crustaceans and shellfish okay fine so that means the next
time you go you shouldn't you shouldn't grab another piece
of seafood you shouldn't grab some salmon and you shouldn't
grab some some octopus instead go and do something else
try a steak totally different right try a steak maybe
you're going to like a steak or try a salad
try some vegetarian dish maybe try a dessert so it's
kind of like with life is you don't like the
engineering thing okay now what would you like that is
gonna is going to honor more of your your natural
authentic getting back to authenticity your authentic desires so here
with this engineering example is the engineer actually finds out
that he's more of a people person he wants to
interact more okay so he needs a job where he's
talking with people a lot and working with them collaborating
he also doesn't want to work in a very big
corporation so maybe he wants to either start his own
business or he wants to work in some sort of
small start-up environment where he has more more more autonomy
or maybe his voice is being heard more where it's
a little bit more creative type work so those are
those are now two things that you can go find
in some other job and so what you do is
how you go and you find that other job you
try that and you see how well did you do
maybe you're going to get it maybe going to get
on your second attempt maybe you won't if you won't
you'll still learn stuff so don't get butthurt about this
you're gonna learn even more because now you're going to
refine it even further now that Engineer let's say he's
working in a company that's small to startup and he's
actually working with people but now he discovers something else
he discovers something else about himself that doesn't like he
doesn't like working for a boss or maybe what he
really finds out he likes is he likes the part
of working with people where he gets to teach people
and he finds out that in this company that he's
working on right now he's working with people but he's
not in a mentor role he's not able to teach
them so now he's to go and he has to
align his life with that so it's this alignment process
that you go through this is what really you need
to do it's an experimental model this is an iterative
model you iterate iterate iterate now of course the warning
here is that this requires development right this requires work
this is not something that's going to come about easily
for you you're going to have to I mean think
about this switching jobs switching a couple of jobs if
you do that within the span of a few years
it's going to take a lot of energy from you
it's going to cause a lot of stress and challenge
you're going to have to really be up for that
but what's the upshot what's the what's the silver lining
of all this it's like we talked about its having
passion it's so important I really want you to believe
and buy into this idea that if you could just
find your passion in life then so many of your
problems in life will be resolved just automatically they'll dissolve
your money problems will dissolve your relationship problems will improve
your lack of energy to go to the gym and
do other stuff will improve once you have passion that
stuff starts to spill over so this is really powerful
so the general idea here is that you want to
be exploring more in your life I find that too
many people are just living in a little box in
this little box that confines them and that keeps them
from really discovering who they are so let me quickly
rattle off a list of ideas for how you can
discover who you really are these are some of the
best ways to do it one is to read be
a voracious reader and read on a diverse variety of
topics to go to college get a nice well-rounded college
education where you experience all the variety of college has
to offer number three travel traveling is really powerful travel
to as diverse places as you can travel within the
country but if you can travel abroad travel across the
whole world and see how much of it you can
soak in the more you can travel and see what
the world has to offer the better the next is
we already talked about really covered in depth is try
different jobs that can be a really powerful way maybe
you want to spend the next two years just jumping
from job to job job just to experience them not
to commit to one but just various the the full
buffet out there another one is live in different places
don't get stuck living in the same little town or
even the same big town your whole life this is
very this is very much restraining you from finding out
who you authentically are meet new people this is also
very big when you meet new people they give you
new ideas they inspire you they share stories they share
their jobs if you want to really learn about which
jobs will work for you and which ones won't probably
the most efficient way to do that because it's hard
to actually try all the job yourself is talk to
people who are immersed in those jobs and just talk
to them and pick their brain and doesn't take long
even pick someone's brain for 15 minutes and find out
very very quickly if you're asking the right questions whether
that job would sit well with you if you were
doing it right so you can talk to people this
will happen naturally while you're traveling which is what's nice
in living in different cities that are going to interact
with new people make new friends break friends and you're
going to just is going to be it's gonna be
powerful you're going to start to discover what you like
and what you don't like and the last thing is
more generally just try new things be open to new
things eat new food listen to new music explore new
websites on the internet try new TV channels that you
haven't watched although you should not be watching TV you
know read a new magazine read a new type of
book go to a new type of place go to
somewhere you've never been to before so when you do
these things stuff will just start to pop out at
you you'll just start discovering what you don't like about
all these things and the things that you do like
and then the last one which is super super powerful
is spend time by yourself alone spend long periods of
time just by yourself in isolation this is very important
because it gets you in touch with your higher self
your authentic self ideals will start bubbling up to you
and when that happens you know I almost find that
it's necessary this is necessary if you want to find
your passion unless you're extremely lucky you need to go
out and explore like we've been talking about but then
you also need to spend time by yourself just quietly
in isolation maybe with a journal or maybe not just
sitting and thinking and stewing in the experiences that you've
had and thinking about them and asking yourself questions questions
like what I really like about that and why did
I like that and what about this thing here rubbed
me the wrong way and why did I really not
like that why do I like this type of person
but not that type of person what do I really
love about life what irritates me about life what am
I already doing that I'm that I'm very passionate about
as like a side hobby how could I make money
out of that it's these kinds of questions that you
want to be asking yourself and this is not something
you do once this is something you do consistently like
I said an iterative process okay so those are my
thoughts quickly on how to find passion I have a
lot more and each one of these points can really
be blown and expanded and we can really get in
