            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/AdM0bhoy3IU' target='_blank'>Happiness & Success - Should You Work on Strengths or Weaknesses</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Strengths vs Weaknesses in Personal Development</b>: The topic of focusing on strengths or weaknesses for success in various area of life like career, relationships, health, and overall happiness is discussed. The common idea is to work on weaknesses and strengths.
</li><li><b>Martin Seligman's Research on Positive Psychology Movement</b>: Seligman's research lays the foundation for the positive psychology movement, and his website, Authentic Happiness, provides a strengths assessment. This character strengths assessment identifies personal strengths such as being generous, grateful, open-minded, curious, or artistic.
</li><li><b>Strengths - Working with People</b>: Strengths could be a natural inclination for working and interacting with people, which results in joy and ease. A weakness for some might be difficulty collaborating due to being introverted or shy, therefore, working with others may be a struggle.
</li><li><b>Working on Strengths for Happiness</b>: Much research suggests that focusing on your strengths rather than your weaknesses is a more effective approach to increasing overall happiness. Improving weaknesses can be challenging and may feel unnatural, but aligning your life according to your strengths can significantly enhance your joy and happiness.
</li><li><b>Importance of Aligning Life with Strengths</b>: If you're extroverted and enjoy working with people, finding a job or role where you can utilise this strength could greatly contribute to your happiness. Same applies to individuals who prefer solitary work. Greater happiness can be achieved by utilizing your natural talents and abilities.
</li><li><b>Addressing Both Strengths and Weaknesses</b>: In personal development, it is beneficial to work on both strengths and weaknesses. The initial step should be to align your life with your top strengths, but weaknesses should not be ignored for a balanced and fulfilling life.
</li><li><b>Authentic Happiness - Strengths Survey</b>: Martin Seligman's website, Authentic Happiness, provides a comprehensive character strengths survey. The survey reveals one's top strengths. By consciously incorporating these strengths into your daily routine, it's possible to maximize potential for growth and fulfillment. 
</li><li><b>Adjusting Roles Life According to Strengths</b>: Depending on one's strengths identified through the survey, adjusting roles at work or in relationships might be necessary to live into the strengths. Performing these strengths consistently can enhance satisfaction in day-to-day life.
</li><li><b>The importance of addressing weaknesses</b>: Gura claims that we must identify and work on our limitations to live life to the fullest. Focusing only on our strengths and ignoring our weaknesses can limit our life experiences and hinder our growth. Taking a comfortable approach, where we only engage our strengths and ignore our pitfalls, prevents us from living a charged, fulfilling life.
</li><li><b>Impact of weaknesses on strengths</b>: Gura argues that deficiencies or weaknesses can restrict the expression and enhancement of our strengths. Therefore, it is crucial to work on our weaknesses, especially those hindering us from experiencing a vibrant, fulfilling life.
</li><li><b>Introversion as a personal limitation</b>: Drawing from personal experiences, Gura discusses how he was held back by his introversion. While he found comfort and success in solitude and focusing on work, it limited his ability to disseminate his wisdom, conduct interviews, develop relationships, be socially active, and develop into a good public speaker and leader.
</li><li><b>Overcoming and benefitting from addressing weaknesses</b>: Gura explains his journey to combat his introverted nature. He has recognized the necessity to work on this weakness in order to achieve his long-term vision and live his life to the fullest. Pursuing this has been challenging but it has resulted in better dating life, enhanced confidence, improved friendships, and overall more comfort in social situations. 
</li><li><b>The balance of strengths and weaknesses</b>: Gura concludes by emphasizing the need for a balance; while focusing on our strengths can lead to success, working on our weaknesses will lead to a richer, more fulfilling life. He believes that for the most well-rounded personal development, you must address both your strengths and weaknesses.
</li><li><b>Working on weaknesses leads to personal fulfillment</b>: Despite the challenges that come with stepping out of one's comfort zone, working on weaknesses can lead to personal growth and happiness.
</li><li><b>Balancing strengths and weaknesses</b>: It's false to think that one has to focus solely on either strengths or weaknesses. Balancing both aspects is key in achieving overall personal and professional fulfillment. For instance, couples work in their weaknesses pushes them out of their comfort zone, while consistently developing their strengths leads to substantial material success.
</li><li><b>Strengths add value</b>: Focusing on one's strengths enables the individual to create value in their chosen career or business. This can eventually lead to financial rewards and success. Choosing to spend time honing one's strengths can also feel more rewarding and natural.
</li><li><b>Addressing weaknesses for personal development</b>: On the other hand, weaknesses should not be ignored as they can hinder overall personal development. Working on weaknesses can help round out an individual's personality and abilities, leading to a more fulfilling quality of life.
</li><li><b>Choice between business success and personal growth</b>: Over the course of one's life, the focus may shift between business success and personal growth. This depends on one's needs at a given time - focusing on strengths can lead to career or business success, while working on weaknesses can lead to personal development.
</li><li><b>Using the strengths assessment</b>: A strength survey can be useful to identify areas of improvement. If the individual is happy with their career or business but notices other aspects of their life lacking, it might be pertinent to work on their weaknesses. The strengths assessment lists an individual's weaknesses as well, presenting areas that could be improved for maximum personal and professional growth.
</li><li><b>Overcoming weaknesses can reduce struggle</b>: Working to bring up one's weaknesses to the level of their strengths can reduce struggle in one's life. Overcoming weaknesses can also present the individual with new self-realizations and rewards, despite the increased challenge compared to developing strengths.
</li><li><b>Conclusion</b>: The bottom line is to work on both strengths and weaknesses depending on the individual's situation and which area they need to focus on at a given time. A strengths assessment can be done for free on Authentic Happiness and more resources can be found on actualized.org.
