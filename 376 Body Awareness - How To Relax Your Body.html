            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/VQCWryMBRxQ' target='_blank'>Body Awareness - How To Relax Your Body</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Impact of Thoughts on the Body</b>: In the video, Leo Gura talks about his own experience with severe irritable bowel syndrome, which he suffered from for over six years. He explains how one day, while feeling nervous about an upcoming test, he had an insight that his physical symptoms might be related to his mindset. He experimented with relaxing his mind and body, and noticed that his symptoms disappeared. He never experienced them again, demonstrating to him the mind-body connection. 
</li><li><b>Body Awareness and Relaxation Exercise</b>: Leo instructs the viewer to do an exercise to understand tension in the body. He tells them to keep their eyes closed, sit still, and scan their body from head to toe without trying to change or relax any muscle tension. The areas to focus on are the face, hand, arms, feet, legs, abdomen, butt, sphincter, back, and shoulders. The goal is to become aware of any muscle tension and then to use consciousness to relax each tensed area. The process involves "sending a signal of letting go" which should be repeated constantly to achieve deep relaxation. 
</li><li><b>Mind-body Connection</b>: The key lesson presented here is the connection between tension and unconsciousness, and conversely, relaxation and consciousness. This highlights that many physical ailments or discomforts could possibly be related to unconscious mental stress. It implies the importance of developing body awareness and mind relaxation techniques to manage physical and emotional wellbeing.
</li><li><b>Individual Differences in Tension</b>: Leo acknowledges that there will be individual differences in terms of body tension levels. However, he emphasizes that lack of body awareness can be a significant obstacle in reaching higher consciousness levels and personal satisfaction in life. 
</li><li><b>Stress and Emotions Stored in the Body</b>: Stress, emotions, and past traumas get stored in the body over time, causing chronic tension. Many people are unaware of this and cannot recognize the subtle energy drain happening. The body becomes a place to suppress emotions, leading to resistance. By developing body awareness and relaxing techniques, people can start releasing these stored tensions.
</li><li><b>Body as a Hurdle for Development</b>: The studio emphasizes that personal development cannot only focus on the mind without considering body awareness and relaxation. Citing the example of Westerners failing to recognize the interconnectedness of mind and body, they end up carrying around chronic tension, further hindering their personal development. 
</li><li><b>Significance of Relaxation and Body Awareness</b>: Leo points out relaxation and body awareness as key for increasing wellbeing and performance in life. The lack of body awareness can lead to serious disorders, both mental and physical. People often use their bodies to repress emotions, leading to further disconnection. 
</li><li><b>Manipulation of Body Signals</b>: The video refers to people's tendency to manipulate body signals. These signals alert us about discomfort or an unhealthy lifestyle, but due to resistance or denial, they often get ignored. The viewer is urged to tap into these body signals, take them seriously, and effectively deal with them.
</li><li><b>Unhealthy lifestyle and its impact on body awareness</b>: The lifestyle a person leads, both physically and psychologically, directly affects their body awareness. Unhealthy habits, work pressures, and stressful environments contribute to unconscious tension in the body. The mind often represses uncomfortable feelings and experiences, which are then stored as tension in different parts of the body.
</li><li><b>Consciousness and relaxation</b>: Unconsciousness corresponds with tension, while consciousness leads to relaxation. A person with high consciousness is usually physically relaxed and at ease, while an unconscious person typically displays physical tension, rigidity, resistance, and quick agitation.
</li><li><b>Western culture and body awareness</b>: Western society seldom emphasizes body awareness. Most people live within their minds, neglecting the connection between the mind and body. This fragmented understanding contributes to various physical and emotional disorders.
</li><li><b>The Placebo effect and the mind-body connection</b>: The placebo effect is a clear example of the strong influence the mind has on the body. Western viewpoints often uphold a dualistic view that sees the mind and body as separate entities, undermining the acknowledgment and exploration of their interconnectedness.
</li><li><b>Emotions, feelings, and rationality</b>: Western perspectives often dismiss emotional and bodily feelings as unimportant compared to "facts", leading to people becoming numb to their own bodies. However, emotions and feelings significantly influence rational thinking and fact interpretation, indicating a need for greater acknowledgement of their impact.
</li><li><b>Historical and societal repression of emotions</b>: Western society has historically discouraged and dismissed the importance of emotional and physical feelings. This has led to societal repression of emotions and feelings, with negative implications for individual and societal well-being. 
</li><li><b>Importance of integrating mind and body</b>: Developing an awareness of the body and integrating it into consciousness is crucial. It can transform lives and, in some cases, even save lives. Body awareness should be a goal of self-actualization, encompassing both mind and body.
</li><li><b>Consequences of living unconsciously</b>: Most people live with bodies that are largely unconscious and numbed due to repression and avoidance of painful emotions and difficult situations. Rather than confronting these feelings head-on, people suppress them, leading to tension and tightness in different parts of the body. 
</li><li><b>Body storing tension</b>: The body often stores tension as a response to difficult situations and emotions. These tensions can manifest in different parts of the body such as the arms, hands, shoulders, stomach, and feet, sometimes forming tension habits that are triggered during stressful situations.
</li><li><b>Relaxation during challenging situations</b>: As Leo elaborates, he explains that people often create tension in their bodies during challenging situations such as work or emotional conflicts. This is often due to the avoidance of uncomfortable truths, leading to repression in our bodies. 
</li><li><b>Ignoring body's intelligent signals</b>: He characterizes the body as an intelligent instrument constantly sending signals to us. However, many become insensitive to these signals due to a toxic lifestyle and ambitions that promote an unhealthy lifestyle, effectively encouraging the body to ignore these intelligent signals.
</li><li><b>Poor body awareness leading to ailments</b>: Leo lists heart attacks, stress, muscle twitching, back pain, premature ejaculation, shyness, OCD, fatigue, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, cold hands and feet, cramping, low self-esteem, low energy and mood, and insomnia as conditions that can arise from poor body awareness.
</li><li><b>Target areas for relaxation</b>: He recommends focusing on relaxing specific areas of the body, particularly the face, mouth, jaw, hands, forearms, feet, calves, lower legs, stomach, anal sphincter, neck, back, and mind. He also encourages practicing slow, deep breathing and becoming conscious of one's body during specific activities, such as sleeping or work.
</li><li><b>Sexual experiences and relaxation</b>: The importance of relaxation during sexual experiences is stressed by Leo, explaining that many sexual difficulties like premature ejaculation or difficulty experiencing an orgasm are a lot of the times due to tension and anxiety during sex. To improve sexual experiences, practicing relaxation is highly recommended. 
</li><li><b>Practices for improving body awareness</b>: Leo emphasizes the practice of developing a conscious connection to the body, which includes becoming more in tune with how you sleep, sit, and work. He emphasizes that learning to relax and pay attention to the body's signals is key to unlocking better health and well-being as well as improving productivity and even sexual performance. 
</li><li><b>Challenge of developing body awareness</b>: He acknowledges that developing body awareness can be challenging due to its subtle nature and the resistance that many people have toward facing difficult realities within their bodily experiences. However, consistent practice, honesty, and proper tools, such as a wristband to serve as a reminder, can aid in the process.
</li><li><b>Sexual Intercourse and Body Relaxation</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that sex is a deeply emotional process which requires relaxation, especially around our groin and stomach area, for a satisfactory climax. He talks about the two forms of tension during sex - a good kind necessary for orgasm and a detrimental form that causes resistance and distraction. He advises practicing mindful sex for full satisfaction.
</li><li><b>Relaxation During Daily Activities</b>: Relaxation and body awareness should be practiced in everyday activities like eating, walking, talking, or even during stressful moments like public speaking or flirting at a nightclub. Confidence, which is attractive, comes from being relaxed and at ease in the world. Leo reiterates the importance of regularly practicing body relaxation.
</li><li><b>Importance of Constant Practice</b>: The process to attain body relaxation involves consistent practice over an extended period. Even though it's a simple exercise, one is bound to forget it 90% of the time. The idea is to remember and practice relaxing tension every time you notice it during day-to-day activities. This continuous practice will gradually relieve bodily tension.
</li><li><b>Difference between Thinking about Feeling and Actual Feeling</b>: Leo emphasizes understanding the difference between thinking about feeling and actual feeling. For instance, when asked to feel our hands, our mind might conjure an image, based on memories of how our hands feel, which may vary from our real-time feeling. The practice involves being able to genuinely feel different parts of our body. 
</li><li><b>Difficulty in actual feeling</b>: Individuals might feel that certain parts of their bodies are numb or empty during this practice. Leo explains that this is because they are not used to feeling these parts and with continual practice, this issue can be overcome.
</li><li><b>Body Awareness Techniques</b>: Leo Gura highlights several techniques to help enhance body awareness. 
</li><li>- <b>Practicing with intention</b>: The inability to feel certain body parts can be overcome by continuously focusing attention and awareness on that area. Honesty and authenticity should guide this practice. 
</li><li>- <b>Use of a wristband</b>: A wristband serves as a visual reminder to continuously practice feeling for tension and relaxing it away. After a month of use, this practice should become habitual even without the wristband. 
</li><li>- <b>Hatha Yoga</b>: This technique helps improve body awareness provided it is done mindfully, with the intention of enhancing body awareness and relaxation. 
</li><li>- <b>Tai Chi</b>: This slow and flowing movement practice focuses on being aware of body movements. 
</li><li>- <b>Body Scan Meditation</b>: This involves scanning and relaxing every part of the body consciously. 
</li><li>- <b>Shamanic Breathing</b>: This powerful method helps fostering a connection with emotions and energizing the body. 
</li><li>- <b>Deep Tissue Massage</b>: A mindful deep tissue massage, devoid of any distractions, helps in feeling into the body. 
</li><li>- <b>Hot Baths and Saunas</b>: Mindfully experiencing the sensation of hot baths or saunas can also promote awareness.
</li><li>- <b>Psychedelics</b>: Used with the intent of enhancing body awareness, substances like mushrooms can lead to deeper insights.
</li><li>- <b>Physical Exercise</b>: Physical activities that accommodate body awareness, like dance for women and martial arts for men, are also recommended. 
</li><li>- <b>Use of massagers or massage chairs</b>: Incorporating mindfulness while using vibrating massagers or massage chairs can also promote body awareness. 
</li><li>Leo finally emphasizes the need to try at least two of these techniques. The practice does not have to be daily, but consistent exploration is necessary to develop body awareness effectively.
</li><li><b>Hatha Yoga and Mindfulness</b>: Emphasizes the benefits of practicing Hatha Yoga mindfully to improve body awareness and emotional mastery. Suggests downloading body scan audios and watching Tai Chi videos to complement this practice.
</li><li><b>Deep Tissue Massage</b>: Recommends getting deep tissue massages to enhance body consciousness. Recommends finding local therapists on Yelp.
</li><li><b>Self-actualization Plan</b>: Stresses the importance of incorporating body awareness and conscious practices into personal growth plans, warning against approaching such practices mechanically.
</li><li><b>Varying Degrees of Relaxation</b>: Discusses the profound transformation and spiritual enlightenment possible with repeated deep relaxation practices over months or even years.
</li><li><b>Distinction between physical and consciousness</b>: Explores the idea that physical form and consciousness are made of the same substance, affirming this realization is achievable through spiritual practice and body awareness work.
</li><li><b>Utilities for Developing Body Awareness</b>: Recommends using resources such as his blog, videos, forum, life purpose course, and book list on Actualized.org to cultivate body consciousness and improve self-development.
</li><li><b>Intellectually Inclined Individuals</b>: Talks about the need for individuals who are intellectually inclined to work on developing their body awareness to avoid stunting personal growth. Highlights that the lack of emotional sensitivity and awareness could become a bottleneck in their development process.
