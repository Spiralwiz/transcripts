            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/odQV4oODum0' target='_blank'>How To Forgive Someone - The One Trick That Makes Forgiveness Easy</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding true and half-hearted forgiveness</b>: Leo highlights the difference between true forgiveness and half-hearted forgiveness. True forgiveness is characterized by letting go and forgetting, thereby giving the relationship a clean slate. On the contrary, half-hearted forgiveness involves letting go but without forgetting, thus keeping the resentment alive, comparable to continuously picking a healing scab, making the wound worse.
</li><li><b>Situations demanding forgiveness</b>: Any relationship enduring for a substantial long period is set for mistakes made by both parties. In cases like cheating, lying, abuse, hurtful remarks, or any sort of wrong behavior causing harm, forgiveness becomes necessary if the relationship is to be preserved. Hence, developing a good forgiveness ability is crucial to avoid relationships becoming fragile.
</li><li><b>The peril of self-righteous forgiveness</b>: A common pitfall in forgiveness is self-righteous forgiveness. This involves keeping score, feeling superior, and maintaining a constant reminder of the forgiven wrong. This creates an undercurrent of resentment in the relationship, contributing to its continual dysfunction. 
</li><li><b>The process of true forgiveness</b>: Choosing forgiveness is not about tolerating wrong behaviors or being a doormat. If the relationship is perceived as repairable and the offender is genuinely remorseful with an intention to change, then a conscious decision can be made to forgive. This act of forgiveness is a promise to oneself to let go of the wrong completely and to avoid contemplating it in the future. This requires inner strength and courage to not live in the past. It's a personal pact, regardless of third-party involvement. 
</li><li><b>The journey beyond forgiveness</b>: Once a decision for forgiveness is made, maintaining the course is crucial. This involves resisting the minds tendency to ruminate about wrongs, to prevent falling into toxic forgiveness  the state of still feeling angry and resentful even after 'forgiveness', thereby maintaining a negatively impacted relationship.
</li><li><b>True forgiveness requires strength</b>: This means having the strength to say "no" when past grievances emerge in your mind, thereby avoiding the creation of a revengeful type of forgiveness where resentment is harbored. 
</li><li><b>Risk of unnatural forgiveness</b>: This form of forgiveness, where the individual still holds angst and continually ruminates on the wrong done, leads to a buildup of toxic emotions that can affect all areas of the relationship, creating tainted, sour dynamics.
</li><li><b>Decision to forgive or not</b>: If a boundary has been significantly crossed beyond reparation, one may choose not to forgive. This decision is up to the individual, and there's no obligation to forgive in such cases.
</li><li><b>The concept of true forgiveness</b>: According to psycho-cybernetics author Maxwell Maltz, true forgiveness is realized when there's no reason to harbor hate or judgement towards the person who wronged you.
</li><li><b>Letting go of the past</b>: Difficulty with forgiveness often stems from being stuck in the past. Being future-oriented, having big dreams, life purposes, and ambitions can help in letting go.
</li><li><b>Life Purpose aiding forgiveness</b>: Having a forward direction in life, specific goals, and a life mission help to avoid petty resentments. When the mind has important issues to focus on, negative thoughts often fade away, making it easier to forgive.
</li><li><b>Developing a sense of life purpose</b>: Establishing one's purpose helps the person to pay less attention to the wrongs done to them, as they are more focused on achieving their goals.
</li><li><b>Decision to forgive</b>: The final step involves deciding decisively to forgive, committing to that decision and not looking back. This is the solution to forgiveness. 
</li><li><b>Self-improvement</b>: Constantly learning about yourself and employing different strategies for growth can enhance all aspects of life. 
</li><li><b>Core principles of a successful, happy life</b>: These include working on oneself, understanding how to live successfully and happily, and fully realizing one's potential.
