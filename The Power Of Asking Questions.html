[Music] in this episode we're going to be talking about
the power of asking questions put simply the quality of
your entire life depends on the quality of the questions
you ask and how consistently you ask them questions are
like magic keys that unlock powerful answers and that's exactly
what you lack in your life the reason you're lost
depressed unfulfilled struggling sabotaging yourself fearful insecure and all the
other problems that you have is because you lack the
answers you lack the understanding and of course that's because
you're not asking the right questions and this is a
very simple thing a very simple technique here and I
just want to take this episode to cement in your
mind the importance of this very basic technique and in
fact if you want to to just get into self-help
and personal development this is a very good place to
start is right here because this is extremely practical and
this just applies to total newbies but at the same
time this is a technique that you'll want to refine
and hone over the years to get to very advanced
levels so sorting out your life requires asking great questions
which is a rare skill it's not a terribly complicated
skill to learn it's not a terribly difficult skill to
learn it's just actually so simple and so basic that
most people ignore it and neglect to do it consistently
and so they're losing a lot of potential growth that
they could otherwise get so here's a key insight for
you the answers to life are inside of you not
outside the way most people think but it doesn't occur
to you to ask and to look inside and because
you don't ask you never receive so I'm talking about
answers like how to be successful or how to follow
your life purpose and how to actualize it and take
it to the next level answers to how to fix
any kind of emotional problems that you have any health
problems answers about how to practice spirituality better how to
meditate better how to fix your relationships how to fix
your money problems these kinds of answers and all you
need to do to get these answers is really to
question more seriously or deeply and that's what I'm going
to show you how to do here today now an
important warning though is that when I tell you that
the answers are inside of you don't misunderstand me this
doesn't mean that now you don't need to read or
watch videos or learn from great masters and teachers and
gurus it's still very important to study external sources you
study that because that gives you the raw data the
raw knowledge sort of grist for the mill but then
what you do is you turn inside inwards rather and
you think for yourself and then you deeply question all
the stuff that you read and learned and heard about
whether it's for me or for anybody else and then
you develop your own answers that are unique to you
and that are true to what you need in your
life right now and of course this is what's so
critical about personal development about spirituality is that you need
to craft a custom path for you that only works
for you in your situation given your strengths given your
weaknesses given your cultural background given your abilities given your
interests and passions and that's different for everybody so just
remember anytime because you're gonna be stuck in in your
life many times you're gonna be stuck in business with
financial problems you're gonna be stuck in relationships or with
spiritual issues just remember that whatever problem you have you
can find the answer within yourself if you ask the
right questions hell you can even google your questions and
find answers and in fact Google is a very powerful
tool that a lot of people just completely ignore Google
to change your whole life if you ask it the
right questions and that's actually a whole separate topic that
I'll I'll shoot an episode on in the futures how
to use Google to transform your whole life you certainly
could and most people don't most people use Google for
all the wrong things in all the wrong ways searching
for all the the stupid stuff which reinforces their all
of their existing problems see Google is an amazing tool
and we live in an amazing time right now where
you have so much information and knowledge at your fingertips
but the problem is is that it's too much it's
overwhelming so how do you filter it down to something
you can use well again asking high-quality questions and it's
also important that your questions are well worded that they're
precise that they're accurate a well worded question is like
an instruction that is sent to Universal Mind so if
you think about Google Google is like this hive computer
mind that stores basically the entire internet in its index
and you can ask your questions and it'll return queries
within seconds well you can do the same thing using
your own mind you can ask your subconscious mind which
is connected to Universal Mind Universal intelligence which is running
this entire show and running your whole life so it's
sort of like you can Google you can google your
own mind universal mind that you're constantly connected to but
that you take completely for granted and that you don't
utilize it's like you've been connected to this Universal database
a hyper intuitive supercomputer and you don't you don't query
it you see that's the problem now I have several
older episodes where I've talked about questioning in some fashion
I have an episode called contemplation where we talk about
how to contemplate it's an important one I have another
one called how to contemplate using a journal that's similar
but we're talking about using a journal in that situation
and then I have one called the the six for
most fascinating questions that a human can never ask that's
also an interesting episode so you might wonder well then
what's the point of this episode well the difference is
is that those were mostly focused on a sort of
existential contemplation you're contemplating philosophical abstract topics they're like what
is reality or what is the self or stuff like
that and that's all great but this this episode here
is about something even more ordinary and more basic and
more practical which is just sort of like ordinary questioning
that has to do with your everyday mundane life so
let me give you some examples of what I mean
now this is a list that I came up with
of 50 or so different questions of course you can
come up with thousands there's literally thousands of very powerful
questions that you can ask for yourself and it will
be one of your homework assignments to develop your own
list but I want to get your mind jogging so
let's look at some of these examples first is what
do I really want that's an extremely powerful question and
I want you to notice with these questions sometimes they're
very simple and basic they seem so basic that they
almost seem childish and yet that's actually what makes them
so powerful and also so flexible because you can apply
these questions in many different situations and also she have
to understand is that you don't just ask one of
these questions once and then you're done though this is
a question like what do I really want you can
ask that question every single year of your life and
you will get new answers going deeper and deeper and
deeper into what you really want out of life so
make sure that you plumb the full depths that these
questions are are making available to you next what is
most important for me in life what is the purpose
of my life what is my highest vision for myself
what is the next level of my life purpose so
this one if you've already found your life purpose you
have to remember that it's not good enough to just
find your life purpose once and then you're done if
you've taken my course it helps you to do that
but you don't just stop there like I talked about
in the course you got to keep taking it to
the next level and really finding your life purpose through
the course is just the beginning of where you're going
to go with that every year you've got to be
asking how do I take it to the next level
next how do I be more creative for you creative
folks in the audience for you artists for you visionaries
how do I be a visionary how do I keep
myself from backsliding why do I backslide at all why
do I have a go backlashes what new product or
service could change the world what does the world really
need right now what causes me to get in a
rut what motivates me what excites me what would I
do if I had no fear or limitation how am
i dishonest with myself what am i avoiding in my
life what ideological positions or beliefs do I cling to
what am i unwilling to let go of in life
why aren't I able to surrender for example if you're
doing spiritual work or you're doing psychedelics some people struggle
with the surrender aspect you can contemplate that and get
an answer why is my mind so active all the
time there's a reason for it it's not an accident
you can discover the answer why do I have emotions
what is the purpose of my emotions I mean you're
experiencing them your whole life every single day you're wrapped
up in your emotions and yet most people don't even
know what an emotion is then it never even occur
to them to ask not me or some book or
some expert but ask yourself I mean hell you're as
close to your emotions as you are to anything if
anyone can discover what emotions are it's you you're the
one experiencing them surely your subconscious mind knows what is
the true purpose of emotions next why are people selfish
why does religion exist why are there so many different
kinds of religion why do people disagree about non-duality I
mean if enlightenment is just a simple binary thing why
so much disagreement why's humanity headed there sorry where is
humanity headed in the future what is my role in
that what is my role in society why do I
judge criticize and complain what's the function of that how
am i failing to take responsibility for my life that's
a very powerful one what does it mean to be
more conscious I mean I talk about consciousness all the
time but do you know what that word even means
you'd have to find it in your own experience next
what are some examples of blank and this blank can
be any kind of abstract term so a lot of
times if you're listening to me or to any teacher
we can use abstract concepts like consciousness or God or
intelligence or awareness or existence or creativity or intuition you
know these very abstract terms that for many different people
they can interpret these terms in a different ways but
a really good way to to understand the teachings better
is to ask yourself what are some examples of this
abstract fill-in-the-blank term and then have your mind supply the
examples that's extremely powerful in fact if you notice in
all of my episodes I give you giant lists of
examples why do I do that because that's how your
mind learns is through concrete examples by hearing lots of
examples your mind because it's an intelligent supercomputer it can
pull out and draw connections and patterns and it can
better understand going from the specific to the abstract it's
much easier to go from the specific to the abstract
than it is to go from abstraction to specifics so
people easily get lost in abstraction next how is my
world view holding me back and a corollary what is
my world view do you even know what your own
world view is explicitly have you explicate Edyta yourself most
people have no idea what their world view is next
why do I love X fill an X with whatever
you want this is a very powerful question because most
people are drawn or attracted to things in life but
they never question why or what is it about that
thing that they're attracted to like maybe you read a
book and you really loved that book but what about
that book is it that you really love can you
actually clarify that and put your finger on it actually
articulate it if you can that's very powerful that's not
just some rationalization for why you love a book that
that tells you something deep about yourself about what you
really value in life see if you go around for
a whole month just asking yourself why do I love
this thing why do I love that thing why do
I don't not like this thing and you keep doing
that over time you're going to actually develop and like
a map and an understanding of the things that move
you and the things that demotivate you next what is
the next stage of evolution for my business or for
my career next what do I truly believe that I
need to have to be happy why do I meditate
a lot of people start meditating but they don't have
a good reason for why they meditate and it's important
to be clear to yourself about why you meditate or
why you do anything really because if you're not clear
about that to yourself then you're gonna not stay with
that habit you're not gonna realize how important it is
to you why do I want this relationship a lot
of people get into relationships for totally wrong reasons and
it makes a big difference if you're conscious of the
reason that you get into a relationship is it for
sex is it for companionship is it because you're lonely
is it because what you're using it to avoid your
spiritual work or whatever next what is the most powerful
question that I could ask what important questions are not
being asked in this situation like maybe you're working on
some business project what important questions are not being asked
you see what I want you to understand here is
I want you to become conscious of the fact that
when you ask a really quality question this question unlocks
something in your mind it has a like an immediate
effect on your consciousness and immediately your subconscious mind goes
into gear and starts to look at the situation in
a way that I didn't look at it before so
just by being like in a business meeting and everybody
there is discussing some proposal just by being the one
who raises his hand and and asks the question like
well guys what important questions are we not asking about
this business proposal immediately everybody they're there the whole like
the tone of the conversation will shift and everyone's mind
will start to wonder like yeah what what are we
missing because we weren't even thinking about the fact that
we were missing anything you see and all the sudden
you can you can now start to see things that
you couldn't see otherwise without having asked that question and
so it is for all the questions on this list
next how do I become successful do you want to
become successful but you don't know how and then because
of this year you're stressed and you're anxious and you're
looking all over the place well how about you trust
that you can turn inwards and discover answers within yourself
now of course also understand that a lot of times
when you turn inwards and ask a question of yourself
the answer will be to go look it up somewhere
so I'm not saying that like for this question of
how do I become successful that you need to generate
all the success strategies and techniques and tips that mankind
has ever developed for success that you need to reinvent
the wheel there no it's just like it might be
for example as simple as like how do I become
successful well I don't know ah but what I do
know is that lots of people have been successful in
the past and probably they've found principles for how to
be successful so those principles must exist within human culture
so let me go find those principles let me go
find a book or a teacher or a seminar and
that's enough to change your whole life right there see
then you go discover the right kind of book which
teaches you the success principles in fact if you're looking
for that book I've got plenty of them on my
book list next question what makes people so effective have
you noticed that some people are way more effective than
others you can always look at that person like maybe
there's one guy in your office who is the most
productive and the most effective one what makes them such
a great salesman or what makes him such a great
leader and then when you ask that question your mind
will then start to observe that guy and what he
does every day you're there you see him in the
office he's doing something what is he doing he's doing
something different and then when your mind choons into that
because you asked the right question then lessons will come
insights will come next how am i unique that's very
important for you to to discover about yourself the ways
in which you are unique and a corollary is how
am I not being true to my uniqueness when you're
not true to your uniqueness you suffer and your life
is not optimal and you don't experience that joy of
self-expression of being who you truly are a lot of
times that's driven by fear but see it's good for
you to be able to discover that so when I
ask you the question of why are not you not
being true to your uniqueness well one answer might be
is because I don't even know what my uniqueness is
okay well then you can ask the question well then
how am i unique and then you can get answers
your mind will supply you with answers and then once
you know that then you can say well yeah I
know the ways in which I'm unique but I can't
do it I'm not doing it because of X Y
Z because I'm afraid I'll be embarrassed or lacking in
confidence or self esteem see then from that you can
say like oh yeah so I'm lacking self-esteem that's the
problem okay well how do I gain more self-esteem that's
another question and then from that you can you can
brainstorm ideas there and maybe that'll lead you to finding
some self-esteem book or whatever which I also have an
epic list if you're interested in that next how do
I become a better leader artist parents or anything whatever
kind of better you want to become how do I
become a better person you could just sit down and
spend an hour contemplating that and you'll get amazing answers
what am I like when I'm at my best what
am I like what I'm at my worst in what
ways am I a devil oh man I love that
question that's such a powerful question if everybody on earth
ask this question seriously we would solve half the world's
problems overnight half the world's Wars and the criminal activity
would cease overnight next how are x and y the
same and how are they different and it's really important
to include both of those components when you're doing this
comparing contrasting there's a lot of times what what people
do is they focus on how two things are the
same and they ignore the differences or they focus on
the differences but they ignore the similarities so always ask
both sides of this coin question next what are some
totally new ways that I could live my life just
sit down and start brainstorming different new lifestyles for yourself
that alone can mmm prop you out of a rut
why am i resisting X there's a lot of stuff
in your life you resist but you probably never question
it why am I afraid of X same thing a
lot of stuff you fear but you never question a
lot of times you fear something that really once you
question it you realize oh that's not a big deal
at all why was I so afraid of that it's
because you didn't question it what would be my ideal
job what will I regret most on my deathbed how
am I being inauthentic and why what am I most
proud of in my life and how could I do
more of that what robs me of energy and passion
how could I use my mind in better ways why
are there so many deluded people in the world and
how could I make sure that I don't end up
like them that's a very powerful question that I constantly
ask myself and I've gotten so much traction with that
question and so many benefits by asking that question over
the course of most of my life it's oh it's
a really good way to avoid self-deception see my three
part series on self-deception next what is the lesson here
you can ask that about all sorts of situations especially
when you have a failure or a problem or you
face some sort of obstacle or you conclude some kind
of project or endeavor always ask yourself what's the what's
the key lesson here and just by asking that question
immediately your mind will start to fill with with lessons
that otherwise even though you win through that situation by
asking the question now you make it explicit rather than
just something that's floating around in the back of your
mind you make it explicit for yourself and then of
course you can write it down as well which then
helps you to remember it to for the future another
great question is what are the top five ideas from
this book that's powerful after you finish reading every book
that you will ever read in your life stop for
a minute stop for 5-10 minutes actually and ask yourself
this question what are the top five ideas that I
learned from this book and then write them down and
you will see you will get way more results from
books just by asking this one question and of course
there's many other questions you can ask in that context
but let's move on what causes me stress and what
is stress anyways what do I admire about that person
there's always people you encounter that you admire but what
specifically can you actually articulate it see if you can
actually articulate it and distill it down to its essence
then that tells you something about yourself because if you
admire that quality in that person well then that tells
you hey the next question that comes up will if
what I admire that person is their generosity or their
lovingness how can I be more generous or how could
I be more loving just like that person and also
what that shows you is of course that you value
generosity and loving us that tells you something important about
your yourself that might be one way in which you're
unique is that you value that while others don't what
lessons could I learn from that person and oftentimes it
could be a negative person so you might see someone
on TV who you hate what lessons could you learn
from that person what lessons could you learn from Donald
Trump see negative examples are all around us and there
are great teaching opportunities but most people are so busy
judging and criticizing the negativity that they see around them
that they completely missed the fact that that's a lesson
somebody they're like Donald Trump is living through hell literally
he's he's living through hell he's sort of like the
Antichrist you might say so you know Jesus died for
our sins the Christians believed and Donald Trump is like
doing the exact opposite of that he's sinning for you
and putting it on public display for the whole world
making an ass out of himself completely embarrassing himself showing
you the the terrible consequences of egotism and unconsciousness and
ignorance and selfishness so he's displaying for you pure devilry
and self-deception and you can learn all those lessons for
yourself as long as you just stop judging him and
Ashley asked the question next what would a permanent fix
for this be a lot of times were busy like
solving problems but we never get to the root of
the problem and so a corollary question to that one
is what is the root of this problem you'd be
amazed how how often this question is not asked to
really sit down alone by yourself and to ask yourself
genuinely what is the root of my blank problem whatever
it is might be a sexual problem might be a
relationship problem might be a spiritual problem your mind will
go straight to the answers as long as you can
tolerate the answers a lot of times the problem is
that we don't want to know the root of a
problem because it's not a convenient next question is what
opportunities am i overlooking if I could get the answer
to any question what question would I ask what makes
me feel creative when am i win am i at
my most creative what would be a more authentic way
of doing this whatever this is what would be a
more authentic way of doing my job what would be
a more authentic way of flirting with women what would
be a more authentic way of relating to my children
what would be a better way of doing this whatever
this is how does this look from another person's point
of view that's a really powerful question that will change
your whole life if you get used to asking in
every situation where you disagree with somebody especially or where
somebody seems crazy to you always remember to ask how
does it look from their point of view actually step
into their shoes and then that that makes huge changes
in how your mind works what top three things would
transform my life if I did them what makes me
come alive why does this trigger me whatever it happens
to be how can I be more aligned with God
if you understand what God is and if you had
an actual direct experience of God then this will be
a very powerful question for you if you've never experienced
God and you just hold it as a belief this
will not be a worthwhile question for you because your
ideas of God are a fantasy but if you really
know what God is there's a lot of good questions
you can ask yourself about that why am i struggling
with blank whatever blank is where can I find the
answers it's a really good question for any problem or
situation that you have how am I being selfish how
do I might make my psychedelic experiences actually stick in
everyday life it's a good question to ask what is
holding mankind back what is the big picture here I
love that question so whenever you get stuck in technical
details or in the weeds or maybe you're reading some
chapter in some book you can always kind of zoom
out by asking the question what is the big picture
here what's the significance of this scientists couldn't really use
to ask that question more often what are the most
common traps here whatever here happens to be like one
of the most common traps with enlightenment one of the
most common traps with meditation one of the most common
traps with starting a business one of the most common
traps in dating one of the most common traps and
having children this is an amazingly powerful question that will
help you to avoid all the worst most common traps
another great one is if this thing that I'm doing
fails what will be the most likely causes of the
failure what am I really good at what's a new
way of seeing this problem that's a very versatile and
powerful question why is my think how is my thinking
how is my thinking about this limited also a very
flexible one who could give me good advice on this
topic whatever the topic is another one I love is
what if my core assumptions are wrong about this situation
what are my core assumptions how could I maybe change
my core assumptions and how would that change how the
situation looks and what I do about it what could
I accomplish if I had more confidence in myself how
am I being reactive and defensive that's a really good
one what am I really trying to say here I
really love that one because a lot of what I
do with my work is I'm always talking to myself
because I'm always trying to articulate insights because that's my
job and that's what I'm interested in but sometimes you
know I get lost just trying to articulate something and
I'm wording it with lots of different sentences and I
just want to like get right to the chase and
so a really good question for that is what am
I really trying to say here when you ask that
your mind usually summarizes entire paragraphs of ideas and insights
into one concise little statement like what am I trying
to say with this entire video see when I ask
myself that my mind goes in a in a very
different direction than where it just was it starts like
open possibilities for which then I can select the most
appropriate one how am i creating this problem whatever the
problem is how can I make this task more enjoyable
that's a really good question how am I being closed-minded
what is the most powerful self help what are the
most powerful self-help techniques how can I become financially independent
what should be the next chapter of my life so
let's stop there with the list I could keep going
and going I mean literally like I said thousands of
these questions exist they're very context sensitive so you need
to come up with your own list you'll be amazed
at the kind of answers that your mind generates to
some of these questions if you just ask now an
important point is that your answers will not always come
right away sometimes they will oftentimes they will but sometimes
not especially if your questions are really deep and profound
sometimes you have to ask the same question over and
over again for weeks for months and even for years
and even sometimes for decades on the really stubborn questions
the really profound ones but you know what I find
is that if there are questions that are really worth
asking for entire years when you finally do get the
answer to it the answers are so profound and so
life transforming that all the years of questioning are totally
worth it and in fact those are my favorite types
of questions those would be the more existential type of
questions but also a lot of them have to do
with your life like you can ask the same question
about like why am i unfulfilled in life for example
you can ask that question for years until one day
you'll finally realize and when you do your whole life
we'll never be the same again and in fact really
that's the only way you will ever become fulfilled in
life is if you get a legitimate personal answer to
that question it's not enough to hear from me I
could tell you right now why you're unfulfilled but it's
not gonna do any good you got to realize for
yourself why you're truly unfulfilled because then you'll be ready
to then do the things that are necessary to truly
become fulfilled so keep asking the questions even if it
takes weeks and months and years and eventually the answers
will come have faith that the answers will come be
patient place your faith in the question place your intent
into it really want to know have a genuine desire
and curiosity often the answer doesn't come to you because
you don't actually want to hear it and it's too
scary and too painful so it takes time for you
to actually grow yourself before you can access the deepest
answers and ask the deepest questions oftentimes you actively avoid
certain questions and answers notice that notice that some questions
are very very scary precisely because you know that the
answers when you are honest with yourself about them will
result in you having to transform your whole life and
of course those are the most powerful ones but of
course they're the ones that you don't usually want to
ask so make sure you ask those push yourself you
know asking these questions can sometimes involve emotional labor one
of the problems with ideologues and dogmatists and fundamentalists will
get stuck on some worldview or some belief system is
that it makes it impossible for them to ask high-quality
questions and this stalls their entire life gums up the
works because their mind is so awesome I'd and what
they're doing is they're defending some kind of ideological position
or some belief system which prevents them from true genuine
questioning powerful questioning so here are my top tips for
you for doing good questioning number one believe that your
questions are important and that they have answers this is
critical a lot of people miss out on the best
questions because they just assume like oh well that's a
sort of silly question that can't possibly be answered and
it can't possibly be important like for example the question
why is there something rather than nothing if you ask
this question of most scientists or highly intelligent people even
they'll just dismiss it say oh well you can't really
know it can't really answer yeah it's one of those
sort of philosophical navel-gazing type of questions but we don't
know it's not possible to know and it's not important
anyways see but by thinking that way you miss out
on the most important question of life or like what
is the purpose of life a lot of people just
say ah well it's subjective it doesn't matter it's just
philosophy and yet it's it's absolutely central to how you
live your whole life so you have to truly like
believe in your questions and that's the only way you're
gonna be able to ask the deepest question for years
the deepest questions for years is if you have like
a sort of a belief that there is a purpose
behind these questions and that it's possible to actually know
and that the it's not only possible to know but
that the knowledge of it will transform your whole life
and it'll be worthwhile secondly be genuinely curious you have
to ask these questions from a non needy place otherwise
you're going to get corrupted responses so genuine curiosity is
very different from wanting to rationalize a situation so a
lot of times you can ask a question and frame
it in a negative way so you have to be
careful so for example you could say you could ask
yourself the question like well why why are evil corporations
screwing over the world that would be a very poor
question because it's frame so negatively and it's so biased
you can tell that there's there's ego and there's sort
of personal wounding there in that question or for example
the question of why is life so unfair that I
can't get laid that's a terribly framed question because it's
negative is coming from the ego it's it's it's coming
from a sort of a wounded place and the only
thing that's gonna trigger in your mind it's not gonna
trigger a genuine answer because here you see you're not
being genuinely curious you're coming too much from your own
selfishness and so of course what your mind what your
ego mind will then come up with is some kind
of rationalization and you'll see them all well I'm yeah
I can't get laid because it's those feminists it's those
feminists and it's those social justice warriors and the there
they're emasculating man and all this see this this is
not a true answer to the question because it's not
you're not genuinely curious to know the answer what you're
what you're asking for is a rationalization of your pre-existing
ideological position which already is assuming that the world is
so unfair and that it's impossible to get laid and
that feminists are the problem so you're already assuming that
so this is what I mean by ideological people not
being able to truly question so be very careful about
that don't just automatically assume that every answer you're monkey
mind comes up with is a high-quality answer it only
works when you're questioning from a sort of a pure
place not from a wounded needy place of course another
important tip for good questioning is that to really do
this you need silent periods where you shut off the
entertainment and all the distractions and just sit by yourself
and really reflect in sort of a peaceful way where
you're not pressured for any kind of results that's usually
when your best answers will come but you see most
people are so busy running around filling their schedule with
social activities and other kinds of nonsense career and work
and chasing stuff that they don't create these silent periods
and so there's no serious questioning and so you can
go kind of on autopilot and just be busy for
a whole year and not ask a single serious question
so your life is just on autopilot doing the same
old stuff and so of course you're not growing another
tip for you is that you got to work on
phrasing your questions well make your questions succinct precise not
wishy-washy that really helps I'm constantly amazed because I answer
so many questions from people literally I answered thousands of
questions if you count all my YouTube comments and my
forum comments and in private messages that I received from
people and I'm amazed at the low quality questions that
I've asked a person with a serious problem often comes
to me but then poor frames her questions so poorly
that it's impossible to help them because of how the
question is framed so really work on your framing and
especially if you want advice and help from busy people
people who are like doing something with their life these
are usually experts gurus and leaders they will give you
advice they will give you really high quality advice but
you need to make sure that you frame your question
the right way not as a as a giant rant
ranting paragraph of telling me your life story like nobody
cares about your life story like distill your whole life
story to one question what is it you want to
know what is it that would solve that for you
what kind of advice do you need be very clear
and specific and then you'll be able to get high-quality
answers from from teachers and gurus and masters be very
careful about not blaming criticizing and negativity when you're asking
these questions that is that is ego that's not gonna
give you genuine answers of course you have to be
very open-minded you have to allow for radical unorthodox answers
a lot of times the answers you get will be
uncomfortable they will be paradoxical they will be counterintuitive they
won't be what you expect and it's easy to somehow
dismiss sometimes you will dismiss the exact answer that you
need simply because it doesn't fit with your existing expectations
or conventional orthodoxies or what your culture taught you or
what your parents told you another tip is of course
trust your highest intuition and trust your own authority the
answers at your own subconscious mind generates are more accurate
ultimately and more true and more authoritative than any kind
of answer you can get from any professor guru or
teacher because your mind knows best what's right for you
as long as you purify yourself and you're not coming
from a needy place then and you're tapping into your
highest intuition then your authority will be will be ultimate
over everybody else now you might wonder below how do
I know that my question will actually get answered what
if my question is impossible to answer won't I be
wasting my time possibly years and the answer is that
ultimately you don't know you don't know it's a somewhat
of a gamble but a deeper answer is that this
is a key insight for you reality is understandable all
of reality is understandable there is a design to reality
it's not random it's not just a hodgepodge of events
and activities and coincidences there's a very deliberate design to
how reality works and how life works and you can
discover the principles and laws behind this design and you
can basically understand everything of course sometimes what that means
is that you will understand that the question you were
asking is a poor question or is a misguided question
or a question based on false assumptions but that in
and of itself to discover that to discover that some
question that has been lingering in your mind is actually
based on false assumptions that's a that's a really valuable
discovery that frees you up to then ponder deeper questions
see and it also clears up various kinds of bad
assumptions that you might have had that's that's really valuable
to discover that so ultimately the way I treat it
is that for me there's no such thing as an
impossible question every question I've answers such impossible questions at
this point in my life that that there's no limit
nothing ceases to amaze me everything is possible I've answered
the most impossible of questions I've answered questions like why
is there something rather than nothing I've answered questions like
why do I exist like what is my purpose here
what is the purpose of life I've answered questions for
myself like what is God and what is truth and
what is time and what is energy and I answered
all these questions and you can genuinely understand all these
things that's what one of the most remarkable things about
life so you will discover that more and more as
you question deeper and deeper and more existentially now of
course it's not enough to just sit down once a
year and to ask a few questions or to sit
down when you're in a real pickle and you're in
some catastrophic situation and you're stuck with some problem and
only then you ask questions that's not good enough you
have to train yourself the whole point of this conversation
we're having is that I want you to train yourself
to ask questions every day habitually in all situations for
the rest of your life that would be a huge
technique right there if you could put that into place
in your life and it's extremely versatile as you can
see because it works in almost all situations for all
problems often times you'll find that your answers come from
totally unexpected sources so a lot of times it'll just
come from your own inner voice from your intuition from
your subconscious mind or from universal intelligence if you understand
what that means a lot of times so in your
own inner voice you'll get the answers but oftentimes you'll
get it from the outer world so you might be
asking yourself the question like how do I become successful
and you in your own mind might not get the
answers maybe you don't truly know you're too ignorant on
the subject but then you go to the dentist's office
and you're sitting in the dentist and then you're just
you're bored and you just look around at the magazines
and you see a magazine it says success magazine fifteen
ways that people become successful like and then you see
that and then your mind says oh yeah that's exactly
what I was asking for and there it is now
is this a miracle is this magic no it's just
that your mind is very selective at what it's looking
for so the whole point of asking questions that it
Prime's your mind to be receptive to all the stuff
that's around you in the world and so a lot
of your answers will literally come from the world people
say something you know your friend or your mom might
be talking to you on the phone and they some
say some some off-the-cuff comment that has nothing to do
with any question that you asked but you realize oh
that answers my question that I had for years that
answers it you know your mind will connect these these
dots for you so oh so what I call serendipity
and what people call synchronicity but you can only activate
this serendipity by asking these questions habitually you see sometimes
the answers will just come totally out of the blue
you'll be in the shower and just the answer will
hit you like a lightning bolt about some question that
you weren't even asking it's a question that maybe you
asked a month ago but then it just hits you
out of the blue a month later in the shower
that's how it tends to work but that's not an
accident that's because you were questioning and so you can
actually cultivate this and then you'll you'll you'll have a
steady stream of answers hitting you every single day that's
what my life feels like I have a hundred new
insights profound insights about life every single day I have
so many of them I'm too exhausted to write them
all down because if if I were doing that I'd
be sitting for six hours every day just writing it's
a it's amazing and it's a bit overwhelming actually so
be careful what you wish for with these questions you
can really really take your life into totally new directions
and so once you get a handle on asking these
questions officially you're not gonna have any more reason to
feel lost in life at a certain point in life
you will be so resourceful by having trained your mind
and also consumed a lot of books and videos and
such you will become so resourceful that you will never
feel lost you will feel confident that no matter what
problem arises or whichever way you get stuck that you
will be able to get the answers and the way
that you develop that confidence is by having spent years
asking these questions training yourself to do it and then
having gotten hundreds of high-quality answers then you will feel
like the universe is your personal Google and it will
answer whatever you want for you that's a very powerful
that keeps you from getting into Rutzen hopeless bouts of
depression and so forth here are some action steps for
you to take away and to do after this episode
number one contemplate the importance of questioning so that you
understand in your own mind the potential of what we're
talking about here number two start a list of all
of your top questions about life make this list hundreds
of questions long make it a thousand questions long number
three determine which questions of these are the ones that
you really care about find your top questions number four
identify any chronic problems and obstacles that you have and
brainstorm some high-quality questions specifically related to that so like
maybe you have a problem with ADHD brainstorm 15 or
50 different questions that you have about that or maybe
you have a problem getting a date brainstorm 50 questions
about that maybe you have a problem with money brainstorm
50 questions for that next make a list of questions
that you're afraid to ask so ask yourself the question
which questions am i afraid to ask and then generate
a list of 50 of them that'll be very powerful
and therapeutic in itself and lastly I want you to
buy a stack of legal pads those yellow legal pads
and pens and leave them lying around your house everywhere
so that you can use them for questioning and be
constantly jotting down new questions throughout your life when you're
in your shower thinking about stuff or driving your car
have a have a legal pad there and you can
jot down your questions and then if you watch my
episode and you keep a commonplace book go check out
my episode about how to keep a commonplace book you
can compile all of your best questions in that commonplace
book the way that I do so if you took
my life purpose course you need to be ask yourself
more questions and more powerful questions to be able to
actualize that if you're a highly creative person an artist
or an entrepreneur you need to be asking way more
questions than you presently are more outside the box questions
deeper questions to be good at what you do if
you want to be a great scientist you need to
get much better at asking quality questions your questions are
not deep enough they're not broad enough and that's holding
you back from making your greatest discoveries if you're doing
spirituality there's a million questions that you should be asking
yourself that I've talked about in the past if you're
a psychonaut you need to get much better at asking
how quality questions that's one of the biggest differentiators between
someone who just does some psychedelics and gets nothing out
of it versus someone who does psychedelics and transforms this
whole life is that the true psychonaut is also really
really good at contemplating questions and that makes the trips
a hundred times more powerful and more productive and useful
in everyday life so it's not just some peak experience
so in conclusion don't take something so basic and simple
as questioning for granted these sorts of basic techniques are
really what account for 80% of your results within personal
development remember that good questioning snowballs over time and it
pays dividends for the rest of your life so it's
worthwhile to do and I'll just leave you with three
of the most life-changing questions that I ever pursued and
asked in my life and that I have answered number
one what is consciousness number two what is reality and
number three what do I really want now of course
I've asked many other questions very amazing questions that have
been answered but these three in particular have probably been
the most most powerful and these are questions that I've
asked for years and sometimes it can take a decade
or more to get the answer but boy is it
worth it so you could try these out for size
but of course you know this is just me everyone's
going to have their own top three questions it very
much depends on your personality and where you are in
your life and so forth so there you go we're
done here please remember to click that like button for
me and come check out actualize that org you'll find
my blog with unique insights and videos that I post
on there check out the book list check out the
life purpose course check out the forum ask your questions
there and the final thing I'll say is that actualize
that order's number one priority is understanding that's my number
one focus in life to me it's even more important
than awakening it's more important than then even embodiment of
awakening or even mastery it's understanding because understanding is the
foundation for everything else if you lack understanding you will
screw up your awakening if you lack understanding you will
screw up your mastery and embodiment of awakening you see
so understanding is the most valuable thing because it grounds
everything else with wrong understanding you're stuck and with accurate
high-quality understanding profound understanding all of life opens up to
you and not only that but really understanding is its
own reward it's not just a means to some end
it is the ultimate end is for you to understand
what the hell everything is what else is there to
do in life but to understand it all and it
is possible to understand it all and of course the
key to understanding is asking quality questions so don't delay
begin today and I'll see you soon in the next
one you
