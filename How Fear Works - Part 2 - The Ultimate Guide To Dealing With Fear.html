[Music] welcome back to the ultimate guide to dealing with
fear part 2 make sure you go watch part 1
where we laid a lot of foundation otherwise let's crack
right into it firstly I want you to recognize that
without fear you'd be dead you wouldn't be alive right
now without it so appreciate that because it's easy to
follow to the sort of trap of thing that fear
is bad and fear is evil you start to demonize
fear and you start to try to reject fear but
really you have to appreciate that fear is there to
serve you to help you to be here right now
you couldn't be here to pursue awakening or spirituality without
fear fear is necessary for base survival and everything else
is predicated upon base survival you being alive all of
your spiritual pursuits they couldn't work otherwise but of course
there's also a way of living life beyond fear so
what we're interested with our work here with actualised is
we're interested in not just base survival for that you
don't need to watch videos you can just go and
do base survival there's people all over the world doing
base survival you don't need to be educated on how
to do it you can go grab a gun you
can go rob people you can go manipulate people you
know whatever you got to do to survive but but
here of course with our work we're interested in going
beyond basic survival so this is where things get interesting
also I want you to recognize not to follow this
trap of blaming other people for being afraid of things
as you go through life you will encounter many people
who are afraid of many different things some of these
things you'll think are silly and ridiculous even you know
how could that person be afraid of that it doesn't
make sense to you but recognize that this is all
relative what you're afraid of is relative to what you
identify with and also relative to how you were raised
what part of the world you're living in what kind
of environment you're in what kind of situation you're dealing
with what kind of upbringing you had what kind of
parents you had so based on all these factors than
many more and based on your genetics and on your
personality and on a million other factors yeah people can
believe in some silly things and the reason that is
is because there's no such thing as like a legitimate
fear versus an illegitimate fear it's relative it all depends
and what I want you to notice furthermore is that
whatever you fear is generally completely irrelevant to somebody else
notice that for example what's the greatest thing that you
might fear in your life if you're a parent that's
probably the death of your child make sense but also
notice that I don't fear the death of your child
at all likewise you probably don't fear the death of
someone else's child at all you don't even think about
it yet when it comes to your child you're so
concerned about it it keeps you up at night it
terrifies you have nightmares over it how can this be
well of course precisely because the very nature of fear
is to be completely self biased go check out my
episode about self bias where I talk about that in
great length but see this is how selfishness operates it's
not interested in what's true because if if the fear
of your child's death was actually true in some deep
sense then everyone would fear the death of your child
but nobody does except you how can that be because
the fear is completely relative to what you identify with
see notice that it might seem like this is sort
of obvious stuff it might seem like well like so
what Lea who yeah of course I fear my child's
death but other people don't so what not so what
this is a very important fact about your fear it
tells you something that about your fear thee that you
don't recognize which is that your fear is basically imaginary
you're projecting that onto the situation its relative speaking of
of ridiculous and relative fears there's a funny story I
remember when I was a kid I was maybe 10
years old and my grandmother who passed away since then
I mean now she's passed away but but back then
this was like maybe 20 years ago even maybe 25
years ago she would come and visit us and she
would stay at her house and a couple of times
this happened and when I was a kid I had
this I had this favorite rubber snake toy that I
got like at school somewhere I forgot where I got
it it was a very lifelike snake but still sort
of cartoony it wasn't too lifelike you could tell it
was obviously not you know you'd never confuse it with
a real snake but it had this really cool like
rubber material that it was made of so it was
very lifelike when you wiggled it around again in a
sort of a cartoony way I guess it was almost
an over exaggerated version of a snake and some some
reason I was playing with this thing I discovered that
my grandmother was just deathly afraid of these snakes she
had it like a terrible phobia over it and whenever
she saw this rubber snake that I was playing with
she would just freak the [ __ ] out if
she was in the same room with that thing I
found this so amusing and of course it you know
I couldn't understand how anyone could be afraid of this
thing because I to me it was a toy and
of course this goes to show the relative nature of
fear but she was so afraid of it that I
would love my favorite thing was to play this gag
on her would I would I would sneak this snake
into like her bed or into the toilet or other
places in the house where I knew she would be
and she would kind of like find it there and
when she found it she would just start screaming and
just like hitting it with a pillow like she would
freak out like it's a real snake and I just
found this to be so ridiculously amusing this was like
my greatest amusement was was tricking her with that snake
because it didn't make sense to me how anyone could
be afraid of this damn snake is obviously a toy
and yes she was having this these real reactions to
it which again just goes to show you their whole
relative nature of this and how much your imagination plays
into whatever you fear now of course if we go
back into her childhood and her upbringing maybe she had
like a bad encounter with a snake I don't really
know I never asked her what the deal was but
maybe you know maybe she saw real snakes and maybe
a snake bit her or whatever that made her so
fearful of them so let's sort of get to the
really fundamental core of what fear is about let's go
even deeper than we went in part one existentially what
is it that you ultimately fear I don't just mean
a particular fear you have but I mean fear in
general when you're fearing anything what does it all ultimately
boil down to ultimately it all boils down to fear
of yourself oddly enough that's very counterintuitive you might wonder
well why would I fear myself and after all Leo
if I'm if I'm fearing something like a snake or
if I'm fearing somebody killing my child or whatever how
is that fear of myself this doesn't make sense except
it does once you have a proper understanding of what
a self is and what you as the self ultimately
are see the problem is right now you have a
very limited identity a very limited notion of what a
self is so if you take yourself to be this
physical human creature sitting here then yeah in this sense
it doesn't make sense how you could fear yourself but
what I'm talking about is the self with a capital
S I'm talking about the ultimate awakened enlightened self your
true self what is that that is the entire universe
you are consciousness manifesting itself as the entire universe not
just this physical body everything including inanimate objects and other
people animals planets stars everything and way beyond that way
more beyond that and of course if you take this
very expanded infinite sense of self your largest identity then
that thing that thing includes everything that you hate and
that you fear all the stuff you don't like about
reality all the evil stuff it includes the murder and
the rape and the theft and the genocide and the
terrorism and the war and the environmental destruction and the
the the violence and the carelessness and the way that
people treat each other in such bad ways the manipulation
the scheming the various power hierarchies giant corporations religions cults
closed-mindedness all of that evil [ __ ] that you
don't like about the world that you're afraid of and
that you want to keep at an arm's length away
from you that all of that is yourself now of
course that's still not all of yourself that's just a
little part of yourself you're much much bigger than all
of that but that's what your ultimate ly terrified of
sea consciousness is terrified of itself because what consciousness is
is it's infinite it's everything it's unlimited which means it's
the good it's the bad it's the beautiful and it's
the ugly it's all dualities it's everything you can imagine
and much much more and since in the end the
highest truth is oneness or non duality that means that
nothing exists but you the self is the only thing
that exists you do this work long enough you become
conscious enough you realise that but there's nothing in this
universe but you because you're the entire universe and so
due to this all fear ultimately boils down to self
fear what you fear is your own scope your own
infinite scope terrifies you and that's the whole challenge of
life existentially speaking is that you're born and you start
to identify as this little creature this weak fragile little
human creature this baby this child and you're growing up
and then you're still identifying with that then even as
an adult you're still identifying with that and you're stuck
with this very limited identification and you're terrified of all
the stuff around you you might be scared of the
dark you might be scared of snakes you might be
pretty scared of airplanes but as you grow more and
more and more through life you you know your childhood
fears you outgrow them you're no longer scared of the
dark the way you used to be maybe you outgrow
your phobia of snakes maybe you get over your fear
of airplanes maybe you get over your fear of being
poor you get over your fear of the opposite sex
you get over your fear of marriage you get over
your fear of children having children and all of this
and this you're growing you're experiencing more of life and
you're you're coming to accept more and more of it
until you reach a point where you realize it's not
just that you're becoming less fearful it's that what's actually
happening that entire time is that your entity is expanding
and expanding and expanding and you're accepting more and more
and more of reality as it actually is rather than
denying it or resisting it or rejecting it or judging
it or hating it you're embracing more and more of
it until finally you realize that what you really are
is you are infinity itself the infinite universe itself you
are all of the stuff that you hated and were
afraid of and at this point what happens is that
the distinction between self and other disappears and you merge
back into the entire universe the limited becomes unlimited but
that process of the limited moving towards the unlimited and
finally breaking through and accepting it and merging into it
that entire process that is what we call life that's
what's happening to all people and then the only question
is how smoothly does that process work for you are
you resisting it and are you being like a stubborn
mule as life is pushing you towards realizing your full
infinite self but you're resisting it and holding on to
areas ideologies or you're denying it in some way because
you're scared see it's very scary to recognize what you
are and so ultimately what's happening here in life is
that God is becoming aware of itself you are becoming
more and more aware that you are God and that
you created this entire universe and you are being forced
by the truth to accept your true nature which is
the infinite universe which includes all that ugly stuff that
was threatening to you when you were younger and so
you need to be very strong and courageous in order
to be able to accept what you really are whereas
most people are in denial about what they really are
they don't want to accept their God it's too much
of a responsibility it's too threatening it's too scary to
their limited little identity and so for most people what
they do what they have is they have a very
fixed sense of other theirs like myself and then there's
the other out there and you know myself doesn't just
include my body but includes my family my tribe my
nation my religious identity my culture and all that and
then everything that's not that is other and then that's
what's being defended and so fear arises precisely because that
sense of other has been created but see to realize
that you are God means that you have to shed
this notion or sense of other and that's what life
is all about how you define self versus other and
this we're told that this is a physical thing but
there's a physical boundary between myself and then the other
but of course this is purely an imaginary boundary and
that's the thing that freaks you out to discover this
is why when people take psychedelics and that boundary between
self and other is dissolved it scares them it scares
a [ __ ] out of them they think they're
going crazy too they think they're losing their mind they're
thinking they're having some sort of psychotic break you're not
having a psychotic break actually your psychosis is thinking that
there is a difference between you and other that's the
psychosis the truth is that there is no such difference
but that's very scary so as it turns out fear
of self is identical to fear of other is identical
to fear of reality is identical to fear of God
it's identical to fear of consciousness is identical to fear
of truth and it's identical to fear of love because
all those things ultimately are identical and that's what you
really fear you fear the enormity of what you are
because what you are is so epic and so enormous
that it's difficult for consciousness to accept itself going from
the very limited form to the totally unlimited form so
ultimately how do you transcend fear by expanding your sense
of self and that's what this work ultimately boils down
to that's all we're doing throughout all these videos is
we're trying to expand your sense of self and as
you do that you should fear less and less until
finally you reach a point where the difference between self
and other completely collapses and when this happens all feel
all fear will disappear but that's a very radical state
of consciousness to get to most people will never experience
this in their life so of course in practice they
have a lot of fear God is the total absence
of fear it's total self-acceptance it's the total absence of
other in other words God is identical to oneness infinite
love to truth to selflessness to freedom to consciousness to
immortality and to liberation and to peace that's what God
is its consciousness which has totally accepted itself while you're
in human form while you're in the ego mind you
are consciousness which has not fully accepted itself its consciousness
which isn't conscious of what consciousness is whereas God is
consciousness which is infinitely conscious of what consciousness is that's
the only difference so right now you are God but
you don't know that you're God you're not conscious that
you're God you're not conscious that you're designing your entire
body and that you're dreaming up this entire scene that
you're sitting in this entire room is something you're dreaming
up right now it's something you're hallucinating but you don't
experience it as such you're not conscious enough to experience
that nor are you conscious enough to realize that you
are me talking to you there's no leo here you
invented me your mind is inventing me right now and
it's inventing all these words and so really you're just
talking to yourself and it's this that you're afraid of
realizing at a very very deep level and you can
realize it at ever deeper levels the deeper you go
the more fear you will shed and then until ultimately
you will reach a state where you will be totally
fearless because you will have completely transcended any kind of
limited identity so if you're wondering is it possible to
be totally fearless the answer is yes but not in
your current state of consciousness it requires a radically expanded
non-dual state of consciousness it requires a deep awakening more
than one multiple deep awakenings and then even then even
after that it requires a lot of follow-up work because
when we're talking about being totally fearless we're not just
talking about having an awakening we're also talking about rewiring
your entire mind all the habits from birth you know
decades of habits this is this is very challenging to
do even after our own awakening most people will still
experience fear because your mind has not been rewired now
begins the process of emotional mastery which which is even
harder than awakening so in practice realistically the only people
who will ever transcend fear entirely are hardcore mystics like
Jesus or Buddha and even in their case I don't
know how much they totally transcended fear it's hard to
know personally I've been in states of consciousness that had
no fear in them whatsoever there was no fear of
death there was no fear of pain there was no
fear of suffering all the worst stuff that you think
would be natural for a human to fear it was
completely gone but that's not a state of consciousness that's
easily sustained the thing here though is to not get
stuck on being a perfectionist you might hear me saying
this you might say well leo then then it won't
be you make it sound like I'm never gonna achieve
this this is something super rare well first of all
it is super rare how often do you find a
totally fearless person almost never so of course it has
to be super rare and as far as you not
achieving it you probably never will but that's not important
because what's more important is not to reach some sort
of Jesus Christ level of consciousness but simply to improve
your situation and your situation can be improved a lot
when it comes to fear right so even though you
might never reach a point in your life where you're
totally fearless it's okay you can still improve a lot
and that will reduce a lot of suffering in your
life make your life a lot better mmm make your
survival a lot easier a lot smoother so that's what
we're really talking about here I don't want you to
get caught on this trap of perfectionism the reason that
it's unrealistic for the average person to transcend fear is
simply because as long as you think that you have
something important to lose in life you will be afraid
basically if you want to be fearless what you have
to do is you have to completely surrender your whole
life everything you have to surrender every single desire every
single attachment that you have you have to stop caring
about the about whether you live or die if the
stop caring about whether your children live or die you
have to completely detach from everything and the average person
simply isn't willing to do that nor are they willing
to put in the decades of practice that are necessary
to actually rewire themselves to reach that point it's an
extremely radical decision to make in your life and then
to actually do it it takes a very special kind
of character the average person is not going to do
this even the average person who watches me and listens
to me is not going to ever do this it's
too much to ask for but nevertheless it's good to
put this out there so that you understand that it
is a possibility so you know don't let me limit
you if you're really serious about becoming a Buddha or
a Christ you can do it but you're gonna have
to devote your whole life to it and realize that
the cost it's not something that you're gonna be able
to do while maintaining your old life as it was
this is gonna be a complete transformation of your whole
life you're choosing to to willfully surrender your whole life
are you interested in that see probably not I'm just
laying it out in realistic terms for you so that
you're not kidding yourself because a lot of people to
get into this awakening work and then they think oh
well I'm gonna become this this Jesus or this Buddha
figure I'm gonna be fearless and I'm gonna be invincible
and immortal well are you willing to sacrifice for that
are you willing to make the ultimate sacrifice which is
stop caring about whether you're alive or not that's what
it's gonna take so you know it's very radical understand
that it's radical also this explains why it's so rare
why most people think it's impossible it's not impossible it
just seems impossible because it's so radical that so few
people do it that for the average person it might
as well be impossible because they're so attached to life
as they've lived it to the way that they were
raised to their friends their family to their religion to
their culture to their science to their beliefs to their
ideas they're so attached to this stuff that it's it's
a it's a joke to even talk about fearlessness with
these people these people will always be afraid because they
always have something that their claim to that they're afraid
of losing you might wonder well Leo what about you
do you ever experience fear or are you totally fearless
now and of course the answer is yes I experienced
fear I experienced plenty of fear but then you might
wonder well Leo then doesn't that make you a hypocrite
and how do you really know that it's even possible
to transcend fear if you haven't even done it yourself
well first of all recognize that I'm still in the
early stages at this work I'm working on myself all
the time I'm doing various practices and so I have
a lot more room for growth I've not maxed out
by any means but secondly I've been in states of
consciousness where I have transcended all fear and I have
seen through fear as an illusion all fear is ultimately
untrue in the absolute sense so that's how I know
that it's possible but I don't live from that level
of consciousness 24/7 I'd have a lot more work to
do to achieve that so I'm nowhere near that but
of course again it's not about being perfect it's not
so much about living from that state of conscious it's
just about improving your situation I'm a lot less fearful
of life than I was ten years ago or five
years ago and that's really the most important thing and
this is where this stuff gets practical right for most
people becoming a Buddha or not practical but becoming a
lot less fearful in your business in your relationship in
your career and so forth that's very practical and we're
gonna talk about that in this episode coming up here
recognize their many degrees of fear right you know some
people are so afraid they're afraid to leave their house
some people are so afraid they're afraid to look another
human in the eyes some people are so afraid that
they don't even like approach a stranger and ask them
for help or they don't even talk with their neighbors
because they're afraid of social situations or they're afraid of
approaching some woman that they that they see at the
grocery store that they are attracted to but they're too
afraid to approach her and just start a conversation you
know there's this sort of basic stuff this this we
can really work on or like you're afraid to go
off and start your business or start working on that
life purpose of yours this is stuff that we can
work on and this is very practical and this will
improve your life a lot you should also distinguish here
between overcoming specific fears versus transcending fear as a whole
these are really different pursuits because you have many unique
specific fears hopefully did that homework assignment from part one
and you've identified and you're more familiar with the various
fears that you have and you can tackle fears individual
like maybe have a fear of snakes or a fear
of airplanes or a fear of going broke you can
work on each of those individually but no matter how
many of those you squash you will still not transcend
fear as a general dynamic in your life because to
transcend that requires doing very deep existential work having various
awakenings but nevertheless it can still be useful to work
on specific fears that are holding you back in life
like maybe you have some fear within your marriage or
within your relationship that's ruining your relationship and by fixing
that you can make your marriage or your relationship work
much better that's great but recognize that you're sort of
in a sinking ship and you're plugging one hole at
a time and new holes are being created every minute
so that you're playing a game and you're never really
gonna win so long as you're doing that you're still
basically stuck in the loop of survival by squashing one
fear at a time most people will go through life
and they will resolve certain specific fears they've had and
you're probably like this they're probably fears that you had
10 years ago that you don't have anymore and now
you think about them you look back at the situation
and you laughing like all its it's funny it's it's
crazy that I used to fear this thing which now
I no longer fear you can probably think of some
of those but notice that your life is still dominated
by fear you have hundreds of micro fears every day
and then you have still many macro fears and this
will keep happening and in fact what I'm saying is
that no matter how many fears you squash there will
still be more fears for you to squash because the
problem is that you're not tackling the root of the
problem you see you're dealing with specific fears finite fears
but the problem is that reality is infinite so there's
gonna be an infinite number of stuff for you to
fear so by coping or resolving each one individually you
know like maybe you fear airplanes so you fix that
okay now you fear snakes so you fix that but
then you fear aliens and you know may humans encounter
aliens let's say in the next thousand years and so
you fear aliens let's say you fix that well then
there's another species of aliens how many speeches of aliens
are there that could threaten humanity probably millions of them
given how many stars and galaxies there are in the
universe and then maybe there are universes beyond that so
I mean like you're always gonna have something you're afraid
of you see so this is a never ending game
unless you go to the root and you completely surrender
your life and then then there's a chance that you
can you can kind of grasp infinity as a whole
and surrender to infinity as a whole and then at
that point well there's the possibility of eliminating all of
these fears in one fell swoop but of course it's
not really gonna be in one fell swoop you're gonna
do decades of work to get there and you're gonna
surrender your whole life is fear a thought you might
wonder obviously thought contributes to fear but are they the
same thing and the answer is no I want you
to notice through mindfulness work that fear is a feeling
you feel it in your body it's a distinctive feeling
it's distinct from anger it's distinct from happiness it's distinct
from sexual arousal it's distinct from frustration it's fear that's
what that word refers to a feeling in your body
so the best way that you can get a sense
for what fear is is to feel it in your
body now of course thoughts contribute to that feeling when
that feeling arises is determined by what you're thinking and
how much you're thinking it and what kind of mental
imagery you're conjuring up in your mind but ultimately those
thoughts create that feeling now of course that feeling can
also then create thoughts of its own which kind of
creates a vicious circle but fear is a feeling so
recognize that and try to distinguish it from other feelings
this takes mindfulness practice and this is important to practice
this because a lot of people will confuse anger with
fear as though they're the same thing and so they're
the one type of feeling they're not but you got
to go inside and feel yourself in those different situations
to distinguish those two another common question that comes up
here with regards to fear is as follows is there
truth behind fear or is all fear inaccurate perception what
about situations where my fear is justified what if a
situation is actually legitimately dangerous then isn't it legitimate that
I fear it here's where it's important to distinguish between
absolute truth and relative truths so in the absolute sense
all fear is false and it's inaccurate perception but in
the relative sense fear can be a valuable indicator of
something that's going to be harmful or dangerous to whatever
you identify with being so in that sense yes you
can be justified to fear certain things and in certain
other fears could be unjustified we might say for example
if you're an American is it a justified fear to
fear that America is gonna be invaded by some foreign
country like Iran or Iraq or North Korea no because
America has by far the largest military force of like
the top ten other countries combined more than Russia China
Brazil and India and Pakistan all combined the US has
more firepower so the chances of America getting invaded are
very small so this fear would be a rather irrational
fear but now if you lived in North Korea is
there al is it a justified fear to fear that
North Korea would be invaded by a foreign country yes
of course because North Korea is completely overpowered by China
by South Korea and the u.s. relationship there's various kinds
of powerful alliances that are aligned against North Korea so
there's a there's a reasonable chance that North Korea might
get bombed in the next 50 years by some American
backed coalition so from North Korea's point of view that's
a legitimate fear they have to be concerned about that
see so it is important to make these kinds of
relativistic distinctions but in the ultimate sense if we're talking
about existentially speaking spiritually speaking even when a fear is
justified so to say so to speak it's still ultimately
untruthful because it's relative to your survival yes if you
live in North Korea and you're let's say a dictator
in North Korea yes if you want to if you
want to maintain your dictatorship if you want to maintain
your life relative to that identity that you have that
you cling to yes then you should be very afraid
of Americans and South Koreans and maybe the Chinese and
so forth but but if you give that up then
you shouldn't be afraid see now the problem though is
of course nobody is willing to give up their life
nobody is willing to give up their comfy little position
no dictator is willing to leave his dictatorship of his
own free will and oftentimes he can't because he'll be
killed so in the situation to even entertain the idea
of giving all this up is is a non-starter for
most people unless they're interested in spiritual work in which
case then it becomes a serious possibility and it's not
just a joke another question that comes up is isn't
it dangerous to eliminate fear if we eliminate all fear
what will keep us alive well here's where it's really
radical here's where you got to bite the bullet understand
that when we're talking about eliminating all fear if you
successfully eliminate all fear what this means is that you
no longer care whether your life literally you no longer
care if you still care you haven't eliminated all fear
so as long as you're attached to life you will
fear so even to ask this question like will Leo
but what's going to keep me alive if I get
rid of fear the answer is nothing and you have
to accept that answer and you have to say okay
well fine then I'm fine with that if you're still
saying no that's terrible well Leo then I'm not gonna
eliminate all fear because I want to stay alive if
you think that way then you're gonna be afraid for
the rest of your life you haven't understood how deep
this goes you're too afraid of surrendering your life you
see so of course you're not wanting to accept the
the radical things that I'm saying here but there's there's
a second little element here and even a third one
which will kind of take the edge off so I'm
not saying you have to literally physically die in order
to eliminate this fear I'm saying you have to be
willing to now to be willing to to surrender to
the idea that you will die is different than actually
dying you see so you can surrender to the idea
of it without necessarily having to shoot yourself in the
head for example and so this other element here is
the thing that's going to keep you from danger if
you get rid of fear is consciousness and awareness and
wisdom these turn out to actually be more effective at
safeguarding you than fear and that's what people overlook a
lot of people think that well if I get rid
of my fear then nothing's gonna protect me well that's
because you've been living your whole life using this very
crude way of surviving a very crude motivation called fear
and it is work to some extent but it can
only get you so far if you want to go
beyond that if you really want to get good at
survival actually what you need is not fear but consciousness
and wisdom because it's more effective in the long run
and so if you're wondering like well if some enlightened
master like Jesus or Buddha if if he's eliminated all
fear then how does he stay alive to a ripe
old age well not Jesus of course but let's say
Buddha Buddha lived supposedly into his 70s or 80s how
did he do that well because of consciousness and wisdom
you don't need to be terrified of a thing in
order to avoid it you can just recognize that well
that's like a dangerous object and I should steer clear
of that thing I shouldn't stick my hand in a
fire not because I'm terrified - not because it's gonna
produce a bunch of pain but simply because I recognize
that if I stick my hand in that fire then
I'm gonna have a problem on my hands I'm gonna
have to go to a hospital I'm gonna have to
pay money to get my hand fixed I'm not gonna
maybe it may be I lose my hand and I
won't be as effective at doing the stuff that I
need to do so it doesn't fit with my plans
for the future of my life and through this consciousness
and wisdom you can avoid sticking your hand in the
fire you see it's more like a positive motivation than
a negative motivation and it's much better to live your
life from a positive motivation another thing that will keep
you from harm is caution healthy caution and here we
need to now make the distinction between fear and caution
fear remember I said is a feeling in your body
it's the feeling of being afraid caution is just the
recognition the consciousness that something might be dangerous or harmful
to you so it's the following difference I can be
terrified of bears for example versus I can be cautious
of bears when I'm walking through the forest you see
the difference there if I was walking through the force
and I was fearful of bears that means I would
actually have the feeling in my body I would be
tensing up out anxious I would have be having images
of bears chasing me and biting me and killing me
this would be legitimate fear whereas if I was cautious
let's say for example I went hiking or camping for
a week out in the wilderness in the bush in
Alaska where there are lots of bears and I brought
a gun with me because I was conscious and wise
you know I read the books I read this and
I read the newspapers I know that there's plenty of
bears in Alaska so of course I bring a gun
with me just in case just spook them off let's
say if I see one in the woods he's coming
at me at least I could fire the thing in
the air maybe not even at him but just in
the air just to to make some loud sound and
spook him off and then in the last case resort
I would shoot him in the face if he came
close enough okay well see in this case I bring
the gun not because I have a like a crippling
fear in my chest but because preemptively I kind of
thought about the situation I recognize the potential dangers that
are involved here and I want to be able to
survive this camping encounter I want to come back home
after a week right I don't want to die there
so I make a conscious decision that y'all bring some
firepower with me that's the difference between fear and caution
see I can be cautious without feeling fear caution is
about anticipating likely obstacles and threats another example for you
is using a condom you can put on a condom
as a guide out of caution you don't need to
be feeling fear in your heart or in your belly
right before sex and then that's the thing that gets
you to put on the condom you don't need that
in fact most people I think when they put on
a condom they're not deathly afraid they put on the
condom as just a precaution because they know how this
process works they know the danger of pregnancy and all
this and so they just put it on contrast that
now with somebody who didn't use a condom and then
the morning-after you know they're terrified oh oh you know
what happens if I got her pregnant and then now
you're actually afraid now you actually experience the fear in
your chest and your belly you're actually worried you're having
images of this pregnancy that you maybe don't want and
all these problems that comes with that all the hassles
of it see that's the difference between caution and fear
for example when I started actualised org I sat down
and identified what are the various problems that I could
encounter with my business that could derail my business and
one of the things I came up with was that
you know what if my computers were broken my hard
drives crashed and I lost all my data because you
know my business is very data driven all my videos
are stored all my notes and all this stuff so
a lot of important stuff is stored on hard drives
so I identified that as a potential obstacle and threat
and then I you know I wasn't afraid of this
in some crippling sense I wasn't having nightmares over this
I wasn't like feeling it deep in my belly I
just identified it rationally as a as a serious potential
obstacles you know computers crash hard drives crash sometimes that
are stolen sometimes there's a fire or something so what
I did is I just I installed a special backup
system like a backup unit which sucks the data from
my main hard drives into the backup hard drives so
I installed that you know I paid a couple thousand
dollars for it I need a lot of hard drive
space to back stuff up it's not in the cloud
it's my own system I had to engineer that thing
I had to figure out how it all works had
to set it all up so that it works how
to test it and make sure that it's reliable so
yeah that took some investment and it took some time
and energy and all that and now I have that
system so see this is a good example of caution
versus fear you know speaking of fear and and bears
in the woods actually one time I wanted to go
tripping on LSD in the woods with my girlfriend at
the time ex-girlfriend now and so we went on this
road trip to a big national park and this was
a giant national park there was lots of forest lots
of mountains high up in the mountains and so we
drove around this thing and we found a good spot
where we could try we wanted to do it like
a nice trip throughout the the afternoon and so we
found this nice little spot high up in the mountains
those very secluded there was no people there it was
like a little pond a little lake and there was
a big forest and mountains there and all that and
so I was cautious though because I knew that you
know if I was tripping with her and I was
in the middle of a deep trip you know this
place has bears in it so I planned it out
and I thought about like we're gonna do it like
this we're gonna sort of set up old picnic area
by the pond and we're gonna be rather close to
the car in case we need to be and she's
gonna get a full dose of LSD but I'm only
gonna trip on like a quarter of a dose because
I want to have my wits about me just in
case there are bears so that I can I can
have like some some sense and so that I could
be capable in that situation be able to manage that
situation and so that's what we did and we tripped
all day long I only took a little a little
minor dose so I still had my wits about me
she took a big dose she had a great trip
and throughout that time at moments I was a little
bit scared that maybe the bear will hopeful creep up
on us or something like that and and nothing like
that happened and it was great and then at the
very end of that day it was started the Sun
is starting to set and our trip was almost over
we were both coming down it was great it was
beautiful and we just went and started to hike around
we went up to on this little hill and we
just kind of hiked up there and we were just
talking and kind of walking and just getting ready to
go back home and then we hear footsteps heavy footsteps
in the bushes right in front of us and we
both pause and we just kind of like look at
each other like did you just hear that or am
i tripping and she looked at me and I looked
at her and we were just like we were transfixed
and then the footsteps they keep getting closer and louder
and this is like some big footsteps this is a
big animal we don't see any animal we just see
like and rustling in the bushes and it's coming closer
to us and I'll tell you like at that point
I was I was truly terrified like that was real
fear that's real fear right there because I knew this
was not good she was also quite terrified and we
were still both a little bit on the LSD but
this was definitely not some mere hallucination and then what
I started to do I grabbed him I had a
hiking stick I grabbed the hiking stick and I started
to like hit a tree really loud and started to
yell him to scream just to make a lot of
noise and then we kind of like listened for the
footsteps and they stopped for a while and then about
thirty seconds later they continued and they're coming closer and
closer to us and we were just so we're so
terrified at that point that we just we just hauled
all ass off that off that hill and we ran
back and quickly grabbed all our picnic gear and all
that stuff and we just ran back to the car
and we made it out of there we never saw
the bear but my guess is that it was probably
a small prep small black bear probably not a grizzly
bear a small black bear we never saw it but
it was definitely there and if we stay don't stick
around it probably would have come at us so you
know that just sort of illustrates to you the difference
between how fear and caution works so you have to
be careful here so when we're talking about being fearless
don't get the idea that you should be reckless and
that you shouldn't take seriously certain relative obstacles when you're
living life when you're trying to survive and that is
what you're doing most of the time there are relative
obstacles to your life that you need to watch out
for sometimes it comes in the form of a bear
sometimes it comes in the form of of a person
that you need to be careful of because he's a
dangerous person but you shouldn't be associated with or am
I come in the form of a business danger that
comes down the road for your business yeah you got
to take some of these seriously as long as you
care about your business as long as you care about
your relationships as long as you care about your life
relative to that so just realize that it's relative to
that it's not absolutely true it's relatively an obstacle to
that attachment that you have and that's okay cuz you're
still gonna have many of these attachments most likely for
a long time to come all right let's move on
to some more questions but Leo doesn't God want us
to fear him otherwise what would prevent us from sinning
absolutely not any religion or spiritual teaching based on fear
is a corruption is a falsehood is a delusion is
ego is devilry God does not want you to fear
him God loves you no matter how much you sin
you might wonder well Leo why would God love me
if I sin because God is conscious that it's you
see unlike you who thinks that you are separate from
God and that God is something other than you God
knows that it's you so how can God judge you
if God is you anything sinful that you do is
God doing it and God is too conscious to judge
or hate to hate itself so it can't hate you
God accepts your sins as its own perfection so it's
really you who is judging you for your sins not
God you're projecting your own judgment of your sins onto
God because you think God would judge you and the
reason you think God would judge you is because you
you've painted God to be a devil like you are
a devil judges but God is not a devil so
God doesn't judge now you might wonder but why do
so many religions teach fear if God is all love
because most major religions are corrupt there are about power
they're not about truth they're not about love because of
projection because the people who are running these major religions
are themselves not conscious of what God is so instead
what they're doing is they're just acting out from their
ego from their ideas of what God is and their
ideas God is just some bearded man in the clouds
who looks down upon you and judges you this is
a very childish simplistic and false notion of God it's
a projection so the people who teach the organized major
religions are themselves Devils and egos and they project their
own devilry and ego and fear onto God they project
their own judgment onto God so if some Christian evangelical
preacher is afraid of homosexuality and thinks that it's evil
and bad he judges he hates it he then projects
his own hatred and fear of homosexuality onto God and
then he teaches you that God hates homosexuals of course
nothing could be further from the truth because God is
homosexuals God loves homosexuals but you know good luck convincing
the preacher of this and the reason the preacher can't
understand this is simply because he's not conscious enough to
know what God is he's not speaking from direct experience
of God he's just speaking from the dogma and the
ideology that he's picked up when he was a kid
and now he's just preaching that so he knows not
what he preaches he doesn't actually understand the true teachings
of Christ because if he did he would never portray
God as a judger or a hater or someone who
punishes you for your sins because this is completely the
opposite of what God is this is a bastardization of
God this is actually a demonization of God and the
reason the religions teach fear is because these religions have
been watered down for egos for simple folk these major
religions they basically understood that serious enlightenment is unattainable for
the masses and so what we need to do is
we just need to lead to water down the teachings
of enlightened masters to ordinary folks but the teachings of
enlightened masters are so radical the truth and love is
so radical God is so radical that how do you
teach it how do you teach you to close minded
people how do you teach it to egotistical people how
do you teach God to devils by turning God into
a devil that's the only way that Devils will accept
God is if they start to treat God as a
devil and that's exactly what Muslims do Christians do Hindus
do they've turned God into a devil because they themselves
are Devils they have to turn God into something bring
it down to their to their own level you see
that's the that's the twisted irony of how religion works
now when it comes to science you might think well
scientific method surely is above fear but the answer is
no it's not science fears many things contrary to this
kind of silly naive notion of science as being this
hyper rational objective activity it's not science is highly subjective
and it's it's permeated by fear fear of what what
do scientists fear they fear mysticism they fear magic they
fear the paranormal they fear God they fear falsehood they
fear losing credibility they fear psychedelics they fear idealism they
fear relativity they fear subjectivity they fear emotions they fear
irrationality these are all common fears that scientifically-minded people have
now of course they will deny these fears they will
try to couch these fears in rationalism as though it's
like well leo but it's rational to not want these
things I don't fear God it's just that God doesn't
exist Leo I don't fear the paranormal is just the
paranormal is [ __ ] but actually that's fear masquerading
as rationality see here you have to be very careful
about how your own mind tricks you into rationalizing your
fears as something that's objective and factual and true when
actually it's it's more emotional than factual it's more subjective
than objective that's what scientists are largely in denial about
they're afraid to admit of the subjective underpinnings of science
a scientist you have to remember is committed to the
survival of science that's his identity so you better believe
that anything that threatens that identity he's going to fear
and be defensive about and gonna be in denial about
and that's exactly what corrupt science so the same stuff
that corrupts religion also that those same dynamics corrupt science
just in a different way you see in all of
these cases what's happening is that and unlimited identity is
being constructed whether a religious one or a scientific one
and then whatever you construct and you identify with that's
the thing that you're gonna be defending and the thing
that you're gonna be scared to lose hmm now let's
get to the heart of this episode which is remember
I promised you in part one that I would give
you the top ten tools for overcoming fear so let's
do that right now in fact I'm gonna give you
two extra ones that I've brainstormed since then so it's
gonna be twelve twelve methods for dealing with fear method
number one is to face the fear head-on to bite
the bullet and to just do it do the thing
you fear it's very straightforward it's not any kind of
trick it doesn't really make the process any easier see
the problem is that when you ask me for techniques
really what you're asking me you're not really asking for
a technique only you're asking for some way to make
the process easier for you so when I tell you
that you just have to bite the bullet and face
the fear head-on you don't like that idea you want
some way to escape the fear Leo give me a
technique where I don't have to experience the fear or
I don't have to face it well sorry but the
whole problem with fear is that if you're avoiding the
fear because you're afraid that just deepens your fear it
makes the situation worse see so like if you're afraid
of leaving your house because you have that kind of
phobia and you don't feel safe outside what do you
got to do in that situation do you need to
look for some sort of chemical pill that you take
that makes it easy for you or do you have
to read some sort of complicated book about what to
do no you know what to do what you have
to do is you have to push yourself out of
your house do the very thing that you've been avoiding
that you've been procrastinating and just by doing that that
brings immediate relief so it's simple but this is really
the most effective method in a certain sense if you're
afraid of the dark what do you got to do
you got to go be in the dark it's just
that simple number two method number two put yourself proactively
to challenging situations what can happen in life often is
that we get very comfortable we get into a certain
groove we find our niche and we get comfortable in
that situation to the point where we get lazy we
get complacent we just get comfortable in our job we
get comfortable situation even if it's very dysfunctional we still
get comfortable in it and we don't proactively push our
comfort zone so with this technique number two you're being
bold on purpose you're sort of adopting this as a
life strategy the way that you're making choices in your
life you're making choices which are a little bit bold
which are a little bit scary which are pushing you
out of what you've been used to doing so for
example you make the decision to quit your job and
to start a new business that's a bold decision that
most people would not make because they were just rationalize
themselves well I can just stay in this job after
all I just paid me a good paycheck after all
does have nice medical benefits after all I am sort
of reasonably happy here it's not so bad it could
be worse you know with that kind of logic you're
never gonna leave your job you're never gonna start your
new business whereas if you're adopting the strategy of being
a little bit more bold and putting yourself into challenging
situations then you would recognize that wait a minute if
I stay at this job even if it's kind of
comfortable I'm gonna fall into a rut I'm gonna get
lazy and complacent I should push myself just because I'm
too comfortable here I should just push myself to quit
this job and to start something new try something new
by starting this new business I'm going to experience new
challenges that's gonna require more of me as the human
it's gonna require me to grow it's gonna require me
to face various other fears that I have and to
overcome those and overall that's gonna make me develop more
self-esteem it's gonna build confidence in myself and this eventually
will make me less fearful in life overall that's a
very good strategy in fact I did that 10 years
ago when I became an entrepreneur and I started my
first business I did exactly that I quit a reasonably
good job that was paying good money that I was
comfortable in that I could have stayed in for another
decade but I knew I just knew I had this
intuitive feeling that I need to push myself and to
be bold and I did that and that was one
of the best decisions I ever made and in that
process I overcame a lot of various fears that I
would not have been able to overcome had I just
stayed in my old job and I could have still
been there 10 years later another example of this might
be to commit to a relationship that you're afraid to
commit to a lot of guys have this problem where
they don't want to commit to it to a serious
relationship that's a fear be bold push your comfort zone
come into this relationship try to see how far you
can take it and if it blows up if it
if if it goes wrong well so so what accept
that bite that bullet and just go into it see
what happens conversely maybe you have the other problem maybe
this is often a problem that females have is maybe
you need to be bold by breaking a dysfunctional relationship
maybe right now you're comfortable in some dysfunctional relationship that's
providing you with some of the benefits of being in
a relationship but ultimately you know that this can't last
it's not the right guy for you but you're afraid
to break it my suggestion here if you're following this
method number two is push yourself be bold have the
courage to leave this guy have the courage to to
go it alone for a while have the courage to
raise your standards have the courage to find a new
guy another example of being bold might be if you're
a guy and you're at the grocery store and you
see some cute girl they are at the produce department
you're attracted to her normally what would you do you
wouldn't approach her you're too scared so in this method
number two you would push yourself and you tell yourself
well now that I'm scared I have to do it
it's precisely because I'm uncomfortable that I have to do
this let me push my comfort zone let me go
over there and talk to her just to see what
happens let's just see what happens if she rejects me
well oh well she'll reject me if she thinks I'm
stupid and ugly and that's what will happen let me
just put myself out there let me see what happens
and you'll do that and that will grow you and
that won't let make you less scared overall such that
the next time it happens it'll be a little bit
easier and if you do it again the next time
it happens it'll be a little bit easier and in
this way you can erode a lot of your fear
of approaching women other examples might include asking your boss
for a raise be bold push your salary see how
much you can get or pursuing your life purpose or
your dream or moving to a new country be bold
move to a new country like for example I have
a friend who lived in Austin Texas and last year
he really sort of just got too comfortable and too
fed up and he just wanted something totally new he
had a very nice software engineering job in Austin he
basically had a nice life there but he pushed himself
to move to Columbia and he just quit his job
got up and left and moved to a totally new
country and lived in Columbia for six months and last
time I talked to him he loved it there see
that was a bold bold move how many of you
would make a bold move like that you see and
as he did that of course he overcame various kinds
of fears he grew himself he challenged himself and in
this way traveling around the world living in different places
this is a very good way to grow yourself and
you can come up with many many other examples of
how to be bold in your life so just be
more bold but of course there's a fine line between
being bold and being reckless so be bold but not
in a stupid way where you're going off and doing
dangerous things that could get you into trouble or that
you might regret so make sure you make that distinction
okay method number three for overcoming fear is training lots
of training this is really the point of training this
is how people get really good at whatever music singing
speaking lawyering doctoring competing boxing playing tennis playing golf how
do they get good at it through training and what
is training training is nothing other than massive experience over
and over again at a thing massive exposure to a
thing so if you're afraid of something consider the possibility
- the only reason you're afraid of it is simply
because you haven't been exposed to it enough for example
if you're afraid of sex it's probably because you have
had a lot of sex you have very little experience
or training in sex if you're afraid of talking to
strangers it's probably because you've talked to very little strangers
in your life we could probably count on one hand
how many strangers you've started conversations with by yourself in
your life if that's the case for you of course
you're gonna be afraid of talking with strangers so what's
the solution there it's not some elaborate metaphysical enlightenment technique
it's just simply expose yourself go talk to a hundred
strangers I can almost guarantee you that by the time
you initiate a conversations with strangers you will no longer
be afraid of strangers if you're afraid of of approaching
and and chatting up beautiful women what's the solution there
is it to meditate more no the solution there is
to go talk chat up with a thousand beautiful women
expose yourself to beautiful women have interactions with them and
then by your thousandth one you're gonna be so exposed
to it that it's gonna be impossible to be afraid
at that point or your fear will just be very
minimized if you're fearful if you're afraid of flying on
airplanes what's the solution there go fly on a hundred
airplanes now of course that cost a lot of money
but you know over your life you fly a lot
the more you fly the more comfortable you become with
airplanes if you're afraid of public speaking what's the solution
to that go join Toastmasters give twenty speeches as Toastmasters
by the time you give twenty speeches you're gonna be
quite comfortable in front of a small crowd just simply
through training and exposure but also I want to point
out a little nuance here is that often times exposure
alone is not enough the real key to overcoming fear
is exposure plus mindfulness so you're not just exposing yourself
to something you're exposing yourself to something mindfully consciously see
so the difference here is like let's say let's use
the example of public speaking and I think in fact
fear of public speaking through surveys it's been found that
it's one of those common fears that people have so
this is a great example so how would you actually
practically tackle this fear in your life you would join
Toastmasters it's an organization that you can go to they're
located all around the world they have different chapters it
costs very little money you you join that little group
you go there and every week once a week you
meet almost like Alcoholics Anonymous and you give a speech
people take turns giving speeches small speech just five minutes
ten minutes long and as you give your speech there's
like five or ten people sitting there listening to you
giving you feedback it's a very supportive kind of atmosphere
they're not judgmental they don't criticize you they they give
you pointers so as you do that though you aren't
gonna be afraid the first time you stood up step
up even in front of ten people in a small
room where everybody is supporting you you're still gonna be
afraid you're gonna be afraid of miss speaking you're gonna
be afraid of forgetting your speech and looking stupid and
so forth so as you stand up there and you're
about to give your speech the extra little twist that
I would act that is do that but feel that
fear feel into the fear as you're about to speak
in the middle of your speech feel into the fear
feel it in your body where is it located get
get comfortable with that fear feeling and continue with your
speech and if you do that 10 20 times you
will probably make a significant dent in your fear of
public speaking technique number four is rigorous mindfulness practice this
is something that I explained in my episode called mindfulness
meditation go search for it so with this method and
this is one of the most powerful methods for addressing
fear over all not just one specific fear but just
fear in general at the existential level what you do
is that you closely observe fear inside your body as
it's happening and you practice feeling very deeply into the
fear and not just fear but just all sensations and
all bodily feelings whatsoever so it's not necessary that you're
feeling fear right now in order to practice mindfulness you
can just start to practice mindfulness every single day using
your ordinary body sensations so right right now we do
practice it feel the soles of your feet right now
you feel that put your attention on that for a
moment just feel what that's like and now shift your
attention to the feeling of your palms don't move your
palms just keep where they are and feel how your
palms feel and now shift that attention to your face
and feel how the front of your face feels and
now shift your attention to your ears and feel how
the ears on your head feel see that's it that's
really all that this practice is but you're doing it
consistently you're setting up a chunk of time 20 minutes
30 minutes 60 minutes a day to do this rigorous
practice and this will help you enormous ly with overcoming
fear over all the long-term in your life as you
practice this then you'll be able to feel fear more
when you're actually in a fearful situation and you're gonna
be mindful in that situation rather than just reactive and
specifically what I want you to notice is that when
the feeling of fear comes up for you that feeling
itself of fear is the key sort of feeling which
is going to be resisted so what you're gonna have
to do is you're gonna have to be mindful enough
to notice when that feeling of resistance to the ickiness
of the fear is coming up and to feel into
that resistance and to let go resisting such that you
allow yourself to actually experience the fear see the problem
is that most people when we get afraid it's not
that just we just get afraid we get afraid but
then that that fear feeling is kind of so picky
that we want to escape from it as quickly as
possible and with this mindfulness practice what you're gonna do
is actually you're gonna linger in that fear you're gonna
let that icky sensation you're gonna allow it to permeate
your body and you're not gonna resist it and you're
not gonna try to manipulate your way out of it
or to escape it you're just gonna marry in it
and through this process you're gonna gradually expose yourself to
that icky feeling of fear you're gonna become more comfortable
with it and then over time what this will do
is make you less reactive to it and ultimately if
you do this practice enough seriously enough you can completely
nullify that fear and become so comfortable with it that
it no longer affects you in the way that it
affects normal people the fifth technique is to be totally
present just totally present so when fear comes up for
you next time if you're able to be totally present
which of course probably requires you have some meditation skills
and abilities that you've been practicing then what you can
do is you can notice that your mind in order
to be fearful what it's doing is its jumping into
the future and it's projecting images of bad stuff that's
gonna be happening in the future and what you can
if you can if you can manage to stop that
by bringing your mind and grounding it in the present
moment of just sitting here right now and not thinking
about tomorrow not thinking about what's gonna happen with your
child not thinking about what's going to happen with your
relationship not thinking about what's gonna happen with your business
but just cutting that chain of thought off and bring
yourself right into the present moment and realizing that there's
nothing to fear about the present moment that's a powerful
technique the problem though is that in practice most of
you won't be able to do this unless you've had
a couple of years of meditation practice because your mind
will just be too active and it will jump into
the future way too much and you won't be able
to be in the present so this is one of
the reasons why we meditate is to be able to
put ourselves in the present when were then in a
fearful situation or an angry situation or whatever just by
grounding yourself in the present moment this can eliminate Nega
emotions but it takes some practice to get there now
you might wonder like well leo but what if the
present moment contains some dangerous thing what if there's a
bear in the room right now and you're telling me
to be present but if I'm present the bear will
get me shouldn't I be like running away well first
of all recognize that most of the time probably 99%
of the time this isn't the case 99% of the
time when you fear something you're not actually fearing something
present what you're doing is you're you're fearing the future
in fact technically speaking this is true 100% of the
time which means that even if there is a bear
in the room right now if you're afraid of this
bear the reason you're afraid of this bear is not
because there is a bear in the room presently you're
afraid of the spare because your mind is creating images
of what this bear will do to you in five
seconds and that is an important distinction those five seconds
of future is not the present so technically if there's
a bear in the room and you're afraid of that
bear it's because you're living in the future now of
course this is this is sort of a more dangerous
situation we're apt to recognize that there is a physical
danger if there's a bear in the room but again
this is where we have to go kind of very
existential and metaphysical and absolute and we have to say
that ultimately remember if you want to transcend all fear
you have to be able to transcend fear even in
actually dangerous situation it can't be like well yeah surely
oh I can meditate and be fearless when there's no
danger but then as soon as there's a real danger
then I can no longer apply those techniques no actually
what you have to do is you have to apply
those techniques even more and you have to surrender the
desire for life so in this situation to be totally
fearless in this situation with this bear in this room
you have to actually accept that this bear might kill
you now of course that's hard to do of course
you don't want to do that that's the last thing
you want to do because you're so preoccupied with your
survival I understand that but then again this is an
episode about how to conquer fear so what do you
want do you want me to tell you how to
conquer fear or not see we can put you in
more and more challenging situations and that will be a
test of how developed you are how conscious you are
most people even if they do meditate if we put
them into a room with a bear they're gonna be
afraid that's just a reality of it because that's how
serious survival is and that's how difficult this emotional mastery
is basically I'm trying to convince you that it's very
difficult to totally eliminate your fear I'm trying to show
you that fear is a very relentless and pervasive force
in your life and that it dominates your behavior and
it dominates your mind and of course that's true and
this bear example shows it very poignant Lee but the
mistake that people make is they think that well if
the Bears in the room then there's no way that
I could possibly transcend that fear and what I'm telling
you is that yes there is a way but it
requires you to make a very radical mmm admission to
yourself which is that your desire for life itself is
really mmm rather subjective and partial and untruthful and something
that you could let go of with sufficient practice and
consciousness okay technique number six for dealing with fear is
psychedelics in fact I would say that psychedelics are one
of the most practical and powerful tools for dealing with
fear because psychedelics put you face-to-face with death and psychedelics
erase all of your dualities and all of your boundaries
between self and other so they sort of force you
into confronting existential fear in a way that I don't
know any other technique that would do this so poignant
Lee so this has been demonstrated it's not just my
opinion this has been demonstrated by clinical and scientific studies
on psychedelics psychedelics are now recognized by more and more
scientific studies to help with PTSD to help with end-of-life
fears for people who are experiencing terminal illnesses like terminal
cancer it's helping them to cope with that why is
that precisely because with PTSD it's a fear problem and
with with terminal cancer it's a fear problem as a
fear of death in the case of terminal cancer and
psychedelics are very effective for this and personally in my
own life I'll tell you this I don't think any
any one technique has helped me the most in facing
my own fears more than psychedelics I don't think psychedelics
can be your only tool here so don't think that
you can ignore all the other techniques and just do
psychedelics but psychedelics are a very very powerful tool especially
because they'll they'll get you at the existential aspect of
fear that otherwise most people are just not conscious enough
you really need that change in consciousness which the psychedelic
offers to be able to start to understand some of
the more radical existential metaphysical aspects of this fear conversation
that we've been having over these two episodes some of
the stuff that I've said here like this distinction between
self and other and how that contributes to fear or
some of the stuff that I said about being able
to transcend all fear or some of the stuff that
I've said about how fear relates to love these are
existential aspects that you will really only be able to
fully appreciate on some psychedelics technique number seven is Kriya
yoga I highly recommend this form of yoga what it
does it rewires your whole mind and your whole nervous
system obviously I can't go into how to practice that
yoga here it's quite technical and involved we have a
mega threat on my forum in the spirituality sub forum
where there's a mega threat where we discuss Kriya yoga
and various ways that you can learn in various books
I also have books available on my book list I
have three or four books that explain Kriya yoga beautifully
and how to do it so you can start to
do your own practice I also have an episode called
the importance of yoga search for that one and there
I talked about some of the importance of yoga and
what it can do for you in your life by
Kriya yoga I don't mean physical yoga I mean meditative
yoga so that's that then we have technique number eight
which is contemplation using a journal I also have an
episode about that how to contemplate using a journal go
check that episode out but specifically what you be doing
here is you'd be contemplating your various specific macro and
micro fears you would be contemplating what this fear is
and why it's arising for you where it came from
why are you really afraid of it what function is
it serving in your life how is it connecting back
to your identity to your ego to your self-image this
sort of contemplative work is very good and it helps
to use a journal to to keep you grounded on
track I will give you a warning here though is
that contemplation alone is not going to be enough to
conquer your fear it's an important step I would even
say it's necessary to contemplate your macro fears and micro
fears but just contemplating them is not going to be
enough fear is too powerful to allow you to just
contemplate your way out of it you can't just reason
your way out of fear that's sort of the whole
point fear is prior to reasoning but still reasoning about
it can help method number nine is the Sedona Method
or the letting go technique I have an episode called
the power of letting go where I explain this technique
in some detail and I give you a lot of
examples as simple as this technique is don't underestimate how
powerful it is I think this is one of the
most powerful techniques for dealing with fear in your everyday
life all this technique requires is that you feel the
fear identify the fear and then just literally let it
go in the present moment and you keep doing that
and doing that and doing that and doing that every
single day for years on end and this will completely
transform your relationship to fear and other emotions but specifically
we're talking about fear here so this is such a
powerful method like for example if you're doing pickup and
you're going to bars and clubs and you're talking to
girls and you know you're getting that approach anxiety right
before you go approach a girl so try try the
letting go technique like right before you're about to approach
a girl feel that fear and then just let it
go and then go do the approach and just keep
doing that doing that doing that over and over and
over again and you'll see it makes a big difference
or for example let's say you have creative anxiety you're
an artist or you're a musician and every morning you
know you get to work you sit down at your
computer or whatever at your workstation and but you have
this creative anxiety what do you do feel into that
creative anxiety and then use that method that I taught
you in the power of letting go episode and just
let it go and keep doing that over and over
and over again every single day until you have a
significant change it's gonna take a lot of work to
do it but eventually you'll be able to use this
technique to let it go and then you'll get so
good at this letting go technique that of course you'll
use it not just for fear and not just in
this one specific situation but you'll be able to expand
this technique out it's gonna become a universal technique which
you can use for fear of public speaking for fear
in the workplace fear in your relationship fear of mmm
bad stuff happening to your family etc you'll expand it
out and then of course you'll also expand it out
beyond fear to include anger and other negative emotions that
you have technique number 10 is breathing breathing consciously slowly
and deeply as you feel your fear so this technique
is nice and that it can dovetail with some of
the other techniques that we've mentioned above so for example
let's go with that example of you're getting up in
front of a group of people to deliver your public
speech at Toastmasters let's say you feel into that fear
you feel it but normally what would happen is that
your body would lock up and you would not typically
breathe consciously so here you're gonna remember to consciously breathe
just like that and you might even close your eyes
and you might literally do that right as you're standing
up there right about to deliver your speech everybody is
looking at you and normally you know you would be
sort of put on the spot by all those eyes
staring at you expecting you to speak but here what
you would do is you would pause and you would
just give yourself the time to just to do that
in right in front of your audience let them see
it do that and then as you do that also
relax your body notice the various tension held in your
arms and your legs and so forth that's a very
powerful technique and you can practice that of course not
just when you're public speaking you could practice it in
your car when you're going to work let's say you
have an important meeting with your boss and you're anxious
about it just practice that when you're in your car
at the at the red light waiting for the turn
green that will help you and for more about becoming
mindful of your body see my episode called body awareness
where I talk about being more conscious of your body
that's a that's a very powerful method very simple but
very powerful and effective because fear is physiological it's a
physiological response it's something your body is doing you have
to become much more mindful about the tension in your
stomach muscles that holds a lot of fear various tension
in your arms and your hands what you do with
your fingers your palms how they sweat because you hold
them like this when you're afraid or what you're doing
with your legs that's it's a great great method combine
it with the other ones that I mentioned above just
from having done that exercise right now already my body
feels a little bit more at ease than it was
my mind is a little bit slower I'm talking a
little bit slow or it's kind of calmed me down
it's kind of grounded me so just training yourself to
do slow and conscious breathing when you're talking with people
when you're talking with clients when you're at school right
before a test very great stuff technique number 11 for
dealing with fear is visualization and Law of Attraction so
one way to deal with fear is to simply crowd
it out of your mind with positivity overwhelm the fear
with a positive vision so let's say right now you're
having a difficulty paying the bills you're a tough spot
in your life you need money you're scared you're worried
you don't know where you're gonna get a job where
the money's gonna come from how you're gonna make ends
meet so one option you have is to keep going
down that negative spiral you can keep visualizing it you
can keep telling yourself how bad it is and how
horrible it is and how no one's gonna hire you
and how all this job interview that you went to
they're probably not gonna call you back and etc and
of course this would just create a negative spiral and
you will just fear more and then out of this
fear you will make bad decisions the other possibility is
that you catch yourself and you stop yourself and you
recognize that wait a minute yes my situation right now
isn't good I need to figure out how to fix
this but also worrying about it here and having all
this negative imagery is not going to work let me
come up with a positive vision let me start to
visualize how I'm gonna I'm gonna get a job and
it's not just gonna be a bad job it's gonna
be a great job and this job is gonna have
great great prospects for the future and maybe two years
from now I can visualize myself you know living in
a nice apartment and being able to pay all my
bills ahead of time and not having to suffer through
this ever again in my life having a lot of
money in my bank account I can visualize myself having
a nice car and I can visualize myself mmm-hmm buying
the stuff that I want to buy and being able
to afford it and so if you do this kind
of visualization consistently this is a very good way of
just crowding out your mind because your mind is only
thinking of one thing at a time if you're thinking
of negative stuff that's what you're thinking about negative stuff
and you're feeling negative if you're thinking about positive stuff
you're feeling positive you can't hold a negative and a
positive thought or feeling in your head or in your
body at the same time so the trick though with
visualization and I do have a video old video about
visualization go check that out it explains how to do
the technique is that you got to do it daily
a little bit of it goes a long way but
you have to do it daily so you don't need
to visualize for an hour you can just visualize for
five or ten minutes on whatever thing you fear so
for example if you fear approaching beautiful women visualize yourself
for five minutes before you go out approaching beautiful women
and then it goes great and that they love you
and they are responsive and they give you dates and
all the stuff that you want visualize that and you'll
notice that helps if you're afraid of talking to your
boss about getting a raise what do you do sit
down and visualize for a week before you go talk
to your boss every single day for five or ten
minutes just visualize yourself talking to your boss and he
listens to you he's receptive and he gives you a
raise and then the whole situation works well visualize that
now of course you're gonna wonder well Leo but what
happens if I do visualize that and then I do
go to my boss and it goes terribly haven't I
just been fooling myself with these positive visions you haven't
been fooling yourself you've been programming yourself see using these
visualization techniques does not mean that your life will always
go however you want that's not the point of it
the point of it is that you're increasing your chances
and you're also making yourself feel good while you do
this so rather than spending a week worrying about how
your boss is gonna reject you instead you spend a
week visualizing how he's gonna actually like your proposal and
maybe will give you a higher position and a higher
salary now is there a chance that he won't yes
but dwelling on that chance and worrying about that chance
that he will reject you um that's not gonna help
you that's gonna make you feel like a victim in
fact if you think that way you probably will be
too afraid to even ever go talk to him but
if you program yourself for a week with positivity then
you'll have more confidence they'll have more pep in your
step when you go in there you'll have a bigger
smile you have a more positive expectation you might even
have some ideas throughout that week of what kind of
things you should say to him that will that will
work as you're visualizing you know in that visualization process
you're gonna ideas will come to you positive ideas empowering
ideas will come to you and then you can use
those to create the kind of situation that you want
so in this way you're being a proactive creator of
your life rather than just sitting back and letting life
happen to you and that's empowering and that's a great
way to combat fear takes a bit of work though
most of these methods take a bit of work which
is why most people don't do them most people are
just lazy and complacent and they just want to be
fearless automatically well you know I guess what doesn't happen
that way in life if you want to be fearless
you don't have to work for it and the final
method number 12 is love love is you might say
the polar opposite of fear love is the ultimate solution
to fear whatever situation in life that you're in where
you're scared the most counterintuitive you can move you can
make at that point is to practice and experience love
in that situation but that's a rather tricky topic in
fact I'm gonna have a separate episode in the future
about how to do this so I'm just throwing this
out there for you now is a bit of a
teaser because there's a lot to say about how love
and fear inter relate and we've still only scratched the
surface of this topic here but a few ideas about
love here so you can start to practice it a
bit is first of all gratitude be grateful and more
appreciative of life and all of the opportunities and situations
that you find yourself in this is a form of
love gratitude is a form of love and the more
loving and conscious you become the more grateful you're become
you're gonna become about just your ordinary everyday life the
people in your life the situation that you're in even
your financial situation you know you can be grateful for
it when you're feeling gratitude in your heart there is
no room at the same time for fear so you
could have a gratitude practice where you spend five or
ten minutes every morning just being grateful going through the
things that you're grateful for in your life and actually
feeling it in your heart that's one way another way
to practice love is through selfless service so when you're
feeling most afraid do something selfless for another person at
your job through your business through your life purpose work
or just help somebody help somebody in your family help
a friend because see the whole problem with fear is
that it's selfishness incarnated what's the solution to selfishness selflessness
this is why having a powerful life purpose is so
effective for grounding your life because your life purpose is
the selfless service that you're doing for the world and
that ultimately is coming out of love selfless service is
not done as an obligation I'm not telling you to
go work at a soup kitchen because you have to
I'm saying find some way in your own life where
your your work what you're doing with your work and
with your time is contributing to the betterment of mankind
in a way that you find meaningful and that you
believe in and that is your expression of love for
mankind and for yourself and for the universe and if
you want a really detailed explanation of how all that
works well for that you have to go check out
my ultimate life purpose course where we have over 25
hours of explanation of videos of how to do all
that by the way I should I should mention here
I don't I don't I don't really upsell my life
purpose course enough I think most people underestimate this all
the content in my life purpose course it's about 25
hours of video all of that content is totally unique
brand new content that you've never seen on the main
channel or in the free material totally new content new
ideas new concepts that I've never talked about so when
you pay something to me for my word when you
buy a course for me understand that you're always gonna
get new content it's not gonna be just I'll rehash
of the same old stuff I've talked about it's gonna
be deliberate stuff that I've reserved for that course so
that you're getting your money's worth and anyone who's paid
the 250 bucks for this course and has gone through
all of it you get your money's worth you see
you feel how much work was put into that course
a lot of work was put into that course way
more than anyone puts into a Twitter $50 course and
that course will pay for itself a hundred times a
thousand times over throughout the rest of your life if
you take it seriously and you do it seriously so
go check that out anyways those are the 12 techniques
that I know of that I think are the most
effective for dealing with fear now let's move on to
a sort of a different subtopic here which is the
following notice that knowing somebody's fear allows you to predict
their behavior if you really want to understand why people
do the things they do whether as individuals or collectively
study their fears what do they fear and get inside
their mind and try to figure it out and if
you can figure that out that gives you enormous power
now of course power can be used for good or
for evil so in this case if you know somebody's
fears you can predict their behavior this allows you to
help them or this allows you to manipulate them and
to exploit them now of course I don't recommend going
the second route as an example of this I bring
up Latimer Putin again the President of Russia mm-hmm so
there was a new story about a year or two
ago where mm-hmm Putin had a meeting with Angela Merkel
of the Chancellor of Germany and apparently it's well known
about Angela Merkel that she has a fear of dogs
because I don't know why it is but I think
she was like bitten by a dog when she was
young and so now everyone knows she has a fear
of dogs and Putin in this meeting deliberately brought his
like aggressive looking dog with him to the meeting because
of course when he was trying to do as he
was trying to exploit and manipulate this fear that she
had of dogs now this is a textbook definition of
devilry so I don't recommend you do that and the
reason I don't recommend you do this is because when
you manipulate people's fears to meet your own survival needs
what this does is it creates bad karma devilry always
creates bad karma devilry comes back to bite you in
the ass it's going to create suffering for you if
you act in a way that you're trying to manipulate
people's fears all the time so I don't recommend that
you go down this road in fact I recommend that
you do the opposite I recommend that you seek to
alleviate other people's fears get into the habit of assessing
others people's fears for example you can do this exercise
sit down with a piece of paper and ask yourself
brainstorm what does your mother fear what does your father
fear what does your spouse fear what does your boss
fear what does your company fear what does your client
or your patient fear what do scientists fear what do
Christians fear what do Muslims fear what do spiritual people
fear what do a theists fear and so on and
so on in fact I'll have a worksheet for you
that you can go and click the link down below
this video to download this worksheet which has a bunch
of questions it's like an exercise that you go through
and you contemplate all these different possible fears that people
have and what this does is it helps you to
step into their shoes and look at the world from
their point of view and as you do that that
helps to explain in your own mind why these people
behave the way they behave why they believe what they
believe why they hold the ideologies they hold and then
in this way you can become really good at understanding
other people you can learn to communicate with others in
a powerful and effective way by thinking through their fears
and then coming up with solutions to their fears and
then communicating the solutions to their fears in this way
you can become a powerful leader you can develop a
powerful business in the end what is business business is
figuring out what is the fear of your client or
what is something that people fear in the world and
then coming up with a solution to that and that
requires being able to see the world from their point
of view like you might ask the question what do
most parents fear and one of the answers you might
get is like well they fear their child getting kidnapped
okay and then you can ask yourself the next question
well if I wanted to start a business for parents
to give them solutions to parents I could just take
like the top five fears of parents and develop technologies
or solutions for that so if the top fear of
parents is that their child will get kidnapped or maybe
the top the second top fear is that their child
will get shot up in school because of these school
shootings we keep having what kind of technology could I
develop some gadget or some website or whatever to help
with that and if I can help with a good
solution then I know it's gonna resonate with those people
because people are motivated by their fears now again of
course you can you can do this in a positive
way you could do this in a negative way you
can start a business that exploits people's fears like for
example you can start a business you might ask yourself
well like what do conservatives fear in America well they
fear brown people so I can cope with a business
that you know fear mongers - conservatives that brown people
are invading America and then I can sell them more
guns well that would also be a business but again
remember like I said when you're playing up to people's
fears and your fear-mongering to people this ultimately is going
to come back and bite you in the ass so
it's not a good idea to go down that road
rather inspire people be an entrepreneur or a business person
have a sense of life purpose that inspires people that
helps them to cope with their fears in a healthy
way that doesn't exploit their fears if you want to
be able to build rapport quickly with people maybe with
clients for example get good at asking them about their
fears and a good question ask them is hey what
keeps you up at night and see what they tell
you like if you're a doctor and you want to
understand your patients better next patient you talk to ask
them what keeps you up at night about your health
and watch them talk they're gonna spill all the beans
to you cuz no one's ever asked them that question
it's a very powerful question or if you're in a
relationship with your spouse ask them what keeps you up
at night what are you afraid of what are your
biggest fears about our relationship oh boy that's a powerful
question it's gonna open a whole can of worms see
but to ask this question you have to be really
interested you have to want to know the other person's
point of view and you also have to be able
to take their fears seriously remember the fears they have
might seem ridiculous to you like if you ask a
Christian what's your biggest fear they might have some fears
that are silly to you but they're real to them
are you willing to listen are you willing to understand
see by exposing yourself and understanding other people's fears what
this will do is this will expose you to the
selfishness of your own fears because you'll see that all
these different groups of people have their own unique fears
and you'll see how limited and selfish these fears are
and how ridiculous they are which will help you to
see your own fears as selfish and limited and ridiculous
so this ability to understand and deal with fear and
communicate about fear is very important if you're interested in
good leadership and I have a pretty nice episode about
how leadership works how to be a leader go search
for that so we're getting towards the end now and
in conclusion I just want to say that there is
no magic trick to overcoming fear that's what your whole
life is for really your whole life is for facing
yourself for facing the universe remember the universe is you
you fear you ultimately you fear your own infinite scope
you are literally so awesome that you're scary that's what
consciousness is doing here consciousness is figuring out how to
grapple with its own enormity and the paradox is this
the paradox about fear is that your whole life you
think that you're afraid of various bad parts of life
because they're dangerous and scary and evil but ultimately what
you discover is the shocking truth is that what you've
really feared the whole time was not bad and evil
stuff but rather what you really feared is the realization
that there is no such thing as bad or evil
at all and that all of it is infinite love
and what you really fear is dissolving into that love
because that love is so Infinite and so indiscriminate that
it leaves no room for you a little limited ego
and furry little petty attachments and that's what you're really
afraid of you're not afraid of evil you're afraid of
love love is the scariest thing love is the most
radical thing that's the paradox of all this this topic
of fear is central to your life you will come
back to it again and again and again all throughout
this work all throughout your life at ever deeper levels
so avoiding this topic of fear avoiding this work is
really unwise it will have disastrous results in your life
why does avoidance of fear not work because in the
end the truth is that everything is one reality is
singular the universe is singular you are the universe and
you cannot avoid yourself forever that's why life happens as
it happens that's why you're always being pushed and that's
why you're always afraid because you're being pushed to realize
and explore more and more of yourself but you're so
big that it threatens you it threatens your old limit
itself you're being pushed to expand into infinity see but
you're too afraid to expand too quickly but the truth
is that you're the whole thing so you can't keep
yourself bottled up forever in your little limited identity your
limited identity will ultimately collapse whether you do it consciously
or unconsciously whether you do it in your 20s and
your 30s or in your 70s and 80s when you're
on your deathbed in the end your limited identity must
collapse and the truth of oneness must prevail so this
division that you made between yourself and others this splitting
of like I'm over here I'm 1 and they're over
there that's number two and one number one is separate
from number two this sort of divisive mnestheus falsehood this
is illusion this must ultimately come to an end and
what must prevail is total unity and it's this total
unity that you're terrified of that you've labeled death the
surest way to fail at life is to allow yourself
to be crippled by fear and to not be bold
but to be meek and to make choices that are
run by fear and to succumb to your own fears
that's the surest way to fail in your relationships in
your career in your business in your health in your
personal life life is all about exploration of yourself when
you're driving to some beautiful national park and you're looking
at the trees in the mountains what are you doing
you're not just exploring the earth you're really exploring your
own self the entire Earth is yourself as you see
different parts of yourself you take it in sometimes it's
something beautiful sometimes it's something ugly and hideous but all
of it is you and to take all that in
requires and here I'm delivering on the thing other thing
I promised you in part 1 which is the answer
is the question of what is the most important quality
you need to succeed in life it's fearlessness what you
need is fearlessness that's how you live the good life
if you said rather than fearlessness love or courage or
consciousness those are all synonymous with fearlessness to be fearless
is to be loving is to be accepting of everything
is the same as having courage is the same as
having consciousness imagine what would happen in your relationships in
your business in your career with your finances if you
were fearless imagine if you were bold and courageous with
your life decisions if you had a strong vision that
you said yes to every single morning there you go
and why are you struggling in life why are not
you you receiving kind of results that you want it's
because you're scared it's because life is big it's challenging
it's scary it's overwhelming it's so huge sometimes that you
don't even know where to begin you're overwhelmed in your
relationship you're overwhelmed with the prospect of starting a business
you're overwhelmed by the prospect of finding your life purpose
or you're overwhelmed by spiritual work you're afraid of taking
a psychedelic you're afraid of meditation you're afraid of this
you're afraid of that you're afraid of going back to
school you're afraid of getting into this relationship you're afraid
of talking to that girl you're afraid of confessing your
feelings to that guy you see the problem life needs
to be lived bold now you might say well believe
if I live life bold I might die it might
be dangerous and risky yes that's life fearlessness doesn't really
mean that you never experience the feeling of fear fearlessness
means more so that you experience the fear but you
don't succumb to it you don't let it Dee spear
at you you don't let it change your decision so
like for example when I started my first business I
was scared to start it it was risky it was
dangerous and yet despite that I started it anyways that's
what counts as fearlessness see when you see some cute
girl the grocery store and you want to go talk
to her it's okay if you have fear but you
push yourself to go talk to her anyways that's still
fearlessness what's true fearfulness is when you have that fear
but then you say oh well then I shouldn't go
talk to her at all that's when you succumb to
your fear and in that situation that's when your life
starts to go downhill so there you go that's one
of the keys to life just as a final reminder
as homework for you you can download the worksheet below
do that and also remember to keep doing that daily
observation work of daily observing your fear feeling that fear
observe how fear runs your whole life do a couple
of years of just observation work to get started here
right because this is gonna pay dividends for you for
the rest of your life I'm telling you if you
can figure out how fear works at an existential level
that's gonna be so valuable for you for for all
situations can you see how universal this skill is it's
not just gonna help you in one situation it's gonna
help you in all situations across the board so if
you understand that then you should understand that this is
really a practice that's worth investing some time and energy
into it's gonna pay itself off alright that's it I'm
done here please come check out my website well first
of all click the like button for me that helps
the videos then come check out my website that's actualized
org you'll find exclusive content on my blog you'll find
the forum you'll find all if purposed course you'll find
the book list where you can use those two to
help you in various ways stuff that's not available in
my ordinary free youtube videos and the last thing I'll
say is this mastering your emotions is the hardest part
of this work mastering your emotions is harder than waking
up there's of course some overlap between the two waking
up helps you to master your emotions and conversely mastering
your emotions helps you to wake up people who have
not mastered their emotions at all cannot wake up but
usually waking up is not enough to automatically have all
of your emotions mastered this requires more work so really
we want to be doing both simultaneously do some work
to wake up and do some work to master your
emotions don't rely on one or the other to fix
the other and be very patient with yourself here this
is a lifetime's work this is not something you're not
gonna master your emotions in one year we're talking decades
here to really truly master your emotions significantly but also
you know you're gonna make progress so you don't have
to wait for 10 years to get the fruits of
this work you're gonna be getting little bits of this
work every week as you're doing it but also you
know be be patient understand this is a long-term process
a long-term investment into your life don't worry if you
don't know how you're gonna master all of your emotions
yet you don't need to know how just start doing
the practices and start sort of like eating this elephant
one little piece at a time right now we're working
on fear in the future we'll work on anger or
we'll work on jealousy or we'll work on sadness and
depression will work on lowliness though there's a lot of
different components to emotions fear is just one aspect of
it here it's a very big important aspect but be
patient with yourself this is what your whole life is
about really is figuring out how to understand all of
your emotions and how to make sure that they're not
running you anymore so that you're acting out of consciousness
and wisdom rather than just like a puppet a marionette
controlled by strings which are usually emotions for people so
as we go forward to actualize that org I will
have more content more videos and even courses probably in
the future which will help you to master your emotions
you
