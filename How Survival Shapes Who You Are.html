survival shapes who you are that's the key to understanding
yourself and we're going to go into a lot of
depth on this point this episode builds on top of
two previous episodes about survival called understanding survival part one
and part two go watch those two episodes if you
haven't already it's going to change your entire orientation towards
life and how you see human beings and yourself and
then this will take it just to the next level
so first i want you to notice just looking at
the animal kingdom looking at the shape of animals literally
look at the shape that animals take why does a
snake have that kind of shape that it has which
is very different from the shape of a giraffe which
is different from the shape of a kangaroo which is
different from the shape of a bat which is different
from the shape of an octopus which is different from
the shape of a ant and so on as kids
we look at all these weird animals like the platypus
or something and we're amused by these interesting creatures you
might even fall in love with some of them but
we don't really see just how serious their shape is
their shape is not just some arbitrary thing their shape
is how they survive without that shape they couldn't survive
and of course then we have to look at you
what about your shape of course i'm talking about the
external shape of your body but for us human creatures
were a little bit more complicated and much of our
survival happens at the conceptual level at the level of
mind even more so than at the level of the
physical body especially these days with all the technology and
stuff that we have our external shape is becoming less
important and what our mind's shape is the shape of
our psyche this determines everything that unfolds for you individually
and for us collectively as a species so let's explore
that because there's there's so much detail here so who
you are today was shaped by your early survival demands
just like the shape of a snake was gradually formed
over millions and billions of years of evolution of natural
selection where the shape of the snake was being fitted
with that of the shape of the environment that it
lives in and there's many different kinds of snakes and
many different kinds of environments and they have different kinds
of shapes so the same with you so it uh
your specific survival challenges and your youth and as you
were growing up especially during the first 20 years of
your life this shaped your psyche and it shaped how
you think how you emote and how you act but
the problem is is that you're not very conscious of
this none of us are unless we do this sort
of investigation that we're about to do right now and
we completely forget how much we were shaped by all
of the environments in which we were growing up when
we were young many of the survival challenges you faced
when you were 5 years old 10 years old 15
years old 20 years old now if you're in your
30s and 40s and later you've your mind doesn't even
hold it can't even hold that much in its memory
banks i mean it does deep down but it's not
the at the top of your mind and it becomes
easily forgotten and it's like uh layers upon which your
psyche is built and those layers upon which it's built
they're forgotten and you just assume that well this is
how i am now this is who i am this
just feels like who i have always been but if
you look carefully if you do some sort of psychic
archaeology in your psyche you know um dig in there
and root around go back into your past you can
actually see how the layers of your psyche were built
over the first 20 years of your life and you
can do some work there because some of those layers
are dysfunctional and are still creating problems for you to
this day but you've forgotten where they came from so
let's look into that so i want you to start
to really notice how much survival demands from your environment
shaped you and the kind of survival strategies you had
to adopt as coping mechanisms to deal with whatever situation
you were faced with and we as humans we can
look quite similar on the outside but the survival situations
that we face are mostly cultural not just the physical
environment so the culture you grew up in and whatever
kind of family environment schooling environment work environment these all
shaped you very much more so than whether you grew
up in the in the arctic or in the tropics
or in the desert although of course that also shapes
you but um really it's the software that's even more
important than the hardware when we're discussing survival here so
i want you to start to notice how much human
survival varies around the globe it varies enormously from country
to country continent to continent but even more than that
even within the same country and especially if you take
a large diverse country like america there are so many
different ways for humans to survive in america it's just
it's staggering and we'll start to give examples of some
of those here in a minute but you can already
probably start to fill in some of the blanks yourself
so uh your personal survival situation creates huge blind spots
in your psyche it limits your ability to understand others
it limits your ability to grow to succeed and to
transcend to higher levels because really what we're talking about
here is when we're talking about personal development or spiritual
development we're talking about growing one's psyche and to grow
one psyche we have to look at the limitations and
blind spots that are present within the psyche that hold
us back these are the obstacles and also as you
were growing up you encountered from your environment as you
were struggling to survive you you incurred wounds and scars
karma samskaras the hindu traditions call it and these stay
with you and influence how you behave they can be
very corrupting they can corrupt your desires your goals your
ambitions in life your fears they can make you insecure
in various ways they can make you overreact emotionally to
certain things they can give you certain biases and predilections
and aversions and all of these fundamentally shape how your
life unfolds and if your life is unfolding in ways
you don't like with bad habits and addictions and you
keep struggling and spinning your wheels and not getting the
kind of traction success you want in your life well
you have to look back and to see really what
is sourcing that and it's probably early childhood uh survival
situations that you didn't quite fully know how to deal
with and you might have dealt with them in dysfunctional
ways unholistic ways and then those became ingrained in your
psyche and now you still keep acting from that place
it's uh it's sometimes difficult to unteach yourself some of
these bad habits you picked up or certain assumptions about
reality or about people or about society that was just
a function of how you survived when you were younger
we tend to assume that humans have always lived sort
of the same way like that a hundred years ago
500 years ago a thousand years ago 2000 years ago
humans lived basically like we do today not at all
when we're studying history in school it doesn't really sink
in the teacher doesn't really teach us that it's not
merely that you know the ancient romans lived a certain
way the egyptians lived a certain way and then in
the middle ages they lived a certain way and during
the renaissance they lived a certain way and the chinese
lived a different way than the europeans and etc it's
not just that it's like when you're when you're reading
history and studying history you have to really put yourself
in the shoes of the people that were living in
that culture in that time with that technology with the
epistemic limits that they had at that time the limits
of their understanding the limits of their science the limits
of their religion that they were plagued with whatever you
know whatever situation they were dealing with like you have
to really understand that to live 2000 years ago was
such a starkly different way of surviving than today and
even a hundred years ago survival was so different for
your great grandparents than it is for you today the
culture has changed the language has changed the uh our
understanding of mankind as a species has changed our understanding
of sciences has changed even understanding of religion today's christians
are not the same christians of 2000 years ago they're
completely different and we don't appreciate that enough and the
survival challenges of course that our ancestors faced were completely
different than what we face today of course many things
were similar there are common patterns but many things were
very different and even just your survival strategies as a
kid growing up were very different from that of your
parents just a single generation is actually very significant but
we tend to overlook all this and we tend to
just assume that well everybody just kind of grows up
the same way no not at all kids today growing
up in in the digital environment with the internet with
video games with virtual reality with smartphones from right from
the cradle they have this stuff it's a totally different
environment than like when i was growing up mostly in
the 90s and even there i i am fairly tech
savvy because i grew up in sort of in a
sort of era where technology was all around me computers
i was there for the early internet the early video
game sort of uh the rise of video games and
cable tv and all these sorts of things but uh
but i wasn't there for example for social media i
mean i was there but my mind was already formed
you see the human mind and really not just a
human mind but all animal minds work this way uh
they're extremely impressionable during that phase from birth to adulthood
and for humans that's around 20 years old your mind
is being cemented and and set in stone stuff that
is set in stone in the first 20 years of
your life that stays with you and it becomes more
and more difficult to change as you get into your
30s 40s and beyond so how your mind is set
like drying concrete uh in in those first 20 years
are absolutely crucial and if the concrete has cracks in
it as it's still wet and drying if it has
uh you know debris leaves fall on it twigs and
branches somebody comes and rides his bicycle through it all
those marks and things are going to be impressed and
in ingrained into that concrete for the rest of its
existence now of course with humans we're a little bit
more malleable than that but it's actually quite astounding how
difficult it is to change the human mind once it's
set after those first 20 years it's it's it's pretty
difficult possible but but difficult takes labor all right so
now i want you to do this little visualization exercise
with me uh i want you to imagine how different
you would be today if for example your father was
a drug dealer when you were growing up if you
were raped by your father if you were a mormon
growing up in a mormon family in a mormon community
if you were gay or confused about your sexuality assuming
you weren't if you were bullied in school because you
were ugly if you were born an eskimo tribe somewhere
in the arctic circle if you grew up in a
foster home without parents just try to imagine how that
would change your very identity and sense of who you
are in the world we're not just talking about like
oh yeah life would have been a little bit more
difficult or some circumstances in my life would be a
little bit different i would have had to adapt to
that no no what i'm trying to get you to
understand here is that you would be a different person
imagine if when you were young you grew up with
a chronic illness instead of like the healthy body that
let's assume you have now or had in the past
imagine how that would shape you if you grew up
in a wheelchair if you went to school 12 years
of school in a wheelchair imagine if you were a
hot pretty girl and all the boys admired you and
lavished attention on you and even the adults told you
how beautiful and cute you were from a young age
because you were just except exceptionally pretty you were just
born that way you got a luck of the draw
from the genetics lottery or if you grew up in
a war zone imagine how that shapes your psyche to
grow up in a war zone with bombs bursting around
you as you sleep with your father waking up in
the middle of the night telling you that we have
to get out of the house because a bomb might
you know blast through the roof then you got to
get up and run or struggle to find food in
the morning because all the shops are closed or bombed
and as you're walking to the bazaar there's bullets flying
around and you gotta you gotta crawl to avoid the
bullets imagine how that shapes your goals in life your
desires your fears and insecurities your political beliefs your religious
convictions imagine if you grew up in a small rural
village with no internet access no television no music no
big grocery stores imagine if you grew up as a
woman in saudi arabia imagine if you grew up in
a royal family in a palace and you had butlers
serving you from golden plates with golden forks your whole
life driving you in rolls royces and such things and
your family groomed you to be part of the royal
family because they just expected you to fill that role
imagine if you grew up seeing mystical visions as a
child it wasn't something you tried to do or even
practiced you didn't even meditate you just every time you
went to sleep you saw mystical visions even while you
were awake at school you would see mystical visions of
weird entities and beings and aliens and things and angels
and imagine how that would completely transform who you think
you are what you think reality is and your relationship
to it and of course this would isolate you from
other children because they wouldn't see these visions and the
adults around you they probably also don't see these visions
even your parents might not have believed you when you
told them that you saw these mystical visions and they
just told you that oh you're just imagining things you
have a hyperactive imagination maybe they even took you to
a doctor and the doctor maybe even put you on
some antipsychotic medications because the doctor of course a western
materialist doctor doesn't believe in mystical visions he thinks that's
all nonsense and he thinks that you're going crazy and
so he puts you on antipsychotics and then those had
maybe those uh numb your visions down but then they
make you feel disconnected and they don't make you feel
like yourself anymore and as a child you don't know
what's going on you don't know whether to listen to
these adults or not to listen to them maybe maybe
you start to think that maybe these adults are right
maybe i do have a hyperactive imagination maybe something is
wrong with me maybe i am going crazy maybe i
am psychotic or whatever and that it takes you a
long time to figure out what's what so humans survive
in very different ways yet we judge others for how
we survive we're very judgmental about the survival strategies of
other people and that's precisely because our own survival strategy
was so paramount in the shaping of who we are
that how we see cert how we see reality itself
how we define what reality is was so deeply shaped
by these things that it's difficult for us to even
step outside of who we are because we just are
that now it's difficult for us to step outside of
that to see that somebody else had very different influences
and had to deal with very different uh much more
difficult survival situations and therefore they had to adapt to
those and they had to become literally a different person
and to survive those situations they literally had to see
reality in a different way to survive as a woman
in saudi arabia literally requires that you see reality in
a different way than if you're a woman in america
otherwise you can't survive in that situation you might get
beheaded this is no joke so be very careful about
judging how other people survive you don't know what situations
they faced what they had to do you assume that
oh well they don't have to survive that way they
can just survive the way that i survived no don't
assume that because if they adopted your version of reality
your worldview your belief system your assumptions your principles your
values your fears your insecurities and and your goals and
values if they adopted all those they might have gotten
beheaded in the survival situation that they were in or
they might have gotten raped or their parents might have
hit them and abused them you don't know these are
very common things that happen to millions of people and
they have to adapt to that to survive through that
and a lot of that happens to children we're talking
about children that might be less than 10 years old
and those children just think about how little a ten-year-old
child understands about reality and about society and about the
evils of the world and about how to survive because
when you come into this world you're not given a
survival manual you have to make it up as you
go along and if you're lucky you have parents that
can guide you who are wise who themselves have mastered
the art of survival and they can pass on some
wisdom to you but um that's that's often not the
case a lot of times the parents are dysfunctional themselves
they don't know how to survive or the way they
survived no longer works in the situation that you know
that they're going up because now there's a war when
your parents were surviving there might not have been a
war in in your country and now the parents are
raising you in a war zone they don't they themselves
don't know what to do to help you as a
as a child to figure out how to navigate that
situation and your whole life is writing on it this
is a life and death matter this is not a
joke and i want you to especially pay attention to
how we're not just talking about physical survival here pay
attention to how survival shapes the mind the psyche the
beliefs the world views your morality your values that's the
really important thing here here's an example with hitler so
who hitler was and what he did as an adult
was merely the reflection of his mind and hitler's mind
was merely a reflection of the survival challenges he faced
during his youth during the first 10 20 years of
his life and it can be useful to actually pick
up a biography of hitler and read it and i
don't mean his autobiography i mean a biography written by
an objective sort of neutral historian because when you're reading
an autobiography it's being filtered through his own mind already
which is not necessarily the truth especially with a guy
like hitler can't really trust his biography but i mean
his autobiography but you can you can you can you
can get a lot of value of reading just a
good historian's biography um i did some of that it
gave me a lot of insight into into his behavior
and into his ideology it's very illuminating to see for
example how hitler participated in world war one before world
war ii before he started world war ii there was
world war one um and it's actually interesting to read
what role he played in world war one and how
he performed there and how that shaped his psyche and
that wasn't the only thing that shaped a psyche after
that i mean i'm not going to go into all
the details but if you want you can read the
biography and you'll start to understand what i'm what i'm
alluding to here so those early experiences shaped his mind
which then reshaped all of europe and the rest of
the world and really human history that's how significant this
stuff is now it's easy for us well not even
that easy see i was going to say it's easy
for us to see hitler's situation because we're not hitler
so it's easy when you're looking when you're looking from
outside it's easier to have perspective to see things objectively
neutrally without self bias but really even for most people
even even seeing hitler is is uh it's not so
easy because most people just see him as evil or
whatever and i'm not saying he was a good guy
or anything i'm not trying to i'm not trying to
whitewash hitler here or to make excuses or rationalizations for
what he did i'm being very neutral about it i'm
not trying to judge but the point being is that
most people aren't even able to see that what hitler
did was simply a reflection of survival challenges he faced
in his youth see just to even see that will
change how you see hitler how you see world war
ii how you judge him and how you judge others
but now the real work is applying this sort of
logic to your own self so let's do that what
are the core survival challenges that shaped your mind that's
the key question so here's the exercise i want you
to remember all the way back to your childhood to
your early years and it really helps to really go
back early i mean when you were just learning how
to eat how to walk the earliest memories you have
and try to recall the survival challenges that you face
that you faced at that time and uh get up
get a sheet of paper a notepad and list them
out start do a little brainstorm here what did you
struggle with and start with even the very basic stuff
like food remember how you struggled just to put food
in your mouth the majority of it ended up on
your shirt i remember when i was like even when
i was like seven years old i can remember you
know eating sandwiches and i would always get food like
everywhere on my shirt i remember had to like buy
new shirts all the time because they would get like
mayo stains on it grease stains and stuff from ketchup
and mustard and burger juice and whatever else dripped on
it and it took me like a couple of years
i remember like from from age seven to maybe age
nine it took me a couple of years to learn
just how to eat so that i don't get food
like all over my pants and my shirts and that
was a struggle and see today i like unless i'm
i'm doing this recording here for the purposes of educating
you i haven't even thought about this stuff for for
like 30 years and so you just forget about it
and you probably forgot about it too like you probably
forgot about these very basic things you struggled with just
even maintaining your temperature was was a challenge figuring out
how to keep yourself cool or how to keep yourself
warm depending on whether you were in the winter time
the summer time i'm about i would get these bad
sunburns because i just wasn't aware of of the the
sun's heat and i would you know stay out in
the summer you know at the lake or something and
it was scorching hot and i would get these terrible
sunburns um or even like i remember it took me
it took me years just to learn to wear warmer
clothes when it was cold outside like it seems so
obvious today right now now as an adult it seems
so obvious you know if it's cold outside grab a
coat but like that that wasn't even obvious to me
and um and like the the family situation i was
growing up with you know we had certain financial difficulties
when i was growing up a lot of times we
just didn't have money like i would need a coat
i would need just like nothing fancy just like a
a sweatshirt or a jacket i would need that but
i knew for example that uh we were out of
money certain times of the year it was weird you
know my my financial situation my family had a big
influence on me i'll talk about that a little more
here in this later in this episode but like it
was very kind of rocky so some parts of the
year we had lots of money and we would even
go to extravagant vacations and extravagant dinners and stuff like
that and then other parts of the year we had
no money at all they would turn off our electricity
and we would have to use the candles or like
even buying new shoes or buying a jacket would be
difficult because my family would waste that money on like
an extravagant dinner but there would be nothing left for
just a jacket which was it was ass backwards but
anyways that's sort of the situation i i grew up
in and you better believe that shaped me very significantly
it shaped my attitude towards money and towards towards life
um even towards clothing uh think about sexuality how your
sexuality was formed in the first 20 years of your
life and what struggles existed there maybe with your sexual
identity maybe with feeling guilty about sex because you were
moralized too by your fundamentalist christian or conservative parents who
told you sex was evil or masturbation was evil or
whatever and you tried to hide it or you were
embarrassed by it or you know whatever or maybe it
was positive stuff too or maybe you had early childhood
experiences i mean sexual experiences whether in high school or
even in middle school or maybe with who i don't
know what um your situation was and think about how
that influenced your views of sexuality which are still with
you today maybe it made you sexually conservative maybe made
you very sexually open and liberal think about the even
survival challenges like just hurting yourself or bruising yourself physically
like i remember when i was younger i always had
like bruises and cuts and scars because i would like
ride the bike and i would you know fall off
the bike and scrape my knees and this and that
and i would always be injuring myself bruising myself against
something on a skateboard or whatever um just like even
kinesthetically physically learning how your body works even like how
to chew and not bite your tongue or bite your
lip or accidentally chip a tooth while you're chewing or
something even that required struggle and practice and you got
it wrong if you were like me and you have
to learn it took you years to learn how to
do it properly think about various dangerous situations you faced
maybe with strangers that were trying to pick you up
or with um with automobiles with bicycles with skateboards with
you know whatever dangers existed in your environment with the
weather maybe you grew up in florida and there was
hurricanes and things and then that shaped you think about
the situations when you cried think about all those times
you cried when you were young between the ages of
0 and 20. what were you crying about i mean
it was difficult think about it was difficult even if
you grew up in a nice neighborhood even if your
parents were were wealthy and you know gave you all
the stuff you wanted you still cried about stuff what
was that and how did that shape you what lessons
did that imprint into you you see the suffering that
you incurred when you were young and very impressionable that
left deep deep samskaras or wounds in your psyche which
you're probably still compensating for today think about the challenges
of learning language that you faced i mean learning language
was so difficult now we just use it it's easy
effortless you don't even think about it but remember how
difficult it was to use language properly or even learning
what time was i remember when i was like five
six years old my parents bought me a wristwatch with
a little arrow you know the arrows it wasn't a
digital one it was an analog one um and i
i like i couldn't figure out what the what the
arrows meant i didn't understand the arrows it took me
a while to figure that out you know we take
it so for granted or learning mathematics i remember i
struggled a lot in like the first three four years
of school just to figure out what the hell mathematics
was or learning other aspects of life struggling through school
think of how much struggle you went through in school
that whole ordeal 12 years of that or the struggles
that came with socializing with children of your own age
and how difficult that might have been for you how
traumatic that might have been for you depending on what
kind of environment you were in maybe you were bullied
or maybe you bullied others it all depends and how
that shaped you remember getting in trouble all the rules
you broke all the detentions you got all the scolding
you got from your parents for being too rowdy or
from your teachers or from your principal or whatever punishments
they gave you and how that affected you the struggle
of fitting in of being cool of making sure your
peers thought you were normal and not weird and that
they accepted you and approved of you that whole game
you played you might have played it excellently or you
might have played it very poorly and that very much
affects you to this day shape your psyche think about
academic achievement and what significant role that played in your
life whether you were a good student a bad student
and how you felt about your own sense of intelligence
and knowledge and self-esteem related to that or your struggles
with sports fights with your family think of all those
what were those about and how those shape you rebelling
against your parents or conforming to your parents whichever one
doesn't matter it shaped you just the same how about
trying to gain approval or love from your parents and
friends think of how much that shaped you divorce if
there was a divorce in your family that was a
huge influence on you think about how your identity was
forged how did you figure out who you were you
probably played with different identities in middle school in high
school and your friends as well and then how you
had to navigate and negotiate that identity with them the
various interests that you explored and how those influenced you
and how you struggled with different hobbies and things some
you loved some you hated some you were frustrated by
remember how challenging it was just to learn different concepts
or the struggle of being lazy or disciplined if you
struggled with that disciplining yourself or being bored just think
about how that might have shaped you being bored when
you were a kid and then what you did in
your spare time of course religion if you grew up
in a religious environment think about how that shaped you
for some people that was huge for other people not
so much but even if you didn't grow up in
a religious environment maybe your family was secular or scientific
or atheistic and then that shaped you just as much
as religion would have if they were religious think about
various philosophical questions that you struggled with when you were
younger like what is life what is death think about
the first time that you became conscious of the fact
that you're going to die or that your parents were
going to die and how that affected you debates and
disagreements you had with your parents elders and friends and
colleagues mentors who influenced you in positive ways negative ways
maybe you had a mentor who misled you music you
listened to health problems you had lack of money or
an abundance of money in your family situation other kinds
of family dysfunctions you struggled with early romances you had
pregnancy if you had that early abortion if you had
that early being denied or rejected for things maybe you
were rejected for a sports team maybe you were rejected
for an early job position maybe you were rejected for
a school or a university and then how that affected
your psyche how did you adapt and cope with all
of these things above how you adapted and coped it
coped is who you are today that's the point there's
a really great exercise that i used to give to
my coaching clients to get a sense of of what
they thought deep down about things and sort of how
their psyche was shaped throughout their life it's a sort
of a fill in the blank exercise so get a
piece of paper and try this out it's very easy
but it might reveal some things to you so on
this piece of paper i want you to write the
following fill in the blank statements and then spend some
time if you want pause the recording and fill in
the blank and don't rush it because these are valuable
to really spend some time contemplating so the first one
is life is blank and then pop i mean uh
fill in that blank with what first pops into your
mind and it can be multiple things in fact it's
better if it's a couple of things not just one
so for example life is beautiful maybe that's the first
thing that pops into your mind or if you were
abused as a child you might say life is that
might pop into your mind or you might say life
is pointless or you might say life is cruel or
you might say life is unfair if you're feeling like
it was unfair to you and see whatever you say
it is i want you to recognize that it is
that way for you because that's the attitude you adopted
due to the survival conditions you faced and how you
cope with them whether you were successful or unsuccessful and
of course the more successful your survival strategies were the
more positive your responses are going to tend to be
and the less successful they were probably the more pessimistic
and depressed and conservative and uh sort of uh coming
from a wounded victim mindset your responses will be notice
that so life is blank men are blank or women
are blank fill in whichever is the opposite of your
sex so if you're a woman then for you it's
men are blank and if you're a man it's women
are blank fill that in and don't overthink it too
much you wanna you wanna kind of do this from
your intuition there's no right or wrong answers it's just
how you feel about it so go with your gut
happiness is blank fill in that one maybe you think
happiness is unattainable or happiness is love or happiness is
sex or happiness is alcohol or happiness is getting good
grades or happiness is having dinner with the table at
the at the dinner table with the family the whole
family there what is happiness to you chances are that's
been shaped very much by how you grew up how
you survived in some sense you equate happiness with some
sort of successful survival however you've defined successful survival for
you and all of us define successful survival in different
ways because of course we had to survive in very
unique ways so of course the next fill in the
blank is success is blank what is success to you
and where do your definition of success come from think
about that what books magazines stories that you heard from
your parents or role models parents teachers in your life
that you emulated or looked up to that generated your
ideas of success next is money is blank sex is
blank science or religion is blank whichever one is the
one you subscribe to spirituality is blank work is blank
school is blank government is blank and finally i am
blank actually i should probably add one more in there
uh humans humans are blank so this reveals to you
some very fundamental views you have that were shaped by
or by your early survival situation so i'm going to
keep going here but i encourage you to really pause
this and spend a good 10 20 30 minutes just
working on this exercise right here it will reveal a
lot to you but i got to keep going so
the key question here is how did early survival shape
who you are today i want you to especially notice
all of your likes and dislikes how those were shaped
where they come from all of your beliefs convictions principles
and and pet theories and firmly held opinions your worldview
in other words i want you to notice your morality
your judgments and the things you hate notice the source
of that and how it came about as a function
of survival and how it serves survival you see it's
not merely that you have a morality or that you
hate something just arbitrarily you never hate something arbitrarily you
never judge something arbitrarily you never just have a moral
system arbitrarily it's always in response in reaction to something
such that it helps you to survive in whatever situation
you were in and again remember it doesn't just help
you to survive physically it helps you to survive as
a psyche as an ego so don't just relate these
things back to physical survival as your psyche accretes as
your psyche develops certain likes and dislikes and aversions and
predictions and beliefs and convictions and principles and judgments and
morality these things create a sort of a object of
their own all of these are sorts of amorphous conceptual
abstract things which don't seem like physical objects that require
surviving the way that a physical body does the way
that a physical object might but once these things start
to cohere together into a psyche or an ego mind
this becomes a sort of an object of its own
which then takes on a life of its own and
it needs to survive even more so than the body
itself it's like a system it's a system of meanings
and interpretations it's your mind this is the ego mind
we're talking about the origins and birth of the ego
mind and your ego mind was not just born when
you were three years old and you realized i exist
that was an important that was an important milestone for
you but your ego mind really was born in the
first 20 years of your life by accreting more and
more of this stuff i want you to notice your
political and economic philosophy your sexual identity your views of
men and women your social behaviors and tendencies and attitudes
towards other people your career your strengths weaknesses fears and
insecurities especially let's underscore fears and insecurities because fear and
insecurity only comes from survival struggles if you didn't have
any survival struggles you would have no fears or insecurities
and you got plenty of them so you got to
spend some serious time looking at those and where they
came from and what those are about where they were
sourced from what they were in reaction to and what
they are coping mechanisms for also your defense mechanisms how
do you protect yourself your values your life philosophy we
might say all of us even if we don't explicitly
call ourselves philosophers we all have a life philosophy like
maybe your philosophy is that hey you know i'm not
going to work too hard i'm just going to sort
of coast through life path of least resistance or maybe
your philosophy is that i got to work hard and
i got to wake up on time every morning and
you know otherwise bad stuff will happen maybe that's your
life philosophy or maybe your your life philosophy is just
oh take it one day at a time or maybe
your life philosophies i got a plan 30 years ahead
or bad stuff will happen i want you to even
notice seemingly trivial and mundane things like the kind of
food you you eat the kind of books you read
the kind of media you consume the kind of work
you do how all of this was shaped by early
survival the way you react to strangers in social situations
how social you are and how you socialize even the
facial expressions you make when you are dealing with people
in social situations the muscle tension in your body your
darkest thoughts what kind of darkest thoughts do you have
and how were those shaped by early survival challenges your
dreams the kind of dreams you have when you go
to sleep the kind of nightmares if you have nightmares
what kind of nightmares do you have what are those
about and how were they sourced by something uh like
a of a survival challenge earlier in your life and
then also your dreams in the more sort of aspirational
sense like your highest goals your highest dreams for your
life how were those shaped how you handle money are
you stingy and frugal or are you very wasteful with
your money and what is that in response to are
you emulating the money behaviors of your mother your father
or are you rebelling against their behaviors and you do
the opposite so like maybe maybe your father wasted a
lot of money so now you are very conservative with
money or maybe your father wastes a lot of money
and so do you because you're copying him it can
it can be both ways even how you dress consider
that where did that come from what kind of style
of dress do you consider appropriate you like and dislike
and what you guilt yourself for why do you guilt
yourself for the things you guilt yourself for because there's
certain things you guilt yourself over and there's other things
you don't where did that come from so what i
want you to notice about all of the above is
that very little of it was chosen consciously and notice
all of the above constitutes basically who you are i
mean if you erase all that stuff i just mentioned
that entire list from your mind what is left of
you you're going to be unrecognizable as a as a
human being as a persona as a psyche as an
ego mind you won't be able to recognize yourself you'll
look the same in the mirror let's say but but
everything about you that you hold as the most important
is gonna be gone you're gonna be completely hollowed out
but also notice just how arbitrary all of these things
are see we tend to hold all these things about
ourselves as like who i really am my true self
but is it really or is it just an accretion
of a bunch of random stuff that happened to you
as you were bumbling through life flying by the side
by the seat of your pants just trying to survive
by the skin of your teeth you see you're not
as conscious as you think you are about who you
are and where who you are came from and why
you are who you are the mind is very good
at rationalizing to itself that well you know i'm a
christian and i have a certain moral system and i'm
frugal with money and i'm conservative or i'm liberal for
these very good reasons you know i'm a liberal because
i value social justice or i'm a conservative because i
really you know my parents were conservative and you know
i value their traditions and all that and i really
value my ancestors and all that but really you're bullshitting
yourself all of those are backwards rationalizations that you make
to justify the way you are to not question the
way you are and then you see when we're talking
about making changes to your life personal development or spiritual
development we're really talking about changing your life to get
better results but to get better results we have to
change the more we change the better results we could
potentially get now of course you could change things for
the worst but we're assuming you can avoid that trap
but i want to point out that you can change
things for the worst about yourself so don't overlook that
possibility but assuming that you're you're being wise about it
and you're changing things about yourself in a in a
beneficial manner to be more effective to be more successful
more productive more happy and whatever else to sort of
round the edges of your psyche um if you're doing
that then the more you change about yourself the more
change you will get the more positive change you will
get if you're doing positive change right but but notice
that if you're unwilling to carefully examine and change all
of these things that i just listed up above about
yourself if you're not really willing to change you at
the core at the identity level then how can you
expect to get any significant meaningful change in your life
so if you really want a serious improvement in the
quality of your life then you have to recognize connect
the dots that that means there has to be a
serious change about you who you are and that means
you have to go the deeper you can go into
who you are and the more you can change your
identity the more change you can create the better your
life will be if you do it correctly but also
the deeper you go the more difficult it is and
the more threatened you're gonna feel about it the less
comfortable it's gonna feel because it's gonna feel like some
part of you is dying and it's going to be
counter-intuitive because a lot of times in life to really
get a new result and some serious level of success
or effectiveness in life you have to change something about
yourself that you're attached to that you don't want to
change about yourself and so half the battle is simply
even noticing that and then accepting that that part of
you has to change because you probably don't want to
change that part of you because you're attached to it
because you're so close to it because you're literally it
so that's why we're doing this work and that's why
we're trying to go in a lot of depth here
because the deeper you can go the more change you
can make the more results you can get notice how
your choices shaped by which were shaped by survival demands
so for example let's say you were forced to go
to church when you were young so you started to
hate religion because you resented going to church every sunday
morning now of course it doesn't have to always be
this simple one-to-one correlation for somebody else because nobody's survival
situations are identical for somebody else they were forced to
go to church and they ended up not hating religion
but becoming religiously indoctrinated and loving religion so i'm not
saying that just because your parents forced you to go
to church that that's why you hate religion it might
have worked that way for you but for your friend
or for your brother or sister it might have just
been exactly the opposite so don't over simplify these things
this is very complex stuff a lot of times these
these very branching paths that our lives and our psyches
can take are extremely delicate and fragile and highly contingent
and almost to the point of being arbitrary in the
sense that like a little tiny is sort of like
that chaos theory effect where you know a butterfly flapping
its wings in brazil will cause a tornado in texas
like everything is interconnected and sometimes a little a little
you know da a little drop of heat something here
or there in your life will will change the trajectory
of your life radically these things accumulate exponentially and it's
sometimes difficult to predict which which way are you going
to end up hating religion or loving religion the difference
between those two can be razor thin the difference can
be as as little as a single word that comes
out of the mouth of your mother father brother sister
or preacher if they say one wrong word or one
right word that's going to make the difference between whether
you hate religion or love religion for the rest of
your life now it's not always that fragile but sometimes
it really is on a razor's edge like that balance
on the razor's edge other examples might be like you
got approval for example for acting the class clown for
being funny and humorous so therefore you adopted this funny
humorous persona you became very extroverted and social and you
still are that way today and maybe today you survive
that way maybe your whole career is built around that
or for example you got approval for getting good grades
in school because your teachers and your parents lavished you
with attention and love when you got these good grades
and then because of that you learn to now be
an authority pleaser now as an adult you please authority
figures and you try to please your boss and your
whole your whole work life and your whole career revolves
around just pleasing authority figures because that's how you learned
to get love or let's say for example you got
approval for being pretty and beautiful when you were young
so you got obsessed with playing that up and so
you started dressing up and you put a lot of
makeup on and maybe you even get some plastic surgery
and you're so you're up your life is obsessed about
this and maintaining the sort of appearance of of beauty
and being pretty and being girly or whatever because that
was what you were trained into and that's how you
learn to survive and that's how you got your sex
that's how you got your approval that's how you got
your love that's how you got your sense of superiority
over other girls in school you know you felt good
because the boys liked you more than they liked all
the other girls that felt really good to you and
you got more text messages more phone calls and more
dates and more sex and more um you know men
wanting to marry you higher quality men maybe or maybe
lower quality men sometimes that attracts the lowest quality men
and and you had maybe a string of of bad
relationships with these men and how that shaped you and
your sense of your sense of who you are your
sense of self-esteem even maybe your career or how you
earn money maybe you relied upon these men to shower
you with gifts to drive you places to get you
jobs to to you know connect you with others to
help you to to move up in the world and
that's become a way of life for you and you
don't even know how to survive otherwise now i'm not
judging you i'm not saying this is good or bad
none of this is good or bad it just is
survival so you should stop judging yourself because if you're
judging yourself while you're doing this exercise you're trying to
really unearth doing this psychic archaeology trying to unearth your
survival if you're if you're judging yourself as you're doing
it that's going to interfere with your ability to really
observe what's there and where it came from in the
same way that if some archaeologist was judging the thing
he was excavating like let's say some archaeologist is digging
in egypt and you know he he digs up some
mummy or some skeleton and he's like oh that's an
ugly mummy i don't like it um well then he
can't observe it and study it objectively because he's he's
biased against it he's too busy judging it so you
got to do your archaeology neutrally that's one of the
principles of good science and this is a science this
is like we're doing science on you the science of
you uology we're doing eulogy here paleo eulogy uh another
example might be let's say you're a guy and your
first girlfriend you know you fell in love with her
in high school and you were madly in love with
her and then she cheated on you behind your back
and you found out about it with your best friend
or something and then you became so bitter and then
you developed an anti-feminist ideology now you hate you hate
women you hate feminism and now you've built up a
an ideology against this there's a lot of guys like
this out there and sometimes it's so silly when you
look back at it sometimes it's so silly um that
something like this can shape your whole identity but it
it sometimes does work in these very simplistic ways consider
for example if your mom wasn't loving so you blank
what did you do because your mom wasn't loving enough
or accepting enough of you didn't give you enough approval
or your dad your dad wasn't loving so you did
blank you developed blank survival strategy blank coping mechanism blank
fear blank insecurity and it stays with you to even
to this day 30 years later it's still there see
love is a very crucial one you should spend a
lot of time contemplating who you are as a result
of the love you didn't receive when you were younger
there's a there's a profound correlation between those two i
can draw if we sat down together for a couple
of hours we could dig real deep do some sort
of psycho psychoanalysis on you and and and just give
you some profound epiphanies about why the you do today
that is so dysfunctional is simply the result of a
lack of love you received from your mother or your
father when you were younger and sometimes it's simple sometimes
it's very convoluted too and it doesn't have to make
a lot of logical sense a lot of the stuff
a lot of these sort of connections in your psyche
are very illogical like your father wasn't loving to you
so therefore you you became rebellious and you started to
hate religion because your father was also religious let's say
so you start to hate religion and now you're this
um you know you're this hyper logical rational scientific atheist
scientist you know astrophysicist nerd and maybe you work at
a great university like at mit uh you're an astrophysicist
doing this stuff and you might think that well your
astrophysics has nothing to do and your you know your
scientific materialist philosophy has nothing to do with the fact
that your father wasn't loving to you you might say
these are unrelated this is not leo none of this
is that you're talking about none of this is scientific
it doesn't make any rational sense and yet nevertheless simply
because your father didn't give you the love you wanted
and he was religious that led you down the path
of this sort of scientific atheistic materialistic you know sort
of a nerd identity that you adopted as a coping
mechanism for that now maybe it turned out well for
you in the sense that you got a good job
and you love what you do okay great but still
there's something there's a wound there that you haven't addressed
and it's got very little to do with science or
with logic it's got a lot more to do with
love or lack thereof and you better believe you might
think well leo so what i'm still doing good science
so it doesn't matter ah not so fast you see
because your ability to do science is actually going to
be corrupted by the fact that you didn't receive sufficient
love and therefore you're reacting against that and therefore for
example you are closed off your mind is literally closed
to studying religion picking up a religious book or even
listening to someone like me even teach something that might
smack of religion it might turn you off you might
click the video off and you might not hear about
non-duality or mysticism or awakening or other things or absolute
truth or other things that are important for you to
do your science well see if you can't tolerate the
things i say then you can't watch my series my
three-part series deconstructing the myth of science and then you
won't be able to understand what science is and all
of that because you didn't get the love you needed
as a child and because of that you're going to
be deluded as a materialist and you're never going to
discover absolute truth which is really what you want as
a scientist but you're going to miss it because your
mind is closed and the reason it's closed because you
didn't get the love you wanted and now you're in
denial about it and now you've got coping mechanisms and
defense mechanisms you've got layer upon layer of coping mechanisms
and defense making them such that it would take hours
for me just to break through to you just to
convince you that this is the case and you might
be a high iq highly rational highly logical scientific person
and yet you're still being dense because there's something deeper
going on in your life than science or rationality your
life is not around that your life is around survival
the survival of your psyche and your psyche can't survive
without love you fool your life your life doesn't run
on reason you don't you don't live for a reason
you live for love and your reasoning is just uh
various tricks the ego mind uses to to to justify
how it gets love and various partial and biased ways
it has of of loving or for example let's say
your dad was a businessman successful businessman very busy and
so the only way he gave you attention and approval
and respect is if you also did business stuff he
looked down upon religious stuff he looked down upon meditation
he looked down upon artistic stuff so even though maybe
you wanted to become an artist you didn't because to
earn his respect you needed your father's love and respect
um you also went into business and now you're running
a successful business but you secretly deep down you hate
doing business you don't like it and you don't mean
you're feeling depressed and uh you're feeling like your life
is not going well stuff in your business is not
going well after a certain point because really it's not
really aligned with what you really want because what you
really want is you want to be an artist but
you didn't allow that to yourself because you had to
earn the respect of your father and all of this
happened unconsciously automatically you didn't even think about it it
happened years ago you forgot about it it was 40
years 40 years ago this this choice was made to
become a business person in your life maybe when you
were 15 years old you made this choice and now
you're like in your 50s and yet still this this
this thing is running your life and you won't be
satisfied until you address it if you grew up rich
think of how that shaped your life and who you
are if you grew up poor think of how that
shaped your life if you grew up white or black
or asian think of how that shaped your life if
you grew up fighting with your parents or divorced parents
think of that how that shaped who you are if
you grew up with animals think of how that shaped
who you are if you grew up reading lots of
books think of how that shaped you if you grew
up watching tv lots of tv or playing lots of
video games think of how that shaped who you are
if you hung out with certain kinds of friends from
this group here or from that group there think of
how that shaped who you are if you were bullied
in school think of how that shaped who you are
if kids laughed at you for being short in school
think of how that shaped who you are if your
mother yelled at you and criticized you constantly think of
how that shaped who you are if your father was
a inept inefficient ineffective provider for your family think about
how that shape who you are if your father was
very critical of you how that shaped who you are
if your household was religious how that shaped who you
are if your household and your whole family ate junk
food how that shaped who you are if you were
an only child how that shaped who you are if
you were less good-looking than average kids in school or
if you were downright ugly how that shaped who you
are all of this that i mentioned above creates biases
in your mind and compensation mechanisms you have to compensate
for all of these inadequacies that you perceive about yourself
now some of these inadequacies could be legitimate like maybe
you are very short maybe you were born very short
and that's just the hand you were dealt the cards
you were dealt um and you might and and that's
just that but also some of these inadequacies and you
might say that that's an inadequacy but also notice that
just because you are physically short does not automatically equal
inadequacy because there are very short people in the world
who don't perceive their shortness as an inadequacy but you
might so what is it about you that gets you
to think that it is an inadequacy you see you
might say well leo it just i don't think it's
inadequate i know it's an inadequacy because i'm just shorter
no it's more complicated than that because it's not really
an inadequacy until you start to believe it is there
are believe it or not short people who don't believe
that it's an inadequacy you might say well they're just
fooling themselves well that's see that's part of your part
of your world view which is part of how you
survived because you really believe it's an inadequacy but a
lot of your inadequacies are not even as physical as
just being short a lot of your inadequacies could be
misperceptions you might think you're inadequate in some area and
that might be a complete illusion that is sourced from
something that happened in your life when you were young
and you misinterpreted it or you didn't think about it
very deeply and then you just took it on as
that inadequacy and then that became a self-fulfilling prophecy over
time and it snowballed and it fed it into itself
and then it it manifested i'm not i'm not saying
that all of your inadequacies and problems are just manifested
in that manner but many of them are many of
them are so look into that and then the problem
is that when you develop these sort of perceived inadequacies
and various biases in your mind and compensation mechanisms for
how you're surviving see you're just when you're surviving in
life most the time when we're surviving we're just we're
just barely scraping by um we're just pulling together whatever
we can whatever is at at our hand that we
can grasp on like we'll grasp this thing there and
that thing here we'll pull these two two things together
and combine them and combine a third thing and if
it just helps me to survive that's just it that's
who i'm going to become and how i'm going to
live for the rest of my life we don't consciously
sit there and choose like well huh i could survive
in this way or that way that's a healthy way
that's an unhealthy way i'll choose that one or oh
no that's even better i'll choose that one and then
i'll swap these around later like most of us don't
do this and we don't think about the long-term consequences
of the things that we're using to do our survival
because most of us are so desperate like we're going
to take the first thing that will help us to
survive like if if if smoking weed helps me to
survive the sort of drudgery of school i'm just going
to start smoking weed chronically and hanging out with my
weed buddies and we're going to be doing that chronically
and then that's just going to be my way of
surviving and i'm not even going to think about other
ways other alternatives or what the consequences are going to
be or how it's going to affect anything or you
know how that's going to shape me 20 years down
the road and how that will distort your perception of
reality you see that's the that's the real kicker here
is that not only are you using all these ways
to survive uh some of them can be very dysfunctional
but since survival is such a serious thing it starts
to then distort your perception of reality then it becomes
very difficult for you to perceive reality clearly because you
become your life become so hinged on surviving using these
various biases and compensation mechanisms that you've adopted you don't
even know how you would live without them and usually
you can't adopt one of these compensation mechanisms or defense
mechanisms without yourself or deceiving yourself in some way that's
a lot of what our compensation mechanisms are they're ways
that we hide aspects of reality or truth which is
painful or uncomfortable to us things we want to avoid
or not look at because they're too ugly or too
painful or too stressful or too uncomfortable or too embarrassing
or too shocking too scary like if you were born
in a religious community and your whole sense of family
and and pride and joy in your life is is
that sort of community that's built around that religion for
you then to to actually start to investigate the epistemic
and metaphysical truth of that religion to seriously investigate that
and then to start to discover that maybe it's not
true do you see how threatening that is and do
you see why you would never do it most people
would never do it everything in your psyche would would
scream and revolt and try to avoid that try to
deny it so your mind would invent all sorts of
defense mechanisms to avoid and deny really looking deeply into
the sort of epistemics of your religious faith because if
that were to crumble then the thing that it's supporting
you know the community the family all that love you
get and that that sense of camaraderie and friendship and
all the meaning in your life all of that would
crumble and it's too much for you to to even
want to think about so you just click the video
off you don't even want to hear this possibility this
is what i mean by biases and compensation mechanisms and
distorting your perception reality and now can you see how
that distorts your entire perception of reality because these sort
of defense mechanisms you create to maintain your religious worldview
these defense mechanisms now have to now you have to
play this sort of game of avoiding certain things within
science you have to deny certain things in science you
have to deny with certain things within spiritual teachings you
have to not read certain books you have to not
watch certain videos and you have to kind of play
this this this this dance of hide and seek in
your for the rest of your life in order to
maintain that house of cards and you better believe that's
going to distort your perception reality then your mind has
to rationalize all this to itself it has first of
all you have to deny that you're doing any of
this then you have to rationalize why actually that scientific
book is is actually bad or wrong and this is
wrong and that is wrong and that person is wrong
in this video you shouldn't watch and this channel is
stupid and then start to judge and you should have
to criticize it boom boom boom boom boom and then
do you see how this multiplies in cascades the distortions
cascade the lies and fantasies cascade don't think that this
only applies to religious fanatics here this this example i
could have easily talked about science instead or rationality or
business or money or sex or relationships or marriage or
children it's not it's not particular to religion here here
are some examples from my own life so when i
was young about six seven years old i moved my
family moved from the ussr which was soviet russia back
then communist russia to america this was right around the
time when the soviet union collapsed we moved and the
soviet union collapsed a few months later um and this
this had a profound impact on my worldview and uh
the work i do today and everything else um in
in in many subtle ways and i'm still sort of
struggling to understand exactly all the ramifications this had on
me but there was a huge culture shock because you
know the russian culture switching from the communist culture the
capitalist culture it was it was a huge huge culture
shock um it was a shock in terms of standards
of living it was a shock in terms of going
to school and dealing with language different language different culture
different customs different ways of socializing and i struggled a
lot with that especially like for the first five years
i struggled a lot i especially started a lot to
fit in socially it was difficult to fit in socially
with all the other kids like in first second grade
especially because i just i literally had zero of the
english language no english language at all so i remember
like in first grade i was barely even able to
communicate with my teacher i didn't even know what she
was telling me let alone like learning deep lessons or
whatever like i didn't even know like when she was
telling me i was doing something wrong i didn't even
know that very i mean you could you can kind
of guess from their emotions but like um you know
she's yelling at you probably know you did something wrong
but you don't know exactly what you did wrong um
so that was a struggle but the the bigger struggle
that was really fitting in with the with the american
culture because all the kids were already at that age
they're already kind of like so immersed in the culture
they don't even know that it could be any other
way but for me like learning some of the american
culture was a real challenge and i had to sort
of i had to i had to really mold my
psyche in order to fit in i had to sort
of pretend and kind of like go along you know
sort of fake it till you make it approach was
necessary in order to um to really survive socially in
elementary school because otherwise the kids would laugh at me
or you know i wasn't really bullied that much um
there was no serious bullying but still like just mocking
laughing ridicule just kind of like you know not wanting
to hang out with you making you feel kind of
like a loner or making you feel weird and different
like a foreigner this these can be some of these
things are very simple um and you might say well
it's not a big deal you'll just get over it
but you don't get over it because really what i
had to do is i had to adapt certain social
survival strategies um in order to sort of fit in
and what i noticed later even really even to this
day it's made me deeply insecure in certain ways like
it's made me always like whenever i'm socializing with people
um there's always like a second like when most americans
just socialize just naturally you know they they do it
unconsciously they just kind of like they just they just
do it and it just kind of flows and it's
natural uh for me it's not like that because for
me there's like a secondary process that's kind of like
going on in my mind given where you know my
survival situation came from um and those sort of coping
mechanisms i developed is that like there's sort of a
secondary process which is like a sort of a self-reflective
self-critical process which is always kind of observing my own
self in a meta way and asking the question like
am i fitting in am i being weird am i
doing something wrong like is this cool you know like
is this how people behave in this room in this
situation this environment or not um and it's like it's
really difficult to unwire that because this was wired into
my mind from age like six or seven now of
course i've done a lot of work and i've become
a lot better about that i used to be very
very shy and socially insecure i've done a lot of
work i've talked about that in some of my pickup
episodes and so forth that helped a lot but still
i still have some of those remnants there some of
these samskaras um and i noticed like sometimes i overcompensate
sometimes i'm inauthentic because of this sometimes i'm people pleasing
i have that kind of tendency sometimes i withdraw into
my mind case that wasn't obvious and i can make
a connection between my withdrawing into my mind and like
being quite a solitary person pretty introverted person i can
kind of draw that that i can draw that chain
all the way back to you know to those early
social survival situations uh i don't really enjoy being social
probably for these reasons because i have sort of a
negative association with it um in my childhood and so
therefore my life is really not about that aspect like
you might think that compared to other normal people for
me socialization with like friends and with family and with
intimate relationships of course i do i do some of
that but like it's significantly diminished that aspect of my
life is significantly diminished compared to most normal people what
i've called normal people and there are pros and cons
to that there are some very big pros to that
and some very big cons to that um and i
i don't even know if i had the choice to
go back and to change it i don't even know
if i would in a certain sense i'm sort of
happy with where i ended up but also you got
to be careful because of course you you're always going
to be happy with what you're comfortable with and you're
not going to want to change deep aspects of your
psyche so there's there's that to consider but also in
a certain sense uh you know it's given me a
lot of advantages um it's made me very independent for
example it's made me um able to avoid a lot
of groupthink a lot of ideology that i would have
otherwise fallen into it's made me a lot more unique
more self-reliant um i would say even more successful in
certain ways but also it it comes with certain limitations
so there's trade-offs there it's made me question cultural norms
and social norms a lot a lot of my work
i simply could not do if i was social if
i was social in the normal sense that people are
because to be social in the normal sense that people
are you have to you have to you have to
like play the social game that everybody else is playing
and if you're going to be playing that game you
simply can't do some of the work that i do
because it would be so jarring and so conflicting with
with what most people believe or most people talk about
um uh so again yeah there's trade-offs and pros and
cons there but nevertheless that's sort of how my life
unfolded it is what it is and i can always
work to you know to improve those things so another
aspect of my early life and survival that shaped me
a lot today is with like i said earlier with
my family's financial situation and instability there were specifically financial
dysfunctions like deep financial dysfunctions with the the way my
father earned money and in certain ways it was i'm
grateful because he was basically always able to provide for
us but it was very rocky at times and it
was very insecure and very unstable and it led to
various sorts of fears that were there even though like
i didn't starve or anything and uh you know i
even had a lot of luxury when i was growing
up we went on great vacations sometimes and we ate
at great restaurants sometimes and we we had nice cars
sometimes then again other times our cars were repossessed our
electricity was turned off i didn't have money to even
buy a jacket or shoes when i needed them or
i didn't have money to go to a dentist or
to a doctor and so this left some samskaras in
me for sure one thing is that it made me
very financially conservative extremely financially conservative to the point where
it it actually hurts me in certain ways it's helped
me because it means that i like i really i'm
very averse to wasting money i'm very very stingy because
i saw how how wasteful my my dad was with
money and the sort of horrendous problems this led to
in our family it ultimately ended up destroying our whole
family um so i saw that had a deep impact
on me so of course the lesson i learned from
that is to be very conservative and careful with one's
money not to gamble not to waste it on stupid
things not to buy stupid things and in a certain
sense that was great i needed that because that allowed
me to bootstrap some of my first businesses i had
to be very frugal to do that i couldn't do
it otherwise i had to save money be very very
frugal but as i grew older and i developed wealth
as a result of that i realized after a certain
point that i had more wealth than almost anybody i
knew in my family or in my friends in my
social circle and so forth and yet i was stingier
than all those people and i started to notice how
that was hurting me and backfiring and so i started
to realize like yeah i over compensated for that childhood
situation i swung my pendulum too much to the conservative
end and you know socially i'm very liberal but financially
i'm extremely conservative and so like um i don't even
like investing money in stocks because i'm so conservative that
i'm sort of paranoid that the market's going to crash
and then i'll lose all my money even though i've
invested money in stocks in the past i've made lots
of money in stocks i've lost lots of money in
stocks when i was young overall i tend to sort
of avoid it but anyways then i realized as you
know i developed wealth and i grew older now i'm
realizing that i have to i have to i have
to dial it back dial the conservatives back and over
the last year or two i was much more uh
with my money in fact i wasted quite a bit
of money in the last year that normally i would
not have wasted just buying things i don't even need
for example um simply because i've i was i was
letting loose those reins that straight jacket that i put
on myself for the first 30 years of my life
i was letting that loose and as that was happening
i started wasting money more and of course you might
say well leo that's bad well actually for me it
was good for me wasting a little bit of money
is actually that actually grows me now for you maybe
if you waste your money too much of course if
you let that go too much you're going to swing
too much to the other extreme and that's going to
be bad and so now you know i've maybe even
overshot to this direction wasting too much now i'm going
to kind of dial it back and in this way
you find your balancing point also this sort of financial
instability that i experienced in my childhood it forced me
at a young age when i was a teenager to
get very serious about my life purpose my schooling and
my career because basically the only option i had when
i was like 15 years old to 18 years old
in that range basically through high school and early university
the choice for me was like either i get very
serious about developing a career or i'm going to be
forever in the situation of financial instability and i was
so sick of this financial instability and financial dysfunction that
i was already living under for the last 10 15
years that like the choice for me was a no-brainer
so i got very very serious and disciplined about school
because to me that was just the natural stepping stone
you know if you're serious about school then you're going
to be likely to get a serious career serious job
i got serious about that so i got serious about
both those things and i also became very pragmatic and
utilitarian like i had to become very realistic about finances
about how to actually do business how to make the
business actually make money not fanciful ideas about this or
that working out maybe something will work maybe something won't
work it's like no it has to work right like
very very pragmatic and a lot of my success i
attribute to that but also it was in a certain
sense psychologically dysfunctional because i sacrificed a lot i basically
sacrificed my entire social life my dating life was non-existent
my sexual life was not exist i sacrificed virtually everything
for education and for my my career and my life
purpose and i sort of was in that i was
sort of forced into that situation now of course i
could have made other choices i'm not i'm not saying
that was the only way it could have gone but
those were the choices i made and i made them
because they made a lot of sense because i knew
i knew the pain and suffering that would happen if
i didn't do that if i was like all the
other kids in high school who were just around or
taking academics seriously and then all the kids in college
who were also around going you know drinking and going
to parties and this sort of stuff and having sex
and doing stupid dating relationships that fizzled out and led
to nowhere if they were doing all this dumb stuff
they weren't really building their career they weren't thinking about
their life purpose um to me it was like this
was the stupidest thing i could have done because then
i would have been in this deep financial instability for
from for decades in my life and i didn't want
that i wanted that part of my life just handled
i didn't want to think about money ever again and
that's what i achieved um now i still think about
money but i don't really need to it's actually dysfunctional
it's dysfunctional for me at this point to think about
money because i don't really need to but i still
do it because it's just a habit that i developed
that i had to develop to get to the point
where i'm at today if i didn't develop it i
wouldn't be here talking to you there would be no
actualized.org there would be none of these teachings these teachings
are only possible because of the financial independence that i
was able to develop through the sort of um overly
disciplined paranoid um quasi-dysfunctional survival strategy that i developed when
i was in my late teens and early 20s for
business and for career and for life purpose so here
we are so again there's trade-offs there's there's there's good
and bad to it most of your life choices will
have trade-offs like this another thing i noticed about my
early survival strategies is that i sort of as i
was getting into academic achievement i sort of started getting
a lot of my love from the approval that i
got from parents and educators teachers um for being really
good with academics and so i sort of i fell
into this trap of doing things for the grades to
get good grades just to to get the approval that
that generated now in a certain sense this this actually
helped me because it made me really good at academics
it made me smart it made me more educated than
most the other kids and this has paid huge dividends
um you know education pays dividends for the rest of
your life so in a certain sense that was great
but it was also dysfunctional in a sense is that
i noticed that later when i even you know finished
school and all that that my motivations were not fully
intrinsic but extrinsic in the sense that i would do
something for the accolades or for the approval that i
would get from the customers or from my family or
from friends or from just external sources and i started
to realize that that there's there's something dysfunctional about that
my motivation needs to be more internal and my sense
of love and approval needs to be more coming from
my own self rather than from outside because that was
a that was sort of a dependency that i didn't
want um and it wasn't healthy and so i did
i did things to sort of rewire my mind and
my psyche to remove that approval so nowadays i get
a lot less of my approval from like you from
the customers from the um from third parties from the
comment sections like uh i actually sort of play a
little game with myself like i read a lot of
the comments i've read thousands of comments so whenever somebody
gives me a positive comment in the comments section like
oh leo is great or something or leo's a genius
or whatever like i could read that and i could
take pride it's like oh yeah leo's a genius i
could i could read it that way or i could
read it like like this and this is how i
tend to read it nowadays is like um i mean
yeah that's nice that that this person left this comment
but i don't want that to actually change how i
feel about myself because if if that comment makes me
feel feel good then i'm going to want the next
comment to also make me feel good and the next
one and the next one and then my sense of
identity and my sense of positive feeling is going to
be about whether people call me a genius or call
me good or call my work important or whatever and
i don't want that so i want to sever that
connection so in a certain sense it kind of makes
me ungrateful towards a lot of the positive comments you
guys leave me um um i mean i am i
am grateful on some level and i i understand i
understand why i leave the comments and all that but
also from my point of view you have to understand
that it's actually unhealthy for me to get all these
positive comments um because it does it certainly when you
read thousands of positive comments about yourself it certainly grows
your ego um and it doesn't it doesn't really lead
to true happiness so my happiness and life can't be
predicated upon the comments that anybody leaves me even if
they are deserved and of course there's plenty of negative
ones as well that i read yeah so these are
just a few examples from my own life that maybe
help you to see use these examples to dive deeper
into your own self and to figure out what it
is for you that's why i'm sharing these examples with
you so i want to clarify here who you are
as an ego mind as a psyche is of course
the survival challenges we've been talking about it is cultural
programming also we've talked about that elsewhere but also it's
genetics genetics plays a pretty big role so i don't
want to dismiss that it's not merely that if if
we place two people into the same survival situation they're
gonna grow up the same no they're gonna have different
genetics if we place you and me into the same
survival situations we're still gonna probably come out pretty different
because i have different genetics than you don't underestimate the
significance of genetics but the thing with genetics is you
can't really change that you got whatever cards you were
dealt genetically so you got to deal with that it's
not really a variable you can change very much um
as long as you got your diet in place and
so forth and there's there's certain epigenetic components but mostly
your genetics are what they are so you just got
to deal with it accept it and then what you
can change though is looking at these survival challenges how
you survive that's why we're talking about them so much
so the next point is that consider this psychopaths sociopaths
criminals narcissists multiple personality disorders schizophrenics alcoholics what all these
people have in common just all these disorders if we
want to call them that all of these are the
result of survival situations people are these things because that's
how they survived these are coping mechanisms much of your
core identity was created around the avoidance of deep suffering
so your psyche erected armor and defense mechanisms against the
suffering so really what shaped you the most are two
things two things the sources of deep suffering in your
life deepest suffering during the first 20 years of your
life and the sources of the deepest love in your
life so whatever those were and those could have been
the same sources like it could have the deepest source
of suffering and love in your life could have been
your mother or your father or maybe your father was
the deepest source of suffering and your mother was a
deeper source of love or vice versa and of course
the closer someone is to you especially in your you
know closest family members they were probably some of the
biggest sources of your deepest suffering and love so really
hone in on that contemplate that deeply and figure out
what those were because that will that will sort of
unravel this whole situation for you lay it bare clarify
a lot of things for you and then see the
the the sources of the deepest suffering they create insecurity
and fear and senses of inadequacy and coping mechanisms to
avoid that at all costs a lot of times your
coping mechanism is dysfunctional and it's obviously dysfunctional you might
even know it's dysfunctional but in your mind the way
it's rationalized the logic of your mind is that well
yes it's dysfunctional and it creates suffering but not as
much suffering as i would have gotten if i hadn't
created it and therefore that rationalizes it and it stays
in its place because you fear that if you let
go of this coping mechanism this armor then sure yeah
it it ruins your life a bit and it causes
suffering and dysfunction but in the back of your mind
you know how much suffering would happen if you didn't
have that armor and you're afraid of that of feeling
that suffering again because you felt it once or twice
and you had enough so you would rather hold that
armor up for the rest of your life than to
risk the possibility of letting it down and getting a
little bit of that suffering so it takes courage to
take your armor down and while also what you have
to understand is that there are different kinds of armor
so you can let this armor down you can find
a better piece of armor so you don't have to
completely open yourself up to deep suffering i'm not saying
that that's the solution here although that's the ultimate solution
but like before you get to that ultimate solution you
can upgrade your armor and you could find healthier coping
mechanisms healthier survival strategies so it's sort of a carrot
and stick model this was the stick and then you
got the carrot the carrot is the love and then
this can also though lead to dysfunction because like i
was giving you that example with the approval from my
teachers on my you know grades and then how that
led to me seeking approval through comments and other you
know praise for my work and so forth that's the
that's the that's the carrot that's the love so you
have to be careful about where you try to get
love from because you can try to get it from
very dysfunctional places from authority figures from external sources ideally
you want to be able to to feed yourself your
own carrots so really you want to become self-reliant and
give yourself the love that you are and that you
want and that you need and that you feel you
deserve because really the only one who could love you
sufficiently is your own self but a lot of times
we we don't realize that the most obvious thing and
we somehow think that well it's not true love unless
it's coming from somebody else well that in itself already
sets you up into a very dysfunctional problematic uh situation
that will never be resolved and so watch out where
are you getting your love from um are you used
to getting it from your parents from your co-workers from
your boss from authority figures from your lovers or sexual
partners from your work all of that is going to
limit you and not allow you to develop to the
highest levels that you can so take that into account
you want to replace the ways in which you get
love you want to replace the partial ways that you
have developed for more holistic expansive ways which are not
as partial and not as contingent right you see like
if for you to feel love you need your sexual
partner to tell you how much he loves you in
the morning every morning and unless he says that you
don't feel love do you see how you have made
yourself a slave to that person why set up that
contingency why not tell yourself that you love yourself every
morning then you don't need this guy see you're using
this guy to tell you he loves you when really
you can just short circuit that thing and just tell
yourself you love yourself now you're saying oh leo but
that's cheating that that's not real love it is real
love but you guys even deeper your love for your
own self believe me will be a hundred times deeper
if you do this work than any man's love for
you but but it's gonna take some serious personal development
work and spiritual development work to reach that point of
true self-love see my episode called self-love and i have
other episodes about love what is love part one part
two i've talked about love quite a bit and we'll
continue to do so so um so yeah but right
now see right now you don't know how to love
yourself that might take you five ten years to develop
that and until you develop it you're going to be
using this man in your life as a crutch and
maybe you stay with this man even though he's not
right for you because he does give you at least
a little bit of the love that you can't give
yourself and so this just perpetuates a dysfunctional survival strategy
see so the bottom line is that you are confusing
your survival patterns and strategies with who you are you
become attached to them because you formed an identity out
of them you have in other words become your survival
this is a problem because survival always ultimately fails survival
is losing game you can't win survival forever it only
works in the short term and medium term but in
the long term as they say we're all dead you
can't win the game of survival so if you identify
with your survival and that's all you think life is
and that's all you think you are is this thing
that needs to survive you've you've set up yourself to
lose the game and you better believe that's a deep
existential problem now of course you avoid it because you
don't think about your death very much um but you
can't avoid thinking about your death forever you're gonna have
to face it at some point and when you do
it's gonna be very painful so you might as well
start to think about that earlier rather than later because
there are things you can do to transcend survival so
one of the points of this exercise that we've been
doing here looking into your past is to show you
just how contingent your worldview is how arbitrary how precarious
it didn't have to be that way you could have
turned out to be a very very different person with
a very different worldview a very different political ideology economic
beliefs a very different sexual identity very different beliefs about
mankind just if your survival conditions were changed a little
bit so when you recognize that this helps you to
detach from your worldview and to stop treating your worldview
as this special true thing you see your psyche tries
to rationalize your worldview as the one true one the
best one is so special and so important and then
you spend the rest of your life debating it and
defending it when really you should see through all that
and realize that it's all just rationalizations you're not that
special your worldview is not that special it's not that
true most of your worldview is illusions and fantasies cobbled
together held together by string and snot uh just just
to get you barely to survive that's really what your
worldview is about it's not about some ultimate truth the
way that you tell yourself and it's not who you
really are and it's not how reality actually is science
is not how reality actually is science is a survival
strategy you fool it's not deeply true it's not the
only one it's not special it's not important it's a
survival strategy that you're acting out and that you're denying
you're so you're so acting it out that you're even
in denial that it is a survival strategy you've convinced
yourself that that this science is this like pinnacle of
truth and reason and objectivity you're fooling yourself and if
even science can't clear this bar if even science is
a survival strategy then what does that say about everything
else which is even worse even less rigorous about religion
about your mystical beliefs about your new age beliefs about
your um everything else about your economic beliefs your social
beliefs your political beliefs it's for the most part it's
fantasies and houses of cards you've built that allow you
to survive barely barely you are acting out deep survival
patterns which are deeply unconscious within you without realizing that
you're doing so and you're justifying them as important true
and real which they aren't they're a fantasy this is
the key to understand about your psyche if you don't
understand this you're going to be thoroughly self-deceived for the
rest of your life and if you start to accept
what i'm saying here this is the beginning of the
unraveling of the self-deception but still just the beginning there's
a lot of work to do you're still acting out
many of these patterns it's going to take a lot
of work to undo these patterns you're attached to them
you're unconscious of them and you're defensive about it and
you're in denial about it and i want you to
start to recognize how your survival strategies limit you the
biggest mistake people make is that they confuse survival with
truth or with goodness or with love survival is a
thing holding you back from truth goodness and love survival
is the inferior crippled dysfunctional manner that you have cobbled
together to get a little tiny sliver of truth goodness
and love into your life it's the bottleneck we have
to widen this bottle neck to get more truth goodness
and love into your life and this is the process
of widening the bottleneck that we're doing here the more
seriously you take this process the more you do the
exercises the more you will dilate that bottleneck anything that
allows you to survive and to thrive especially thrive gets
backwards rationalized by the ego mind as true valid and
good this is the ultimate illusion that the ego spins
the best examples of this is the grifting that you
see people do on in the media politicians priests talk
show hosts news anchors businessmen wall street types bankers academics
youtubers many of these folk are grifters but the grift
is so good the grift is so deep they don't
recognize that they're grifters they don't believe or feel themselves
to be grifting because they're true believers in whatever they're
preaching or teaching or selling why because to sell to
preach to teach to lie effectively to spin illusions effectively
to sell fantasies effectively you have to buy the fantasy
yourself otherwise there's too much cognitive dissonance within you it
creates a sort of instability in the psyche when you
are preaching something and you don't believe what you're preaching
therefore the most effective preachers are completely deluded into the
fantasies that they're preaching same thing with the news anchors
the news anchors who are delivering the news to you
they can only do that effectively consistently for long periods
of time if they are fully bought into the world
view from which they are delivering the news and the
people who are running businesses these giant multi-billion dollar businesses
that require enormous investments of time money energy and all
that the only way these businesses can be run is
if the managers and leaders who run these businesses have
fooled themselves into thinking that these businesses are doing something
good for the world it's always the ego's job to
rationalize whatever it's doing as being good your mind is
doing this every day and in a certain sense it's
true all these things are good everything is good that's
the ultimate truth everything is good which is why the
ego can get away with this you see so actually
it's it's it's really twisted you might think like well
the ego is lying all the time that's really what
you're saying but it's it's it's more subtle than that
it's not that the ego is lying like for example
when hitler is doing his evil stuff actually what he's
doing is good everything is good there's nothing there's nothing
bad in the world everything is good um but the
way that the hitler's ego can rationalize that what he's
doing is good is precisely because everything is literally good
so anything you point to can be made to look
good simply by focusing on it and sort of avoiding
the collateral damage of the consequences that happen to other
aspects of reality if you're unholistic you can get away
with that and that's exactly what the ego does the
ego is always biased and unholistic in the way that
it looks at the world it always looks at it
from a selfish lens in a selfish way and ignores
all the collateral consequences and damage and so therefore by
looking at it in this narrow way it's able to
see it's oh it's sort of the eco is sort
of carving out its own version of goodness but it's
always a finite piece of the pie so if absolute
goodness is the whole pie all of reality everything that
could ever possibly occur that's absolute goodness the ego is
saying well i don't like this piece of the pie
i don't like that pie of the pie so it
cuts out all those and it just cuts a little
sliver of the pie that it likes for itself here
so hitler basically said okay i only like this this
much of the pie the rest of the pie i
can you know them i just care about this pie
here this little piece and then he eats that piece
and it tastes good to him and he actually believes
that this is the best pie this is the the
best the pie can be and then you you carve
out a different piece of the pie maybe your piece
of pie is a little bit bigger than hitler's maybe
twice as big and somebody else carves out a little
bit a little bit bigger piece a little bigger piece
people carve out different sizes of of pie but all
of them are are still like one percent less than
one percent of the of the whole um and then
since we're carving different parts of the pie you know
well your piece of the pie contradicts hitler's piece of
the pie so you call hitler evil hitler's piece of
the pie contradicts with your piece of the pie so
hitler thinks you're bad and you need to be killed
and so everybody is doing that carving up this pie
into pieces but what nobody understands is that the entire
pie is absolutely good and that's it it's just that
simple and therefore everybody can get away with loving some
part of the pie because the entire piece the entire
pie is just love the pie is love itself it's
infinite love it's an infinite love pie and then you're
just cherry picking whichever part of the pie you like
as the biased little ego that you are that you're
trying to survive as because the entire pie is too
big for you and it threatens you too much you
can't love the whole pie because it'll kill you so
you love little pieces of it that don't threaten you
so here are some key questions how are your top
fears and insecurities shaped by your early survival challenges how
did your early survival challenges shape your values what strategies
did you invent to get love in what ways are
you still over compensating what are some outdated survival patterns
armor and defense mechanisms you still act out today how
have they served you well in the past that's important
to acknowledge and become conscious of because they did serve
you well at some point in the past otherwise you
wouldn't have adopted them and how are they limiting you
today now they've probably outrun their usefulness and you can
find better ones and what would it look like if
you let them go what are you afraid would happen
if you let them go that's a very good question
to contemplate so i want to underscore that you should
have compassion for your early survival situations you didn't have
much of a choice about them you were thrown into
them from a position of total ignorance you had no
idea how to cope with them and you just did
the best you could and so there's no need to
feel shame or guilt about it you did the best
you could but you can do better now with more
knowledge more experience more consciousness higher teachings that you didn't
have see if somebody sat down and taught you what
i just taught you in the last two hours when
you were six years old you could have avoided a
lot of these problems but nobody did and part of
the reason is that when you were six years old
you couldn't even understand the things i'm talking about nor
would you be interested in them because you're a child
all you care about is candy and video games um
it's hard to even get you to eat healthy food
let alone to watch something like this and to understand
it and then to follow it for the rest of
your life it's hard to even get an adult to
do this let alone a six-year-old child but still some
some young children are watching and they'll this will change
their whole lives save them a lot of problems and
it's easier to do this younger than it is older
right like some of you who are watching who are
like in their teenage years some of you guys watch
me you're like 16 years old 18 years old so
i've even read comments of like 12 year olds watching
some of this content you've discovered like the secret to
life here if if you only watch this stuff and
then you don't turn into a dogma but you actually
practice it the way i talk about all the time
and warn you not to do not to turn into
a dogma you actually practice it you don't just listen
but practice and you apply for the rest of your
life your life will like you will you will be
orders of magnitude more developed than any of your peers
and your life will go so much better so don't
don't take this for granted but also as you have
compassion for your own early situation have compassion for the
early situations of others who probably had it worse than
you they also had little choice about it hitler had
very little choice about his early situation like i mean
i don't remember exactly but i believe he was drafted
he was probably drafted into world war one i don't
know if he was like when you're drafted into war
you have very little choice about that so whenever you
see somebody doing something you don't like or that you
hate or that you think is evil or disgusting or
wrong or you think the person is a monster just
ask yourself what was the early situation survival situation that
he was cornered into where he was forced to learn
these bad habits these dysfunctional survival strategies and and remind
yourself he had virtually no choice about it he was
cornered into these survival situations just like you were and
he was ignorant he was totally ignorant about how to
handle these situations so he might have made some bad
choices just like you probably did in your life too
which you probably regret and you would undo with the
benefit of wisdom but uh wise teachings are pretty rare
you don't come across these sorts of discussions very often
within your family at work on tv in the media
you were lucky that you found this information so can
you see why people's world views are so different why
people don't get along why people don't understand each other
they had such different survival situations that you can't even
imagine the survival situations that some people had to endure
and of course this led to very different world views
than your own and a worldview is just a survival
mechanism that's contingent to one's survival environment just like the
shape of a snake has to match the environment that
it tries to survive in otherwise it dies so really
all the evil people in the world that are doing
stuff you don't like that you hate all they're doing
is they're just surviving in the only way they know
how the best way they know how if they knew
a better way to survive they would do it but
they don't they don't know you might say well leo
but they should know they should know better no they
shouldn't the only way they could know better is if
their survival situation and their environment offered them opportunities to
know more opportunities for education for spiritual work for personal
development advice for these kinds of videos for mentors and
gurus and teachers who are loving and kind and wise
and truthful and unbiased and who could guide them but
this is extremely rare extremely rare recognize how rare this
is to have these kinds of people in your life
it's much more common to have mentors and teachers and
adults who abuse you exploit you manipulate you control you
mislead you feed you fantasies brainwash you use you selfishly
to serve their own survival that's much more common and
how can you blame them because their elders and adults
and parents and mentors also did the same thing to
them so it's just a cycle of ignorance being perpetuated
don't you see if people knew better they would act
better but they don't know better and don't underestimate the
significance of knowing better just knowing what the right thing
is what the best thing is is that can take
decades yes it's not enough just to know what the
right thing is or the best thing is you also
have to act of course you have to act and
it's not just enough to listen and to to read
a book or to listen to a video and just
to know but also don't underestimate how important it is
just to know something just to know what the right
thing is what you should pursue and what you shouldn't
pursue in life what the consequences of a certain choice
or action are just to know that that is a
very rare and valuable thing in and of itself if
people knew that they would act a lot better there
are a lot of obstacles to knowing that because the
way your psyche is shaped is that all those defense
mechanisms they become epistemological such that it even locks your
mind off from knowing these things that's how bad the
situation is when a person is deeply stuck in their
survival patterns you can't even get through to them their
mind is not open enough even to hear a communication
such as this one they can't hear it they would
have clicked the off button two hours ago and uh
even more more to the point they wouldn't have even
clicked on this video they wouldn't have even begun listening
to it that's how badly brainwashed they are that's how
badly their perception of reality is distorted by their survival
coping mechanisms so in conclusion you are a robot acting
out a survival script that's not all that you are
but the way that you've currently been living that's what
you basically are 99 of you is a robot acting
out a survival script spirituality is about transcending that script
and it is possible to transcend that script to radical
degrees degrees you might not believe until you start doing
some serious spiritual work once you see everyone is just
acting out their survival script you stop taking things personally
all the ways you struggle to survive as a kid
left karma patterns scars wounds and insecurities in samskaras in
your psyche and now you're left coping with those scars
spirituality is about purifying and healing those scars and development
is about finding more nuanced and functional ways of surviving
so we're really talking about two things here we're talking
about transcending survival altogether and finding aspects of life that
are beyond survival that's spiritual work and development work is
as important or even more important than the spiritual work
it's not about transcending survival it's about finding better more
functional healthier survival strategies because you still have to survive
even if you're spiritual if you want to live if
you don't want to live then you don't have to
develop survival strategies also i want you to notice that
every generation faces new survival challenges and develops unique coping
mechanisms with unique blind spots and limits and trade-offs so
the boomer generation which is popular to to meme these
days the the okay boomer generation developed certain coping strategies
and blind spots and we're living with those today many
of our politicians are their minds are sclerotic with these
blind spots and they're holding society back but don't think
that you know it's all the boomers fault every generation
will have its own form of this sort of mental
sclerosis especially as it gets older and the previous generation
dies so i mean gen x will have its own
coping mechanisms and blind spots millennials which is my generation
we have our own coping mechanisms and blind spots and
zoomers those of you who are younger than me you
will have your own they just haven't become a parent
yet so it's it's a never-ending cycle of of growth
into more consciousness and love and various limitations and biases
and resistance that holds us back from doing that individually
and collectively notice how most people around you are surviving
reactively not consciously they're just scraping together barely some kind
of survival strategy they're doing it from a position of
weakness and reactivity not proactively consciously deliberately planning out how
they're going to survive not deliberately comparing different survival strategies
swapping them out trying different things experimenting trying to improve
them upgrade them almost nobody is doing that so the
key distinction here is between opportunistic reactive survival and conscious
survival i'm trying to teach you conscious survival and then
beyond that how to transcend survival altogether so i invite
you to shift to conscious survival stop surviving opportunistically because
down that road lies evil and devilry as we've talked
about don't just do what's convenient and easiest and the
path of least resistance and what's most lucrative and what
gives you the most short-term pleasure follow a higher purpose
live life for a higher purpose you will be rewarded
for it there are trade-offs it's harder at first it's
an investment it's a long-term investment you make a long-term
investment and then it pays dividends for the rest of
your life that's the idea are you going to be
a wise investor in your own life can you think
of a better thing to invest into than your own
life what else do you have if you don't want
to invest in your own life then what are you
doing all right that's it hopefully this gets you a
little bit of a better appreciation for the depth and
importance of survival i can't stress this enough survival is
one of the most important things you can understand in
your life and almost nobody understands it so make sure
you go watch my earlier two-part series understanding survival part
one and part two combine it with this you could
think of this as part three in a certain sense
and this gets you a very very nice foundation and
and then this is not enough now you got to
do some of the work and i'll probably come up
with new episodes in the future about survival because there's
there's just so much that could be said about it
there's so many interesting facets to it i mean it's
basically what all of mankind is up to everybody in
your life everybody around you they're busy running around doing
what surviving in different ways and survival is so diverse
there's so many different ways you can do it it
can be so functional but it can also be so
dysfunctional and that range is enormous and so spending time
studying that is one of the most useful and practical
things that you can do in your life all right

have an editor who's cherry picking the best parts of
all my videos and he's gonna be uploading those to
the actualize clips channel it should be live now or
it will be live in the next few days and
those will be posted new clips will be posted on
a on a daily basis probably even multiple clips per
day we've basically got like over a thousand clips to
to prepare and to post a long-term project that will
take a couple of years to come to full fruition
but we'll start pumping out those clips now so um
subscribe to that channel as well if you uh if
you want the the sort of juiciest cherry picked bits
and the last thing i'll tell you to wrap all
this up is since we've been talking about survival the
majority of you listening to me what you're missing is
survival handle your survival get good at mastering survival don't
get too far ahead of your skis with the spiritual
stuff i talk a lot about the philosophical the metaphysical
the spiritual because you have to understand that from my
point of view i've sort of reached a very advanced
level in human development not to brag or anything but
it just is the case that like literally i'm losing
interest in most things in life that are just survival
i don't really care about money so much i don't
really care about raising a family i don't care about
doing more business and launching a bunch of businesses like
what really interests me is what's beyond survival but i
know that there are a few people who are at
that level so part of my job is not only
to teach what's beyond survival and how to get there
but to help you to reach the point where you
can even care about what's beyond survival and i know
you can't care about those things unless i help you
with the basics of survival so you have to understand
that i didn't just jump into spirituality at the beginning
of my life i spent like the first 15 or
20 years of my life really getting a solid handle
on survival and i still haven't fully done that i'm
still learning things in that area there's a lot to
learn about how to survive well um and more healthier
ways of surviving so i encourage you not to rush
too much especially if you're young if you're like in
your teens especially but if you're in your 20s or
even 30s and you haven't got a good solid handle
on survival because you wasted your time smoking weed playing
video games or you know hanging out with friends or
whatever partying and stuff like you're going to need to
spend a good solid 10 years just handling survival now
that doesn't mean you can't start laying the groundwork for
what comes next if you're genuinely interested in some of
the spiritual topics i talk about and you're genuinely interested
in awakening and psychedelics and whatever you can you can
dabble in some of that stuff you can start to
lay a little bit of a meditation habit maybe 30
60 minutes a day whatever start doing a few retreats
a year you can start laying that groundwork as you're
handling and learning about survival such that once your survival
stuff is handled five ten years from now then you're
gonna have a nice smooth natural transition into what comes
next this way you don't get caught in the endless
tail chasing game that is survival that's the danger with
survival is that people who get too good at it
and know nothing else they get lost in it for
the rest of their lives thinking that it'll lead them
somewhere but it won't you got to do enough survival
to survive but if you do too much survival it
boomerangs and backfires on you so my advice to you
especially you youngsters is take the mastering of survival seriously
study it learn it master it as much as you
need to but don't don't go overboard and you can
already start to lay the groundwork for what comes afterwards
and that would be the proper use of these teachings
and if you're at a point where you're already sick
and tired of survival and you've got it well handled
then you're right where i want you and that you're
ready for the very advanced stuff that i talk about
so stay tuned for more of that you
