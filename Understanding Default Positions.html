hey it's Leo for actualised org and in this episode
I'm going to be talking about understanding default positions [Music]
you this concept of the deep position is an extremely
foundational and critical concept which you need to understand because
in all the future stuff that I talked about this
will keep recurring this concept will keep coming back and
back and back into the big picture of things and
I want you to know what this concept means what
default position means so that when I say that in
the future you could be like oh yeah that's exactly
what he talked about before and I can see how
that fits into the larger picture and all the different
examples of how this works so what is a default
position let me give you a couple of ways to
think about it one way to think about it is
it's a position that you hold or person holds without
acknowledging that it's a position also it's a natural position
requiring no burden of proof or you can think of
it as an overlooked assumption or a belief that one
holds without knowing that it's a belief that one holds
or you can think of it as a perspective that
one has which masquerades as actuality and denies that it's
just a perspective so as you can tell here we're
going down into some epistemology theory of knowledge again and
again we keep coming back to the topic of custom
ology because it ends up being so critical to understanding
the obstacles that keep you stuck in life that's why
we keep coming back to it and we keep looking
at it from different perspectives in philosophy also there's this
notion when people argue or debate or use reasoning to
try to make some sort of progress intellectual progress there's
this notion that some positions deserve a sort of default
status by which we mean that like well a certain
position is just sort of obviously true or it just
seems more true the face of it than other positions
and therefore it doesn't require as high a burden of
proof and so it's like the crazy wacky positions the
oddball positions those are the ones that require a lot
of proof but then there's these like these default positions
which are just obvious to everybody and they don't require
much proof and they're rather safe this is the notion
that I want to debunk here this is a very
dangerous notion and the way we're going to do this
is with some examples in fact I'm going to give
you a lot of examples here but I want to
focus on three specific examples which I've identified as being
just like the epitome of what I mean by default
position and also the danger of not recognizing default positions
that you hold so perhaps the best of these is
atheism even though I'm going to rag on atheists here
um basically I consider myself an atheist I was an
atheist pretty much my whole life I was never religious
or theistic in any kind of sense but I did
study because I was an atheist I did study atheism
in a lot of depth and I observed it within
myself and I found some some things that most atheists
don't find and that most atheists would find very unpalatable
if they really explored the full depth of atheism so
atheists like to position themselves as having no position and
they like to say well Leo atheism is not a
position the religious people the theists they're the ones who
believe in stuff and therefore they have a position where
as I as an atheist don't believe in in any
of that kind of stuff and therefore it's not really
even right to call me an atheist because that would
be like just putting a label on me in fact
I just don't buy into these silly notions of God
or other deities or supernatural phenomena I just don't buy
into any of that kind of stuff in the same
way that maybe like you know a religious person doesn't
buy into the Spaghetti Monster the Flying Spaghetti Monster and
so in that sense the religious person is also an
atheist but with respect to the Flying Spaghetti Monster and
so in that sense I have no position not so
fast to truly have no position is a very different
thing than what your typical atheist is doing you also
have to make a distinction between not having a position
in theory and then also what actually happens in practice
because it's very easy to create a rift between the
two and to say for example well yeah in theory
I have no position but then in practice you actually
do have a position and your position is revealed most
truly by your emotions and your behaviors and your attitudes
and your dispositions towards people things and the way that
you relate to life as a whole that speaks much
more much more about your true position than your intellectual
philosophical ruminations and the sort of armchair philosophy that you
would do or the way that you debate maybe with
a friend you see so the Atheist likes to say
that he has no position actually he does have a
position if he's very honest and looks within he'll see
that he actually has an active belief there and the
active belief is that there is no God that is
the act of belief which is why of course we
have another word to contrast atheists with theists and that
is agnostics you might say okay Leo so what you're
talking about here is agnosticism agnosticism would be like the
true form of atheism in the sense that the agnostic
really doesn't know he admits that well I can't know
one way or another but you see even that is
a position even the agnostic most agnostics like to think
of themselves as agnostic but that's agnosticism in theory in
practice they're not really agnostic they still hold a position
because if we take the typical agnostic person and we
like ask them to maybe consider Christianity and then atheism
they'll say well it's a wash I don't really know
maybe there is a God maybe there's a heaven maybe
there's not maybe there's just nothing maybe there's just reality
the Big Bang whatever and he kind of holds them
as an equal that's what the typical agnostic does but
then if we say okay what do you like believe
in Mormonism do you hold it as equal as these
two he'll probably say no or if we say well
what about Scientology do you hold that as equal as
these say no and even if he doesn't say no
in practice if he hears about Scientology or something like
that he'll just have a gut reaction to say no
that's just a bunch of [ __ ] I'm not
going to even entertain that you see that's the true
position there that reveals what agnosticism really is the Atheist
actually has an active belief that there is no God
I know because I've held this active belief I've kind
of been on both sides of the fence on this
issue right so this is what I mean by a
default position is what the atheist is doing is that
he's saying no Leo I have no position you don't
understand but that actually is a position you actually do
have a position you're just not conscious of it you're
not conscious of your position and you also hold it
as a default in the sense that whatever you're debating
with theistic people you say well you guys believe in
some sort of God therefore and I don't therefore I
am like the minimalist here let's go with Ockham's razor
i'm the minimalist my position doesn't require any proof any
there's no high burden of proof for my position to
clear as an atheist whereas for you as a theist
there's a high position of the high burden of proof
too to overcome in order to to believe in God
now this might sound like I'm arguing in favor of
theism don't make that mistake I'm just trying to make
you more aware of how default positions work I'm not
interested here in reconciling or debating between one ideology and
another I'm interested in going much deeper than that so
that's the example with with atheism I'll give you another
example of default positions which is the the the notion
of not the notion rather but the mindset that most
people have about psychedelics this is very interesting because this
is one I only learned recently in last year as
I started talking about psychedelics too to ordinary people after
having used them and it was very interesting for me
the reactions quite honestly I was quite shocked and some
of the reactions I got from my viewers and also
from other people that have that I've talked to kind
of more privately about this this topic if you take
the average person who has not actually done any psychedelics
and you start talking about psychedelics and some of the
amazing revelations that are possible like the mystical experiences that
are possible and various deep existential insights and so forth
even when you get past they're very common a negative
reaction just to psychedelics in general because psychedelics are lumped
in with other drugs hard drugs and so in general
there's just sort of like stigma around psychedelics just from
a kind of cultural perspective because we've been taught in
school not to do drugs and and that drugs are
evil and bad and they'll just destroy your life so
there's that whole element but even if you set that
issue aside and you get someone who's quite open-minded and
then you start talking to them about psychedelics and some
of these mystical experiences they'll say well Kayleigh oh yeah
you're talking about some of these amazing mystical experiences and
I'll admit maybe psychedelics do give you some of these
amazing mystical experiences but how do you know they're not
just hallucinations they're just like a hallucination you want me
to take this psychedelic but what's going to be the
point because I'm just going to be like whisked out
of this reality into some dream or some fantasy and
it's just going to be an illusion I'm just going
to come back to ordinary reality and an ordinary reality
is just going to continue the way it always has
so why should I even bother with that see the
default position there though the default position of your typical
person about psychedelics who hasn't tried them is that they
assume that this right here is the actual reality that's
a huge [ __ ] assumption huge assumption they think
that this right here is the real reality and that
wherever you go there's just a dream but consider the
converse of that that this here is the dream and
that wherever you go might be more real than the
dream you're in right now you see that's the default
position there and it's very subtle and it's very hard
to see this default position until you've actually exited it
first so once you take the psychedelic you'll often immediately
very quickly recognize oh my god that was my default
position and I held it for four years four years
four years why didn't I try this earlier I didn't
even anticipate that such a reversal was possible you see
and that's exactly what happens when you hold a default
default position without recognizing that it's a position you open
yourself up to some big surprises and some very big
epistemic blunders because it could be revealed to you in
an instant under the right circumstances that what you held
as reality just a moment before was actually a conceptual
position that you had see yeah it's interesting I was
talking to my mom about psychedelics and I wanted her
to try it because there's some amazing experiences and I
think it would actually help her to grow and to
get some healing done but yeah even though she's not
close totally close minded about psychedelics she doesn't want to
try it she doesn't want you why not because she
doesn't recognize that she's holding the default position that this
here is not a hallucination she's like well yeah psychedelics
will just caused me to hallucinate I don't want to
loosen it I want to be in reality but this
what is this here this is a hallucination right here
I don't just mean that metaphorically I mean it literally
and that's what's I could also reveal to you literally
so if she ever takes a psychedelic she will instantly
know the error of her epistemic reasoning but of course
the tragedy of it is that because of the air
of the epistemic reasoning she will probably never ever take
a psychedelic and never be able to correct the situation
that's the irony of this whole thing that's why I'm
stressing this so much because this stuff is so pernicious
it traps you so completely in the illusion and the
third final example that a really strong example that I
want to give to you a default position is death
now this one can really blow a lot of people's
minds death is a default position that you hold you
actually believe that you will die you see you actually
believe you will die and you probably have specific beliefs
about what you think will happen at death so you
will either think that nothing happens you just kind of
go asleep into a dark nothingness probably if you're atheist
you believe that like that or if you're more spiritually
inclined you'll probably think that your soul floats off to
somewhere to some purgatory or to have it or to
hell or to some other dimension or some other realm
and something like that happens maybe you think you'll meet
God maybe you think you'll become enlightened by dying you
know you have some kind of ideas about what's going
to happen a death it's not the case notice that
it is not the case that you have no opinions
about death whatsoever my claim is that not only do
you have theoretical beliefs about death but also you have
very practical ones in the sense that if I take
a loaded revolver and I stick it to your temple
and I am about to pull the trigger and you
think that I'm going to pull that trigger there's going
to be a whole set of emotional physiological mental reactions
going on with you and they will be very sharp
they will not be subtle which betrays your belief in
death you see you are not neutral or agnostic about
death you actually believe that death will happen and that
it'll probably be a negative thing you don't want it
to happen and you probably believe something about how it's
going to happen and what's going to be on the
other end even though you might have a little a
little bit of a sort of open-mindedness met you might
say well yeah we don't really know we don't really
know yeah but you behave when I put a gun
to your head you behave as though you really know
you behave as though it's a bad thing you're not
wishy-washy about it when there's a gun to your head
or to your child's head you see now you might
say holy Oh death yeah death I mean we all
die so what's the default position there no you see
death is a default position that's a belief that's a
conceptualization is holding the ocean of death is a specific
position that you hold and notice that you hold a
second-order position on top of the first-order position and the
second-order physician says something along the lines of there's not
even an alternative there's not even a possibility it would
be ridiculous and silly to think that I don't die
under what circumstances could I not die how is that
even possible it makes no sense death is really the
only option now how I'm going to die and what
exactly is going to be at the other end of
that I don't really know but that death will happen
a certain so let me be very clear here what
I'm saying is that that death will happen to you
is not certain at all and that that's a position
that you hold that you've probably never seriously thought of
as a position you don't think of death as a
perspective you see you hold it as a brute fact
and that's the second order part of this position is
that not only do you think that death will happen
to you and that'll have in a specific way and
the stuff will happen at the end of that but
you also hold it that's the brute fact when that's
not true at all you see are you starting to
fathom the depth and the the crazy ramifications of really
understanding what I'm saying not just in theory but so
that it percolates down into practice for you see let
me give you some more examples the kind of quick
list of examples that I won't go into into a
lot of depth because I just don't have the time
of default positions so one default position is naive realism
I've talked about that at length in past episodes another
position is that everything in the universe is rational I've
also covered that in my what's wrong with rationality episode
another default position very common is that reality is made
out of discrete separate entities or objects that are physically
demarcated and separate from each other as though the world
is composed of objects and that these objects are inherent
and are real and are somehow absolutely defined in the
sense that you know I see a table my children
see the same table my wife sees the same table
my cat and dogs see the same table even a
robot that I create sees the same table and is
able to use image recognition to to locate that table
and to maybe move around it successfully and therefore I
conclude that that table actually exists as a physical separate
object within reality see that's a position that you hold
that you probably never consider as a perspective that's one
perspective it might not be true at all even though
it seems like it's the only perspective see when you
only have one perspective it always seems like that perspective
is the reality because there's nothing to contrast it against
there's no alternatives as soon as you have two or
more at least two that's why getting that second perspective
is so critical once you get the second perspective all
of a sudden your mind opens up to the possibility
of infinite perspectives which is why a lot of religions
and cults and stuff like that they really get you
to just buy into one perspective because if they can
do that they've got you they've got a monopoly on
your mind and of course this isn't just religions and
cults science culture society nutrition business theory military strategy you
know there's there's a whole gamut here of areas in
life where this happens the position that time is absolute
that's a default position that virtually everybody held until a
hundred years ago until Albert Einstein came along and and
said otherwise and even now even though Einstein and most
modern physicists understand that time is not absolute in practice
most people live their life as though time were an
absolute when it's not we know our best scientists know
it's not and yet we still live that way another
default position is that energy is always conserved this is
a popular one in science which I think eventually might
be debunked by science itself anyway it's a position even
if it isn't going to be debunked for a long
time or maybe it may be is it being true
but but it's still a default position in the way
that it's held because it's held as just obviously true
when in fact there's nothing obvious about it another common
one like that is you can't get something from nothing
how many times have you said heard people arguing that
way well you can't get something from nothing oh yeah
how do you know that's a default position right there
or Occam's razor that's a really a terrible default position
there's no reason why explanations of reality have to be
simple they could be as complex as reality itself skepticism
especially false skepticism as I've talked about in Prior episodes
is commonly held as a default position you think like
well most skeptics think like well questioning everything and doubting
everything that's that's just natural that's just like what we're
supposed to be doing without recognizing that maybe by doubting
everything you actually delude yourself so that's a the problem
with false skepticism is that you take the position that
all other positions are false except the one that you
took leads to a lot of delusion the position that
modern science is true because it works that's a very
pervasive modern default position people are so bought into science
and technology and to the benefits of it that they
never really question this and then this creates a lot
of damage the default position that consciousness is in the
brain probably 99% of the world's populations believe this if
not explicitly then implicitly right you believe that your consciousness
is tied to your brain and any belief other than
that sounds ridiculous people really think like no but that
consciousness happens in the brain and there's a brain process
that that is just a given you know there's no
burden of proof that that has to clear if you
want to leave if you want to argue that consciousness
somehow outside the brain or separate from the brain or
independent of the brain you to provide very good proof
for that see that's the trap that I'm pointing to
you here that you are the body is another default
position that you believe you're the sickle body another one
is that physical pain has to inherently be painful and
that it's bad that's a default position that many people
hold that you have free will or control over life
and yourself and your circumstances this is the very common
default position what's funny about this one is that even
people who do not believe in free will people who
are determinists people who will argue against free will in
theory in practice they will still believe in free will
in practice they will still feel that they are the
controller and doer of life because that's what ego is
about you see so it's very it's very interesting to
kind of risk that the mind can create between the
theory and the practice and what's more important is the
practice rather than the theory most determinists are actually firm
believers in free will because they act as though they
have it when they lose control over some circumstance in
their life to get upset see if you actually believed
you didn't have free will you would not be upset
about a situation where you have no control you would
be surrendered to it but that's a very rare state
of affairs very few people are actually surrendered to those
kinds of sin those kinds of you know tough situations
when I put a gun to your head you're probably
not going to be surrendered to that you're probably going
to try to attack me of course even if you
did attack me that would still not be evidence of
a free will you attack me because I've put a
gun to your head in the same way that you
know a robot can attack you when you try to
unplug it from the wall or something you could easily
program a robot to attack a human being does it
prove that it has free will another default position is
a lot of the mainstream cultural norms that we have
so like getting married if you believe that you need
to get married or you have a certain pressure feeling
like I need to get married that's the default position
you have you probably have default positions about sexuality for
example you probably believe homosexuality is maybe unnatural or unmanly
a missile EO how could you say homosexuality is how
could it possibly be manly of course it's unmanly right
that's your default position you see you never bothered to
ask for proof for that position you just took it
on faith you took it as just a given see
that's the danger of the default position is that it
just sort of slides under the radar of examination and
it never gets examined because it just feels too obvious
to be examined that's what all these examples have in
common is that they just feel so obvious when you
are holding these positions and on the other hand when
you're not holding these positions they seem so ridiculously blind
so unconscious another position is that the education system teaches
truth a lot of people believe that another position is
that enlightenment is an experience that one has watch out
for that one light amount of experience watch out for
that one another default position is nihilism the idea that
life is inherently bleak and meaningless and hopeless and depressing
and sad and just full of suffering this is a
position the nihilists mistake is that he doesn't recognize that
nihilism nihilism itself is just a groundless default position that
he stumbled into and now doesn't know how to escape
uh if you struggle with depression watch out for this
default position which is that most people who are depressed
hold the depression is something that happens to them like
cancer or something it's just a play upon me whereas
the alternative to that is maybe that depression is something
that you're causing something that you're doing actively depression must
be actively maintained most depressed people have the default position
that no depression is the default state like unless I'm
always cheering myself up I'm going to be depressed that's
their default position happens to be false as well actually
peace and bliss are more of the default state for
the human system for a healthy human conscious system rather
than depression depression something you're actively creating all the time
you just not aware how you're creating it but you
can become aware and that ends up being the ultimate
solution to depression not pills you might have a default
position like letting my kids watch TV or playing with
the iPad all day isn't really bad for them it's
okay no problems and if you do hold that position
it's probably not explicit it's not you go around telling
your friends like oh yeah it's okay for my kids
to watch a bunch of TV and play a bunch
of games on the iPad all the time it's okay
you never probably explicitly say to anybody not even to
yourself do you acknowledge this position unless you really go
in there and start to look another very common default
position which is leading to a lot of problems is
this this one about humanity as humanity is somehow highly
evolved and that we have exited the dark ages maybe
not another default position is that society is healthy and
this is another one that's totally under the radar most
people in society believe the society is healthy of course
because if they believed otherwise they would not really be
able to to function as a cog in the machine
that society is one of the biggest i opening mind
[ __ ] of all when you start to get
into this deep self-actualization work is you start to see
more and more just how dysfunctional and how unhealthy society
is and it blows your mind it's like wow it
blows your mind and it doesn't stop blowing your mind
it doesn't just happen once it's like over and over
and over and over again it's just like it doesn't
stop like every year I'm seeing how [ __ ]
dysfunctional Society is that's um that can be yes that
can be emotionally laborious to notice that over and over
again can be kind of shocking but most people don't
recognize that they just assume a society is healthy I
mean this is this is the norm this is how
society is supposed to be right it's not even thought
about and the last one I'll mention is the default
position that happiness comes from external conditions this is a
huge default position that a lot of people hold which
really screws them up and prevents them from ever finding
happiness so notice that often default positions really turn out
to be special case constraints so what do I mean
by this for example gravity we assumed up until like
five hundred years ago we generally assume that gravity points
downward and that objects fall downward like you can read
some treatises from the Greeks and Romans and they they
actually believe that objects have an inherent tendency to fall
down that's what their explanation of gravity was until of
course Newton came along and then we went into outer
space and we saw that actually gravity is a omnidirectional
it doesn't just favor stuff falling down that just is
a special constraint upon gravity when you're you know dealing
with a very large spherical object that looks flat and
you're out sitting on top of it then it appears
as though yeah gravity is always downward but when you're
out in outer space it doesn't look like that anymore
right so gravity beam galleries of special constraint in the
same way with Euclidean geometry Euclid assumed that parallel lines
at 90 degrees always you know runs can run forever
and never intersect and of course the default position there
that he was assuming that he was unconscious of is
that that's only on a flat surface if you're talking
about a spherical or hyperbolic surface then that's no longer
true right so Euclidian geometry is a special constraint on
the larger field of possible geometries that exist and you
know now we know better because we have non Euclidean
geometry and that's one of the developments that allow Dine
Stein to then revolutionize our understanding of space-time because space
time is four dimension you know model that is four
dimensional non Euclidean another example would be absolute time are
kind of talked about this but you know until Einstein
there is this notion that time is absolute and it's
the same for everybody and then we find out that
that's not true that absolute time is really just a
special constraint which only works for human beings when we
are at relatively low speeds under the speed of light
if we go faster approaching the speed of light than
absolute time starts to break down doesn't really work right
so it's sort of a simplification so a lot of
what the human mind does is make these simplifications but
then these simplifications come back to bite us in the
ass because we mistake our simplifications for reality and we
think that our simplifications explain everything when is that there's
a lot that they don't explain so all of these
are positions everything I talked about above these are all
positions that are being held often without knowing that they
are being held and a lot of times what these
positions do when it's pointed out to you that it's
a position is that you deny that it's a position
the position denies itself it's not really you it's really
a position is almost like a virus infecting your mind
you want to think about it that way and then
that virus defends itself you see and for the virus
the best defense mechanism is to go completely unnoticed so
it's really in the virus's favor that you're never aware
that it's present at all see the virus is smart
the virus doesn't come out and showboat and do all
this flowery stuff I mean sometimes it does in some
people but most of the times your most deepest beliefs
that get you stuck the most they are completely unconscious
to you they are not premeditated at all they weren't
chosen by you you don't even know that they're there
until you do a lot of digging and I want
you to be really cognizant that many of the positions
you think you hold in theory are actually quite different
in practice you don't just hold positions in theory you
also hold them in practice and a lot of times
there's this sort of disconnect this rift you want a
really good example of this of something that you actually
hold in practice very very deeply you hold that reality
is actually real like think of what I'm saying here
you actually have a position and it is a position
that this reality that you have been a part of
your whole life that it's actually real and then you
have a second-order position on top of that which says
Leo you're [ __ ] crazy what you're saying here
because it Israel what else is more real than reality
see and that's something that even if you're a philosopher
you've probably never actually sat down and thought to yourself
oh well yeah I have a default position that reality
is real no not even if you're a philosopher have
you probably even done that not unless you've gone really
[ __ ] deep right because this stuff is and
it's just it seems so obvious and that's exactly how
it hides from you is through its obvious nacelle what
I want you to take away from this episode is
that there are no Givens everything must be empirically investigated
and anything that's not empirically investigated watch out you're really
setting yourself up for some disasters they're disasters of very
tragic proportions notice interestingly that from a mechanical point of
view it's hard for the eye to see itself it's
hard for you to see where is your standing okay
because the place you stand is hidden by the fact
that you're standing on it you see that's sort of
like the mechanics of life and reality is facing this
problem of how does it become conscious of itself reality
is facing this problem on many levels so you probably
don't even appreciate yet and yet it's challenging because when
you identify with a thing then you're standing on top
of it right and then you don't really see it
it is looking out on everything else doesn't really see
itself and it takes a lot of effort to circle
back around to really see itself properly this is sort
of a mechanical problem imagine if you were an engineer
trying to design an eyeball that could completely see itself
from all angles as well as the rest of the
world that would be a tricky engineering challenge see and
you might even wonder well why why do I do
that what's the point don't we just want the eyeball
looking outward never looking inward why does it need to
see itself from every angle well maybe for an eyeball
that's not a big problem although you know if you
have a a tiger creeping up behind you it's it's
nice to be able to see back there see but
for human beings who are very complex organisms we need
to be much more self-aware otherwise we create all sorts
of disasters and problems for ourselves both individually and collectively
is because you know we don't really have a 360-degree
panoramic perspective of how we behave as human beings mostly
we just have this tiny 5 degree view out into
the world which with which we interact and which to
which we relate but that ends up being a way
too limited of a perspective default positions are a key
mechanism for self-deception because what they allow is they allow
the mind to make a construction a conceptual construction without
acknowledging that it's a conceptual construction it allows constructions to
be created and then regarded by its creator as inherent
to reality this creates projections this is how you can
concoct some sort of story or whatever almost anything you
want you can basically create a fantasy and then that
fantasy becomes real for you now you might say well
that's a very dangerous mechanism and it is and you
might say well Lea we don't want to live in
a fantasy we want to live in just reality but
see you got to see both sides of this because
reality is very ingenious for reality to create itself which
is what it's doing all the time reality is creating
itself it's the only thing there is so it has
to create itself to do that it has to there
has to be a way for an illusion to appear
like reality because that's actually what creates reality that's actually
the fabric of reality is illusion in the same way
that the substance of a magic trick is the sleight
of hand without sleight of hand you could not create
an amazing magic trick and what is more amazing of
a magic trick than this entire universe you see so
there's a very deep interconnection between constructions getting constructed but
then not being aware as constructions that's why most people
believe in all sorts of constructions but they will never
admit that they are constructions they will argue to the
death that they are reality and another secondary component here
of this self-deception mechanism is that active maintenance has to
happen of these constructions which doesn't get acknowledged so the
best example of this is with depression a depressed person
not only will they generally not acknowledge the depression as
a construction but they will especially not want to acknowledge
that they are actively maintaining their depression they like to
think that depression is just like something that they're stuck
in as if it's like the the most natural state
for the human being or niya let's think this way
right nihilus don't understand that they are actively maintaining their
nihilism and that they could stop so the danger here
is that with these default positions they create paradigm lock
I've talked about in the past they prevent self inquiry
and observation especially self observation they lead to unexamined self
biases they lead to closed mindedness and dogmatic debating and
they lead to you to delusion of otherwise highly intelligent
people so what I'm talking about here especially applies to
highly intelligent people because see in their hubris highly intelligent
people assume we understand all this stuff already when they
don't and then that just makes it even worse so
you've got layer upon layer upon layer of self-deception going
on here which is why we need to spend all
this time really talking about the examples going through them
in a lot of detail over and over again so
you start to see the significance of this all right
so you might say okay Liam so what do I
do about this what is required to see my own
positions how does the I see itself well basically three
things awareness raising your awareness there's a lot of ways
you can do that which I've talked about in the
past from meditation to mindfulness practice to many many other
things also though self-honesty developing the capacity to be more
self honest and objectivity developing the capacity to look at
situations including yourself and not giving yourself any special privileged
position so first what you want to do is you
want to acknowledge your positions as positions as much as
you can acknowledge your perspectives as perspectives and not as
absolutes super-bored don't engage in debates with people where you
start to defend yourself based on this bogus notion of
certain positions as being self-evident and default and then playing
this game of burden of proof it's like well you
have to provide burden of proof to change my mind
don't do that instead be much more honest and to
just say yeah you know this is my position I'm
an atheist and that's my position and I believe that
after death there will be nothingness and that's my position
I believe that reality is real and that's a position
that I hold and there could be alternatives but see
the whole game that the mind is playing with itself
is that it's trying to close down possibilities for alternatives
that's why the mind doesn't generally like to hear this
stuff much less actually work to implement it be very
vigilant with yourself watch yourself like a hawk and just
stop giving your beliefs special status watch how you will
attack and criticize everybody else's beliefs and then when it
comes to your own beliefs you'll be like that's okay
I'll just let myself slide a little bit it's okay
we'll just fudge some stuff here and fudge some stuff
there now you got to apply the same rigorous standard
of criticism to yourself as you do to all the
other silly nonsense beliefs that you find out in the
world and then what you'll discover is that actually you're
part of them and that there's no real difference at
all and then that's what gives you the motivation to
then step outside the whole game and then play this
game on a whole different level now you're really exiting
the dogmatic paradigm and you're entering the non-duality paradigm at
that point and non-duality is actually not a paradigm hi
Veronica Lee it might seem like what I'm saying here
is that everything is relative you know everything's just open
to speculation you can just anything goes it all comes
out in the wash doesn't matter what you believe everything
is equal no that's not what I'm saying at all
actually this relativism which sounds like relativism will come full
circle and it will turn into the absolute and you
will arrive at the absolute but the absolute will not
be anything like you think from your dogmatic relative relative
perspectives because it's the absolute it's not a perspective you
can't squeeze the absolute into your perspective but that's that's
the discussion for another time so in conclusion I just
want to tell you to be very suspicious of any
ideologies that limit your ability to observe because observation here
is the key the key to raising awareness is observation
that's basic what awareness is is just observation but most
people don't want to engage in observation they want to
engage in position taking observation is very threatening to the
mind that's why it refuses to observe it's very stubborn
about observation it'll only want to observe the things that
really perpetuate its survival and its current web of beliefs
and it doesn't want to observe the stuff that runs
contrary to that and then that gets us into a
lot of trouble all right that's it I'm done here
I'm signing off please click a like button for me
post your comments down below come check out actualized other
work as well this is my website right here I've
got my blog I'm releasing new stuff on my blog
all the time I've got my life purpose course the
book list the forum there's a lot of resources come
check it all out most of it is free and
stick with me for more you might think that oh
well Leo you've already covered so many topics and all
the important topics it sounds like you've already covered you're
just like rehashing stuff over and over again no no
no no more foundational topics are coming completely new stuff
that you haven't heard about before it's on the way
I have lists lists of hundreds of episodes that I
need to shoot but if it sometimes seems like I'm
rehashing stuff I'm actually very cognizant not to waste your
time repeating the same things in new episodes if if
it seems that way it seems like there's overlap it's
because that overlap is either natural and organic to this
assembling of the big picture or it's because it really
needs to be stressed for you to get it right
one of the dangers with shooting these videos with no
overlap which is actually what I try to do no
overlap between episodes is that that means that if you
miss an episode a foundational episode you don't watch it
that means you have like a huge missing gap in
your understand of reality in life and so the burden
is then on you to make sure that you watch
all the episodes and piece it all together so sometimes
there's going to be some overlap between certain concepts for
example you might think like well default position how are
they really different from paradigms ah there's a lot of
overlap there true but also I want you to have
that that label of default position I want you to
have that concept in your mind with all the Associated
examples so that in the future when I talk about
default positions you could be like oh yeah that's it
and that's it and that's it and I can see
how it all interconnects see so there's this process of
interconnecting everything which is what is my deepest passion here
is to give you a really integrated biggest picture possible
understanding of yourself and of life that's challenging to do
and very few teachers or people out there do it
because it really requires you to stretch your mind and
then it also requires you to spend quite a bit
of time putting all the puzzle pieces together see but
man having that big picture understanding of life is incredible
it's incredible it's the most amazing thing it's the thing
that I'm the most passionate about in life is getting
this big picture understanding and I'm really excited to give
you more of the foundational building blocks in the future
to do just that so stick with me for more
you
