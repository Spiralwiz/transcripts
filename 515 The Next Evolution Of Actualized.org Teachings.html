</li><li><b>Reasons for reduced content output in the past year</b>: Gura mentions that he has released fewer video content due to a focus on putting out high-quality and genuine material, chronic health issues, a possibility of burn out from consistency, personal life commitments, and integration of profound awakenings.

</li><li><b>Rethinking teaching approach</b>: Gura discusses his reconsidered approach towards teaching that involves generating genuine insights based on contemplation and brainstorming instead of simply updating older theories.
</li><li><b>Working on personal life at the cost of work</b>: Gura admits that while he has dedicated time for his personal life and relationships, which he had neglected earlier, it has affected the time and energy he devotes to his work.
</li><li><b>Experience of divine awakenings and its effect on teachings</b>: Gura shares experiences of his profound divine awakenings which affected the originality of his teachings as such awakenings take one beyond linguistic, logical stuff. 
</li><li><b>Shutting off mind and aiming at more balance</b>: Gura explains that to integrate divine awakenings, he practiced shutting off his mind which impacted his work as it cut off a lot of insights. Now he is aiming at balancing both relatively.
</li><li><b>Maintaining quality and not succumbing to pressure</b>: Leo stresses the importance of maintaining the quality of his content and not succumbing to pressure, instead taking time to develop insights and brainstorm ideas until they cohere. 
</li><li><b>Personal development and dealing with age</b>: Reaching close to 40 years old, Gura discusses his journey of self-reflection, and rethinking his future life, work, legacy and character. 
</li><li><b>Challenges of increased consciousness</b>: Gura acknowledges that increasing his consciousness has led to recognizing his own ego, flaws, limitations, and the responsibility that comes with it, requiring higher maturity as a teacher.

</li><li><b>Being a Better Role Model</b>: Leo highlights the importance of becoming a better role model, not just having superior teachings. This involves adopting a higher level of integrity and implementing teaching methods that align with the highest truth and love. He admits this will be a challenging process requiring changes in his teaching behaviour and delivery to engage with people effectively.
</li><li><b>Pruning and Enhancing Teachings with Direct Experience</b>: Leo suggests a need to refine his teachings by discarding information and theories learned from others, and replacing them with insights based on his own direct experiences. This will improve the validity of his teachings and ensure they stay relevant and applicable to his evolving understanding of spirituality.
</li><li><b>Challenging Human-centric Views</b>: Leo notes the limitation of human-centric views in understanding reality. He acknowledges they are necessary for human survival but, to transcend and go beyond being human, one needs to shed these views and operate from direct experiences and concepts that go beyond humanity. 
</li><li><b>Accepting Contradictions as Part of Growth</b>: Leo discusses the inevitability of contradictions in his teachings due to personal growth and evolution. By acknowledging mistakes of the past, embracing change and constantly improving, he identifies this process as a part of growth, much like a caterpillar evolving into a butterfly.

</li><li><b>Leo's evolving approach to his teachings</b>: Leo reflects on his career since starting Actualized.org, acknowledging that he started from a place of deep ego. He discusses the journey he followed to reach his current level of consciousness, from the basics of self-help to deeper perspectives on spirituality and awakening. Leo admits that past teachings contained both beauty and brilliance, but also noise and corruption due to his level of consciousness and development at that time. He strives for more purity and less ego in his teachings, and is committed to his personal growth to be able to relay more pristine teachings.
</li><li><b>The concept of 'noise versus signal'</b>: Leo introduces a new concept of 'noise versus signal' where noise represents corrupted teachings and signals stand for genuine insights.

He proposes a 'poison pill strategy', intentionally incorporating falsehoods into his teachings to prevent blind acceptance and encourage critical thinking among his viewers. 
</li><li><b>Leo's teachings and his audience's personal development</b>: Leo stresses that the purpose of his teachings is to encourage personal development, not to idolize him as a spiritual teacher.

He wants to build teachings free from corruption, biases and self-deception.
</li><li><b>His role as a spiritual teacher</b>:Leo stresses that he is a self-taught spiritual teacher, having no formal education or training in this area. He embraced his journey from basic self-help concepts to profound spiritual realizations and used his platform to document his personal evolution. His intention is to guide, model, and inspire his audience to follow their own paths of evolution, exploring their potential and reaching higher levels of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's acknowledgment of his arrogance and its origins</b>: Leo reflects on how his arrogance stemmed from a mixture of intense ambition from a young age, sovereign intellectual independence, and dissatisfaction with societal norms. He explains that his arrogant attitude has been a tool for him to cut through societal constructs and reach an understanding of absolute truth through his own direct experience.
</li><li><b>Arrogance in spiritual growth</b>: Leo notes that while this arrogant attitude can be perceived as anti-spiritual, in his case it has led him to the highest levels of awakening because it maintained his intellectual independence and allowed him to avoid falling into the trappings of any spiritual school, guru, or belief system.
</li><li><b>Arrogance and teaching style flaws</b>: Leo acknowledges the negative aspects of his arrogance, admitting that it might give off an obnoxious vibe, turn off audiences, and corrupt his teachings and demeanor. He agrees that it is not an intelligent and artful way to teach nor does he want his viewers to emulate this behavior.

</li><li><b>Admission to exaggeration</b>: Leo identifies that he can sometimes exaggerate points in his teachings. Upon his self-reflection, he realizes this stems from his attempt to communicate the 'spirit' or emotional impact of the teachings, rather than adhere to technical precision. 
</li><li><b>Exaggeration vs. technical accuracy</b>: Leo tends not to prioritize technical accuracy over the emotional significance of his teachings. He criticizes academics who focus excessively on technical accuracy to the detriment of conveying emotional significance. 
</li><li><b>Purposes of exaggeration in teaching</b>: Leo admits to exaggerating intentionally, aiming to emotionally engage his students and demonstrate the significance of his teachings, especially during discussions about awakenings.
</li><li><b>Importance of signal to noise ratio</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of distinguishing 'signal to noise' ratio in the teachings and information content consumed online. The 'signal' is the pure, good stuff, while the 'noise' represents corruption in teachings resulting from the teacher's lack of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Sources of 'noise' in teachings</b>: He identifies major sources of noise in teachings or any informational content including lack of consciousness, selfishness, biases, limited life experience, and arrogance.

He underlines that while it can lead to technically accurate reports, it may result in a lack of understanding of the bigger picture or true importance of the discovery. He is critical of the dry and neutral reporting style in academia and prefers to communicate the emotional significance of his teachings. He also highlights the deceptive nature of data, facts, and studies, and their potential misuse. Despite his occasional use of exaggeration, Leo insists that he tries to stay true to the emotional significance of subjects like awakening or god realization.

He also understands the necessity of issuing certain warnings and precautions in his teachings for less informed viewers to prevent potential misuse or misinterpretation.
