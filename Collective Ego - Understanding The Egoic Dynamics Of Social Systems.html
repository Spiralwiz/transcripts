[Music] ego is not only individual but also collective I'm
really excited about this topic because it's such a juicy
one there's so much to say here in this episode
I want to share with you a powerful lens for
looking at social systems and understanding how they work and
that is the lens of the collective ego now with
personal development and self-actualization a lot of what we do
is we turn inwards and we focus on ourselves on
our own individual egos and we've talked about this topic
ad nauseam at this point throughout the episodes but there's
also a lot of value in studying yourself and learning
the tricks of your own ego learning your own self-deception
mechanisms and then starting to see parallels of that out
in the social systems of which you are a part
of and which comprise the majority of human life if
you think about it are comprised of various kinds of
social systems which also have a sort of ego such
that once you start to understand the tricks of your
own ego you will start to understand all social systems
and this becomes extremely useful because you then become quite
good at predicting why these systems are malfunctioning and also
how to guide these systems to better levels of performance
and higher consciousness which is ultimately what we want we
want that individually for ourselves which is where it starts
that's a good start but then we also want collectively
the same sort of thing as a general principle of
life we can say that every complex system or group
of people tends to exhibit ego that's my claim now
what is ego well of course that's a that's a
loaded word and there's a there's hours of discussion we
can have about that and there's different perspectives we can
take on it but for the purposes of this conversation
here let's keep it simple for this episode let's define
ego as the rational self-preservation instinct that a complicated system
has a human being has it the human brain tends
to exhibit it but also social systems which involve human
beings also tend to exhibit it now you might say
but leo why do you say it's irrational why is
ego irrational after all what's irrational about self-preservation but what's
rational about it have you ever wondered about why you
care about self-preservation and whether that's a subjective or an
objective concern what is rational about caring that you or
your body survives and somebody else doesn't what's rational about
caring about protecting your family and your company and your
corporation in your nation versus some other family or some
other company or some other nation is there anything rational
about that at all no if you were perfectly objective
if you took the the universe's perspective you would see
that it doesn't matter whether you protect yourself or your
family or somebody else it doesn't matter who survives because
in the end they're all gonna die this ego game
that you're playing it's gonna end nobody wins this game
has that sunk it in yet self-preservation is highly highly
irrational there's no reason why your human life is worth
more than an insect or a tree or a rock
or anything else you need to start to think about
reality in a much more impersonal manner and from outside
of the human species perspective think of reality as a
collection of thing different organizations are happening and unless you
have a sense of self or a sense of ego
then an object doesn't care whether it lives or dies
its own survival is completely irrelevant to it for example
a rock doesn't care whether it lives or dies and
many other things in nature don't care whether they are
attacked or disturbed and broken up and collapsed and crumbled
into pieces so see but that as life becomes more
complicated as objects and structures develop within life then they
need to build sort of defense mechanisms against the forces
of chaos which are outside and so therefore you need
to start to define an inside versus an outside the
inside is the thing that's being protected and preserved that's
the order that's being maintained it's a highly ordered system
if you think about the human organism or even an
insect or an ant or even a bacteria that's a
highly ordered thing it needs to maintain itself it's constantly
struggling and fighting against its environment now what is the
environment the environment is simply defined as that which is
not the thing that is trying to survive so in
a sense every sufficiently complex organism needs to start to
develop some sort of ego now maybe it's a very
rudimentary ego a sort of proto ego maybe it's not
fully self-aware but still it needs to have a sense
of self because if it didn't how would it distinguish
between itself and its environment and how would it know
what needs to be protected and defended versus what needs
to be attacked how does it know not to eat
its own tail if it doesn't have a sense of
self you see the problem here and you see the
problem is that nature is very chaotic stuff is always
changing nothing is ever staying the same everything absolutely everything
is changing all the time so this is a very
tenuous situation to be in if you want to maintain
a consistent order and that's what ego is about it's
about hang on to some aspect of reality and then
maintaining it that way so don't think of ego as
something that human beings have or like all yeah some
human beings are egotistical that's not what I mean by
ego I mean a much much much more general principle
we're talking about how life is constructed at all all
right and I'm not just talking about biological life I'm
talking about any complicated system I'm even talking about something
like let's say you have a religion we can say
that a religion is like an organism it's alive in
a certain sense it needs to be able to organize
and protect itself otherwise what happens is that it gets
taken over by the forces of chaos and it ceases
to exist so if something is in existence and it
keeps existing for any significant length of time for a
few days a few months a few years a few
centuries then it has to develop a system to maintain
its integrity otherwise what happens is that either the thing
will crumble and collapse and dissolve entirely which we might
call death or it will morph and evolve to such
a degree that you won't be able to recognize it
anymore which is what we see with animal species you
take some sort of lizard or you take some sort
of bird or creature and you you rewind the clock
100 million years and that thing is unrecognizable it's not
the same as it was it's a completely different thing
it's completely evolved in a sense you could say that
it died because it evolved that animal that used to
live a hundred million years ago does it live anymore
that's how it works unless it goes to extraordinary measures
to keep itself intact and that's where ego comes in
the more complicated a system becomes the more sophisticated the
ego structures become until eventually like in humans it starts
to develop a sense of self awareness and self reflection
and that comes with various pros and cons so fundamentally
when you have a highly ordered object nevermind whether it's
allied or not if you have a highly ordered object
or system it needs a way of protecting itself because
the more order it has the more fragile it is
the more susceptible and vulnerable it is to too little
things causing great errors for example if you take a
human brain which has tens of billions maybe a hundred
billion neurons all interconnected in a very specific way you
can't just go in there with an icepick and muck
around and change a few neurons here and there and
think that everything's gonna turn out fine no it won't
for your brain to be able to maintain itself it
needs to have a specific sort of structure within certain
tight bounds narrow bounds otherwise you're gonna become a [
__ ] or a psychopath and you're not going to
be able to survive effectively in life so maintaining homeostasis
becomes the number one priority of any complex system where
there's a human being or some sort of organization a
collective organization so let me give you some examples of
these what am I talking about when I mean collective
ego it's a lot of stuff let's make it very
concrete I'm talking about your family I'm talking about any
club that you're a part of or a musical band
a sports team a gang a committee of any kind
a local church a business whether it's a small startup
business with you and a couple of your buddies in
a garage or it's a giant multinational corporation that employs
50,000 people it has an ego it has a collective
ego an ashram or a monastery cults have egos religions
have egos nonprofit organizations political parties labor unions cities grassroots
campaigns communes even online forums and subreddits institutions like mathematics
or science have an ego universities even entire professional fields
like you can take the entire professional field of doctors
or lawyers or accountants they will have a certain professional
ego collective professional ego in addition to and above their
individual egos of course spiritual schools all have their own
egos races and ethnic groups have collective egos Nations alliances
like the European Union or the UN or NATO those
sorts of things even the human species as a whole
has a collective ego and then there are things which
you would think wouldn't have an ego but they sort
of do like culture tends to have its own ego
and even systems like language and you might wonder well
how can language have an ego but in a sense
it kind of does have you noticed grammar nazis how
you notice how how people get really hung up on
using language properly and then there's different ways different dialects
and people get really picky about what's the perfect pronunciation
for certain words certain dialects are are minimized while others
are elevated in status and then of course languages evolve
and morph over time you can't recognize what English is
like from 500 years ago it's hard to read Shakespeare
and yet that's English that's because it's always evolving and
people are always trying to preserve language as it is
so in a sense language is trying to preserve itself
against the forces of evolution and cancer is another good
example of something that has a sort of proto ego
to it because what cancer is is just these cells
that start to multiply but then they get out of
hand they multiply too much and so they try to
do that in fact when you attack when you attack
these cancer cells and you try to kill them they
defend themselves and they fight against that so they have
a sort of sense of self and the entire earth
as a whole you could say has a collective ego
of course not all complex systems exhibit ego your computer
doesn't have an ego cars your car doesn't have an
ego your house doesn't have an ego but then again
these technologies are very new relatively speaking computers and cars
have only existed for about a hundred years who knows
where they will be in a thousand years in a
thousand years maybe even sooner maybe even in a hundred
years your computer or your car or your house it
gets so complex that it starts to have an ego
so what's required is massive complexity not just complexity yes
your computer is complex yes your car is complex in
your house is complex but not nearly complex enough what
seems to be required is a vast interconnectedness the way
that you get inside of a brain the brain is
the perfect example of this sort of massive interconnectedness or
you link a bunch of brains together into some sort
of internet type of system into a network or into
a religious organization or into a corporation or into a
nation and then that acquires an ego because that's also
networking this complicated multi multi parallel sort of way I
want you to start to draw a parallel between your
struggle for self-control in life and the collective egos all
around you which are also struggling for self-control if you
think about what life is at the most general level
it's all about self-control it's the self trying to control
itself struggling with itself fighting with itself this is not
particular to just you as a human being of course
you have your petty little struggles every single day you
get up and you're dealing with stuff you're dealing with
emails and work problems and financial problems relationship problems what
are you doing you're struggling to maintain a a stasis
within a general environment of chaos stuff is always changing
you know your cars is breaking down your house is
breaking down you always have to fix this stuff up
your relationship is deteriorating you have to work on that
your job is deteriorating if you're not working on that
your business is deteriorating everything everything has to be worked
and maintained this is just a general principle of entropy
your fatty against entropy so you of course are familiar
with the fact that you're struggling all the time but
are you familiar and are you really conscious that the
same struggle within you is the same struggle that you
see for example taking place within a religion like Christianity
or Islam or within a city government or within a
sports team or within a new business startup or within
an alliance or within the community of scientists and mathematicians
or within some spiritual school or within an ethnic group
or a racial group are you conscious of that and
are you drawing parallels are you seeing the deep interconnectedness
in the mechanisms there's an isomorphism between the mechanisms that
are happening within you to maintain yourself and the mechanisms
that are happening out there and all these systems and
of course these systems are not separate from you you're
intimately involved in many of these systems you're a part
of your government you're a part of your nation you're
a part of your ethnic group you're a part of
all these groups they're not something out there that you
can just point your finger at and judge you have
to also take responsibility for the fact that you contribute
to all this stuff start to notice the similar dynamics
that are going on as you study your own ego
with all the self-actualization stuff your eyes should be opening
to like oh wow yeah all this stuff is happening
in me and all these tricks that I play on
myself and all this this need that I have for
self preservation that's the same thing that's happening with that
corporation over there or that government over there and that
helps to start to explain a lot of the evil
that you see out in the world because you might
wonder like well how come that corporation is so greedy
and how come that religion is is so oppressive and
so violent and how come how come there's so much
corruption in that nonprofit group over there and all the
sorts of stuff you start to really appreciate that when
you become conscious of that very same stuff happening within
you when you start to see the corruption within you
the struggles for self-preservation within yourself I also want you
to start to notice especially what happens draw the parallel
between self-preservation running amok in your own life and running
amuck collectively what do I mean by this I'll give
you an example in your own life your individual ego
for example maybe you grew up in a in a
poor family in a poor neighborhood but you worked hard
now you're doing well for yourself but deep down you
still fear poverty and so you work hard every day
on your business or at your work at your job
you're trying to climb the corporate ladder or whatever you're
doing you're saving money you're you're looking out for all
the stuff but deep down you're you're always afraid that
you're not saving enough and so you're working more and
more and more and every time you know you're presented
new opportunities you always go for the opportunity that gets
you more money more success because deep down that's what's
driving you is this sort of fear and you might
say well what's the prob with that well the same
thing as with cancer too much of a good thing
becomes a bad thing because you start to chase more
and more money more and more money and then your
business or your work becomes just about money and you
lose sight of the higher consciousness values if you're an
artist you lose sight of your artwork if you you
lose sight of your creativity you sell yourself out you
just go for more money more money more money and
then maybe you start to do shady stuff borderline unethical
stuff gray hat sort of stuff and then nad devolves
into black hat sort of stuff and then you maybe
start to do some illegal sort of stuff and you
start to do some fraud and you start to do
a little bit of this and cutting corners a little
bit there and stealing a little bit from work and
this and that yourself preservation instinct is starting to run
amok you can you start to realize the limits of
that and stop it before it gets out of control
because the fact is that you could become a billionaire
you could have a hundred billion dollars and you will
still not have enough because fundamentally you haven't address the
deep fear inside of you that you're still running away
from because that's what's really driving your ego your ego
wants self-preservation to an infinite degree and unfortunately that's just
not sustainable in many cases so you start to see
if you do some inner work some consciousness work you
start to become more aware you sure to see oh
yeah I do have this fear let me work on
that let me get to the root and to the
bottom of it and if I fix that then maybe
I won't be so attached to success into money and
then I can kind of relax I'm not gonna be
working overtime all the time my wife and my kids
aren't gonna hate me because I spend all my free
time working and I don't spend any time with them
and also my health is gonna improve because now I
have more time to go to the gym and I
have more time to enjoy myself and I have more
time to relax I'm not so stressed and I can
meditate a little bit right see so you let go
of the self-preservation instinct and actually what happens is that
you start to improve you start to thrive more so
it's not the case that to be rigidly attached to
self-preservation means that you're gonna live the best life possible
not at all it doesn't work that simply life is
not so linear these these sorts of dynamics they tend
to backfire on you life is all about finding the
right equilibrium and balance so that's an example from your
personal life hopefully that makes sense for you but now
I want you to start to see that all around
you in the collective egos that exist the exact same
stuff is happening it's happening within religions within corporations within
governments and you start to wonder well well why is
that religion so violent well maybe it's because that religion
is afraid of dying it's afraid of its environment changing
so radically it's afraid of the new technologies in the
internet and and and gay rights and all this sort
of stuff it's so afraid that it needs to defend
itself so when it does is it lashes out and
it goes and it proselytize those people at the at
the at the point of a gun or it employs
tactics to manipulate people because otherwise the religion would go
out of business start to draw those parallels it's rarely
talked about this topic of collective ego by spiritual teachers
and that's really a problem because just working on your
own ego turns out to not really be enough to
understand life because life for human beings because we're social
creatures were hive like like ants or bees the groups
that were part of shape us enormous lee and how
we behave and how we think in turn feeds back
and shapes the groups such that when we don't understand
this dynamic of collective ego or the individual ego and
we don't link them together then what ends up happening
is that actually a lot of evil is created in
the world collective ego is responsible for some of the
greatest evils of all time and hey maybe you're gonna
become enlightened one day and you think okay I'm enlightened
and everything's good I've solved all the world's problems well
not so fast because even though you might be enlightened
your group still has a collective ego just because you
got enlightened doesn't mean that your organization got enlightened with
you your corporation or your nation or even your ashram
or your monastery just because you're a Zen monk who
got enlightened in a in a Zen monastery does not
mean that your Zen monastery now doesn't have a collective
ego oh no and it's very easy for you to
come under the collective pressure of that ego because you're
you're at the whim in a sense of these larger
forces that shape society and the even though you are
enlightened just because you're going along with the flow it
will carry you to some great evil and there's many
examples where that has happened to people even enlightened people
individual human beings if you meet them face to face
most of the time they're pretty kind and decent people
now of course there are exceptions some people you meet
them face to face and they stab you in the
eye with a fork because they're Psychopaths or they got
something else going on with them there's definitely that possibility
out of billions of people but most people are pretty
decent most people have a sense of compassion because they
aren't connected to their heart they don't just think with
their mind they're also connected with their heart and they're
not cold-blooded but in groups that's another matter when you
get human beings into groups even though the human beings
might have heart when they come together into a group
they sort of give themselves up to the collective ego
of the group the problem is though that the collective
ego of the group is very mechanical the collective group
of a religion for example doesn't have a heart it
doesn't have a conscience and when you surrender yourself to
that when your individual ego gets identified with the collective
ego now there's this sort of bond and you become
like a child of the larger parent you're sort of
attached to it the way that the wrist is attached
to the to the arm or the hand is attached
to them to the wrist such that now you know
I move the rig move the hand or the arm
and the hand moves along with it and that's when
a lot of great evil can get done human beings
can turn into monsters and then you're not conscious see
most human beings are not conscious of the egoic mechanisms
within themselves because they've never bothered to look deeply in
words nobody has taught them how the way that actualize
that org is trying to teach you how so they're
unconscious of their own self deceptions and egoic tricks and
therefore of course they're extremely unconscious of all the egoic
tricks of all the groups that they're a part of
and then all hell breaks loose so I want you
to start to notice that the ego is a very
general dynamic and that it tends to operate in the
same way at the individual and the collective level it
tends to use the same bag of tricks so specifically
what bag of tricks does it use well let's give
you a little list here and I'm not going to
go into full depth on all of these because these
are entire episodes all in and of themselves and I've
already shot episodes about some of this stuff and I
will shoot more in the future but we got to
give you this list and talk about some of this
stuff a little bit so here are some mechanisms self
bias this happens at the individual level and the collective
level and that's true of all these mechanisms self deception
dishonesty secrecy and lack of transparency oh the ego loves
that one that you love secrecy the more secrecy there
is the less transparency the more the ego flourishes because
the devil loves to do his work in the shadows
in fact that's the only place where he can really
be effective is in the shadows that's why in organizations
whether it's governments or corporations or religious organizations whatever lack
of transparency is always a problem if you notice it
always leads to corruption abuse of power why is that
because the ego runs amok when nobody else is holding
it to account and the only way you can hold
it to account is through transparency and that's especially true
with religious and spiritual groups which is one of the
reasons why with actualized dot orgs forum I try to
keep all conversations public on the forum we don't have
any side discussions private chat groups or any of this
kind of stuff because I know just how much corruption
potential there is there you have to moderate that stuff
and it has to be open when the stuff is
open it's fully transparent to everybody that's what keeps it
from festering and getting infected but then people people love
to form a little splinter groups their own little private
chats and all this sorts of stuff and then I
can quickly quickly get out of hand so see that's
just one little area of application there and of course
know whatever organization you're a part of you can apply
that to your organization and you can see that there
are tendencies within an organization to become more and more
secretive less and less transparency give less and less information
by a government for example to its population and as
soon as that starts to happen you know it's coming
next something pretty evil double standards is another mechanism of
the collective ego the ego loves to set up a
standard for itself which is much laxer than the standards
for other egos out there and that's what allows the
ego to start to judge others is these double standards
so judgement is the next mechanism huge mechanism if you
notice collectively these groups these collective egos they love to
judge every religion loves to judge every other religion every
spiritual teacher loves to judge every other spiritual teacher every
school of mysticism and enlightenment loves to judge and criticize
all the other schools as being inferior for whatever justifications
they have and it doesn't matter the mind and the
ego will come up with an infinite number of justifications
to justify absolutely any position the justifications of the mind
and the ego or the the collective in this case
is simply anything that serves its self-preservation it doesn't matter
what the truth is the number one thing is self-preservation
and that's where judgment is used other mechanisms include denial
projection manipulation and abuse of power these are huge notice
all of these in yourself no notice all the deception
or I mean the manipulation the denial the projection within
you and notice it all around you collectively abuse of
power is not just something that applies to government's abuse
of power is something that applies to you first and
foremost you abuse power and it's because you abuse power
because you have not purified yourself enough that collectively egos
abused power as well to have a collective organization that
does not abuse power is no easy thing that means
that organization has to be a high consciousness organization it
has to do work on itself in a sense in
order to not lead to abuse of power another mechanism
that's common to individual and collective egos is having base
needs like Maslow's hierarchy of needs the very bottom rung
of the entire hierarchy is stuff like food shelter you
know just very basic stuff water or maybe sex maybe
some other kind of stuff like that well guess what
corporations also have basic needs governments have basic needs sports
teams have basic needs churches and and cults have basic
needs and you know what they're doing most of the
time just like you are in your life mostly they're
spending 90% of their time trying to satisfy their basic
needs that's it I mean think about it what are
most human beings doing most the time just struggling fighting
with reality to satisfy their base needs and same thing
for most corporations and most governments start to see that
the reason that our governments are not better is the
same reason that individual human beings and you yourself are
not better because it's hard to satisfy your base needs
and transcend beyond them to the higher consciousness needs that's
not easy to do that requires self-actualization work lots of
work lots of self-reflection lots of consciousness another mechanism is
language and categories this is huge notice that all groups
construct their own languages and use language as a tool
to advance their own self-preservation now language is a deep
topic and all shoots specific episodes on language but language
allows you to create categories and allows you to set
frames and to define situations you use language in order
to judge people or to judge other groups and organizations
you use language to manipulate you use language to deny
to project you use language to frame things in favourable
ways to yourself for example a corporation could be stealing
from the taxpayers or a corporation could be exploiting people
a corporation could be polluting the ocean but then they're
gonna use language and categories through language to frame what
they're doing in such a way such that it doesn't
appear like they're doing anything wrong at all they're not
gonna call it pollution cuz that's got a negative connotation
they're gonna come up with some other word or language
for it they're gonna create some other kind of category
to justify it justifications happen within language also notice that
every group develops its own jargon this jargon reinforces membership
within that group its greats a sense of identity just
by knowing the jargon you feel like you sort of
belong mm-hmm-hmm because language isn't just language language comes with
an implicit metaphysics and thus metaphysics shapes how the ego
or the collective ego in this case looks at reality
and by changing how it looks in reality that changes
how effective the ego is at manipulating this reality so
language is critical which is why there are PR departments
in big businesses and they're masters at language using language
to manipulate just like individual human beings notice how you
yourself used language to manipulate you use language to manipulate
your spouse your girlfriend or your boyfriend your children your
parents your boss your co-workers use language to do that
language allows you to lie and the lying is key
for the ego because the ego fundamentally is based upon
a lie the ego is a lie the ego is
the lie that you drew a boundary around some corner
of reality and said okay this is me this is
what's important that's entirely a lie but since you're living
that lie now you've got to kind of roll with
it so that massive core fundamental lie necessitates further lies
to maintain the lie so it's just like a snowball
of lies and that's why you have so many corporations
and organizations and governments lying to you of course of
course of course religion lies to you of course because
the whole thing is predicated upon that otherwise it would
die your hairy life depends upon lying lying to others
and also lying to yourself notice that corporations and organizations
governments they don't just lie to you as the consumer
or the citizen on the receiving end of the lie
they lie to themselves they lie to their own employees
and their own members the church lies to its own
Cardinals and priests first and foremost only secondarily does it
lie to you another mechanism is ideology and paradigm blindness
every collective ego uses ideology just like almost every individual
ego does ideology is huge the whole idea is to
indoctrinate someone into some way of thinking such that then
that ideology becomes the thing that sustains it's like the
software that sustains the hardware and the whole idea is
to create this bubble that's isolated from the rest of
reality so it's a that's what ego is trying to
construct it's trying to create this sort of isolated walled
garden this bubble such that you can't see outside of
it and that's what's happening with science with religion with
government with political ideology with economic philosophy like it doesn't
matter what it is it's it's building paradigms other mechanisms
include narratives identity and a sense of history notice that
every collective organization if it has any degree of success
it starts to develop a narrative of itself in the
same way that you have a narrative of your own
life you think you were born in such a city
and you went to such and such a school and
such and stuff happened to you all of that is
a fiction that your mind and invented but corporations and
governments do the same governments spend a lot of time
orchestrating and crafting engineering the history of the government how
did the United States government come about who's the founding
fathers in the Declaration of Independence and it was so
idealistic and they were so brilliant and it was all
based on freedom and and overcoming tyranny and you build
this up you build up this identity through these narratives
and then you construct this history but of course it's
a very selective history it's not fair at all it's
not objective at all you're cherry-picking the stuff you need
to preserve and to aggrandize this structure your narrative will
be the the most positive narrative that could exist that
will help to maintain the structure including even a narrative
of being a victim because being a victim and having
that narrative for many people that's a way that they
survive is by developing this victim identity and many organizations
and groups develop victim identities or other kinds of identities
that's just one trick there's many different narratives that you
can develop for yourself and corporations what are they big
on they're big on branding why do they brand because
is the image it's the identity of the company and
that becomes important the brand itself in a business is
really the most valuable part it's the brand how well
people know you and what your brand represents and that
needs to be manipulated constructed in the same way that
individually as an individual person you also have a sort
of brand you have a reputation people think of you
in a certain way do they think that you're a
sheet do they think you're a murderer a rapist or
do they think that you're sweet and nice and that
you're you're kind you give to charity and so what
do you do you play to that self image and
one of my most popular and most watched and most
highly rated episodes of all time is how to stop
caring what other people think about you and that's because
you care so much about how people think about you
why do you care so much because you have this
self-image and you have this identity and the whole important
thing is that you got to project a good identity
out into the world because if you don't project a
good identity that other people accept then you're gonna get
ostracized and that's gonna directly affect your ability to survive
and to live your very life depends on your identity
the identity that you project out into the world which
is why so many people percent a false front they
lie so much to construct this pleasant identity whereas deep
down inside they're so screwed up and so neurotic that
they're not even honest with themselves about what their true
identity is because they just buy in it's just easier
to buy in the projected outward identity same thing with
companies companies [ __ ] themselves all the time by
creating this this nice identity they'll run ads that they're
they're nice to the environment they're nice to this or
they're doing this all this lofty stuff but then deep
down when you look at what's the company actually doing
what they're doing is they're just they're really their identities
just greed rampant greed and exploitation in many cases that's
it for most companies that's our whole identity but I
mean will they admit that to themselves of course not
never they buy into the project the projected identity that
they put out there for the rest of the world
why wouldn't they because that's the identity that makes them
succeed another mechanism is tribalism the sort of us versus
them mentality defining in us defining of them and having
enemies oh this is huge notice that individual people have
enemies but collective egos organizations corporations governments they all have
enemies to every religion has an enemy religion every spiritual
teacher probably has an enemy spiritual teacher every government has
an enemy government every sports team has an enemy sports
team every corporation has an enemy corporation that is gonna
kill them of course because when you are living as
an ego in an environment with our other egos one
of the biggest threats to your survival is other egos
similar to yourself so in a sense the more similar
someone is to you the more they can encroach on
your territory and that becomes a problem and that's where
this tribalism comes in another mechanism that collective egos use
is rewarding loyalty and punishing disloyalty threatening to outcast you
as a heretic someone who has broken their orthodoxy what
is that about that's about making sure that they don't
have too much dissent within the organization if some element
of a complicated organization is starting to stir up a
revolution what are you you kicked them out you don't
let that thing metastasize and turn into a cancer and
take the whole thing over that's too much of a
threat to the to the homeostasis of that system you
kick them out so you need to have mechanisms to
isolate to find those people immediately and to demonize them
to ridicule them to marginalize them and kick them out
and the final mechanism I'll give you here which by
no means is the end of the list but for
this episode it is is refusing to self-reflect just like
as an individual you don't like to self-reflect well guess
what corporations governments these collective egos they hate to self-reflect
to get a large company like ExxonMobil to really self
reflect about the environment environmental impact the economic impact that
they are having on the world their carbon footprint hmm
get a religion like Islam to really self reflect about
the way that it operates around the world hmm and
I'm not just picking on Islam you can pick any
religion it's the same same deal for are any religion
or really for that matter any organization get a non-profit
get the most charitable nonprofit you know whatever organization whatever
charity you love get it to really self reflect good
luck good luck that's heart and if you are an
individual in that organization and you try to get them
to self-reflect what do you thing is gonna do to
you are they gonna listen are they gonna say oh
how wonderful that you wrote me this memo like let's
say you wrote up a memo to your CEO of
their company oh let's let's self reflect it let's really
think about whether we're charging people too much money and
whether maybe we're exploiting our workers and maybe we should
raise our our minimum wages and maybe we should not
dump so much pollution into the ocean yeah good luck
good luck you're gonna get fired of course you will
so now let's go through some examples some concrete examples
of collective ego across various domains of life so first
let's look at religion Islam which I recently talked about
in a separate episode is a really interesting one great
example certain elements within Islam in Islam as a is
a big tradition there's a lot of diversity there so
we can't we have to be careful not to over
generalize but small minorities some radical minorities within Islam are
trying to build an Islamic caliphate that's what Isis is
trying to do and they're their firm believers they've got
a certain ideology now that's a small percentage of overall
Islam so now there's a sort of battle going on
within Islam be too the more moderates and the more
radicals and different factions and all this is trying to
get fought out but fundamentally what is Islam trying to
do Islam whether it's radical Islam or moderate Islam doesn't
really matter it's trying to grow because it's an ego
an ego is not just interested in maintaining itself it's
also interested in expanding itself like a cancer so if
you're a moderate Muslim you still want Islam to grow
you're still converting other people to Islam because you believe
in it and if you're a radical Islamist well then
you're really you're really serious about it and you want
it to grow in a particular way you want it
to grow in a particular direction your direction because you
have a certain conception of it and so now there's
a sort of battle going on there you see and
that's all ego that's what that is and Islam needs
tools to defend itself from attack from outsiders and also
from insiders see there's always the threat from the outside
and also in a sense from the inside in a
sense most systems their greatest threat is actually not from
the outside but being sabotaged from some faction from the
inside which is why there's such a strong emphasis on
orthodoxy and maintaining power see and so these radical Islamists
what they want is they want a really pure strong
strain of Islam which domineers over everybody else because what
is that that's pure ego that's what ego loves to
do is it love to dominate in domineer its authoritarian
Bynes very nature ego is all about control control and
manipulation damn the costs because the ego doesn't care about
whose toes it steps on whose head it chops off
or what it done it doesn't really care at least
not when you have the most pure form of ego
now as your ego evolves and it becomes more conscious
more self-aware and the boundary between itself and others starts
to dissolve then the ego gets moderated it's no longer
as hostile you see the less ego you have the
more likely you are to want to dominate somebody else
and control them because alessi go you have the more
you realize that control is an illusion there's no such
thing as control you're not in control of anything you're
always gonna lose ego will always lose eventually Islam will
be completely gone and dead no matter how hard you
try I'm sorry that's just the truth that's not just
true of Islam that's true very every religion every religion
will ultimately die or become so corrupted and so transmuted
through evolution that it will be completely and utterly unrecognizable
which is already really the case in a sense you
could say that modern Catholicism modern Islam modern Judaism it's
dead it's died thousands of years ago it's the opposite
of what it used to be how about the example
of the Catholic Church let's not just pick on Islam
here don't think that uh I have a bone to
pick with Islam this is this is true of every
single religious institution the Catholic Church look at what it's
doing it's using denial classic mechanism denial to deny the
fact that it's priests have a problem with pedophilia that's
how it defends itself it's completely in denial about it
it tries to sweep that under the rug in the
same way that you would as an individual if you
found out that you were doing something nasty in your
own life you would deny it of course you would
in the same way that if if you're getting out
of your car in a parking lot and you actually
accidentally hit the the neighboring car with your door and
you make a dent what are you gonna do are
you gonna are you gonna and let's say nobody sees
you so it's just you only you see it are
you gonna be conscious enough and really compassionate enough to
leave a note on the other guy's car with your
phone number and let's say your credit card number so
that they could get their money back no of course
not if they don't see you you're just gonna sweep
down on the register oh well oh it's just a
little scratch oh it's just a little scratch it probably
only costs um ten bucks to fix that oh it's
not a big deal I don't want to inconvenience in
by leaving the snowed I don't even have a pen
with me oh it's okay and then you just walk
away drive away exactly what the Catholic Church does and
of course it also wants to expand as well that's
why you've got that's why you've got missionaries all around
the world converting all sorts of people under the threat
of a gun destroying cultures destroying families just for the
sake of promoting the Catholic Church the Catholic ideology yeah
and then you got the cat the Spanish Inquisition and
what's the Spanish Inquisition about it's about rooting out the
corrupters of the one true ideology and so you got
that and all the dirty tricks that the Catholic Church
has played throughout history which pretty much every religion every
Church has played throughout history we all know them well
those are the exact same tricks that you play in
your own life individually how about Scientology Scientology is a
very egotistical religion it uses all sorts of highly manipulative
tactics to control its members to brainwash its members to
to extract huge sums of money from its member to
the point of bankrupting them discrediting ex-members anyone who leaves
Scientology is discredited they use blackmail to to pressure ex
members and and all sorts of stuff to keep them
silent yeah it's classic egotistical behavior and in a sense
it has to do that in order because because it's
afraid it's afraid of what it's afraid of dissolving what's
gonna happen Scientology if it doesn't use all these methods
if it actually has some heart well maybe it actually
become more popular but for that to happen it would
have to release its fear but the people running it
are all afraid they're all claim to their egos they're
not at a high level of consciousness that entire organization
has a very low level of collective consciousness and therefore
it's doing the dirty stuff that it does and it's
because of that ironically that it's probably gonna lead to
its own self-destruction because more and more people now are
finding out about this bad reputation it's ruining its brand
now you talk about Scientology to most people they don't
want to have anything to do with it because of
all the bad stories all the bad publicity right that's
exactly what happens that's what happens to an individual when
he's a liar a cheat a manipulator and he's domineering
same thing happens eventually people find out you'd have up
that reputation and then you can no longer do business
and that and near that person anymore no one wants
to do business with you now of course let's not
just pick on religion let's pick a little bit on
science as well you myself silly oh but that's all
religion yeah of course religions full of collective ego yeah
it's really easy to to see the collective ego and
religion it's a little bit harder with science most scientists
are so in denial that science has a massive collective
ego how so well science is not about truth you
see the way that people assume science is number one
priority because it's a collective ego is self-preservation Sciences job
is to maintain develop and defend the existing paradigm of
science which in the 21st century now happens to be
materialist reductionism science is in denial about consciousness science is
in denial about psychedelics Sciences in denial about altered states
of consciousness science is in denial about mystical traditions and
spirituality science is denying evidence of the paranormal which clearly
exists science tries to fragment reality very sneaky this notion
of fragmentation is a classic egoic technique it separates reality
into domains the physical science of the biological science is
the this kind of science that kind of science and
then of course science and academia has to be carefully
isolated from spirituality from mysticism from philosophy from something else
carefully everything is isolated such that when you go into
a scientific conference you start talking about mysticism they kick
you out they're not gonna listen about nandu I think
I'll listen about parable no they're not gonna listen to
you because they're gonna say even if they believe you
they're gonna say well yeah maybe you're right but that
belongs in the domain of religious studies right because that's
the ego is fundamentally about fragmenting ality it's all about
fragmentation because the thing that the ego is fundamentally resisting
is the fact that everything is infinitely interconnected it's all
one but the ego to maintain itself as an ego
the whole point of being an ego is that you're
denying that everything is one you're deny that everything is
interconnected you're saying no this is most important here so
fragmentation is a very handy tool and science uses it
masterfully masterfully universities have mastered this science defends itself and
tries to frame its narrative as its it's the one
and only source of truth the one and only true
method of understanding the world that's anything but true but
nevertheless that narrative is still there and most scientific people
believe in it even those pay me absurd in fact
science will never get you to the ultimate truth but
try explaining that to a dogmatic scientist the mistake is
that scientists falsely assume that their science is about truth
no it's not it's about self-preservation it's a collective ego
and if you carefully turned inside and really study your
own ego you would clearly see that it would be
obvious to you that those same mechanisms are operating within
science but of course most scientists they don't turn inside
because again they've used fragmentation to say that well size
has nothing to do with psychology science has nothing to
do with my own level of consciousness léo science is
objective right because you've fragmented and separated science scientific pursuits
from your own emotions your own consciousness so of course
that looks like it's true for you in the same
way a to a religious person it looks to them
that their little bubble of religion makes perfect sense of
the world of course it doesn't but that doesn't matter
the truth doesn't matter the ego doesn't care about truth
if the ego cared about true it would allow itself
to die how about the domain of politics tons of
examples here especially lately really good ones you can see
ego on full display right now in our politics the
entire rise of the alt-right and this trumpism phenomenon and
the entire phenomenon the fact that Donald Trump is even
involved in politics what is that it's an ego backlash
that's what that is nothing more that's what the alt-right
is it's an ego backlash you can talk about economic
factors and socio political and racial factors in all of
this and sure yeah that's right but when you really
understand non-duality you understand what ego is how it really
works you just look at the whole situation for a
big picture Brazil you like yeah that's just an ego
backlash that's all it is it's an ego backlash against
eight years of Obama and in a sense all what
conservatism is is just it's it's a clinging to the
past make America great again right yeah that's the ego
trying to maintain itself that's what it is and the
ego loves to do an ego backlash after big changes
come you know you have the first black president that's
a big change for many people of course many of
them don't like that and I'm not saying that that's
the only factor there's other factors it's not that simple
but fundamentally it's an ego backlash it's an ego backlash
against progressivism it's an ego backlash against all this sort
of stuff that's happening you know gay rights are coming
becoming legitimate and and civil riots are becoming legit there's
always an ego backlash look through history every single time
there's been big progress there's nigo backlash and how do
you really verify that's the case study yourself study your
own personal ego backlashes do a deep meditation retreat or
take a deep psychedelic trip and then notice what happens
the next week you have a massive ego backlash and
then you're like oh yeah of course that's exactly what's
happening with our nation as a whole because there's only
so much progress you can take that a system take
before it destabilizes too much it experiences an identity crisis
that's why we have these culture wars why culture wars
because it's all about an identity crisis but of course
you know liberals are also guilty of plenty of ego
as well the Democratic convention Democratic Party rigs the Democratic
system or the Democratic primary process for example against against
progressives because the Democratic Party is sort of entrenched in
the sort of centralist and doesn't want to go to
left-wing to progressive so it rigs against that Hillary Clinton
was involved with that against Bernie Sanders for example great
example of how that works so we can expect the
Democratic Party to try to maintain the Democratic Party the
Democratic Party is corrupted with all sorts of lobbyists and
and Pro corporate interests so of course that's what they're
trying to maintain they don't care about creating the best
countries not about creating the best country the alt-right is
not about creating the best country it's not about the
truth it has nothing to do with that it's all
about defending their view of the world and defending themselves
their very existence is on the line same thing with
the Democratic Party gerrymandering is a really good example of
how the collective ego works so gerrymandering is is redrawing
the districts inside of a state or county so that
if it's in your favor that's precisely what the ego
is about this is like the epitome of egotism is
gerrymandering you redraw all the rules so they favor you
and then on top of that if anybody comes and
contests you're redrawing of the maps you contest they're contesting
of it which is what happens in like like in
Pennsylvania like they had a big good gerrymandering case there
lately and the Supreme Court in that state struck down
the Republican gerrymandering but the Republicans are fighting it see
cuz it's not about honest he's not about having fair
elections nobody cares about that how about gerrymandering that's how
the ego works and of course that particular examples Republicans
but Democrats also do gerrymandering so it's the problem on
both sides how about the Iraq war what was that
all about you could say well there were all these
complicated factors to the Iraq war no it's very simple
from a non-dual perspective it's just an ego backlash to
9/11 that's all it really is now you might say
but Leo like bush and the neocons they had plans
maybe they wanted to invade Iraq even before 9/11 and
you know it's all about the military-industrial complex and all
of this so how is that an ego backlash that
seems like self-interest well obviously it's self-interest and that's the
ego on itself but I'm saying the entire nation experienced
an ego backlash after 9/11 see the way that an
ego works is that when it gets attacked it reacts
and oftentimes it reacts in unconscious and knee-jerk ways and
that's exactly what happened after 9/11 now sure maybe Bush
and Cheney and the neo-cons they had this sort of
desire to go start to invade countries and maybe go
back into Iraq there's some evidence that they wanted to
go back into Iraq even before 9/11 9/11 was sort
of just the the catalyst for that but would they
have been able to do that were it not for
9/11 maybe you could make the case that maybe they
could but it would've been much much harder what they
did is they exploited the the sort of collective egoic
consciousness which was wounded at that time and they exploited
it and created a sort of us versus them enemy
sort of mentality and then they went and they started
to wage their war they probably would not have been
able to get away with that unless 9/11 happened because
otherwise the the collective system you know the Senate the
the house it would not have approved the war and
and people would have protested it too much but because
9/11 happened in the whole the whole country was kind
of feeling wounded didn't know what to do felt angry
felt afraid these very base fears base base emotions and
desires and needs their very survival felt threatened now all
the sudden now we can justify all sorts of lashing
out in projection and and all sorts of selfish stuff
and so that's what happened let's look at the domain
of government the government for example outlaw psychedelics why does
it do that is it because I can else are
harmful and evil no of course not psychedelics if the
government would allow them and if the government actually supported
them and actually distributed them helped to distribute them and
help to advertise them psychedelics would destroy the current government
it would destroy the entire capitalist economy and capitalist system
like radically decimated so of course it's not in the
government's interest to promote psychedelics not only that it outlaws
them and actively demonizes them lies about them just pure
out lies completely unscientific we have tons of scientific studies
which show all the benefits and the safety of psychedelics
completely validated both empirically and theoretically and in all sorts
of ways clinically and individually is all been validated or
last 60 years but the government still says that these
are illegal schedule 1 substances which have no no medical
or clinical or scientifically proven use complete nonsense but hey
the government doesn't care about the truth the ego never
cares about the truth it cares about preserving itself how
about the government suppressing minorities almost every government Andris the
US government almost every government suppresses minorities always has pretty
much always will why is that because the majority constitutes
the majority of the ego and nass was trying to
maintain its power so of course it's gonna suppress minorities
and of course as minorities get more power the majority
will start to feel threatened which is a huge factor
to the this rise of the alright it's just an
ego reaction that's all it is how about the expansion
of federal power that's a good example especially if you're
a right winger and you think that I'm ragging too
much on right-wingers here well look here I'll say something
in a little more towards your liking the federal government
has been expanding its powerful last 30 not thirty three
hundred years since the founding of this country the federal
government has been expanding its power originally the United States
was not supposed to have a federal government at all
but you know we were kind of forced into it
of is an agreement of convenience but then federal power
grew more and more and more and more in states
rights these days states rights even most Republicans these days
don't really believe in states rights just some some [
__ ] they say when it helps them but you
know and and if you're a right winger if you're
conservative maybe you're a libertarian or something then you you
you want to go back you want to roll that
back you want to roll back the power of the
federal government but the federal government is ego that's collective
ego it's growing of course it's gonna grow more it's
not gonna grow less it's only going to grow more
because the more complicated a system gets the more the
more control the more fine control it needs over itself
that's what a lot of libertarians and right ringers don't
really understand when you have a very sophisticated system you
cannot roll back all the regulations and all the rules
and just go back to simple Wild West style living
it ain't gonna work it ain't gonna work can you
imagine if you decided to do that for example with
a biological organism if you said oh you know I
don't want all these controls and all these rules and
all these regulations within my body I mean after all
there's a there's hundreds of trillions of cells in my
body but I don't I don't really want to inconvenience
them they want to be free all these cells want
to be free well if all the cells in your
body are gonna be free and do whatever the [
__ ] they want you'd be dead can't do that
in order to have a very complicated system that functions
like a well-oiled machine you need a lot of rules
and regulations and limits in place it's all about limitations
the opposite of freedom order is the opposite of freedom
you know what true freedom is it's chaos true freedom
is no ego just by the very fact that you're
trying to be an ego is you are enslaving yourself
so everything you're doing all all these pretenses of freedom
it's it's a it's a complete circle jerk if you
wanted true freedom you would surrender to death that would
be true freedom but of course you don't want to
do that it was never about that it was always
about just defending your ideology that's all it was how
about the CIA we have a new CIA director who's
being nominated lately seems like she has credible accusations of
being a torturer supporting torture supervising torture personally videotaping torture
of the CIA doing torture to innocent people by the
way in many cases and yeah destroying evidence destroying evidence
of this torture why would the CIA want the torture
and then destroy evidence of the torture because the CIA
wants power wants control that's what ego is all about
it's all about control and it's all about thinking that
your control is justified it doesn't matter who you use
your power control against the ego doesn't care about that
so it wants to torture and then it wants to
hide the fact that is torturing and all it wants
to do all this secretly so when you have some
whistleblower revealing the fact that some of these government programs
are doing torture or secret surveillance so you have someone
like and word Snowden who reveals the stuff what is
he called he's called a traitor why is he a
traitor because because he went against the ego self-interest what's
the that's the greatest that's the greatest crime the ego
the shallow the very shallow very condensed ego that that's
that's the worst thing that you can do to it
is you can betray it because that that is an
affront to everything the ego is about the ego all
is all about just pure unadulterated on self-reflective selfishness and
any sort of attempt to reveal it to some light
on it is going to be immediately smashed and crushed
and quelled if possible which is why the US government
right now is trying to kill Edward Snowden they're gonna
they're gonna try to extradite him if they can and
and if they do they're gonna probably try him and
are they gonna give him a fair trial of course
not and then if they if they convict him they're
gonna they're gonna execute him under the the acts of
treason of course of course he was revealing truth he
was being a whistleblower and trying to make things more
transparent but that doesn't matter to the ego about corporations
like something let's make sure we include some of these
examples exxon mobil has been hiding evidence of global warming
data for over 30 years internally they did their own
studies using their own scientists and concluded over 30 years
ago that the the effects of all this burning of
oil sort of stuff and all the activities of exxon
mobil will be raising and creating contributing to global warming
they themselves know about that but of course they they
kept all that stuff silent and now in certain states
they're actually suing suing exxon mobil like new york state
i think is suing exxon mobil for this sort of
fraud that they've been committing of course because it's not
in exxon mobil's self-interest to reveal facts that will undermine
its own business of course not in the same way
when you go to a job interview are you gonna
voluntarily disclose that you have some sort of deep problem
or some sort of deep and competency which is gonna
disqualify you from this job of course not you're gonna
present this fancy resume with all this doctored up stuff
everything's gonna be made good like oh yeah you have
five years of experience at this company when in fact
you only worked out for three years and you have
oh and you worked at this company but really that
was somebody else's company that you just kind of put
your name on and you say that all you started
that company but really it didn't so you pat up
your [ __ ] resume so that's what exxon mobil
is doing just same basic thing how about the tobacco
companies denying all the the damage that their that their
that their products did of course large denial is is
a strategy number one for the ego how about have
you heard in the news these patent Wars that happen
between these giant corporations like Google Apple Samsung Oracle Microsoft
and so on what is that about these companies are
hoarding thousands of technology patents against each other and as
soon as one of them doesn't have enough patents to
outweigh the others then that one starts to sue it
and these patents can be because they're so broadly used
and billions and billions dollars at stake one of these
lawsuits can cost you five ten billion dollar massive amounts
of money there's so much money there so they got
teams of lawyers they've got teams of hundreds thousands of
lawyers these lawyers probably make millions of dollars a year
fighting over these gigantic cases all these patent Wars is
just like a cold war with patents with technology that's
what it is and these companies are buying up smaller
companies for their patents and all the sorts of stuff
what is that that's just ego collective ego but I'll
bet you this these fancy Harvard and Princeton and Yale
lawyers who get paid a million dollars a year for
fighting these cases and they were straight-a students they went
to school for dozens and dozens of years they're very
smart they're very intelligent you know I'm sure they're very
good at what they do and they think that they're
that they really understand what's going on in life but
they don't even see if they're participating in this collective
ego war which is really no different than to hordes
of barbarians fighting with each other it's really it's no
different or two to religious groups slaughtering each other in
a genocide it's no different no different at all and
these people are earning a good healthy profit every year
from this but are they conscious of their participation in
this larger dynamic no they're not because if they were
they would stop doing it how about lobbying that goes
on in the government our government of Mary Mueller is
completely corrupt with with the legalized bribery basically that's what
lobbying has turned into and of course that's what the
ego loves the ego loves to bribe somebody for a
favor love so you get special favors special treatment loves
to rig the rules that it's sewn favor all loves
that anything to destabilize the playing field that's all that
the ego is about it's all about destabilizing reality to
favor itself to favor its self-preservation and its expansion imagine
if the cancer cells inside of your body were able
to reprogram the epigenetics inside your body such that your
body would actually feed the cancer cells more uh-huh make
it grow even more that's exactly what's happening with this
with lobbying in America and it might lead to some
disastrous and results how about various kinds of philosophical and
ideological movements like pick up is popular today the pick
up movement the men's rights movement MOG child a mocktail
movement the red pill movement what is this about this
is pure [ __ ] ego that's all is pure
ego it's all about control how to control and manipulate
and create an ideology that makes you so blind to
your own selfishness and narcissism that you start to flow
your narcissism as though you're proud of it it's I
mean it's pure devilry is what that is how about
the new atheist movement this is exactly the same thing
just collective ego what is sam harris doing what is
Christopher Hitchens doing what does Bill Maher doing what does
Daniel Dennett do Laurens got these new atheists they think
they're so sophisticated is just another collective ego that's being
built up another ideology defending itself protecting itself writing books
it's not about truth is about promulgating this ideology of
course all under the clever disguise of being for the
truth and against the dogma and against the collective egos
of the religions see how tricky the ego is it's
a master of trickery it's it's a thing of beauty
how how much trickery there is the ego it's it's
really it's it's so it's so efficiently tricky it's tricky
in so many ways the multitudes of it streakiness are
are really something that only God could accomplish how about
have you watched this new documentary that I mentioned on
my forum All Shall mention on my blog about osho's
commune in Oregon it's really interesting documentary it's available on
Netflix go check it out it's pretty new but yeah
they talked about how this commune developed and Osho was
an enlightened master but then this commune of his develop
in Oregon and and you see all the shenanigans this
documentary the outline all the shenanigans all the stuff that
went wrong with the Kanye and it was a complete
disaster towards the very end it always survive for about
four or five years but it's really interesting all the
stuff that happened how it was all justified and all
the details of that crazy stuff crazy stuff but what
was that that was collective ego pure collective ego that's
why I think collapsed even though he himself was enlightened
which is why I say just because you're enlightened doesn't
mean you're immune Oh shoh suffered from this stuff even
though he was enlightened because even though he was individually
aware of his own ego and maybe he transcended that
maybe he didn't really transcend I don't know but um
but then he really didn't appreciate the problems with collective
ego that we're building up around him and his irresponsibility
and lack of consciousness than that in that area led
to some lesson some crazy crazy shenanigans how about online
communities are you a part of an online community maybe
a forum maybe a subreddit may be some sort of
yeah any online community political or non-political video games doesn't
matter what it is notice how much collective ego there
is within these online communities how much people fight and
debate and - flame wars about all this sorts of
nonsense and they use all the tricks of the ego
manipulation lying projection judgments I mean yada yada yada we've
mentioned them all already so that's the list of mechanisms
that's the list of examples let's take a quick intermission
here you don't go anywhere and I will be right
back all right let's talk now about the principles the
core principles of the collective ego principle number one is
that the number one priority of a group is always
to defend itself not truth but the opposite of truth
falsehood and the preservation of a boundary of separation fragmentation
is the number one priority of every group not the
truth not unconditional love not consciousness not goodness and benevolence
all of that isn't antithetical to ego so pragmatism always
prevails and in fact pragmatism is the chief vehicle for
delusion and egotism contrary to what many scientific and rational
people think they think that all well religion is so
impractical it's so philosophical and lofty if we just made
everything secular and highly pragmatic and materialistic and hard-nosed and
just strictly empirical that that would be the most truthful
way to live no not at all pragmatism is what
you're talking about science is pragmatism religion is also pragmatism
politics is pragmatism business is pragmatism capitalism is pragmatism it's
all about pragmatism and what's pragmatism is about it's all
about serving the ego that's what's pragmatic it's what's useful
for the ego survival and that's all the ego really
cares about now the more the ego evolves the more
it starts to open up to possibilities beyond pure pragmatism
which is why science and rationalism is not a solution
to any of these problems more science more rationalism more
materialism just leads to more pragmatism it does not get
you to truth another principle of collective ego is that
it's all about increasing control and leverage if you have
a free market which doesn't ever really exist but let's
just imagine the the libertarians ideal of free market free-market
capitalism what happens every party seeks maximum control and leverage
until some party's completely win out and dominate over all
the others that's what happens or at least that's what
happens if they all behave egotistical II forever without end
now of course in reality it doesn't quite happen that
way because actually the ego ends up eroding itself just
like a cancer so a cancer doesn't succeed in taking
over everything because if that happened reality would just be
monopolized by one ego and reality is designed in such
a way that seems like no one ego can get
a monopoly over absolutely everything but the ego will surely
try it will surely try until it is killed that's
its tendency and you can count on that you can
count on the ego to manipulate without any moral compunctions
or any compassion to service agenda and you can count
on the ego becoming blind to the collateral damage that
it creates which is the source of all evil if
you're concerned about evil you should be concerned about your
own ego and how you contribute with your ego to
the collective ego of all the groups that you are
part of and that will be the ultimate solution to
all the evil in the world principle number three is
that the consciousness level of the members of a group
basically determines the consciousness of the group so a corollary
is that if you want to improve the group if
your question is well Leo how do we use all
these ideas to improve our groups well you want to
make them more conscious and how do you make them
more conscious well that's a deep topic there's a lot
that can be said about that then I really don't
have time to go into here but just some clues
for you study how to make your self more conscious
struggle and fight with your own ego and as you
do that you will learn the patterns and the things
that raise your own individual consciousness and you can then
start to probably apply many of those techniques to group
dynamics now of course you could probably expect that group
dynamics will have additional factors because they're not completely identical
so in fact you could have an entire science if
you wanted to if universities were really open minded they
could actually develop an entire subfield of just studying how
to raise the consciousness of collective egos and that would
be of enormous practical value and benefit to mankind is
to do study a testing you do empirical testing not
theories not ideologies about what you think will work but
actually do empirical testing on groups of various kinds from
corporations to churches to governments to see what techniques actually
raises the consciousness of the group now of course raising
the individual members consciousness is perhaps the most direct way
for example if you took the entire country of Russia
and you forced everybody in that country to practice yoga
for five years that would raise the consciousness of the
entire country radically like radically the country would never be
the same again for the positive in that case of
course the fact that you're doing at a gunpoint would
be a problem in itself because that's not a conscious
behavior you can't consciously really force people to do that
but it's just a random example so that's something to
keep in mind especially if you're a leader inside of
an organization another principle of collective ego is that the
group will always resist the raising of its consciousness in
fact it will perceive the raising of its consciousness as
the greatest threat to its existence so not only will
the group not want to listen to your proposals for
how to raise the consciousness of the group but it
will actively attack you demonize you ostracize you and in
the most drastic scenarios kill you for attempting to do
this that's precisely where all evil comes from the resisting
of the raising of consciousness why is that because the
ego is an illusion it's based on falsehood to raise
consciousness is to bring more truth more light shine more
light on the shadow as you shine more light on
the shadow the shadow evaporates and disappears the shadow if
it wants to remain a shadow which is what's happening
here is gonna lash out and attack and resist the
light even though the light is the thing that could
happen to it but because it's ignorant because it is
the shadow because it is the devil because it is
the ego it misconstrues every attempt that is made to
help it which is why consciousness is very difficult to
teach you can only teach consciousness to people who are
on board with the program raising their consciousness and even
then it's still very tricky but if a person doesn't
want to listen to it no it's not going to
work they're gonna lash out at you in fact a
corollary principle is that you will experience ego backlash so
whether you're a teacher of consciousness or whether you're trying
to reform your school you're trying to reform your government
you're trying to reform your sports team you're trying to
reform your nonprofit organization or your religious group or whatever
you will experience massive resistance and you will experience backlash
you will make changes and improvements and then it will
collapse and slide back down to its original homeostasis and
so the process of improving an organization or a collective
ego is the same as improving an individual one it's
a sort of back and forth painful process it's two
steps forward one step backward and sometimes it's two steps
forward and three steps backward and then again you have
to start all over again and that's how it works
so don't get discouraged just like with yourself individually the
key is persistence and also the key is not not
making too much change too quickly if you introduce too
much change into a government what's gonna happen they're going
to throw you out that's if they're nice in many
places in the world they'll kill you if you introduce
too much change to a religion they'll kick you out
or in many places in the world they will kill
you this isn't a game this is life and death
this is not a game that's what people don't understand
about this I mean it is a game in a
certain sense but to the ego its survival is not
a game because its survival is this entire reason for
being so to it seriousness is defined relative to it
being able to survive so the eco will love to
laugh and make jokes and all this sort of stuff
as long as it's not threatened as soon as it's
threatened all the jokes and all the laughing quickly stop
[ __ ] gets real serious another principle of collective
ego is that it is always engaged in fragmentation and
splintering which is why if you study all these organizations
you always see fragmentation and splintering within all collective groups
so if you have a corporation and it becomes successful
what's gonna happen there's gonna be splinters off that corporation
people are gonna leave factions are gonna break out factions
will break out and start their own companies this sort
of stuff will happen if you have a religion or
a you you teach mysticism what's gonna happen eventually your
community is gonna split off and splinter and they're gonna
become adversaries that's happens with every religion every spiritual tradition
ever and it will continue to happen if you run
an online forum there's gonna be a tendency for that
forum to break off into factions if you run a
government there's gonna be secessionist movements and so on and
so forth because that's what the ego loves to do
it's fighting with itself it's always fragmented it's based upon
fragmentation it's sort of like I don't know if you
had like a chronic liar you would expect him to
lie all the time he's constantly lying you see and
the more he lies the more he has to lie
to maintain his lies well as the same way with
ego it starts as a fragment you're fragmenting reality and
then it has to keep fragmenting because that's sort of
its its modus operandi can't stop it can't help itself
another principle is that high consciousness groups outperform low consciousness
groups in the long run because it seems that the
more complicated you become as an organism you need to
start to notice your own shadow your own footprint otherwise
you're undercutting yourself in the foot a self-awareness and intelligence
is required to be able to live without for example
polluting your own environment like if you weren't fully conscious
let's say you were just like an animal who lived
in a cage and you would just keep booing and
pooing and pooing in your cage until your entire cage
filled up with poo and then you would die because
you would have any space to live anymore if we
just kept supplying you with food for example see the
animal has to be intelligent enough to see that its
own actions can lead to its own self-destruction so like
in the example of cancer if the cancer was really
intelligent and became self-aware it would see that oh I
can't just keep multiplying endlessly cuz I'm gonna kill the
host and that means I'm gonna kill myself oh that
means I have to moderate and balanced my activities I
have to be aware of my own reproduction rate and
control that develop some sort of discipline over that such
that I don't exhaust this host oh that would be
a much smarter way to survive whereas if I'm just
going to be a dumb cancer and I'm just gonna
multiply endlessly well I'm not gonna live very long I'm
gonna self-destruct low consciousness groups are defined by the following
list of characteristics they tend to be materialistic aggressive violent
dysfunctional neurotic at conflict with themselves tribal lacking innovation very
rigid very ideological anti-democratic untruthful manipulative coercive enslaving mechanical greedy
heartless abusive dogmatic thinking in the short term corrupt propagandistic
power-hungry and judgmental that's useful to know and you can
use that list to evaluate the level of consciousness of
any group and also any individual for that matter groups
have various degrees of consciousness just like individuals and it's
not just about having an ego or not having an
ego every single organization or group that we've been talking
about here must have an ego so don't fall into
the trap of thinking that ego is bad ego is
all evil no ego is necessary for a thing to
exist so you can't just completely get rid of ego
and live in some fantasy land not for an organization
now we've got enlightenment for individuals that's a whole nother
can of worms I'm not going to get into that
here but for organizations we're not talking about enlightenment so
organizations have different degrees of ego now the question is
how conscious is this ego how big of an ego
is that how condensed and contracted is it if it's
very very contracted and very condensed in the worst case
scenarios it's going to be extremely materialistic and utilitarian to
the extent of being violent and authoritarian and dictatorial and
just absolutely power-hungry and it's gonna slit everybody's throats that's
in the worst case scenario as it becomes more aware
of its surroundings it starts to play nicer as its
circle of awareness and sense of responsibility expands more and
more and more it loosens its grip and need to
control and it becomes less fearful less angry less power-hungry
it starts to surrender these things its surrendering itself to
reality the ego is getting thinner and thinner and thinner
and thinner and that's what we're aiming towards so I
want you to see that there's a there can be
big differences between groups and what their egos are for
example you can have the KKK which has a much
more contracted ego than something like the civil rights movement
and you can see that reflected in their thoughts in
their speech and in their actions how these people behave
but of course now you can break down the civil
rights movement into into different components of the civil rights
movement and you can see like Martin Luther King had
sort of one strand of civil rights movement which was
the more peaceful higher consciousness version and then someone like
Malcolm X had a more egotistical version of the civil
rights movement which was more aggressive more prone to violence
and more similar to the KKK see but overall the
civil rights movement was more conscious than the KKK and
you can do these sorts of comparisons for all sorts
of different corporations different governments you can see how conscious
are they take for example the Chinese communist regime versus
Tibet and sort of the hostile takeover of Tibet that
they did when communism was was was starting to flower
in China in that region in the 1950s and 60s
and 70s you know they China really oppressed Tibet why
is that because these Tibetan monks like the Dali Lama
many of them were very peaceful and there is very
spiritual and they not really interested in taking part in
this materialistic hierarchical authoritarian scheme that these communists the Chinese
Communists were running and that they're still running to this
day and so there's there's a fundamental clash between the
consciousness of the Tibetan monks and the unconsciousness of the
Chinese Communist government so of course there's going to be
a clash there at different levels so the the goal
here is not to criticize all the different stuff collectively
you see out there to say oh look look how
egotistical our government is look how egotistical the Communists are
look how he could take still the capitalists are and
the corporations on this that would be falling into the
trap of just more ego when you're doing now what
are you doing you're just judging you're falling into that
very same trap instead what you want to do is
you want to just mindfully observe observe these egos in
action in the same way that you observe your own
ego in action start to draw these parallels and connections
and then start to see what's really going on and
why it's going on and develop compassion for it rather
than judgment or anger and from that you learn and
from that you're in a much more resourceful position to
make changes you're really robbed of your power when you
start to try to make a change as a knee-jerk
reaction like what the alt-right is doing or what the
what the Nazis were doing or what the you know
any other any kind of group which is in an
ego backlash against something that they don't like something is
threatening their ego that's them playing the ego game what
needs to happen he to sort of rise above it's
not about taking sides it's not about saying oh yeah
the civil rights was great in the con and the
KKK was bad or the Chinese Communists they're evil in
the Tibetan monks they're all good no the Tibetan monks
also have ego as a community some of them might
be enlightened okay great but as a community they still
have ego and they still have a goa cabooses think
that they're innocent in all this they participate and they
in a sense they need to have an ego because
their ego is even though it's more evolved it's still
what helps them to survive they still need to have
a sense of boundary everything we've been talking about here
is especially important if you're a leader and if you're
doing this self-actualization process then you are a leader and
I hope you see yourself as one leadership is not
just about being some corporate Titan or some CEO or
some President of the United States or president of a
company you're a leader even inside your family inside your
relationships you're a leader inside your small social circle of
friends you're a leader at work and what leadership is
really about is raising the consciousness of the people around
you the best leaders are the ones that have the
most consciousness and are able to share and radiate that
consciousness to others around them in a way which is
productive and practical and doesn't put those people off so
judging people for not being conscious wouldn't make you a
very good leader a good leader would study techniques and
methods for how to embody consciousness him or herself radiate
that consciousness outwards in the face of all the selfishness
and evil that exists in the world and have enough
strength to to stand to stand through all that and
to insist on the truth and to spread the truth
and to help people become more conscious and that's your
job as a leader that's your job inside of a
family that's your job inside of your marriage that's your
job with your children that's your job at work that's
your job in your political party that's your job as
a citizen of this nation or whatever nation you're part
of or whatever committee you're sitting on and that's what
we really need to transform the world is we need
more conscious leaders who first master their own consciousnesses embody
that but then also learn how to help other people
embody that it's one thing to be able to embody
it yourself that's a key step you can't over overlook
that step you need that you cannot be a conscious
leader just by preaching to people but not being conscious
yourself the consciousness of your followers or the people around
you that you influence can only rise as high as
your own level of consciousness that's important to remember so
that means you got to raise your own consciousness and
that's for example why over the last year or two
with actualised org I could have released like I've been
working on a course or two that I wanted to
release and you know courses for me are great because
they earn me good money and so if I was
purely focused on money I would be pumping out courses
non-stop that makes me really good sums of money compared
to just releasing free videos instead what I did is
I put almost all of my focus into deepening the
free videos over the last two years which you can
probably notice there's been a pretty big shift and also
into working on myself on my own personal consciousness that's
taken up an enormous amount of time I've probably lost
over a million dollars in the last two years just
as an opportunity cost by choosing to work on myself
rather than working on my business to maximize the profits
of my business because I wanted to raise my own
consciousness because I know that to lead you and to
help you to become as conscious as you can be
I myself need to be more conscious because I can
see in the way that I interact with all these
people and like everything I do I'm very conscious of
the limitations of my own levels of consciousness you see
and that's what you want to to start to become
aware of so invest in yourself but then investing in
yourself alone is not enough you also then need to
teach yourself learn the techniques study the books takes the
courses you know whatever do the experimentation the trial and
error to learn how do you help other people raise
their consciousness and then you will truly combine your own
success and growth with also contributing in the right way
to society and so now imagine what would happen if
we taught people all over the world how to do
that in every culture that's how you create real change
not by demonizing and nitpicking and criticizing that doesn't work
when you do that people get defensive that doesn't help
them to raise their consciousness what I have for you
to really bring all this home and to get the
rubber to meet the road is I have a worksheet
I haven't done one of these in a while this
is a really good juicy in-depth worksheet it's gonna be
here i opening for you and it's gonna take everything
we've talked about and and apply it to your own
personal life so it's a free worksheet you'll find the
link down below go click it download it spend some
time seriously contemplating and filling it out you'll get a
lot of benefit and growth from that and the last
thing I'll tell you is just what do you do
with this stuff that we've talked about you just start
observing it in a non-judgmental way all around you sort
of like you're just a scientist just studying this phenomenon
and start making the connections between what's happening collectively and
what's happening within you individually and what you'll start to
notice is that as you work on yourself as you
start doing yoga start doing meditation start doing self inquiry
you start cleaning up your diet you start becoming more
mindful of how you relate to human be all the
sorts of stuff starts to happen you start to put
your own life together you become more conscious you're gonna
start to see oh yeah it's hard to do that
no wonder people aren't doing this it's hard it's emotionally
difficult it's scary it's it brings up emotions and anger
and frustration all this OH could that be why our
government is corrupt for those exact same reasons could that
be why corporations are corrupt because they're also afraid because
it's also scary for them because they also have basic
needs they need to satisfy because they're also addicted to
things like money and power in the same ways that
I am and then you develop more compassion more understanding
if all these conversations were having are making you more
angry and bitter about the world you're doing it completely
wrong when you do this properly at first it's a
bitter sting of the truth it stings because your illusions
and fantasies are shattered and you learn how little you
really know and you see how ignorant you really are
and you see how ignorant everyone else is around you
and that can be a little depressing sometimes but you
also start to see that you have a lot of
potential and room for growth and that starts to get
you hopeful and then you start doing these practices and
you grow and grow and grow and and then you
see the potential and you see all the incredible potential
you see just how amazing our economy could be how
amazing our government can be how amazing our corporations can
be how amazing your fam all these things you see
all the potential and then you see that reality as
we currently know it and I mean it's pretty good
unless you're really living in in some in some [
__ ] as Donald Trump says it's pretty good it's
pretty good 21st century society even in the [ __
] areas of the world is still pretty good way
better than what it was 2,000 years ago for example
2,000 years ago in ancient Rome 45% of the Roman
population were enslaved so it's pretty good but then you
start to see the potential you start to see where
the human race will be in a thousand years and
ten thousand years it completely blows your mind the potential
is incredible then you get excited then you see that
you have potential to contribute to that and in fact
that's why you were born in the first place is
to contribute to become conscious to become a leader to
to develop a life purpose around this to customize it
to to your way of wanting to interact with reality
and then you build your entire life around that and
you align that with your life purpose and then your
self-actualization your ear your personal growth also becomes about growth
of the whole community and then that inspires you and
that motivates you and you've got so much motivation so
many ideas that you you would need many lifetimes to
actualize them all and that's where we need human beings
to be that's where you need to be that's the
ultimate vision of what we're doing here with actual eyes
not organ we're bringing all these pieces together and one
of the things we're doing is we're we're we're turning
ourselves into responsible citizens one of the reasons that our
governments are so dysfunctional and corrupt is because our citizenry
is so ignorant and so unconscious and so poorly educated
and of course that's not an accident the government doesn't
educate you for very good reason our Education Department is
being dismantled in the United States right now why is
that because that's how the devil works the ego works
to destroy or sabotage any mechanisms which might ultimately lead
to its undoing so what the ego or the devil
is gonna do is it's gonna go for the light
source and it's gonna try to sabotage the light source
because the shadow is afraid of the light so the
the devil runs around with a hammer breaking all the
light bulbs that's basically what's happening and that's what the
that's what what the Trump administration basically is Trump is
a walking narcissistic ego and all the people that he's
appointing to power are just basically devils with hammers that
are trying to try to break these lightbulbs now I'm
not saying this to to pick on him to demonize
him I'm not saying this from a position of bitterness
or anger I'm just talking about a general dynamic of
how ego works it's not about Trump it's not personal
if you're a fan of Trump I mean I'm sure
you're gonna think that I'm biased and that I'm liberal
and all the sorts of stuff but no we're just
talking about consciousness here these are meta dynamics way beyond
any kind of political debates it's not about being a
democrat or republican talking about something much much larger so
there's a lot here I can I hope you can
see how much juiciness there is to this topic so
much detail and I'm only still showing you the ice
tip of the iceberg I want you to follow up
on all this and continue studying these examples start coming
up with your own examples too to fill in the
gaps I sort of painted this with broad strokes now
fill in the fine details and all the minutiae it's
gonna start to blow your mind you're gonna start to
see the matrix of reality that you're in and that
will be a little disconcerting at first but also very
very empowering in the very end and in the very
end you can transform yourself into new individual who really
makes a positive difference in the world all right that's

amazing topics one set of topics that I want to
turn my attention to in the future is talking more
about social dynamics how different social systems work we're going
to be talking more in more depth about politics about
economics about leadership and we're talking a lot more about
spiral dynamics I have one episode about spiral dynamics which
you should definitely watch that will really help you to
understand levels of consciousness and collective enforces individual egos that's
very important it's a very important model to learn but
there's so much to that model that I probably want
to shoot an episode in the future one episode per
stage of the spiral dynamics model so I'm probably gonna
shoot an episode about stage Lew stage orange stage green
stage yellow and stage turquoise that's five stages those are
the most important ones to talk about so we can
talk about in depth what every stage is what its
limitations are how to outgrow it and also in general
I want to talk more about how to take spiral
dynamics and apply it more practically in your everyday life
for growth so I'm not sure when that's coming but
I definitely am excited to do that in the future
so stay tuned for that and much more you
