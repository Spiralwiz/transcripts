Hey, what's up? This is Leo for actualised.org here, and
today I want to talk about the idea of resistance.
And resistance robs you of a lot of your potential,
even if you are already super motivated. So what is
resistance? Well, I like to make an analogy between mental
resistance and electrical resistance. So electrical resistance we know of
as the tendency of a conductor to not want to
have current flow through it. So obstruction of current through
an electrical wire would be electrical resistance. Whereas the risks
I'm talking about the self development type of resistance, is
your resistance, your minds resistance towards thoughts and ideas, and
ultimately, actions. Because what you think and what you believe,
and what your ideas are your concepts, your inner game
is going to influence the kind of actions that you're
able to carry out in your life. So what are
some things that you might be resisting? Well, how about
that big project at work that's due in two weeks,
or washing the dishes, or doing your homework, or having
that conversation that you need to have with your loved
one, or going Christmas shopping two weeks before Christmas, rather
than waiting till the last day, or how about doing
your taxes, or sending your resume off to another company,
or maybe going to the dentist, even though you're afraid
to so all these things you can be resistant to
so the thing that is really interesting and kind of
pernicious thing about resistance, is that it's worse with the
things that you really actually want to be doing. So
this is something I've noticed in myself, is that I
set goals for myself, I tend to think of myself
as a high achiever. I think people out there that
are high achievers have this problem where you set a
goal for yourself, and you create a lot of shoulds
and musts for yourself. So these are things that you
have to do, maybe you have to go to the
gym, maybe you have to eat cleaner, maybe you have
to do better at work, maybe you have to make
10 phone calls a day, if you're a marketer, or
sales salesperson over the phone, you know, whatever it is,
there are things that on the one hand you want.
And on the other hand, you simultaneously resist. And here's
the trick with resistance resistance happens, because you are creating
imperatives for yourself. So think of yourself as having a
higher self and a lower self. And your higher self
is like the adult. So it knows what you need
to be doing. It knows all the right things that
should be happening. And it knows everything that's good for
you. And then your lower self is that part of
you that wants to stay in your comfort zone, that
part of you that likes security, that doesn't like taking
risks. And so it's like the kid, so it's the
kid and adult relationship between your higher and lower self.
And here's the problem is that when an adult comes
up to a kid, and if you if you tell
your kids to not do something, a lot of times,
what are they going to do, they're gonna immediately just
resist whatever you're telling them. And they're going to do
the exact opposite just to be contrarian, just almost to
spite you, even if what you say makes sense to
them, even if what you say is good advice. How
many times have you done that when your parents gave
you advice? I know I have. It's just, I think
a natural human tendency to kind of shy away from
and not want to do the things that we're being
forced to do. Whereas if we're giving options, and we're
given options to choose, then we're much more likely to
to have the drive to do it. The thing is
that you do this to yourself too. So even though
you have the option to work at the job that
you are currently working at, or you have the option
to go to the gym or not. That is that
if you're if you're really punishing and repressing that lower
self of yours, ironically, what you're doing is you're hurting
your results. Because what's happening is that you might be
moving forward in your diet or in your business or
whatever it is that you're doing, you might be moving
forward in that thing, you might be getting some decent
results, but you're probably also feeling a lot of frustration.
It might feel like a grind. And the reason it
feels that way is because you're you're feeling that resistance.
And now this this is such a pernicious thing. It
can pervade any aspect of your life because you can
literally develop resistance toward anything. You can develop resistance towards
any of the things we already talked about, you can
develop resistance towards personal development, which is something that I've
struggled with. And what I want to talk about here
is how to manage this is how to understand it
and give you some tools for actually reducing it, eliminating
it completely if you master some of these tools, and
they're pretty simple. So, one really good example of this
is, of course, going to the gym. You know, there's
always that crowd around New Year's time, like January 1
through January 15, those first two weeks of the gym.
So if you're a gym regular, you know that it's
funny that gym gets so PAC, it's like this throng
of a New Year's resolution, people come in, and they're
all eager to get on the treadmills and start lifting
weights and the gym is packed, the parking lot is
so full, you can't even park if you're a regular,
you get a bit frustrated by that. But when I
see that I can't help but kind of grin and
chuckle because I know that most of those people 90%
of them, I probably won't see in two weeks, just
because they've got that burst of initial motivation, and then
it's all going to drop off. And they're gonna get
develop a lot of resistance towards it. And you know,
the fact is that, you know, even being on the
opposite side of the fence, I go to the gym
regularly. So I've been going to the gym for like
seven years straight now. And even even though I think
I developed a pretty strong habit of it. A lot
of times, I shouldn't say a lot of times, but
there are periods like weeks within the year where I
really don't want to go to the gym, I really
struggle with it, I have to pull myself, physically pull
myself to the gym, and come up with all sorts
of excuses, why not to go and sometimes I don't,
sometimes I don't, and I come and I give in
to that lower self. And I stay in and I
veg out on the couch or whatever. But the fact
is that that's a great example for how resistance works
is that you, you tell yourself, this is something you
should do, initially. And then when you get a little
bit frustrated with the lack of results, you tell yourself,
god dammit, no, this is something I'm doing something I
have to do. And then from that point on, you
have this very stern discipline about it. So you're always
telling yourself, I have to get to the gym by
a certain by certain hour. If I don't make it,
I'll punish myself by doing X, Y and Z. And
it's this harsh kind of discipline, which might get you
some initial results, it's certainly better than being a slacker
not doing anything. And just being lazy, or not even
being conscious about your health. But it's not the best
way to get the best results. Because in the end,
there's too much, there's too much struggle there, wouldn't you
ideally want to be going to the gym with a
certain ease and a certain flow, where you're happy to
go there, you want to go there, you're enjoying it,
and you don't feel like there's any sort of grind
involved? Well, that's where eliminating resistance really comes into play.
So the best way that I found to eliminate resistance,
there are a couple of ways I'm going to share
with you really, I'm going to share two ways here.
One of them is dead simple. And it might actually
be the best way. And the second way is the
one's a little bit more involved. And that's what I'm
gonna start with. And it's called the Sedona Method. Now,
the Sedona Method is great for releasing all sorts of
emotions, so you can use it on anger, frustration, sadness,
loneliness, all that kind of stuff. But right now, we're
just going to limit Sedona Method, particularly to dealing with
resistance. So with resistance, the way the Sedona Method works
is like this. First of all, Sedona Method tells us
that you're going to develop resistance to anything that you're
telling yourself, you must do. So if you're putting a
lot of pressure on yourself. And the way to eliminate
that is to go through this little process, it's a,
it's like a four step process that you go through,
it's a mental process, you do it in your head,
it takes just a couple of minutes to do. And
what it does is it removes the emotional blocks that
you have with that resistance. Because resistance is not a
conceptual thing. Resistance is a feeling when I'm talking about
resistance, this is something that you feel very, very deeply,
like in your body when you're resisting something. So let's
say you're sitting there on the couch, and you know
that it's time to go to the gym, it's your
usual time, you should be getting up right now putting
on your gym clothes and heading in. Well, now, if
you're resistant to it, if this is something that you've
been struggling with, then the way it's going to feel
to you is it's going to feel like this heavy
tension in your body. It's gonna be like, oh, man,
I really don't want to do that. Like why does
it have to be so difficult? Why is it always
so frustrating? Why me, it's this kind of victimization that
you have. And ultimately, it leads to a lot of
frustration also leads to guilt. Because what happens is when
you're feeling that kind of resistance, and you're on that
verge, where you can go, you can slide one way
or the other so you can kind of side with
your higher self or your lower self. When you side
with your higher self. You're going to go to the
gym, and you're going to do your workout, but you're
also going to have a lot of struggle and frustration
while you're doing it. So it's going to feel very
labored. If you side with your lower self, what's gonna
happen is you're gonna not go to the gym in
this case, and you're gonna feel very guilty about it.
Right because You're always your Higher Self still is there,
it's still telling you, I should have gone, the next
day you might still be, you might still be feeling
bad for not having gone the other day. And over
time, if you develop this kind of negative habit of
siding with your lower self, you get into more and
more guilt, you get into more and more frustration. And
it really becomes difficult to actually do stuff that you
want to do. It robs you of a lot of
your potential. So this is where Sid, is going to
really come in and help you. So what is the
data method? Like I said, it's really an inner game
tool. And it's a series of questions that you want
to ask yourself. Now why I was talking about resistance
being a feeling is because Sedona Method works with feelings.
So what you want to do, to try this method
out, is, is very simple. You want to first of
all step one is you want to get in touch
with your feeling of resistance. So in this case, let's
say you're sitting on the couch, and you're you're looking
to go out to the gym, and you're kind of
on that cusp of which way do I side? Do
I go? Or do I not go? Man, I really
don't want to go. But on the other hand, man,
I really, I really gotta go, or I'm going to
regret it tomorrow. So get in touch with that feeling
and really feel it. So don't try to run away
from it. Just let it kind of soak into your
body. That's step one. So you're feeling it now. Good.
Step two Sedona Method is you're going to ask yourself
a question. This is all the questions that you ask
in Sedona are silent questions. So you're just talking in
your head, basically. And the question that you ask there
is, could I let this go? Could I let this
feeling go? And you're going to ask yourself that question,
and I want you to really think about it, and
ponder that. And ask yourself, if you were really pinned
down if I had a gun to your head right
now, and I said, you have to let go of
this feeling of resistance? Or I'm going to pull that
trigger? Would you be able to let it go? Now
this is kind of a yes or no Yes or
No? Question. So that's how you answer you. Either you
answer with a yes. Or you answer with a no,
either answer is fine. But make sure that you really
think through it, because the point of Sedona is that
it's asking you these questions, and it wants you to
come up with the answers. And as you come up
with the answers, you're gonna experience a release of emotion
and release a feeling. So in this case, like one
little trick that I like to do, is I like
to think when I ask this question, I like to
think to myself, you know, if I was a master
Jedi, or if I was a Zen Buddhist monk, or
maybe I was a Greek, stoic, could I just let
this feeling of going to the gym go? After all,
it's just like, it's a pretty, pretty petty feeling. If
you think about it, right? We're talking about going to
the gym, what is that in the grand scheme of
things? Not really very significant? Could I just let that
go? And what I find is that I almost always
come up with the answer. Yes. And I think if
you rehearse this, this process, you're gonna have to try
it out a couple of times. If you rehearse the
if you rehearse, and you really think about it, your
answer to that first question, could I let this feeling
go? is always going to be yes. And and that's
good. So you just say that to yourself, and then
you go on to step number two. Now, if you're
so resistant, if you're so caught up in these emotions
and these feelings of not wanting to go to the
gym, that you can't imagine a possible scenario where you
could let that feeling go than answer no, by all
means. Don't fake your way through these through these questions.
And what you'll find is that that is also actually
going to lead to a reduction of feelings, because you're
acknowledging the fact that you want to hold on to
this resistance. The fact of the matter is, is that
you always have the option to let it go. Sometimes
you're just much more caught up and identified with your
emotions than other times. So sometimes it's easy to let
it go, sometimes it's hard to let it go. But
with Sedona, this is a process that you can go
through that's almost always going to guarantee that you're going
to get a reduction in the strength of the feelings
and the emotions, even if you're resisting using Sedona, so
just plow through it. So that was step number one.
Step number two, will actually look back up. Step number
one was just feeling the emotion. Step number two was
asking yourself, How could I let this go? Step number
three now is asking yourself the silent question. Would I
like to let it go? So this is a slightly
different question. Here. What we're asking is really, what are
you? What would you like to do you know that
you could let it go if you wanted to, but
that's still not the same thing as actually wanting to
let it go. So let's say you said Yeah, if
I was, if I was Obi Wan Kenobi, I could
let this resistance go. Now we're asking yourself ourselves, if
now that we know now that I have recognized that
I can let it go in theory, do I actually
want to let it go in practice? And that another
way to phrase that quote Question is like this? Do
I want to stay identified with this emotion of resistance?
Or do I want to be at peace? Would I
rather be disturbed by this emotion? or would I rather
be impenetrable? And that's a choice. So actually ask yourself
this, which, which of those two would you want to
side with? And again, if you really think it through,
usually you're going to come up with the answer. Yes.
And, of course, it's still possible that you might come
up with the answer, no. And that will happen when
you've got a really strong emotion if you're very resistant
to something. So let's say you did say, No, that's
still perfectly acceptable, it's still going to lead to a
reduction in the feeling. So that was step number three,
right? You ask yourself, would I like to let this
go? And the final step, step number four, is to
ask yourself, when would I like to let this go?
So here, this is pretty easy. If you've answered yes
to the first two, then you're gonna just weren't going
to want to ask yourself. Now I recognize that I
can let it go. And now I've made a decision
that I would rather be imperturbable rather than being disturbed
by this emotion. So I've made the choice to let
it go. And now the question is, when? So the
best answer is right now, right? Because why stay bothered
by something that that is that is hindering you for
longer than you have to, and you can always let
go immediately. So there's no, there's never any reason to
hold on to something unless you want to. So if
you said that you don't want to hold on to
it, then make a decision as to when you want
to stop holding on. So usually, the best answer is
right now. You can also answer no, you know, you
could say, I'm not, I'm not ready to let go
of this right. Now I'm gonna hold on to it,
you probably won't say it like that, you'll probably just
say, No, it's impossible to let this go. And that's
fine. That means you're just very, very identified with that
emotion. So stay that way. Even with the answer of
never, even if you answer, never, I'm never letting this
go, That guy screwed me over. Whatever I have to
get to the gym, I have to be at a
certain weight by certain by a certain day of the
month or other shoot myself, whatever it is, if you're
that committed to it, then you're probably going to say
never, I'm never going to let it go. Fine. Stay
with that. So you're gonna go through those steps, one
through four, and you're gonna find that each of those
steps that you go through is going to lead to
a slight reduction in the intensity of your resistance. And
that is going to complete one cycle of the Sedona
Method. Now, the trick is that you have to run
this cycle multiple times on every instance of resistance that
comes up for you. The nice thing about it, though,
is that once you do run it a couple times,
you're going to substantially reduce that resistance. And a lot
of times those gains are permanent. So this is not
something that you have to do forever for the rest
of your life. But it's something that you're gonna get
immediate results from. So it might take two minutes to
run through this through through the full process. Now the
full process is going to take, typically, I like to
say four cycles. If you just take what I what
we went through right here, those four questions, those are
one cycle. So you just complete that one cycle, and
then you immediately go back in and you start again.
So by starting again, I mean, again, you ask yourself,
Okay, what am I feeling right now about going to
the gym, okay? I have some lingering resistance, let's say
I have 90% of that original resistance left, okay, so
you want to identify with it, get it, get a
feeling for it in your body, get a sense of
why don't want to go to the gym, and then
go right into the next question, go into the first
question, which is, could I let this go? Then go
to the second question. Would I let this go? And
then go to the third question, when would I like
to let this go. And so that completes cycle two,
then you go through and you do cycle three, and
then you do like a four. So you go through
a four times every cycle that you go through, you're
gonna notice, maybe a subtle, maybe a great reduction in
the resistance, it might take one or two cycles to
really take the bite out of that emotion. On the
other hand, it might take five, maybe six cycles, and
maybe you have to do do it a couple times
throughout the day, as this resistance is coming up for
you, but eventually, you'll notice that you get substantial reduction.
Now, this is a technique, a mental technique that you
can use to work on your emotions, to release emotions,
specifically with resistance. And like all techniques, it's a tool.
So you're gonna find that when you start using it,
you're Gonna be rusty. And there's going to be some
common common problems that you can make using Sedona, which
actually, I've gone through and I've detailed more in depth
in the article, I don't want to do that right
now on video. So be sure to read through those
common common pitfalls that people experienced with Sedona. But I
guess the two points that I really want to stress,
the couple of points that I want to stress about
that is, number one, give it a chance, it sounds
kind of hokey science kind of new age and silly
that you know, you can have an emotion and then
you can just let it go. Before you are too
quick to judge a book by its cover. In this
case, I really want to urge you to try it
out. Because like everybody else, I think that encounters this
method. At first, it seems so simplistic, that there's no
way that it could work. And there's no way that
it can work for serious problems. Fact is that I've
tried it, I was skeptical at first. But once you
use it, you use it for days for a few
for a few days, use it on a couple of
problems, and you use it for a few weeks, then
you maybe use it for a month, you start to
really notice the effects, and you start to see how
powerful it really is it kind of blows your mind.
So definitely give it a shot. Don't be too judgmental
about it at the outset. The other point that I
want to make is go through all the cycles. So
there's this tendency, at least I had this tendency of
where I went through one cycle, and then I expected
this immediate release, and I didn't get it. And then
what happened is I tended to cast judgment on the
method, I said, Nah, this, this is nonsense, the Sedona
stuff doesn't work, it's a bunch of BS. And what
you have to do is you really have to go
through it three or four times, three or four times
is enough that you actually are going to start to
feel a reduction in, in in that resistance. So what's
literally gonna happen is, you're gonna not be able to
do that step number one, right, because step number one
instead of what it asks you to, to identify with
the feeling. And what happens is, when you go through
each cycle, that feeling is going to dissipate to the
point where you go through maybe three or four cycles,
and then you try to maybe go into that fifth
cycle, and it's almost going to be impossible, because you're
not gonna be able to do that first step, that
first step is telling you to identify with the feeling,
but that feeling is gone, because you've gradually knocked it
down. And what you're going to find yourself doing is
actually going to find yourself struggling to get into step
one, once you get you know, very, very adept at
using Sedona, you're going to find it, you're gonna find
it a struggle, because you're like, Okay, I want to
do one more cycle, let me do a fifth cycle.
And you're gonna find that it's hard because at this
point, the feeling, you only have a vague memory of
it. It's only an abstraction, it's not a real feeling,
it doesn't have that hold over you that it used
to have. So those are some of the some of
the very common kind of caveats that I'll give for
using Sedona. I really encourage you to try this technique
out, because it's so powerful, it will let you get
through your frustrations and unleash unblock some of those some
of those grindy areas in your life. So think about
it right now. You know what, what parts of your
life? Are you encountering a lot of struggling? Is it
maybe at work? Is that maybe with your diet? And
how you're eating? Is it maybe with gym, like we
talked about? Is it maybe with developing a certain skill
set within yourself? Maybe you want to become a better
public speaker? Maybe you want to learn stand up comedy,
maybe whatever it is that you want to do? Are
you resisting that? Where Where else could you have kind
of a grind in your life, think about that, it's
going to be very palpable, chances are you're probably going
to pinpoint a couple of areas. And this applies, it's
gonna apply to anything. In fact, one place where it
most definitely applies is actually with Sedona Method itself. One
common problem with Sedona is that you can tend to
have resistance towards actually using Sedona to remove resistance from
other things. So just like anything else, you can develop
a resistance towards something, when you tell yourself that you
have to do it. So if you tell yourself right
now, after watching this video that I'm gonna go and
use Sedona from now on and everything and then I
have to use Sedona all the time, and I have
to be perfect at it. You're gonna put a lot
of pressure on yourself. And actually, that's going to create
some some backwards momentum, it's going to hold you back.
So watch out for that. And what's the solution there?
Well, you can actually use Sedona Method to release on
having resistance to the Sedona Method, kind of an interesting
little catch 22 How you can do that. So definitely
watch out for that. Once you have acquainted yourself with
Sedona and you find yourself using it and then it's
working well for you. Watch out for that resistance because
it'll probably creep up for you the way it did
for me. Beyond Sedona Method, what else do I want
to say about resistance? I think as actually writing the
article below, reading this article on resistance, you know, I
went through all the points that I wanted to make,
I wrote it out. And then I had kind of
an epiphany while I was meditating, I had this epiphany
that a lot of the stuff in my life would
go a lot smoother, and I would actually get a
lot better results at it, if I took the pressure
off of myself for having to do it, too, the
problem is, I tend to put a lot of pressure
on myself to be self developed. And I put a
lot of pressure on myself to learn and to improve
every day, and to get a certain amount of work
done every day, and to hit the gym and, and
to eat well, so a lot of pressure on being
perfect, and on getting success and being being getting achievement
in life. And what I find is that intuitively, you
tend to rationalize it to yourself, your high achiever at
least, that putting more pressure on yourself is going to
lead to more results, more success, right. So you kind
of tend to whip and sell flagellate to get yourself
going to get yourself motivated. But this epiphany that I
had was that I kind of realized I'm like, Oh,
shit, that's self flagellation, that I'm doing all the time.
I mean, it works to some extent, but it's starting
to backfire on me, because I'm noticing that I'm having
difficulty going to the gym. And even though I'm going
and I'm still getting decent results, I'm starting to resent
it, and I'm starting to hate it. And that animosity
that's building up over time, that's not a healthy thing.
And I don't know how sustainable that is, eventually, it
might lead to me quitting the gym. So in that
case, like I really realized how I was about that.
That push that I was making to be successful, was
not serving me as well, as if I just kind
of let things breathe. Now, the scary thing about letting
things breathe is that you'll tend to tell yourself that,
well, if I just let this go, if I'm not
disciplined, then I'll just be a couch potato, I'm going
to slack off on it, put all that weight back
on. And so that's a little bit tricky. And that
might be true, actually, at first, is that that very
harsh discipline that you have that might be holding you
in place right now. But see, sometimes you have to
take a step backwards, before you can move forwards. And
that's kind of the case here is that you might
need to actually be able to sacrifice slacking off at
the gym a little bit. So that you can rebound
and get back on the horse. This is what I
found is that usually, when I'm when I'm developing, when
I'm developing mastering something, when I'm becoming good at something,
the way it happens is not through just a constant,
beating myself up and whipping myself into shape. What happens
is that initially, I'm lazy about it or I'm negligent,
then I have to use a lot of discipline. So
I kind of swing my pendulum to the other side
where I'm very harsh with myself. And then I find
that that gets me some decent results. But then I
find that I've gone a little too far and that
there's too much resistance, and too much grind involved with
everything. So I tend to swing the pendulum the other
way, even though I'm afraid, I finally swing my pendulum
the other way. And I say fine, I'll just go
back to being lazy again. And then you go back
to being lazy. And then you do that for a
little bit. And you're like, you know what I don't,
this lazy thing doesn't work for me either. So now
you have a choice. Now you could swing your pendulum
again, to the totally opposite side and use a lot
of harsh discipline. Or you have the choice of saying
yourself, hmm, okay. So laziness doesn't work, the harsh discipline
stuff tends to backfire. It's not sustainable for forever. So
there must be a happy balance somewhere. And you tend
to find something in between that works well for you.
And you tend to actually get the best results when
you're in that middle zone. Because you're first of all,
you're recognizing that you have two sides, you have your
higher self and you have your lower self. And they
both have legitimate concerns, the higher self cannot always just
dominate the lower self, that will backfire. And then again,
of course, the lower self can always win over the
higher self, because then you're not achieving, you're feeling guilty.
You're not living your potential. You're really not sharing your
gifts with the world. And you're not being who you
could really be. So those that's a good way that
I like to think about resistance is just it's actually
letting go of it is actually important for your results,
even though in the short term, you might suffer a
little bit. So really ask yourself the question, are you
more concerned about the short term gains, or are you
more more interested in getting a very stable solid law?
Long term improvement, or achievement or whatever it is that
you're doing, like really locking that in. So if you're
going to the gym, wouldn't it be awesome to, to
get rid of that yo yo that you have where
one week you love it, the next week you hate
it when the next week you love it the next
week you hate, it wouldn't be nice to kind of
even that out and just have a smooth and steady
habit. And it's not something that you're really forcing yourself
to do. But it's something that you enjoy. I think
that's, that's one of my goals, with everything that I
do is to start to really see that I have
a lot of areas in my life where I'm doing
that up and down, up and down. And I want
to smooth that out. And that's gonna get me much
better results. Another point about resistance, I have some notes
here that I'm using, because there's such a long article.
And there's a lot of good stuff here. What you
really don't want to do is avoid your feelings when
you run away from your struggles. Ironically, that tends to
it's kind of like sweeping a problem under the rug,
it tends to fester. And it tends to just go
rancid and stink and comes back to you in the
end. So in the short term that might be a
good good solution is to just kind of stick your
head in the sand, not look at you're not looking
at resistance, not look at your problems. But a long
run, it's not very good. In fact, a very good
way of removing a lot of resistance in your life
is just allowing yourself to feel whatever it is that
you're feeling. So let's say you're resistant right now about
going to the gym. The thing that really makes that
resistance bad. If you if you kind of toy around
with this for a while, you'll realize that what makes
it so awful is the fact that you're actually resisting
the resistance. You're not allowing yourself to feel bad. You
can feel bad about something and be accepting of it.
And you can also feel bad about something and resisting
when you feel bad. And you tell yourself, man, why
do I feel so bad, this is not the way
life is supposed to be I'm not supposed to feel
bad, I'm supposed to feel good all the time. That's
a surefire way of really creating heavy heavy resistance for
yourself. So a great method. If you're, for example, resisting
going to the gym is just saying you know what?
I'm feeling shitty right now. Because the other day I
was having problems with going to the gym a few
days before that I skipped a few days. And I'm
probably gonna go in today, it's not going to be
so great. And right now I'm sitting here I'm struggling,
it's really a struggle to decide whether I'm gonna stay
in or what I'm gonna go out. I don't know,
it might go either way. I feel a little bit
drained of energy, a little drain on willpower. So I
can't even trust myself to make the high kind of
the high consciousness, the higher self decision, I might have
to side with my lower self, and I don't want
to do that. But you know what? That's okay. See,
I'm accepting of it in that case, whereas, and that
dissipates a lot of resistance counter intuitively. Whereas, intuitively, what
you would want to do is you'd want to say,
No, this was this is horrible, I'm going to get
rid of resistance by using the Sedona Method, and resistance
is never going to come up for me again, I
should always feel awesome. If you take that route, well,
you can kind of see what's going to happen is
that you're gonna set expectations for yourself that are not
realistic, first of all. And second of all, you're just
not acknowledging the fact that matter that there is this,
this seesaw effect going on, and that it's okay, to
be resistant. At times, the best way to get out
of resistance is just to accept that you have resistance,
and then it sort of fixes itself. Kind of interesting.
So you make things a lot worse, by by kind
of egging yourself on, and setting up a lot of
high expectations for yourself. So I mentioned that there were
two methods here for removing resistance. I really went in
depth on Sedona Method, I think it's an excellent tool,
I definitely encourage you to try it out. And then
just accepting of your resistance. You can accept your resistance
by asking a question of yourself such as, could I
allow myself to feel resistant right now, that's really kind
of an extension of Sedona. They're very, they're very subtle
ways that you can do Sedona that I'll cover in
the future in other articles. But I did start off
by saying that there is one other way and in
fact, I said that maybe it's the best. Well, the
best way that I know how to get rid of
resistance is just through action. It's very simple. I call
it the JUST DO IT method. I mean, ultimately, it's
sometimes I just think that all of self development can
be involved self help or self development, it just be
boiled down to one thing, which is just just do
it, you know, whatever it is you need to do
just do that, do that frequent thing, and you won't
have any problems. Of course, easier said than done, right.
So the great thing about the JUST DO IT method
is that you don't need a lot of you don't
need a lot of thinking, if you're the kind of
person that doesn't like to think and rationalize everything and
dissect everything and analyze the way that I do, well,
then just pure action might be the best thing for
you, and just kind of kicking yourself into gear, and
literally forcing yourself to take action. A lot of times,
that's, that's the best way to solve all your problems
in life is through action, right? Sometimes, if you think
there if you sit down and think you can think
yourself into a pit of despair, and sometimes it's hardest
hard to think your way out of out of a
hole, much easier to climb your way out just by
starting to climb. Here's the thing with the, with the
with the JUST DO IT method is that as simple
as it is, it's also highly effective. And the way
that I the way that I really use it is,
you know, you literally can use your body to get
your mind into motion. So the way that uh, let's
use an example, let's say we're talking about that gym
example again, right? If you're sitting there on the couch,
and you're using the JUST DO IT method, if you're
using Sedona Method, you should sit there and spend five
minutes going through all the cycles, if you're using the
JUST DO IT method, then you cut your mind off,
you don't even think because when you're sitting there on
that couch, you're thinking all sorts of stupid stuff. You're
thinking like, oh, man, I gotta put my sneakers on,
I gotta go change that I gotta get in my
car, I gotta get my gym towel out of the
laundry, then I gotta, I gotta get my protein shake
going, then I gotta get to the gym, then I
gotta wait for somebody to get off my machine, I
got to do my benchpress then I got to do
my squats, then I got to do my curls, and
I gotta do my cardio. So you build up this
massive pile of stuff you got to do. And of
course, of course, you're gonna resist doing that you just
visualized all the nasty stuff that you're going to do
so negative, that you're building up too much. So with
just a method, you cut all that crap, and you
start forcing your body. And you you stay very present
and in the moment. So you force your body to
just get off the couch. Next step, walk over, grab
your car keys. Next step, put on your sneakers robotically.
Next step, just walk out the door. Next step, get
in your car, next step, drive to the gym. Next
step, just walk through that gym door and go to
your machine and just start moving away. And usually by
that time, you kind of get in the flow and
stuff starts going. So with a just do what method
you're really relying on. Using your body to kind of
brute force your way through the problem can be great.
I mean, it works, it's super simple. So if that's
the best method for you go go ahead and use
it. Try using Sedona and see how that compares to
how the two compare. The thing was Sedona and the
reason I went into such details, I think it gives
you a lot more leverage than just do it method.
Just do it method is kind of common sense. And
you can develop some skill and using it actually, I
think most people don't really know how to use the
adjustment method properly. Like they haven't really condition and discipline
themselves to actually move their body to get their emotions
up and to get get themselves motivated. But with Sedona,
you get a lot of leverage. So the just do
the method, you need a lot of willpower to get
that process started with Sedona Method, you also need some
willpower, but I think you get a lot more bang
for your buck when you expend willpower on Sedona, so
don't only takes two minutes. The other nice thing about
Sedona is that it can be done anywhere at any
time, you can also do an immediate be done immediately.
So with the JUST DO IT method, you know, if
we're talking about going to the gym, well, that's, that's
something you just have to start doing. Whereas Sedona Method,
that's something you can do throughout any part of your
day. So let's say you're resistant to going to the
gym in the morning, well, and normally you go to
the gym in the evening, so in the morning, you
wake up and you're already having resistance going into the
gym, but you're gonna go like at six 6pm. So
right in the morning, you can already use the doughnut
to release a lot of that resistance and feel good
throughout that day. You just going to spend two minutes
going through those cycles like I like I talked about,
and that resistant feeling will dissipate with just do it
method while you're gonna have to wait the whole day
to start doing it. And you're still going to feel
a lot of those emotions. So Sedona Method is nice
in that regard. Also, Sedona Method can be done. Very
especially once you get good at it can be done
while you're doing other stuff. So, if you're going to
pick up the kids, if you're driving in the car,
if you're waiting on the phone, if you're waiting in
line to buy groceries, even if you're at the gym,
doing cardio, you know you're walking the dog, whatever it
is you're doing, not everything but stuff that doesn't require
too much of your attention. Um, you can, you can
use the donuts release on all the resistance in all
the different things that you have in your life. So
that's why I like Sedona, I really encourage you to
look into it, I'm gonna have more in depth articles
on how to use Sedona to release other emotions like
anger, fear, frustration, sadness, all those, I think it's a
really powerful method I've been experimenting with with it. I've
known about it for maybe a year now. And I've
been experimenting with it on and off, I've been getting
into it a little bit more now. And I'm getting
some some pretty good results, I really like it. And
if you want to know more about Sedona, there's more,
there's more method to that madness, so to speak. There's
more details there. So you can pick up one of
their books. It's called The Sedona Method by Hale Dwoskin.
And you can get that on, on the links that
I have down below in the article. You can also
get it on Amazon. And then you can also order
audio and video courses from sedona.com. And they have some
some amazing programs I've lived I've watched some of those
and I've gotten a lot of benefit from them. That's
kind of where, what that's the source of my information
to you about the resistance is really from the Sedona
Method. So I really encourage you to get get your
feet wet. start using it right now pick something right
now that you're resistant about and apply those four or
five steps that I talked about. Read through the article.
There's more details there about how to do everything properly,
how to avoid all the common mistakes. And that's it
for now. I encourage you to use Sedona and peace
out
