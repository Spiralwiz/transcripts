hey what's up this is Leo for actualised org in
this video I really want to talk a little bit
about the idea of what happiness is and maybe share
with you some of my journey through finding out how
to get happiness in my life because about five years
ago I really found myself in a position where I
was at a new job but I didn't like my
new job and I didn't feel like I was getting
the kind of happiness and fulfillment that I wanted from
life not to mention success just let's focus on happiness
and what I had at that point is I didn't
have a lot of personal development knowledge I didn't really
study this stuff I didn't study all the material that
I've studied since and I didn't really know what it
took to become happy and at that point I was
in this position where I was kind of wondering you
know what is the thing what is the thing that's
going to make me happy and I think usually when
you start off this journey and for some reason you're
not happy in your life you tend to think that
there's going to be one thing that's going to come
and solve it for you or you think that there's
one problem that needs to be solved and then you'll
be happy or then you'll be fulfilled and for me
at that point you know it was a financial independence
I thought that I needed financial dependence and I had
various theories about what it might be right and what
you tend to find is that as you're going on
this journey and as you immerse yourself in some of
the books and you started to study some of the
theory and take a look at what other people are
doing and you start to see that it's not so
much one thing there's no one secret that's going to
do it for you really there's many things there's many
potential areas of your life that you're going to need
to handle to really be happy that's not to say
that you need to go out there and do a
lot you can also be happy in the moment too
but I'm talking about you know achieving the goals that
you set out for yourself so if you set up
some goals for yourself then happiness is going to come
from you fulfilling and playing a part in that and
being in integrity with that but ultimately like I'm just
thinking back to what I thought back then for example
back then I thought maybe it was going back into
my past and really the question that was driving me
was why wasn't I more successful why wasn't I more
happy and so I thought maybe the problem is that
you know I have some childhood issues from the past
in my subconscious that are holding me back the way
that you know you usually hear that people go to
therapy they work out issues and I thought maybe maybe
have some issues that are kind of holding me back
from being more successful and more fulfilled and so I
thought personal development might go down that route for me
and that I would need to go back and do
some analysis and think that stuff through and so maybe
it was that and I thought well maybe it's not
just that maybe it's also the fact that you know
I'm a pessimistic thinker and then I'm having negative thoughts
and that maybe I need to be more of an
optimist and so if I just work that out then
that would be the one silver bullet so to speak
you know if I could just be more optimistic then
the past wouldn't even be an issue for me I
wouldn't need to go back and rehash my old childhood
issues and do therapy on that or introspect back on
that because I would just be more positive positive in
the moment or speaking of the moment maybe I should
just follow the Eckhart Tolle advice and maybe I should
be more in the moment right be more in the
now and stop being so goal driven and maybe the
problem that I really have and the reason my fulfilled
is because I have all these goals and maybe I
should just be more Eastern philosophy based write be more
in the moment don't have so many desires and the
desires are the root of your suffering in life that's
kind of what Eastern philosophy teaches us and so what
the prescription there being that you had a not be
so ambitious so start stop having all these goals stop
being so materialistic stop trying to get that awesome career
stop trying to find your ideal mate stop all these
things and then you'll be happy so I thought maybe
maybe that's the problem maybe I shouldn't have so many
goals and then I thought well maybe it's not even
that maybe the problem is that I'm not patient enough
right I really thought that this might be the key
is patience because I was going down a trajectory and
I was still pretty young in my mid-20s and I
was figuring you know well my life is still in
its infancy is still starting my career is still very
young and I just started experimenting with entrepreneurship so I
thought well what if I'm just more patient because I
do tend to want to get results fast a few
months can go by I can get discouraged because I'm
not getting the kind of results that I want to
make getting the fulfillment that I want may be not
advancing in my career as fast as I want if
my business isn't growing quite as fast as I wanted
to and so I say well the concept of mastery
teaches that it takes years and thousands of hours to
get good at something so maybe I just got to
be more patient right maybe I'm just pushing myself too
hard and I'm expecting things to unfold too quickly so
all these different things so I just right now I
just went through and I talked about maybe four potential
problems or silver bullets that that could have been the
cause of of all my my strife and maybe fixing
one of those I thought would have helped and at
that point five years ago I was really confused because
I didn't know which one of those to tackle first
and I thought well maybe it's the patience thing maybe
it's the presence thing maybe it's I have too many
goals thing maybe it's that I don't have enough goals
you know maybe it's just that I'm becoming lazy now
and I need to just get myself going and just
kind of push myself harder so I didn't really know
which one of those to bite off first and I
thought that there would be one that would be more
important I think as you go through this and you
get a little bit more experience we start to realize
it's not so much about one the fact is that
there are many things that lead to fulfillment and many
things that lead to success and there's probably dozens of
them and you need to have a certain number of
them in place before you can really be happy in
life right for example if you're addicted to drugs we
have other addictions that I talked about in other videos
see my my blueprint video on eliminating addictions but if
you have other addictions like you're addicted to television drugs
alcohol sex negative thinking gossip internet whatever that is going
to be a bottleneck that's going to limit your fulfillment
in life and that's going to be a big bottleneck
for you if you've got one of those right and
if you've got multiple of those then you can think
of it as having multiple bottlenecks to your success so
look at yourself and your fulfillment in life as like
a flow of water like a flowing stream right and
when you've got everything opened up it flows smoothly and
you're feeling happy you're feeling that natural joy that you
feel that you feel as a kid right when you're
growing up it's a kid you're present you're in the
moment you're not too worried you're just always enjoying yourself
if you have a normal childhood and that's the same
way with like animals - that's kind of one envious
thing that we have about animals we can envy them
in that they're always they find it easy to be
in the moment right and sure they suffer and they
feel pain but they're not as self-conscious as we tend
to be and so they're not as frustrated they don't
have the same kind of emotional toil that we have
and so the point here being that you've got this
flow this natural flow but then what we do is
we create these bottlenecks in our lives right and maybe
for you the bottleneck right now is some addiction that
you have maybe you're watching TV incessantly and so that's
really preventing your flow from coming out there and that's
preventing you from getting the kind of the kind of
success that you wanted your job or even in your
relationship or somewhere else and so that might be one
bottleneck and what you got to do is you got
to go there and you got to identify that bottleneck
then you got to open it up you got to
fix it and then that will release some of the
flow maybe another bottleneck that you might have is you
might be a very pessimistic and negative thinker you're always
worrying about stuff you're always seeing the negative and everything
you're not able to focus on the positive you're not
able to show any gratitude and so you've got that
bottleneck and because you're always pessimistic about things even though
good things are happening in your life and you've got
a lot to be grateful for already and you already
have many successful aspects to your life you're not really
seeing those you're discounting them you're always looking at what's
wrong with your life and therefore how can you be
fulfilled so that can be a real obstacle to having
happiness really flow through you and having that feeling of
happiness in your life so that might be one obstacle
another obstacle might be maybe that you you don't have
enough money right now maybe you're living on kind of
subsistence level and so that's creating strife for you and
that's going to be hard to be fulfilled when you
can't pay your bills so that might be an obstacle
and all the other ones that I mentioned could all
be obstacles and bottlenecks in this model and the trick
is that you want to slowly start opening those up
and what you got to start with got to just
identify which one it's not that there's one and then
there's one magic one or one that's secret or one
that's the most powerful the question is which one right
now is the highest priority for you so there's probably
one bottleneck right now in your life that's holding you
up the most so for everybody this is going to
be different you have to introspect and ask yourself what
is really holding you back right now from living your
full potential from having the kind of happiness you want
you know what is that one bottleneck for you and
then you can probably see that there's going to be
more than one for you and then if you ultimately
want to become really successful and really fulfilled then you're
probably going to realize that this process of personal development
the reason that it can't be done in one go
you can't just read one book you can't just watch
one seminar you can't just watch one video you got
to work on this on a consistent basis really over
years you have to undertake this idea that you're going
to be doing personal development for a long time really
for the rest of your life that's a good thing
because what you're doing is you're getting more and more
of the pieces in place that are making you more
successful more fulfilled more of the natural Express of you
and so the way you do that is you tackle
one issue at a time and it's not that there's
one magic one so to me knowing this advice five
years ago would have been helpful because it would have
eliminate a lot of frustration and kind of puzzlement as
to which thing to tackle first that there's not one
ultimate important thing so for you the question is what
does that bottleneck right now what is your biggest bottleneck
I want you to sit down think about a little
bit and then once you do figure it out commit
to eliminating it commit to opening that bottleneck up whatever
it is use the videos resources on this site other
books seminars whatever is available for you or just your
common sense right figure that out but also I want
you to sit down and think one step ahead think
about not only maybe one or two action points that
you can take to open up this current bottleneck that
you're facing but think one step ahead and ask yourself
the question once this bottleneck is open this major one
what is the second biggest bottleneck that you're going to
have I think about the and you can use your
imagination kind of for see maybe that's obvious for you
right now or maybe it's not so obvious because sometimes
we have such a tight bottleneck in one place that
it's closing us off from seeing other potential bottlenecks right
so maybe for example you're such a pessimistic thinker that
right now that is really steaming you but once you
get that part handled what's the next part going to
be maybe for you at that point it's going to
be something like being more present being more in the
moment right and then that's going to be the next
one that you can open up and then you can
think about maybe what are one or two potential action
items that you can take to open up that bottleneck
so think about the first in the second bottleneck think
about one or two specific things that you can do
just start to open that up and you can work
on multiple bottlenecks at the same time I definitely encourage
you not to take on too much at once try
to contain your actions and focus them on the biggest
challenge that you've got right work on that so work
on your first bottleneck but also sometimes working on a
bottleneck is like a month long or a year long
process and so if you're working on it like that
and it takes time then you might want to bite
off one or two things that you're working on right
so something like being more pop being more of a
positive thinker that's something that you're going to chip away
at on a daily basis slowly and you're not just
going to become a positive thinker the next week it's
going to take you a couple of years maybe to
make that full transition or to make a really substantial
change so you can a chip away at it everyday
and that might take you five ten minutes of work
every day just to do a little bit of chipping
away at that but then you can also work on
that second bottleneck to maybe you're going to do five
or ten minutes or 20 minutes of work on the
problem that you have for example with being not present
and the best way maybe you can work on that
is to do meditation so do 20 minutes of meditation
in the morning or whatever other kind of habit you
can put in place that will help you work with
that so you can work on simultaneous bottlenecks at once
so I just wanted to throw that out there and
show you kind of what it looks like what the
picture looks like and once you unlock a lot of
these bottlenecks then you're going to find that that fulfillment
that joy that happiness is going to flow for you
the only trick is to sit down and really think
a little bit about what is blocking you right now
and do a little bit of research about what the
solutions are out there because there are multiple solutions to
fix any kind of bottleneck that you have in your
life and I guarantee that every bottleneck that you do
have has a solution to it so whatever it is
whether it's pessimistic thinking or childhood issues from the past
that are still blocking you or lack of finances or
lack of relationship or lack of social skills you know
whatever it is in any area of your life you
can find a solution out there because the problem that
you have I guarantee that thousands of other people have
had that same problem you know humanity has been going
on now pretty strong for the last five thousand years
and that's just documented history we even go back further
than that and our biology or psychology hasn't really changed
in that whole time so the problems that we face
today are really much the same problems that people faced
to three thousand years ago there are the same problems
that you can read about in ancient texts on philosophy
ancient texts about happiness you know back from the Greek
and Roman times to the Hindu to the ancient ancient
Hindu texts ancient Buddhist texts the Bible all that stuff
talks about very similar themes and the idea is that
you can find solutions to that stuff because people have
figured it out especially in the modern times we've got
people that have created lots and lots of resources for
you that you can use to follow you just have
to go out there new a little bit of searching
it's actually pretty easy there's an information product now we
live in the information age in the information product age
especially in the last 20 years there have been so
many information products created from seminars to books to audio
programs to DVDs to coaching programs workshops booklets worksheets that
you can buy you can find out there a lot
of that stuff is even for free right like these
videos you can find this stuff and use it to
fix whatever bottleneck you've got and then you can move
forward in your life and that fulfillment and happiness can
flow alright this is leo signing off go ahead and
