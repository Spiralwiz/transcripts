            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/yvRWqGpKx-s' target='_blank'>Success & Creativity - Why You Should Be More Schizophrenic</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>The Importance of Inner Reality</b>: In his lecture, Leo Gura highlights the significance of having a strong inner reality, characterized by beliefs, emotions, thoughts, visions, and philosophies. He posits that creative and successful people are those who have a strong internal world and do not let external influences dictate their inner reality.
</li><li><b>Imagination as Predecessor of Achievement</b>: Gura emphasizes that every achievement starts with an idea or a vision in the internal world. He notes that people generally discount the ability to imagine or envision, focusing instead on tangible markers of success. However, he argues that the process of creating and realizing something often begins in the mind, and it's crucial to maintain a firm belief in this vision despite external skepticism. 
</li><li><b>Struggles of Creative Individuals</b>: There's a unique internal struggle experienced by creative individuals while translating their internal visions to external reality. This process involves emotional labor and challenges, as it largely happens internally and is often unseen and unappreciated by others. 
</li><li><b>The Mind as Original Augmented Reality</b>: Gura likens the human mind to augmented reality devices like Google Glass or augmented reality apps for smartphones. This comparison highlights how our minds also contain filters that shape and color our perception of reality. Our experiences, habits, and disposition form these filters, and it's crucial to understand that our reality is already significantly influenced by them.
</li><li><b>Influence of Internal Reality on Personal Growth and Success</b>: To foster personal growth and success, Leo Gura suggests strengthening one's internal reality and serving it as the primary driver behind motivation, creativity, and achievements. He stresses that our inner reality isn't lesser than the external world; in fact, it lays the groundwork for shaping the outer reality. 
</li><li><b>Challenges in the Cultivation of Inner Reality</b>: Gura underscores the need to "recondition" ourselves into prioritizing our internal reality over external validation. Cultivating a strong sense of inner reality involves embracing one's imagination and developing beliefs that solidify and make this internal world more powerful. 
</li><li><b>Role of the Inner Reality in Overcoming Obstacles</b>: Leo Gura points out that the perseverance, passion, and resilience needed to overcome challenges and obstacles come from a remarkably strong internal visionthe ability to envision outcomes and believe in them.
</li><li><b>Mind as Augmented Reality</b>: Leo Gura highlights that the mind filters reality and that we're living in an augmented reality whether we realize it or not. He viewpoints reality as a fabrication of our own mind, and emphasizes that to achieve success and personal fulfillment, we should use this augmented reality advantageously.
</li><li><b>Acknowledgement of Inner Reality</b>: Gura urges us to acknowledge and harness our thoughts, habits, and imagination and use them in an empowered and positive way. He warns against unhelpful mental habits like worrying, self doubts, and limiting beliefs, suggesting that these can be combated by shifting our thought patterns to be more positive and optimist.
</li><li><b>Embracing Imagination</b>: Bordering on the allegory of a schizophrenic persons way of experiencing their internal reality, Gura encourages people to take their own visions seriously. He explains that one's visions and ambitions should be felt as real and tangible, even when they are not yet manifested in the physical world.
</li><li><b>Minds as Powerful Simulators</b>: Gura describes the mind as a powerful simulator akin to a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) program, allowing for internal prototyping and design of one's visions before they become real. He promotes belief in the power of visualization and the cultivation of a strong inner reality.
</li><li><b>Nurturing Own Visions</b>: Asserting the importance of giving more weight to one's own ideas and visions, Gura suggests that these are perceived as more than "just ideas". He contends that they are the starting point for motivation and drive, and should be used to construct one's desired life in the mind. 
</li><li><b>Aligning Inner and Outer World</b>: Finally, Gura pushes for the convergence of the internal and external world. The internal world plays a vital role in influencing our reality and assists in actualizing ideas physically, which starts within our mind and is then manifested outwardly.
</li><li><b>Nikola Tesla's Unique Mind</b>: Nikola Tesla, known for being slightly mentally deranged, had strong visualization skills and a photographic memory, crafting complex designs like the electrical motor and alternating current purely in his mind before bringing them to life.
</li><li><b>Overcoming Blocks and Realizing Inner World Potential</b>: To unlock the potential of the mind, a crucial mental shift must be made. This involves overcoming hesitations and blocks towards believing in your inner world and the tangible power it holds for creativity and personal development.
</li><li><b>Practical Techniques for Strengthening Inner Reality</b>: Time alone for contemplation and concentration on your thoughts can fortify your inner reality. Practices like visualization, meditation, deep contemplation can lend strength to this process. Gura emphasizes reducing distractions like social media and intentionally dedicating time for mental planning and creation.
</li><li><b>Recognizing and Encouraging Creativity</b>: Creative moments often arise from certain conditions. By identifying these conditions, one can consciously create more opportunities for creativity. A habit of setting aside time for visualization, journaling, and contemplation each morning can strengthen belief and motivate action.
</li><li><b>The Power of Journaling</b>: Journaling can serve as a powerful tool in augmenting inner reality, making our visions and plans more tangible. It is a technique that allows us to immerse ourselves deeply in our thoughts and creative life.
</li><li><b>Valuing Thoughts and Imagination</b>: A protected space for thoughts and high regard for one's own imagination is required for success. Building up willpower, embracing imaginations as actual reality, and not worrying about others' opinions are essential for realizing creative visions.
</li><li><b>Child-like Imagination and Freedom</b>: Children are naturally adept at using their imagination due to their freedom and present moment awareness. To improve creativity, adults should try to mirror this state, embarking on a path of "creating their own stories". 
</li><li><b>Shaping Reality according to Desires</b>: By using the mind to filter reality as per one's desires, one can create an empowering augmented reality without needing digital aids. This act of belief and willpower not only creates internal changes but also manifests in the external world, leading to creativity and positive societal change.
