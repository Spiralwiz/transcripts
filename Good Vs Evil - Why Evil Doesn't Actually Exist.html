hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about good versus evil okay
good versus evil of the classic battle right okay well
let's dig into this and talk about what good and
evil actually are this is going to be more of
a philosophical video not going to be as immediately practical
and applicable SMI others but actually at the end I'm
going to go in and tell you why this is
an important concept for you to understand it properly and
the problem that I see is that most people don't
really understand what good people are and how they actually
operate and what's really going on in reality and so
because of this it can lead to a lot of
dysfunction it creates an adversarial relationship with reality which leads
to closed mindedness and does not get you the kind
of results that you want in your life and it
keeps you from being happy so it is practical you
just have to bear with me to see how it
all interconnects here it's going to be a little more
philosophical so good versus evil why is this topic even
interesting to us well all of us have heard of
good and evil many of us tend to believe that
good and evil are out there somewhere and you know
we ask ourselves questions such as why do evil things
happen to good people or questions like why does evil
sometimes prevail over good in this world why does that
seem to happen why are there good people and why
do there seem to be evil people and if that's
the case how do you convert a good person to
an evil person or an evil person to a good
person is that possible so all these kind of interesting
life questions start to come up and the critical thing
here is that I have to warn you that this
video requires an open mind it requires an open mind
because what I'm talking about here challenges conventional wisdom and
conventional wisdom on this subject is wrong conventional wisdom is
what you get from the media the culture Society what
you were raised to believe what your religion told you
to believe and all of those views generally speaking are
wrong on this issue so I'm going to talk about
why that is all the details and how you can
start to get your luck your life and your light
and your your mind aligned with more of the way
that it actually is rather than the way that we
want it to be in some of these cartoon character
versions of morality that we receive from from various sources
in society now before we get there we have to
ask because I'm really challenging your your notions of how
life is and how the world works I'm really challenging
your worldview here with some of these ideas and I
have to ask you to to be able to step
aside and separate yourself from your beliefs separate yourself from
all the things that you were fed as a kid
growing up or as a young adult or even that
you experience in your own life and really open your
mind to some of the possibilities that are here and
the way that I'm going to do this is by
asking you have you actually yourself really looked in and
investigated this question of good versus evil have you actually
done that see because most people believe that they know
what good and evil are and they believe that they're
very smart about this subject but what I find is
that none of them have actually gone and done a
personal investigation now be very careful about what this means
a personal investigation does not mean that you're simply believing
what you were told when you were a kid it
does not mean that you believe whatever your society or
your culture beliefs or whatever people want you to believe
it means that you didn't read it in a book
somewhere you didn't hear it from somebody you didn't see
it in the news or on the television it means
that you actually sat down by yourself unplugged yourself from
all those external sources of information and actually started to
think philosophize about what good and evil are maybe started
doing some research on this topic started studying it started
reading various books to look at different points of view
see now it's very and that you answer this question
honestly because if you've never done this I would say
99% of people have never done this then what is
your opinion of good and evil really worth is the
question and now it's okay if you haven't done this
but I encourage you that if you haven't done this
then keep your mind especially open because that means that
you haven't really investigated it for yourself and I'm gonna
help you to do an investigation here now you'd have
to believe everything I tell you but just use this
as a launching point to do your own investigation and
I think that if you do an honest investigation by
yourself you'll come to a lot of the same conclusions
that I'm sharing with you here that I've come to
okay so the next thing that I want to do
is I want to do a little demonstration this is
also a very important thing is to get you to
start to see how tricky the human mind really is
and the way I want to do that is I
want to show you an image I'm going to show
you actually two images I'm going to show one and
then after it a few seconds later I'm gonna show
a second one and we're going to see if your
interpretation the first image changes after you saw the second
image and then you're gonna come back here and we're
gonna discuss it alright so here it is here is
the first image you okay awesome welcome back so what
did you see there you saw two images right two
images the first one about plain wall socket the second
one of a little addition that I made to a
wall socket now what is the relevance of this what
does have to do with good and evil the wall
sockets not good it's not evil but here's the important
point the important point is that what this is called
is this is a phenomenon in human psychology that's called
a Poe tinea what is Apple Fenian apophenia is the
human tendency to recognize shapes and patterns where no shapes
and patterns inherently exist now that's what happened in this
example if you saw the first image of the wall
socket and you thought that oh it's just a simple
wall socket but then you also saw the face in
the wall socket right you also notice that even though
you knew it's just a wall socket but you also
saw the human face in it then that was you
seeing a pattern that wasn't really there and the second
image helps to highlight that so it makes it really
really clear makes it like glaringly obvious what's going on
there and this is a phenomenon called apophenia now what
does it have to do with anything this has to
do a lot with good and evil because what I'm
going to tell you here is that good and evil
are really a creation of your mind just that the
way this pattern of the face in the wall socket
isn't inherent to the wall socket it's not the wall
socket looks like a face it's simply that your brain
has certain wiring in it that gives you image recognition
especially with human faces the human mind this has been
proven in various psychological cities are they done is very
very good at image detection even just has a baby
a baby is able to instantly recognize simple facial patterns
even just something as basic as two dots and a
little horizontal line the human mind will immediately interpret that
as a face even though on the really what's going
on there so you just got two dots and just
a little line but the human mind will see it
as a face or a smiley face or sad face
now the same is really the case with good and
evil and I really want to ask you to ask
yourself this question what is good and evil what is
the substance of it better ask yourself that like what
actually is it in the world how how is it
in reality is it like a physical object does it
have that same kind of physicality and reality to it
is it the same as as an emotion is that
a thought where does evil and where does good exist
does it exist out there in the circumstances of everyday
life or does it exist up here in the mind
it's a very important question now you might say well
leo there are clear examples of evil that exist out
in the world and if we saw it we would
all recognize it and we could point our finger at
it you might see a scene where something is happening
in life and you you clearly know that that's that's
wrong and that's evil like maybe you see somebody getting
murdered and obviously that's wrong and evil now the question
is okay I agree with you on that kind of
kind of basic level but then is the evilness of
that act where is it actually located is it in
the person is it inside the person's doing the murdering
is it the the combination the whole scene of the
murder and the victim where is the actual evil happening
there and what complicates this is even further is then
consider some other scenario where you have the same scene
one person murdering other person kill another person but this
time it's done in self-defense so now it being done
in self-defense is that act no longer evil most people
would say it's no longer evil but then what's the
difference is it the physical arrangement of atoms that has
changed is that the circus has the intent of the
person and where is that actually like physically substantially located
well what you're going to find you look at these
scenarios and really dig deep and ask yourself honestly what's
going on you're gonna agree that evil doesn't actually exist
out there you can't actually point a finger at evil
evil is not a like a physical tangible thing what
evil is is evil is a thought evil is an
interpretation evil is a judgment that you're making on reality
and very very simply evil is this and good is
this good is simply what you prefer and evil is
simply what you don't prefer in life that's it there's
nothing very complicated here there's nothing very deep or metaphysical
to it except the problem is that something even as
simple as this such a simple truth for most people
it doesn't sit well it doesn't resonate well and it
seems like it's not true or that there must be
something more to it because if that was the case
léo you might say then all these sorts of problems
start to come up in my worldview and we're gonna
start to address those right now but this is the
general thesis that I'm throwing at you here is that
good is simply what you prefer and even listen to
what you don't prefer it can be extremely intellectually honest
to to see this to admit this to yourself because
there are various ego defense mechanisms at work here there's
also a lot of social conditioning at work because you
grow up in a society where you're fed with all
sorts of different theories and information and different worldviews and
beliefs which are now running on a subconscious layer in
your brain so this idea that that good and evil
are just a personal preference ultimately what does that make
it I mean good and evil completely relative it means
that if your mind didn't exist if you didn't exist
if humanity didn't exist then there would be no good
and evil in the world this means that the world
and reality itself is entirely neutral it's devoid of any
meaning it's devoid of any good or bad characteristics it
just is it just is now this is a Buddhist
concept really and this is a powerful console I love
this concept this concept is so beautiful to me that
reality is in neutral we want to believe that it's
not neutral but really if you look at and you
investigate it then you see that it's neutral the meanings
that you're creating those are being created in your mind
by your thoughts the meaning doesn't exist out in the
world and this model is very beautiful to me because
first of all it I mean it liberates us it
gives us a lot of freedom but second of all
this freedom it's always existed it explains the lot it
explains a lot about how humanity works how human beings
interact with one another why there are awards it explains
a lot of historical events and I'm going to cover
that a little bit in detail right now so the
idea here is that it exists only in your mind
any meaning but especially something like good and evil when
you're really dichotomizing that drastically okay so this being the
case you might now start to get objections right so
here are some of your objections that I want to
address one objection that I commonly hear when someone hears
this is that well what about things like murder and
rape and theft I mean clearly oh we don't want
to say that those are our neutral things those are
clearly evil things don't you agree isn't it's silly and
ridiculous to have a theory of life and the world
that goes against this this kind of common sense notion
that those things are wrong now really notice what's going
on there I'm not saying that it doesn't disturb you
in fact the fact that it disturbs you is evidence
of the fact that it's a preference right who is
being disturbed by this you are being disturbed by this
and that's what we're saying here is that when you
see an evil act all that really means is that
you get a tingle in your brain now saying it
just as a tingle that makes it seem like it's
not very substantial but in fact it can cause a
very big impact on you so I'm not saying that
your beliefs about this don't influence you they do but
look at what's going on in reality it's you that's
getting disturbed it's your ego that's getting either offended or
when you see something good it's your ego that's getting
satisfied and gratified I mean else is going on besides
that is there anything else you have to look within
yourself to see if there is anything else if you
do look and you look honestly and you remove the
social conditioning what you're going to find is that there
is nothing else it's just thoughts whatever you think is
evil is going to be perceived as evil whatever you
think as being good it's going to be perceived as
good now the next objection might go like okay leo
well even if that's the case I mean your theory
here is very dangerous I mean what happens if everybody
in the world believes this what happens if everyone buys
into this is everyone now gonna believe that murder is
okay and it's just neutral and rape is okay it's
just neutral and theft is okay it's just neutral so
society is gonna turn into a chaotic mess it's not
a case well let's take a look at that it
might not be quite as drastic as you might think
how about taking a pride of lions have you ever
seen them on to the Discovery Channel or some animal
channel you see a bunch of lions maybe 10 or
20 of them sitting in a nice little patch in
the grass on the savanna somewhere and they're just lying
around and they're enjoying themselves basking in the Sun maybe
they go off do a hunting but they're just sitting
there and a pride so take this pride of lions
now what about a pride of lions would you say
that a pride of lions has morality it has a
concept of good and evil or do they not what
do you think what would you say I think most
people would pretty readily admit that lions don't have a
sense of morality and lions don't have a good and
evil they don't understand what good and evil are they
don't even know about good and evil that's outside their
cognitive abilities so they don't have that but then the
question is it's kind of curious when you have 10
lions sitting there basking in the Sun next to each
other what is preventing them from tearing each other apart
from killing each other from murdering each other why are
they not doing that kind of interesting because is your
thesis is that if you get rid of my sense
of morality then the whole world goes to hell Society
goes to hell well yet we have this little Society
of lions here and they're doing quite well they sure
they fight sometimes just like humans do you know they
scuffle they might even buy each other and maybe even
sometimes they'll get into a fight so bad that they'll
maim each other maybe even one of them gets killed
in a fight but generally it's pretty clear that lions
coexist very peacefully together they generally don't have problems beyond
just kind of you know the normal problems that we
would expect with any kind of creatures or organisms in
a society who are trying to take care of themselves
and look out for themselves so that's interesting huh what
does that mean then that means that morality isn't quite
as important as maybe you thought it was to society
running and functioning well in fact what you're gonna find
is that there is no need to have a sense
of black and white morality of good and evil there
so there's no need to have that in order to
be quote-unquote good yourself what you're going to discover is
that what's really going on here is that it's not
a sense of theoretical morality that's keeping you in line
in society that's not really what's going on what's really
going on is that the morality that you're exhibiting that
all of us are exhibiting the reason we're coexisting peacefully
is really because that has been hardwired into our brains
just like it is with the Lions that's what's going
on with the Lions right as part of the evolutionary
process it wouldn't work if a pride of lions came
to be and evolved to that level and they were
able to just indiscriminately savagely murder each other it wouldn't
work right they could never evolve to that level so
what happened through the evolutionary process is that wiring was
installed where they're really not allowed to harm each other
generally speaking they have not they have no programming no
reason to do it so they don't and the same
thing goes on with human beings we generally don't have
reason to harm one another the only reason we harm
each other is when we report into dire circumstances and
we'll really put into a zero-sum game and it has
high stakes of life and death then we start to
get physical and we start to get nasty but other
we have no reason to and in fact we have
a lot of programming in our brain that makes us
generous towards each other that makes us friendly and makes
us accommodating and empathetic why is that because that's important
for a social organism of any kind that's how society
is created that's how a society of bees works that's
how a society of ants works they couldn't work if
they were busy slaughtering each other all the time so
that's really what's going on here it's not some sort
of theoretical lofty religious morality that you're using you might
feel like you've got a layer of that running on
you but really that's not what's keeping you in line
it's actually a very good thing that it's not that
easy to take the morality out of you it's hardwired
so to speak because if it wasn't hardwired then it
would be very very easy for you or somebody else
in society to just change beliefs and then they could
easily go and start doing all these antisocial things that
are damaging to them species as a whole so it
makes sense that it's really deeply hardwired now in human
beings it's hardwired now does that mean that it can
never be unwired no you can see examples for example
with suicide bombers and terrorists where they're successfully able to
unwire this because they do so much training literally drilling
the mind the subconscious mind so much that eventually they're
able to sort of get those defenses down but with
most normal people that's not the case it doesn't happen
so very interesting how how that works now why then
do people want to say that good and evil exist
and that they're they're clear and they're external out in
the real world why is there this need to do
this it's very interesting this is a philosophical concept it's
called normativity this is something that you will encounter in
an ethics class or you'll encounter it in a psychology
of morality class normativity what it means is it means
that what I believe you should believe what I do
you should do it means that your belief or your
idea has a certain need to be transferred it has
a certain universality to it so the reason that really
people are interested in making these morals and values and
good and Eve black-and-white an objective is because when you
make something objective that means that you can now justify
to others to believe that thing as well so it's
a really convenient way to transfer values so here's how
it works if you've got a normative idea then what
happens is that you say okay it's out there in
the real world it's true it's a fact of the
luck of life we all need to accept it and
now everyone looks at that and says oh yeah you
know what yeah that's true it's a real fact of
life it's out there so all of us must accept
it and you can go around telling people hey you're
wrong you have to accept this and you can tell
that person hey look you're wrong look at this fact
accept it that's normativity now if you've got a concept
that has no normativity then here's how it works your
concept has no normativity so you tell yourself that you're
believing it okay nice but then you go and tell
this person hey you should believe what I believe you
should value what I value and that person will look
at it and say you know what that's a nice
idea but I don't really like it I'm gonna keep
believing what I believed and you look at them and
you say well you know what if you if you
want to keep believing what you believe that's okay because
this is a non normative concept what's a non normative
concept a non Nordic concept or phenomenon life is something
like ice cream flavor right we usually wouldn't go around
saying you know what I like chocolate ice cream so
you should like chocolate ice cream most people don't do
that we tend to be honest with ourselves and say
you know what I like chocolate ice cream because I
just like it I happen to like the taste it
titillates me in a certain way and that person he
or she likes strawberry or whatever other flavor and that's
fine with me I don't expect everybody to like chocolate
I don't I'm not gonna come up with some sort
of elaborate theory to say that chocolate is the one
that everyone should like just because I like it now
what happens with morality is the exact opposite of that
with morality whatever you believe you want to make sure
that everybody else believes it too because you need it
to be true and actually this is a this kind
of a weakness and a crack in the system because
it already tells you that something is going wrong there
when you really strongly need to fight for something and
to defend something it usually means that it's a it's
an ego defense mechanism of a sort because your ego
needs to be validated by all the extra no circumstances
so that it can maintain this adversarial relationship with reality
because ultimately when you believe that there is a good
and an evil what's what's happening is that you're you're
not really being honest you haven't really introspected enough and
so now you have to work really hard to keep
that worldview into place because you're gonna see things and
phenomena in the world that don't make sense to you
under this model a lot of stuff doesn't make sense
when you believe that there is a good and an
evil and if you believe that good and evil are
totally neutral and they don't really exist they're just in
your mind their personal preferences all the sudden everything makes
sense it's so simple it's like duh why would you
believe anything else and here's some examples if you're a
student of history then these should start ringing bells for
you immediately and especially like really start clicking into place
when you start adopting this this model so for example
George Bush versus bin Laden right Battle of the new
millennium what was going on there is George Bush good
and bin Laden evil or the vice versa I mean
what was happening there I mean George Bush believed he
was good and the lawn was evil would appeal on
the belief below Madonn believes the exact opposite of that
now which one of them is true none of them
are true it's just it just is what it is
reality is just neutral without our layers of meaning and
added on top of it so none of them are
correct or right now I'm not saying that I condone
the actions of bin Laden over Bush that's not the
case you can still have preferences for what you want
again we're talking about preferences right so Bush prefers one
thing but not on prefers another thing we prefer our
own thing and our own thing hopefully is in line
with what Bush believes rather than what Milan believes because
we don't want a world where there's a lot of
terrorism and violence but some people prefer that and they
have reasons to prefer that okay we don't like it
I don't like it now that does that mean that
I'm a good accept it no but it just it
just means that it's it is what it is and
it's our own stories in our minds right there's no
need to build up this grand theory of normativity there's
no need to say that you know what bin Laden
is actually evil and what Bush tries to espouse is
actually good there's no need to do that unless you've
got some sort of insecurities within yourself an intelligent open-minded
intellectually honest person could say you know what there's no
actual normativity here but I'm still confident in what I
prefer and I prefer a life that's happy and peaceful
I prefer a society that way and so that's just
all there is to it and I don't need anything
more that's enough that's enough for me to go and
really live my life and be motivated and still have
a family and still go to work and still do
everything that I want to do in my life I
don't need this elaborate theory of why someone is actually
evil I don't need to demonize anybody whenever your demonizing
somebody it's generally a very big clue that you're off
the track and that you're doing it for egoic reasons
not for actual any reason in reality so Bush bin
Laden how about the Conservatives versus the Liberals same sort
of thing I mean who's right nobody's right everyone has
their own stories and ideas personal preferences what about the
Israeli Palestine conflict who's right there is there somebody that's
objectively good and objectively evil no one side prefers one
thing another side prefers another thing that's all there is
there's nothing more this is actually what you fight find
is that you find a lot of conflict in situations
where this is the case because when you believe that
everybody must believe what you believe then you're gonna be
willing to go out there and fight for it creates
a lot of tension creates a lot of war creates
a lot of bad situations when you have this more
Buddhist type of mindset that you know what reality is
very neutral and actually what that does it doesn't make
you a moral it actually makes you super moral it's
a very interesting idea because look at the way that
a true Zen Buddhist for example or an Indian yogi
how he will behave himself I mean he's not out
there raping and pillaging he sees reality is totally neutral
and that actually makes him super moral he's actually extra
caring because of this because his ego is gone he
shed the ego and now it's just like pure love
and joy for everything that's out there and why is
that that's just simply because the human brain was programmed
with that that's your natural eight except most of us
don't feel that because we're so wrapped up in our
own egos trying to survive try to fight for our
own security and defense when you let those offenses go
actually you become very very peaceful the more you put
those defenses up and the more you protect them the
more conflict you have which is perfect example what's going
on in the Israeli Palestine conflicts about Hitler versus Churchill
what was going on there can we clearly say that
Hitler was evil no it's a preference he thought that
he was doing good for the German nation now do
we agree with that no but again that's our preference
how about Rome the Roman Empire versus the barbarians what
was going on there have you studied that well the
Roman Empire was trying to expand and basically dominate the
whole world in a similar fashion to what Hitler was
doing from from within Germany except they were doing it
from Rome now they were collecting all these little satellite
states and nations and they were conquering barry's barbarian tribes
and forcing them to work and to become subjects and
pay taxes of course the barbarians didn't want this they
thought that they were being subjugated and enslaved so they
fought back but the Roman Empire just called the barbarians
demonize them right that's where we get the word barbarian
from but what's going on there who was right and
who was wrong in a situation who is objectively good
or evil nobody was one side has its own agenda
and other side has its own agenda and those agendas
just clash what about Rome versus Christianity similar kind of
conflict happened there the Roman Empire tried to crack down
on Christianity especially in the in the early days and
again who is right or wrong there nobody just preferences
about capitalism communism same thing so if you go through
history in your real student history you'll see that almost
every conflict every single conflict on the social scale has
happened because of this and a lot of personal interpersonal
conflicts happen because of this as well because we demonize
each other and we we need a way to prove
to ourselves that our judgement of the other person is
somehow justified and in fact no judgment of anybody has
ever justified there's no reason why you are right in
judging somebody so really think about this think about all
these examples and see if this is starting to make
more or less sense than the model that you may
have had before I think you'll start to see that
it makes more sense so now this case being made
what is bad about having a black and white model
what's bad about believing that good and evil are actually
external fact of life I think the problem here is
like we already mentioned in a couple of examples is
that it's an ego defense mechanism it's a lack of
intellectual honesty it's an adversarial relationship with truth and reality
when this happens then you tend to start to contort
yourself and build your life around this and you kind
of have to put yourself in this little bubble we're
not able to accept everything that's out there you deny
things to yourself you become judgmental of other people you
start to believe that tension and conflict are actually justified
in certain circumstances it tends to make you more extremist
and less accepting of life in reality it tends to
lead to a certain closed mindedness it tends to lead
to this effect where you're you're putting the blinders on
in certain parts of your life and you're isolating yourself
from certain realities and ultimately what this is doing is
it's creating suffering because all of your suffering is being
created because you have this ego it needs to defend
itself from everything that's going on constantly having to defend
and work and work and work you get tired of
that you suffer you have to concoct elaborate theories and
stories about why this is the case you have to
run around and change other people make sure that other
people believe just like you do so that it becomes
a little bit more palatable to you to believe some
of the the incorrect things that you believe because when
you have a whole group of people all believing in
the same wrong idea or belief then if you're a
sort of history you also know how that works that
makes it very easy for that whole group to buy
into a bunch of and to should each other blow
smoke up each other's asses and basically stay comfortable in
that why are they comfortable because that person is telling
me that I'm right and that person's telling me and
I'm right and I'm telling him that I'm right so
it just becomes a self-fulfilling self self-serving sort of sort
of way of life and way of being within the
world and I just find that you can't really become
happy and you can't really become successful in life if
you comment life from this perspective so consider that and
see where you are relative to this and see maybe
if if your notions of good and evil might need
a little bit of fine tuning and tweaking now if
any of this stuff rub you the wrong way or
you think that it does make sense you know what
I don't expect you to just believe it don't just
take it I'm just throwing out an idea here go
ahead and take it for yourself and maybe explore it
and maybe if you find that it doesn't work for
you then toss it aside but do an honest investigation
be very open-minded in the way that you do this
be very objective be very rigorous spend some time really
thinking it through and I think you might be surprised
by what you find and also how beautiful this idea
is it's not threatening at all you'll find how beautiful
it is okay this is Leo I'm signing off this
is what I have to say about good and evil
