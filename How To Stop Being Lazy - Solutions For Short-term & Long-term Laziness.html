hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're going to talk about how to stop being
lazy let's do some lazy troubleshooting I want to help
you to get out of your rut your funk or
whatever else is going on your life so let's troubleshoot
this issue and this is an issue that's close to
me because you know I get lazy sometimes in fact
today was one of my most lazy days in a
while I've been working real hard on my business stuff
and today was just one of those days where I
didn't really have that much to do but I was
supposed to shoot a couple of videos which is what
I'm doing now but it was really hard for me
to get mobilized the whole day I was kind of
putting it off and putting it off and procrastinating and
just saying like oh no I don't want to I
feel sleepy I feel tired I didn't have a good
meal so now I'm kind of a sluggish it's like
oh so I really have to get up there and
prepare myself and get all pretty and everything and get
ready to talk about this kind of stuff like oh
I don't want to deal with all that stuff so
and and I was like writing writing a little outlines
for what I'm gonna say but then like I just
wasn't feeling I wasn't in the mood and I was
feeling I was really being lazy but Here I am
I'm standing in front of you and I'll tell you
how I got up here at the end of the
video but right now first of all to frame this
problem let's just be very clear and ask you what
kind of lazy are we talking about here because there's
different kinds of lazy one kind of lazy is that
you lost your job and now you've been unemployed for
12 months and you've just been lying around on the
couch at your parents house in their basement and you
haven't even been looking for a job and you're just
so lazy you're sitting there watching reruns of teeth old
TV shows for 12 hour straight eating noodles out of
a Styrofoam cup right now that's one kind of lazy
and that's the kind of like really problematic lazy then
there's another kind of lazy which is actually one that
I get coaching clients coming to me twelve four and
that's this kind I get a successful person coming to
me this person is already earning six figures but this
person is now feeling I'm not so motivated anymore you
know I want to go out there and go for
that promotion but I'm just kind of like losing my
drive or you know I want to earn an extra
million dollars in my business but I've already got a
couple million how do I motivate myself to earn that
extra million like this kind of lazy or maybe you
know you you work really hard and you're working on
projects all the time and now you're in this kind
of a rut between projects you're feeling like oh I
don't want to do anything I don't want to start
the next project that's a very different kind of lazy
I mean that's kind of an over achievers lazy that's
what I'm called that one it's a if you're her
overachiever type you're a workaholic type you think that everything
unless you're working you're your ass off at a breakneck
pace then everything is lazy so that's a very different
type of problem and then of course you've got other
kinds of lazy like maybe you're too lazy to go
and study for school or college maybe there's an exam
coming up a certification and you're not studying for that
kind of lazy I've been there or maybe you're too
lazy to go to the gym you don't get your
ass up to get there and do the workout that
you set out for yourself or whatever whatever other kind
of thing that you're stalling on but basically if you
keep having this recurring problem in your life of being
lazy that's what I want to cover here in this
video that and then at the end of the video
I also want to talk about how to specifically get
yourself out of a lazy funk like right now right
this second because I think that there's a difference between
long term laziness and short term laziness what I had
today was a short term laziness like I it's not
that like I lost my motivation to shoot more videos
no that that didn't happen at all it was just
that like today I wanted to slack off so I'll
help you with that at the end too but let's
talk about for a second this longer term laziness which
I actually is see as a much bigger problem because
see I don't have a problem with long term laziness
that's because I worked hard at it it wasn't always
like that you know I worked hard on my life
purpose my life has purpose that's why it's very hard
for me to be lazy on the long term I'm
never really afraid of that I can have short-term laziness
though because you know like anyone I just kind of
like want to slack off during a certain part of
the week or whatever especially if I'm working the hard
prior to that so the real question I got to
ask you is like what's the problem with being lazy
why not I don't mean for me I mean for
you because for me there's a really big problem with
being lazy I mean I got an important life to
live so what I'm lazy I'm losing time I'm losing
time my life purpose is not getting accomplished what about
you though do you have a life purpose what's not
being accomplished when you're lazy why does it matter maybe
for you being lazy is cool now no one says
that being lazy is cool but I mean that even
when you tell yourself that being lazy is not cool
it's still cool for you why is that because your
life has no purpose it has no meaning you're not
doing anything important with your life there's no larger mission
to your life so honestly the reason that you're lazy
is because you can be what else you what else
are you doing you're trying to come up with like
fake productivity you're trying to be productive and efficient and
be go out there and you know work that job
or do this thing here or do whatever there you're
trying to do all this stuff just to keep busy
just because someone told you to do it just because
you have a social obligation or whatever in that case
if you have laziness problems well that's because you're using
extrinsic motivation not intrinsic motivation so that's one distinction you
gotta understand here extrinsic intrinsic extrinsic means you're being motivated
from the outside in that's like when you have a
kid who wants to eat some candy and his parents
are telling them no you're going to eat vegetables and
then they give him some sort of reward they'll say
if you eat your vegetables then we'll give you ten
dollars that's called extrinsic motivation intrinsic motivation is when it
comes from the inside out so that's like if the
kid would say you know what I want to eat
healthy stuff so I'm not going to eat the candy
I just want to eat healthy stuff and that can
happen too it's it's rare it's harder to find people
who are intrinsically motive is to your life you develop
it you're cultivated this is not something you're born with
you cultivate it and I talk about that in other
videos another distinction you should understand is that between positive
and negative motivation some people think that they can motivate
themselves through life to accomplish great things through negative motivation
what is negative motivation by the way I have videos
on that too here I'm just going to give you
the quick summary version negative motivation means that you're telling
yourself all the bad painful stuff could happen to you
if you don't do something that's like you got to
go study for a test in a class that you
have no interest in maybe you're studying math you have
no interest in math you got to go ace the
math test in order to get into it's a law
school or something which is what you're really passionate about
so now you're taking math you don't care about math
you got to a sit though and you got to
go out there and study you don't want to study
so you're going to just slack it off and the
negative motivation there is that well if I fail I'm
going to get an F that's going to look bad
on my transcript negative motivation not a good way to
go a few people in life have accomplished amazing things
through negative motivation what works much better they're really successful
people they're positively motivated that means that there's something that
they're constructively working towards and in their mind they're visualizing
all the good all the pleasure that will come from
that so same situation let's say you're taking this math
test except here you're really curious and interested in math
it's very different and you want to Ace this test
because you just want to show that you're good at
math which you're studying anyways very different right very different
kind of motivation a lot of really successful people actually
what happens to them and they come to me for
coaching on this is that yeah they got a good
career good job but then what happens is that they
actually got to where they got to through negative motivation
it's interesting how it's not like if you're negatively motivate
you can't be successful I mean there's plenty of negatively
motivate successful people out there but what happens is that
they max out they hit a plateau once they get
a relatively comfortable level of living they're comfortable all the
sudden there's no more negative motivation the negative motivation robs
you of itself that's kind of the problem with it
it produces a yo-yo effect because if all you're doing
is you're moving in life to move away from pain
and discomfort as soon as you find a comfortable spot
you're going to stay there that's it you're done there's
no more motivation for you if you want to go
really far in life you need positive motivation positive motivation
it never wanes for example one of my motivations is
to get smarter about life to understand life better now
what does that is that positive or negative that's positive
right I'm not doing personal development and I'm not understand
understand life so that I can avoid all the pain
in my life that's not why I do it I
do it because it's fascinating to me and because it's
just interesting and because I see all the awesome ramifications
that come from that I enjoyed the learning process so
from that my motivation never wanes not long-term because I
can keep learning about life for the rest of my
life it's never going to end there's always something new
to learn whereas if somebody was doing personal development just
because for example oh I need to lose 20 pounds
before my wedding which is three months from now Leo
help me lose 20 pounds right before my wedding you
got to do it now give me some personal development
mumbo-jumbo so that I can quickly lose those 20 pounds
for that wedding see that's negative motivation as soon as
those 20 pounds are lost then it's like well screw
this purplevelvet still I don't care about anymore I'm going
to go off do my own thing and then what
happens you gain all that weight back that's what produces
yo-yo effects so positive negative keep that in mind here's
a basic check list to see why you're lazy number
one life purpose do you have a life purpose you
have a compelling vision of what you create with your
life what you want to create very very long-term I'm
talking twenty thirty years down the road do you have
that are you aligned with that are you working towards
it on a weekly basis if not huge problem you're
going to have lots of laziness problems because you're not
really you're not driven by anything you have it's like
you're a car with no engine inside you need someone
to tow you basically and that's what it is that
you're being towed through life and then if there's no
one towing you you're stuck the second point your top
ten values you got to identify what your top ten
values are and then you got to see is your
life aligned with those values are you actually acting towards
it if you're not if the stuff you're doing with
your life isn't aligned with your values for example if
your job isn't honoring your top values well yeah you're
going to be lazy there you can have a lot
of long term laziness problems third point on this checklist
ask yourself where are you in the cycle do you
know that life works in cycles and I don't mean
here the circle of life that's a different thing that's
when you're dead I mean life works in cycles as
you're going through life there's this natural ebb and flow
up and down cadence like this to your life and
it lasts one of these cycles can last for two
three or five years so these are pretty long-term cycles
how does one of these cycles work well let's say
you're starting a new project when you start a new
project you're kind of at the bottom of the cycle
you start some sort of new project or new endeavor
or whatever new chapter in your life and then you
start moving towards it's exciting you're working on it and
you're going up in a cycle then you really hit
your stride you're reaching towards the top of the cycle
then you're really at your peak you're really killing it
at your job you know whatever you've been trying to
do it's really clicking everything's working you're at the very
top of the cycle then naturally people expect like well
I'll just stay at the top no that's not very
natural the way life works is that you have an
ebb and flow so even after you've peaked you're not
going to maintain that peak there's going to be a
it can be a turn downwards the phase in the
chapter is going to be coming to an end the
movies coming to an end there's going to be a
climax right after the climax things resolve so that's what's
happening here it doesn't necessarily mean failure sometimes it is
a failure sometimes a catastrophic failure maybe your business catastrophic
a fails but most times it's not even that it's
just kind of a natural phasing out maybe you're just
moving on to bigger and greater things whatever a new
chapter in your life needs to start so now you're
going down in the cycle and then inevitably you hit
the rock bottom of that cycle this might be something
very serious like something bad happened to you some traumatic
event now you're very depressed you're suicidal you're very doubtful
or maybe you're just kind of feeling lost and lazy
and you're like in this rut you don't know what
the next thing is in your life you don't know
what the next chapter should be you're confused you're lost
you don't have a project to work on maybe you're
unemployed maybe you don't have a business it's kind of
stuff that's you at the very bottom and then from
that what happens is that through that process of contemplation
and kind of wandering and looking and searching and rediscovery
you come up with the next chapter and then from
that next chapter again the cycle starts to go back
up so understanding this you can ask yourself where are
you in this cycle right now in your life if
you're lazy and you're at the top of the cycle
well that's one scenario if you're lazy and you're at
the bottom of the cycle it's another scenario I mean
it's pretty natural to be lazy at the bottom of
the cycle and sometimes you have to let yourself be
that way because maybe you've just completed a really big
project or you just sold a business of yours or
whatever yeah now it's natural to be a little bit
lazy maybe should take some time off you know think
things through if you're the top of the cycle laziness
shouldn't really be a problem for you because you're going
full stride but sometimes you know you might have a
day or two of laziness here or there and so
that's okay notice where you are in your cycle the
next checkpoint on this list is when was the last
time you had a vacation how many months has it
been if it's been over six months then that might
be the problem right there I find myself I start
to become lazy after I've worked really hard for a
long time and I don't even acknowledge to myself how
hard I've worked so if you're having laziness issues when
you're at the top of the cycle maybe it's because
you've been working so goddamn hard to reach the top
and now you're at the top you just need a
little bit of a break you need to recharge those
batteries take your mind off the work you've been doing
or whatever and then you won't have these laziness problems
anymore so check in with that - so that's the
basics checklist but I have a little bit more to
say so maybe you're still lazy after all of this
maybe you pass all these points and you're lazy so
I mean if you don't have a life purpose expect
yourself to be lazy a lot if you're not aligned
with your top values expect yourself to be lazy a
lot if you're not taking vacations and resting properly expect
yourself to be lazy if you are not conscious of
this cycle expect yourself to be worrying about your laziness
and not understanding it in its proper context so that's
the reason I explain that stuff if you're still having
laziness issues habits habits are really key you need to
develop successful habits and I don't really want to cover
the process of making habits in this video just be
a little bit of a tangent I'll cover that in
other videos I have good videos about how to break
bad habits and how to start good habits the only
thing I'll tell you here is that you probably need
more success habits in your life and you want to
build them up slowly so if you're lazy right now
don't expect to just like go and jump out of
the bed and you know go to the gym and
you haven't been doing a gym in a long time
it won't work that way you know we got a
baby step that and build that momentum up build that
habit up over the course of the next month or
two and then I'll be okay so let's say for
example that you want to be an aspiring writer and
in your mind you're selling yourself well I got to
write this novel or I got to write this screenplay
but I've been so lazy I've been slacking off the
last two weeks and I keep pushing it off I've
been pushing off for a whole year now you know
you're lazy well in this case actually there's a procrastination
issue there which I have a video on I'll link
it below so check that out but also beyond the
procrastination you need to build a writing habit see what
you're probably telling in your mind is like well I
got to sit down and write this whole book or
I got to sit down and write the FIR chapter
or I got to sit down and do eight hours
of writing for the whole day no that's not how
a writer that's not how a good writer starts a
good writer if he hasn't written yet he'll start slow
right baby step that stuff so maybe today you just
spend one hour if one hours too much spend ten
minutes baby step it that's I have to do it
sometime especially when you're we're working really hard when you're
doing something ambitious you got to look into the future
and say to yourself well right now I'll start slow
and that's okay because the ramp-up will happen pretty fast
it's okay if you spend the next month just ramping
up slowly just to get to let's say five hours
of writing a day that's a lot of writing if
you can consist ly do five hours of writing per
day I mean damn you'll write anything you want really
fast so the key is to get you there right
you just don't jump there and one go and the
final point that I want to really make here is
how do you break out of laziness right now right
in the moment so the habit stuff that's more long-term
but you know what if like right now I was
sitting on my couch today and I didn't want to
go and shoot these videos I was really lazy in
fact in my mind I almost said like oh man
I'm it's just not going to work I'm not going
to do it today I'll I'll put it off to
next week or something like that I honestly didn't feel
like I would come up here but Here I am
standing in front of you shooting this video so what
happened I want to read you a quote from William
James I was thinking of this quote before I got
off my couch and it goes like this you can
act your way into right thinking but you can't think
your way into right action what does this mean there's
something very truthful about this quote very profound and it
says basically that if you're sitting there and you're trying
to think your way into going out there doing something
big it's not going to happen and that's what I
was trying to do on that couch I was trying
to sit there and like come up with a way
okay what kind of what kind of technique do I
do you know do I know what kind of like
psychological trick can I pull out of my bags of
tricks so that I can get up here and shoot
my and in fact I was thinking myself I started
and gilt myself and I started to say stuff like
well if I don't shoot my video you know what
are people gonna think of me when I'm shooting a
video about laziness and I'm being lazy myself you know
what gives me the qualifications to talk about it the
fact is that I am lazy there are times in
my life when I'm very lazy so let's be real
here I'm not standing up here and saying like I'm
never lazy it's just that it happened today that I
was able to motivate myself and the reason was was
that I stopped thinking about it and shirin it acting
thinking versus acting okay when you're really stuck just go
through the motions just go through the motions that's it
that's the best way to get yourself mobilized in the
moment so if you've got to get your ass off
the couch to the gym literally lift your ass off
the couch step 1 step 2 walk over to the
closet step 3 put on your shoes step 4 put
on your your jacket or whatever you need step 5
pick up the keys to your car step 6 walk
out the front door step 7 walk into the car
step 8 turn on them you know the music to
make yourself feel a little bit better when you're in
a car take your mind off of it don't overthink
this if this stuff is simple personal development is simple
two people over to overthink it and sometimes I don't
think that I'm helping with releasing all these videos because
honestly these videos can lead to like a big circle
jerk effect or all you do is you sit there
and you you do this mental masturbation all these cool
interesting concepts and ideas but then nothing happens because you
just don't take any action you can't act remember that
the first three letters of the word actualized is act
act action taking action action is a thing that determines
the winners from the losers in life the successful people
from the unsuccessful the self-actualized from the Unseld facts realized
its action and sometimes you just gotta say to yourself
just do it something you do it just do it
whatever it is that you're being lazy on right now
stop looking for a trick just go do it it's
not as hard as you think it is it's not
as painful it's not as bad your mind is exaggerating
that stuff just get yourself into action and put your
mind on something else while you're doing it soon soon
what you'll find is you'll be standing here speaking to
the camera you'll be enjoying yourself it'll be feeling pretty
nice you'll be wondering man how how kind I was
so lazy just a couple hours ago I don't even
know that was like a different person now I'm standing
here I'm not lazy at all I feel great in
fact this is my second video I already shot the
first ones the second one I really didn't feel like
I was going to do it but you know what
sometimes it doesn't matter what you feel like sometimes you
just move your legs you move your ass you move
your mouth and stuff happens it's pretty cool also another
trick is that don't build it up in your mind
like if to do it perfectly sometimes just tell yourself
you know what I'm just going to do a half-ass
job today I'm going to go to the gym and
just do a half-ass job you know instead of staying
at home from work I'm going to go to work
but I'll just do a half-ass job at work instead
of writing this stellar awesome chapter for my novel I'm
going to write a half-ass chapter for my novel that's
good because it takes the pressure off you it gets
you mobilized and once your mobilise allows you to build
up the momentum you need to then actually kick some
ass that day another tip that I like is that
sometimes when I'm feeling like it's really hard for me
to mobilize to do work just slow down slowly your
life down sometimes we try to speed things up so
we get more done but ironically what happens that we
you know we're moving we're moving there's so much action
going on but this action it's got no traction to
it so it was just like stuff flying in the
air but nothing really important is getting done sometimes you
guys like slow yourself down bring yourself back to your
own original principles and values that actually helped me today
- is that what I did is I started -
I've got a couple of blogs from some people that
I follow some quality blogs so I read that and
that started getting me thinking started my mind churning because
I wasn't really in the mood to think and come
up with you know new insights new ideas I wasn't
come up with the stuff but I started reading this
blog I started like reading this analysis it started getting
my mind to be doing analysis my mind has to
be analytical mode I'm shooting these videos so that's what's
happening right now I've kind of built up a little
bit of that momentum and that's because I kind of
allowed myself to slow down earlier in the day I'm
just said you know what I'm going to take it
easy today and if I read a book for example
if I picked up a book from the bookshelf and
I read that that would have helped me to because
like I'm slowing down I'm really focusing on the stuff
that I'm trying to do with my career with my
business which is you know delivering good insights to you
guys so when I when I focus on that that
tends to reground me and finally just acknowledge that sometimes
you're going to fail I mean honestly I'm standing here
in front of you but it could have been probably
a 50/50 chance that I wouldn't have done this video
today just because I was I was pretty lazy today
and you know what that's okay in the past that
would really guilted myself for it I was guilty myself
a little bit today but ultimately you got to say
to yourself you're not perfect and sometimes you're allowed to
be lazy and in fact it's when you try to
be perfect and when you try to be super productive
all the time that actually laziness tends to come up
and so you get laziness because you're over productivity backfires
on you now we've covered a lot of ground here
in this video this last point about over productivity backfiring
you got to ask yourself is that me am I
an overachiever type if you're an overachiever type that's a
perfect description of how you work but if you're a
lazy slacker type that's not you if you're a lazy
slacker type what you need to do is go back
to the beginning of the video and really look at
life purpose you don't got enough purpose in your life
you don't got enough positive motivation so you got to
work there and I got some videos that I'll link
