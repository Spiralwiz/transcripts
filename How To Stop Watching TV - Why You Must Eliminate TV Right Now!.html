hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org and in this
video I'm going to talk about how to stop watching
TV television ten years ago if you would have asked
me to shoot the video that I'm about to shoot
what you're about to watch about television it would have
blown my mind because where I was then compared to
where I am now is so radically different and my
views on television have really changed a lot this video
even though it might sound like it's something very simple
and very obvious you might have heard it many many
times before don't dismiss what this video is going to
show you because if you watch television the way that
most Americans watch television nowadays which is multiple hours per
day multiple week days per week accumulating up to 5
to 10 to 15 hours of TV time per week
then actually this video right here might be the single
biggest personal development gain that you can make in your
life just by changing this one thing and stopping to
watch TV I want to go into some of the
details here about the challenges with TV and I also
want to make some finer distinctions between what kind of
TV TV is OK and what kind is not ok
so let's crack into all that television is destroying your
life pretty simple pretty simple statement and this is not
a statement that I would have grete agreed with 10
years ago because I was so immersed in television I
love my movies I love my video games I love
my my TV shows I love my Discovery Channel my
History Channel I love my TV news and watching all
the politics and all the election cycle news all that
stuff I was very much immersed in it not only
that but in my own mind I was telling myself
this is actually a positive thing because I knew back
then that people were espousing theories about why TV is
bad for you but I actually had counter theories to
that in my mind and I'm saying actually TV is
making me more worldly I'm seeing things on TV I'm
learning stuff from the stuff that I see on TV
that I wouldn't have otherwise learned by myself that this
is helping me to become a more rounded human being
of course the same time that TV was numbing my
mind and creating a lot of other problems I want
to get it to here in a second so the
first thing that you have to start to realize about
this this TV that you're watching if you're watching a
lot of it is that your mind is going to
trick you and it's going to get you to come
up with all sorts of rationalizations for why this TV
that you're watching is good for you right and you're
gonna have theories you have all sorts of like counter
points to make against even the suggestion that you should
cut out TV entirely from your life and that is
what I'm suggesting here in this video is to cut
it out entirely I'm going to make a couple of
minor adjustments to to that blanket statement but generally what
we're talking about here is cutting it out entirely so
how is television bad we have to really build a
case for it because if you don't if you don't
buy into this case that I'm about to make then
you're not going to quit and see the challenge with
television is that it's everywhere anywhere you go there's TVs
even when you go nowadays to a restaurant there's a
flat-screen TV on the wall even if you go to
a hotel lobby there's a flat-screen TV I even go
to my apartment to get my mail at the mail
center there and there's a TV there playing movies and
and news that kind of stuff and at the gym
you see television screens so TV is everywhere and in
your house you probably have many of them and they're
probably always playing and so because of this there's this
like social social and cultural momentum to be watching television
so you have to kind of set some boundaries if
you want to stop because if you don't set these
boundaries deliberately consciously then you're just going to go along
with the flow you're going to go with the crowd
you're going to do what your friends are doing you're
gonna do what your family's doing you're going to do
what what people are doing at the gym or other
places that you go to in public and you're going
to watch that television that's just what's going to happen
to you so we have to sort of build this
case in your mind the first biggest thing that I
see that's a big problem with television is how negative
it makes you it makes you extremely negative it's funny
because I watch the comments that are left on a
lot of my videos on YouTube and one of the
things that I see there is that people will respond
with all sorts of like limiting beliefs about life or
they'll espouse he's like very deeply negative theories about how
miserable and horrible and brutal life is and I didn't
realize this myself until I started getting into a lot
of personal development you know going to seminars watching a
lot of products listening to audio programs and you know
smart people made smart points to me that I eventually
caught on to which is that a lot of the
negativity that your worldview has is simply the result of
the cultural conditioning that you're inundated with through television as
one of the primary sources I can guarantee you that
a lot of the people who espouse these very negative
views about life would think that life is very depressing
or horrible that there's a lot of murder and rape
and drugs and violence happening in life that the only
reason this is if you think this way is simply
because you watch a lot of TV if you didn't
watch TV if you didn't watch cable news if you
didn't listen to all the stuff that people are telling
you like that in the media then there is no
way that you would form a negative worldview like that
in your own life just from personal experience not if
you live in a first world country if you live
in a in a reasonably good area in a first
world country there's no way you would come to that
conclusion but a lot of people are extremely negative in
exactly those kinds of nice environments first world country nice
neighborhood but you've got this negative view of the world
why because you're watching so much goddamn television and the
stuff that television is reporting to you is all biased
what does it bias towards it's biased towards drama and
like excitement and shock value that's really what TV is
about that's what movies are about that's what TV news
is about that's what a lot of shows and even
documentaries which you would think would be objective and more
even minded more scientific a lot of them are also
about shock value simply the things that they're using to
focus on even if they're reporting a case accurately simply
the fact that they chose to focus on a rape
or a theft or a robbery or a war or
some sort of scam or a Ponzi scheme or some
sort of government corruption just because the news is choosing
to focus on these things that right there is already
biasing you towards having this filter of the world as
a negative place which is not at all but you
might think that because you watch so much television a
couple of other problems with TV it numbs your mind
so even though you could say that through television you
get to explore some of the world you get to
see what people are like through television you get to
learn about society through television there are some redeeming qualities
there but the biggest problem is that you numb your
mind as you're watching that TV and what that does
is it just like it drains your motivation to live
your own kind of life what I see happening and
this is something that I was experiencing for a long
time is that you start to get into this vicarious
mode where you're living life through other people you're living
life through your reality TV stars that you watch or
through an HBO show or through even news or documentaries
that's how you're living life you're not actually coming face
to face with three-dimensional life the way you would if
you put down the remote and shut off your cable
but instead you're you're just like looking at this screen
and you feel like you're living a real life but
your life is actually very two-dimensional and until you start
to go out there and travel and build an amazing
career for yourself and get into amazing relationships and make
friends with cool people and start earning money and creating
success in in the real world for yourself then really
you don't recognize how two-dimensional your life is so the
numb the mind-numbing effects are really pernicious the next thing
is that television promotes laziness this really goes along with
the 9-month numbing effects but the laziness comes about because
it's so easy to just sit down and plug into
an easy source of stimulation the TV right you get
home from work you're a little bit tired you just
want to unwind and so you plug in and you
stayed plugged in and do that day after day after
day week and month after month after month and then
go it goes into years what happens is that your
your willpower muscles just kind of drain and it becomes
very difficult to motivate yourself to go out there and
do something big with your life that's actually going to
require work and and discipline and some challenge to it
right for example to be very difficult for you to
go out and up there and start your own business
because when you do go to start that business the
first few obstacles are going to run into which was
inevitable you will when you start a business they're immediately
going to make you think like oh why am i
doing all this work when I could just go sit
from the TV and watch a nice comfortable show that
I like isn't that the easier and more comfortable life
why don't I just go do that why am i
bothering building this this whole business thing it's too much
work takes too much discipline there's all these challenges all
this frustration all this stress and then you say to
yourself ah you know what that can wait and you
put it on the back burner and you waste year
after year after year watching more of this TV so
that's how promotes laziness the other thing that does is
it really kills your schedule a lot of us these
days we're very busy we live lives that are just
inundated with all sorts of activity well television is what
it's doing is it taking all that discretionary time that
you have in your life which is actually pretty limited
because after work and after showering and go to the
bathroom a couple times a day and getting a couple
of lunches and dinners pretty much your whole day is
used up you only have about four or five hours
of discretionary time per day at at most that you
can use towards growing yourself or developing a business or
improving in your career we're doing something positive for your
life creating something positive with your life you don't have
so much of that per day and every day that
you waste an hour or two or even more watching
television that's precious time that you're wasting and that's destroying
your schedule it's really putting in a lot of filler
in there that's just making you more frantic more stress
and more overwhelmed because you have these grand goals for
your life but you can't accomplish them with all your
time is taken up by television the other way that
it's bad is that advertising is rare fit through all
television all of media basically the media is built to
accommodate advertising shows are literally designed so that they fit
in with it with advertising this is a really really
dangerous thing and you don't presently realize this if you've
been watching TV your whole life what I found is
that once I weaned myself off of TV then the
other thing that I got really sensitive to is how
pernicious the advertising is I haven't watched cable television in
in years now probably three or four years and one
of the things that I see when I'm at the
gym because we have TV monitors there I try not
to look at them but sometimes I do is whenever
I see an advertisement I'm very very sensitive to it
it's almost freaky how sensitive I am because I'm simply
not seeing them all the time but you see them
so much if you're a regular TV watcher that to
you you think like oh advertising and that's just nothing
I'll just sit through it or maybe all even you
know flip channels but the fact is that you're still
catching those ads and those ads are dangerous because they're
driving this kind of shallow consumers desire in you and
they're also filling you up with just like this very
stupid mind-numbing groupthink right TV makes you really soaked in
groupthink which means that you're going to think like the
general masses think and when you think like a general
masses think then you expect easy results you expect money
and fame and you think that some magic pill solution
is going to come along and fix anything in your
life and just like other other sorts of kind of
groupthink like that when you're buying into that it's really
difficult to then go do something extraordinary for life there's
going to be such a huge disconnect there because just
the philosophy of mainstream society is is completely anti mastery
its anti anything creating great with your life it's anti
that right it's just living a really humdrum 90 day
kind of nine-to-five kind of existence and then spending the
rest of your day kind of entertaining yourself being comfort
mode being stuck there and then your life just stalls
that's what that's about so that's very very dangerous and
the last thing is that TV is really distracting you
from your life purpose right what is it that you
want to accomplish in your life what's the impact that
you want your short existence on this earth to actually
create you can't have a really serious life purpose and
then to be spending even one or two hours a
day watching television there's such a huge disconnect between that
you really have to choose whether you want to have
your life purpose and you want to be making a
big difference contribution the world or you're watching TV doing
all the stupid stuff that your friends do and all
the stupid stuff that society tells you is easy to
do right because having a purpose working on that having
the kind of impact that you want growing yourself in
order to live into that purpose to share your greatest
gifts with the world that's very challenging that's difficult to
do that's why I do so much personal development because
I found that it's necessary in order for me to
live out my greatest dreams and my greatest goals but
I can't do that literally like right now in my
day I'm always scrambling I have so much stuff to
do if I was watching television there's no way I
could even accomplish a fraction of it all right it's
just totally taking me off my course breaking down my
momentum taking that motivation and willpower that I'm putting into
my life purpose if I watching TV the TV just
kind of sucks all that out from under me so
let's say a couple of distinctions here between television because
I don't like using the blanket term TV there's too
many different mediums out there nowadays that some of them
are actually good some of them are really really bad
so let's make some distinctions I think the worst thing
that you definitely need to cut out with no questions
asked is cable television right just cut out cable if
you have cable if you have satellite that needs to
be cut why because the problem with cable is that
it's always there right it's just like constant source of
comfort you can keep coming back to and keep coming
back to and keep coming back to so it's when
it's there at work or when it's there in your
house or if you work at home and you have
your own business that's extremely extremely damaging to you right
to always go to that source so you want to
cut that off so that even if you are watching
movies here or there or you're catching glimpses of the
TV at your friend's house or the gym you can't
sit down and watch four hours of it which you
inevitably will do if you have cable TV in your
house so you gotta like snip that cord and just
cancel it the next thing is DVDs I think DVDs
are actually okay if you want to watch films you
want to watch movies especially some of the class your
films that are out there go ahead and do that
I think that's fine just you know keep it keep
it moderate keep it reasonable if you want to watch
a couple of movies a week I think that's perfectly
fine if you want to like entertain yourself with one
of your favorite movies or a really high-quality movie I
think that for movies actually you can gain good inspiration
you can also gain creative ideas if you're a creative
type of person and your career revolves around that you
can get a lot of creative ideas from movies they
can also move you emotionally they can stir you which
are some of my favorite movies are the ones that
kind of do that and they can also just give
you kind of like an escape especially if you're working
really really hard and you want to use a movie
to get you some nice relaxation to get your your
batteries recharged so you can go and hit hard get
hit hard at work again the next day I think
that's fine just as long as you don't go overboard
with that stuff and what's nice with DVDs and remember
this is DVDs or blu-rays this is different than something
like Netflix because Netflix is again it's more like cable
I'm going to get to Netflix in a second but
DVDs are okay because usually you don't have access to
an infinite number of DVDs you can't just sit there
watch for hours of DVDs most the time you can
actually get in there put it in your DVD player
so that's a different dynamic right don't confuse this with
Netflix let's let's talk about Netflix and other streaming services
too so like Hulu Amazon video other kinds of streaming
services I look at these as the same as cable
TV they're in the same negative category this needs to
be cut so if you have subscriptions for Netflix Hulu
Amazon Prime whatever that kind of stuff is canceled and
cut all that stuff because the problem is that it's
too easy it's there right it's just there and it's
waiting to drain your attention in life and it will
trip you up and your willpower is not going to
be strong enough to withhold from it all the time
so even though you can use that for a while
you can't use it all the time and what you
really want to avoid are those like four or five
hour marathon sessions where you just sit and veg out
and your mind goes totally numb so get rid of
those movie theaters I think movie theaters are fine if
you go to the movies with your friends on Fridays
Saturdays that kind of stuff that's fine usually because it's
already expensive activity so you're not gonna be doing it
too often usually you're not going to go more than
once a week and you're actually there you're going out
with your friends you're socializing so that's a bit of
a different thing so movie theaters are not a problem
what is the problem is YouTube right you're watching me
on YouTube a lot of times and I think that
there's a distinction that needs to be made you can
you can watch YouTube but only watch it for educational
material not entertainment material because it's so easy to waste
hours and hours of your life watching funny YouTube videos
and quite frankly almost all the most popular channels on
YouTube virtually all of them are just like the most
stupid mind-numbing like lowbrow entertainment that you could possibly find
why are they the most popular channels simply because that's
what people are drawn to the easiest that's the easiest
thing to get drawn to because it's the most low
consciousness thing it's like the most lowest common denominator and
so if you're watching any of those kind of channels
unsubscribe from those channels they commit with yourself not to
watch anything funny or stupid on YouTube if you're going
to use you to use it for educational type of
information use it to watch documentaries use it to watch
lectures and Ted videos like that kind of stuff that's
more or less okay you don't want to go overboard
with those either but those are miles ahead of like
the mind-numbing that is 90% of what YouTube is so
watch out for that porn I'm not really going to
talk about porn in this video I'll show to dedicate
a video about porn the bottom line is you know
don't be too obsessed with porn think that's a problem
for most people because you just can't watch too much
of it it ultimately there's only so much of it
you can watch it's not going to waste hours and
hours of your day so my suggestion here is cut
cable TV cut TV news cut TV shows cut stuff
like Amazon and Netflix all the streaming services cut all
of that stuff educational material is a different story so
I actually use television nowadays mostly for education I'll use
it to watch seminars self-help products lectures and and and
like really high quality documentaries that kind of stuff I
think is really really good so it's not about the
screen the TV screen itself that's not what's kind of
evil about television the TV screen itself can be used
for a lot of good stuff right I literally have
a hard drives terabytes of hard drives full of like
amazing lectures from college professors and DVDs from various seminars
like amazing self-help seminars like that kind of stuff that's
life-changing stuff for me and if anything I need to
do is watch more of that but that's a very
different thing than the way that most people use television
I feel I see very few people using television in
this kind of educational way where I actually sit down
i watch I pause it takes like detailed notes it's
really like studying it's almost like being enrolled in like
an online college kind of course so if you create
that for yourself using your television or your your internet
or your computer that's that's perfectly fine I think that's
actually a really powerful way to grow yourself very quickly
and YouTube could actually be part of that strategy I
mean that's what I hope to do with my videos
here is I hope that I can use these videos
not to make you numb and to make you live
vicariously through me and just to be feeding you with
empty information but ultimately I hope that I give you
all this information and you're actually going out there and
implementing it on a daily basis right and eventually what's
going to happen is that I hope that you actually
wean yourself off of my videos eventually going to wean
yourself off and your life is going to be so
extraordinary it's going to be so three-dimensional that you're going
to say screw that guy leo I don't need this
channel I don't need these videos anymore I've got this
stuff figured out I can go you know to higher
sources of information like books and other plate and seminars
and you know mentors and my friends and stuff like
that and like learn really richly from that and live
this extraordinary life in the 3d not in the Toodee
so that's kind of where I hope you alternately get
to but it may take take some time to do
that so how do you actually go about cutting television
cutting it out of your life it's difficult I remember
the first time that I wanted to do this because
I saw that it was important and I was trying
to do it but I kept cutting TV and then
falling back off cutting TV and falling back off and
my biggest sticking point was that I was saying in
my mind that way well television it's serving an important
function in my life here's how my own mind was
thinking it was saying look I worked really hard I've
owned a business I'm earning some good money you know
I'm working more than eight hours a day sometimes so
I need a channel to relax I need a way
for for my mind to just kind of like mellow
out be chill and recharge my batteries and I'm really
low on energy all the time so teeny helps me
do that helps me relax otherwise I would say to
myself I'd be working all the time and I would
just burn myself out and so this was the excuse
that I was using to stay plugged into television for
a long time and I knew in the back of
my mind that there might be other sources of relaxation
out there for me other ways to relax and recharge
my batteries other than television but I kept justifying in
my mind and saying that well I try some of
this stuff like reading books and I tried some of
this stuff like you know going out for a walk
or you know doing these kind of other activities and
they just don't recharge me the way that TV does
and that's true because right now you're hooked to TV
like a drug and you probably don't even realize it
so you have these withdrawal symptoms and they're very real
I can remember right now my withdrawal symptoms about four
years ago when I was getting off of cable they
were they were they were difficult I would like tell
myself no I'm not going to do it and then
I would still turn the tv back on right and
I would go maybe for a whole week not watching
TV and that I'd be so tired for my work
and so like beat up after working so hard that
I'd be like ah I'm just gonna watch for an
hour too and then I would sit down and I'm
watching for five hours and then I would feel guilty
about it so it's like this cycle that goes on
and on it's very similar to to eating junk food
right if you're if you I've ever done an emotional
type of eating where you have a bad day that
you eat a lot and then you feel like you'd
like splurge and you just feel disgusting with yourself that's
what TV starts to feel like after a while so
here's how I did it I think the most important
thing is that you have to you have to be
honest with yourself and tell yourself that yes there's going
to be withdrawal symptoms and it's not going to be
a clean and easy break at first I think the
biggest thing is to cut your streaming services cut your
cable if you do that then it's gonna be difficult
for you to engage in too much television already right
there but of course you're still gonna have these withdrawal
symptoms and you're going to feel like well now I
have nothing to do with with this time I've no
way to relax and now you're going to feel stressed
about it and you might feel like it's actually gonna
affect your performance and your work in a negative way
and it might for a short while but I think
the thing that really helps with that is to start
to find activities to replace television right it's one thing
to just cut out TV and then have no other
plan for what you going to do at that time
it's another thing to replace it with something else and
you have to be smart about what you replace it
with this is going to be a personal decision for
everybody so for everybody that's watching this it's going to
be a different decision depending on what your tastes and
hobbies are and I think that one of the dangers
here is to to kid yourself and to tell yourself
well I'm just going to replace it with doing more
work or I'm going to replace it with doing educational
type of stuff or doing doing personal development you have
to you have to understand why TV is in your
life in the first place TV is in your life
because it helps you to on widen to recharge your
batteries at least that's what it was for me so
if you're also in that position then you have to
find a suitable activity that's also going to recharge your
batteries that help you relax right one of the problems
that I made is I was telling myself well I'll
just work a little bit more that doesn't tend to
work because if all you're doing is working for 12
hours a day then the TV was actually doing you
good because too much work just gets you too narrow-minded
eventually you do burnout so the activities I'm going to
give you here and while I give you a list
of activities try to find the ones that you think
are actually going to relax you and fill in that
that void that's going to be missing once you cut
out cable so here's some of stuff and for some
of you this will seem like work these activities for
others of you it will seem like a joy and
also remember that what seems like work today if you
do it for a while you do it for a
few months you do it for a year it can
actually become a joy and become a relaxation activity that
used to be a work activity so that's a further
wrinkle that gets thrown in here so here's the list
one is nonfiction books reading nonfiction books is amazing for
you amazing for your performance and it's a lot better
than reading fiction books fiction books can also have that
kind of effect that TV has so you could do
it but be careful don't get too drawn into that
next is audio programs I love listening to personal development
audio programs I have so many programs that I want
to listen to and read listen to again and again
and again that really helped me in my life that's
a really great way to take up your time and
it's also pretty relaxing to do that kind of stuff
you can just sit and passively listen it doesn't always
take that much effort the next thing is educational videos
like they talked about educational YouTube videos you can watch
lectures and seminars and Ted videos a lot of stuff
that's kind of on the border of education and entertainment
something that's a little bit halfway so it's not like
very rigorous educational material because that tends to require a
lot of brain processing power and that doesn't recharge your
batteries that drains your batteries but you can find stuff
that's kind of in between and use that to recharge
your batteries and also at the same time build up
your brain and personal development so you can kind of
be killing two birds with one stone there next is
meditation meditation is huge I'm going to take now for
an hour every day I actually feel like it saves
me some time of course it takes an hour out
of my schedule every day but I also get some
other benefits for example I feel more calm and relaxed
and I also feel like I need less sleep when
I meditate so don't dismiss that meditation although it might
sound boring it also might be stressful at first that
actually once you get into the habit of meditating it
can be a really pleasurable activity that you can just
literally substitute one hour of TV time with one hour
meditation time and feel very refreshed and relaxed doing that
another really simple activity that you could replace TV with
is napping this was actually really practical for me I
always felt guilty about napping and my mind was always
telling me well if I'm napping then I'm sleeping too
much I'm being lazy I'm not working hard enough actually
what I've discovered in about the last year or two
is that napping is awesome and there's no need to
feel guilty about it in fact if you're working really
hard then you're probably going to want to take a
nap sometime later in the day because you're just exhausting
your mental resources so much if you're working a lot
so for me I usually do take about a thirty
to sixty minute nap in the evening because then it
just like recharges me for another run at the work
that I'm doing and one big thing with naps that
I discovered is that I kind of have this almost
like socially conditioned negativity about naps and one of the
things I'd always felt my life that I have to
be running around in like doing stuff actively right and
TV I thought was kind of like also like an
active activity I actually put naps under TV kind of
on the hierarchy of of like important activities in my
life naps would be underneath TV but what I discovered
now is that like when you take naps and you
just kind of allow yourself to like relax and be
a little bit more chill with your schedule not always
needing to be filling your schedule to the brim with
activity then that's actually a really powerful way to promote
your personal development recharge your batteries and just like get
that happiness and calmness that you ultimately want right you
don't want to be frantic all the time you want
to start creating activities in your life that will get
you more of that peace and I find that naps
are really good for that and the biggest thing in
my mind was that I had to kind of condition
myself to say oh wait a minute naps are actually
like a very healthy form of relaxation right in fact
maybe they're one of the most healthiest I would probably
put naps and meditation as a top two healthiest ways
to just relax yourself and unwind along with that is
just simply doing nothing literally like just sitting around and
just kind of like enjoying the space that you're sitting
in and like doing nothing even if it's only for
10 or 20 minutes that can be a really good
way to slow yourself down and also just kind of
relax yourself because during your work day you're always like
trying to get stuff done everything's very goal oriented and
if you just kind of like sit down and have
no goals whatsoever that can be a good way to
recharge your batteries in and of itself other activities taking
walks spending more time with your pet if you have
a cat or dog playing with your cat or dog
more kids you have if you have kids spending more
time with your kids of course is a great thing
to do it'll help you it helps them going out
a lot of people nowadays are so hooked into media
TV internet that they don't leave their houses I know
I was like that I'm still kind of like that
I took I could force myself to go out go
out to bars go out to clubs meet with friends
go to the movies that kind of stuff do social
events so that can be a really really great way
to replace your TV and that's a really good thing
because when you're going out with your friends you're going
out to a bar or a club your mind just
is totally taken totally off of television and so I
find that that's a really good substitute because you're never
going to be tempted to go back to TV if
you're in a in a stimulating environment like a like
a nightclub or a bar gym if you don't work
out then spending more time at the gym actually what's
also cool is that when you reduce your TV intake
is that you can also up the amount of time
you spend at the gym and I often times find
that actually spending more time at the gym that I
normally would want to spend can actually be better because
you kind of like slow yourself down you give yourself
more time to enjoy the actual exercises that you're doing
you can do them a little bit slower and you
can kind of like relax and know that you have
actually a couple of hours to get through your whole
routine you don't need to be anywhere so I find
that that actually makes a gym more enjoyable if you
have a little bit more time you're not always like
working towards a clock at the gym because that can
be stressful next is a spending more time with your
friends just in a coffee shop or wherever you want
to meet them on the phone talking chatting you know
talking about what kind of life stuff you want to
talk about if they're your great friends that you probably
enjoy having deep conversations with them and that can be
a really great great way to relax unwind from work
and also learn stuff in the process because if you
have smart friends that are very positive they're doing a
lot of stuff in their life they're very ambitious you
can learn a lot from them just by sitting and
talking with them for an hour - next listening to
music there's another great activity that you can replace I
think that listening to music is not that damaging to
your psyche or doesn't make you that lazy maybe you
can overdo it but I find that generally listening to
music isn't too bad so that's a good way to
relax and it's also kind of similar to TV so
that might be a smoother transition for you than doing
something like replacing TV with meditation another thing that I
like is I've been really getting into it lately is
self-hypnosis audios there's a lot of audio programs on self-hypnosis
that you can buy and literally what these are they're
just like these guided hypnosis sessions it's just like a
voice talking it's usually soothe and calming and you can
find different hypnosis audios on different stuff like building your
confidence or improving your success with the opposite sex or
career money really anything or just generally relaxing and stress
reducing type of hypnotic audios and just like sit back
put your headphones on and listen to it for half
an hour or an hour they're going to help you
visualize cool stuff and that really promotes your personal growth
you get a lot of active personal development that way
but it's also like extremely relaxing and it feels extremely
good I've really been getting into that lately and that
the last one I'm gonna throw out there is cooking
cooking is a really great activity I find that you
can use it too at the same time build a
valuable life skill if you're a guy cooking with girls
it's a really hot commodity girls will love you for
that if you're a girl learning how to cook guys
love that too so really both sexes love for the
opposite sex to know how to cook and you can
also couple that with the nutrition that you should be
improving in your life right eating more nutritiously eating more
Whole Foods eating more raw foods or vegetable based foods
so cooking is good for you on that level too
so you're killing kind of multiple birds with one stone
and also I find that it can be relaxing once
you learn some of the recipes and stuff then you
can just kind of like go do your thing even
the process of going to the grocery store and buying
groceries that can also just be kind of like a
relaxing process and I find that it's very healthy very
healthy process so that's a list there's a lot of
stuff here and I'm sure you can come up with
a much larger list given your specific tastes and hobbies
and preferences and where you live and all the options
that are or are not available to you so sit
down pick one or two or three things that sound
like a really good substitute for TV that will help
to fulfill that role that TV is playing in your
life I think that's the critical piece here make sure
that the role that TV plays is also filled by
one of these activity that you choose don't choose something
that's totally totally out there something that would not be
a candidate as to replace TV and really the action
item for you from this video is really simple I
want you to cancel your cable cancel it right now
don't wait till the end of the month because you're
going to forget don't wait till the end of the
billing cycle call them right now and just cancel it
cancel your Netflix cancel your Hulu cancel your Amazon TV
cancel any kind of streaming services that you have that
give you really easy access to television cancel all that
stuff don't throw your television out because you'll be able
to use it for other good stuff like educational videos
and the occasional DVD so you don't need to get
rid of your television just snip that cable and I
want you to commit to a 30 day challenge this
is how I started to wean myself off television when
I got really serious is I committed to a 30
day challenge no TV for 30 days straight and when
you do this challenge I would recommend really going cold
turkey so I would recommend cutting off cable TV all
your Netflix all that stuff obviously but I would even
recommend that you don't go to movie theaters you don't
do any DVDs or movies of any kind you don't
even look at the TV monitors at your gym when
you're exercising you just kind of like look away do
that for 30 days straight which you're going to finds
if you do that for 30 days straight you're going
to get through some of those withdrawal symptoms and after
30 days you're not going to be thirsting for TV
as much and if you replace TV with some of
these other activities like meditation or naps or cooking or
listening to music then that substitution is going to take
place and you're not going to have that same drive
to go back anymore and once you're done with those
30 days see how you feel and if you're feeling
good just keep it going keep it going as long
as you can cutting that cable is going to help
you a lot and what's going to happen is that
even after those 30 days you still might feel like
you want to go back to TV you might backslide
a bit what I found is that really takes about
six months to twelve months of no TV to really
convince your mind of the fact that you don't need
it at all if you told me three years ago
or four years ago when I was in the process
of breaking this TVs watching cycle and myself if you
told me that I would be really happy standing right
here right now and not watching any TV in my
life for months on end I would be like no
way I couldn't do that I couldn't do that and
maintain my performance at work that's what I would say
but now I found so many other enriching activities in
my life that I would rather be doing the television
that I don't even think about it it's a pretty
amazing shift and just shows you how hooked your brain
can get on stuff because you can get so hooked
that you don't even realize how hooked you were the
whole time and this is going to improve your mood
this can improve your negative thinking this is going to
remove some of your negative beliefs or at least keep
you from being conditioned with even more negative beliefs it's
going to take you out of that consumer culture that
the TV ads are always trying to feed you and
it's going to free up your schedule and it's going
to free up your motivation and your your mental resources
so that you can be a little bit higher consciousness
and then go out there and start creating that amazing
life that you want to create if you're watching my
videos and you're subscribed to this channel alright so go
