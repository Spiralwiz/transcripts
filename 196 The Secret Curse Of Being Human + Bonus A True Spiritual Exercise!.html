            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Umt4ocxvnw0' target='_blank'>The Secret Curse Of Being Human + Bonus A True Spiritual Exercise!</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>The Curse of Being Human and the Grand Illusion</b>: Leo highlights a regret that most humans face at the end of their lifenot appreciating and being present in their daily life. He shares a personal experience of being preoccupied with errands, failing to enjoy a beautiful spring day. He discusses a client with relationship issues who desperately seeks love and intimacy, leading to problems in her marriage. Leos coaching sessions lead the client to a realization that she doesn't need a relationship to be happy, questioning her motivations for other life tasks such as career and starting a family.
</li><li><b>Living in the Future as a Barrier to Happiness</b>: Leo explains that the grand illusion refers to the pursuit of future happiness, often at the expense of present contentment. He believes that people can't genuinely be happy if they are constantly living in the future, and their mind constructs this conceptual future, a "matrix" that prevents them from appreciating the present moment.
</li><li><b>The Domestication of Humans</b>: Drawing from 'The Four Agreements' by Don Miguel Ruiz, Leo discusses human domestication. He uses his apartment as an example of a self-imposed cage that keeps him disconnected from nature and reality. He also references a study indicating that the human mind subconsciously finds images of nature more appealing, attributing this preference to our evolutionary history in natural environments. 
</li><li><b>The Concept of 'No-Need' for Happiness</b>: Leo returns to the breakthrough he guided his client to - the realization of not needing anything for happiness in life. This understanding is not a manipulation but must be genuinely adopted, requiring the letting go of the perceived necessity of relationships (or other desires). This realization confronts the grand illusion of pursuing future happiness, instead focusing on the appreciation of the present moment.
</li><li><b>Impact of nature on the human mind</b>: Our minds, evolved in nature, find simple, schematic representations of natural scenes pleasing. This fondness contrasts sharply with our usual reaction to depictions of a grimy cityscape. Our preference for nature comes from thousands of years of evolution, making us predisposed to enjoy the natural environment.
</li><li><b>Reconciliation of hippy and rational views</b>: Rational thinkers and nature-loving individuals like "hippies" can learn from each other. Despite not identifying with the hippy mentality, Leo has found himself growing softer and more appreciative of nature as he develops personally. This shift challenges his self-image, emphasizing the need to broaden our perspectives and learn from different points of view.
</li><li><b>The grand illusion and the voice in our head</b>: Happiness comes from being present in the moment, rather than working tirelessly for future achievements which only perpetuates the grand illusion. Our mind constantly spins future scenarios, limiting our ability to live fully in the current moment. This state of neglecting the present, according to Leo, is the "grand illusion".
</li><li><b>Simplicity of Enlightenment</b>: Enlightenment is profoundly simple  it's about silencing the inner voice, leading to a shift from future-focus to present-moment living. It marks the undoing of the grand illusion and embodies the acceptance of reality, in its beauty and imperfections. Enlightenment doesn't bring about drastic changes in reality but a shift in perspective.
</li><li><b>Changing perspective vs environment</b>: Our society emphasizes changing our environment (like improving finances, getting a better partner, etc.) to attain happiness which often becomes traps since they seek future outcomes. However, this results in missing the enjoyment of the everyday present moment. True contentment doesn't come from changing our environment, but improving our perspective. 
</li><li><b>The faulty mentality to perfect reality</b>: We often seek to perfect our reality based on our conception of happiness - from the material goods we amass to the lifestyles we aspire. However, these endeavors land us into a trap of constantly living in the future, always chasing the next improvement, thereby preventing us from appreciating the present. 
</li><li><b>Permanent shift to the present moment through Enlightenment</b>: Enlightenment allows a permanent shift from focusing on the future to appreciating the present. Even the simplest, most ordinary, and challenging things become beautiful when seen from the present perspective. Despite nothing essentially changing, your perspective makes everything different.
</li><li><b>Perspective's Role in Happiness and Personal Growth</b>: Leo discusses the futile cycle of constantly seeking the "next thing" to find happiness. He stresses the need for a perspective shift, realizing that happiness comes from silencing the inner voice, seeing through the grand illusion and dwelling in the present moment. He hopes his viewers can achieve this personal growth and die without regrets, having savored life's experiences without constantly seeking something better.
</li><li><b>Achieving Enlightenment through Embracing Present Moments</b>: Leo explains that enlightenment can only be achieved by mastering and quieting the ego, which persistently looks to the future. He paints a picture of enlightenment as not an ethereal state, but rather a grounded presence in reality and encourages the audience to undertake an exercise where they fully perceive an ordinary book with all their senses without analysis or judgments which according to him, exemplifies the state of true spirituality. 
</li><li><b>Actionable Steps towards Personal Development</b>: Leo emphasises the need to consistently practice being in the present moment and evolving mental development in order to break free from the grand illusion. He insists the concept of "being present" cannot be achieved just by telling oneself to do so but by working on their mental development through exercises like the one mentioned. He assures that struggles in staying present should be seen as steps toward breaking free from a future-oriented, hollow existence and towards appreciating the present. 
</li><li><b>Promotion of Personal Growth Course</b>: Toward the end of the section, Leo prompts the viewers to take action for personal growth by subscribing to his newsletter and hints towards his course dedicated to helping them master their psychology by reframing their thoughts and taking action toward a fulfilling life. He assures that consistent action, even in small steps, can lead to exponential growth and fundamentally change their lives, making it the best investment of time and energy.
