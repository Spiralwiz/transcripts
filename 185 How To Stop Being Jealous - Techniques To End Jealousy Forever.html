            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/2gFLwkeJYB4' target='_blank'>How To Stop Being Jealous - Techniques To End Jealousy Forever</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Jealousy as a Subtle Emotion</b>: Leo highlights how jealousy is an extremely subtle and undisclosed emotion, often unrecognized by its host due to its deceitful manner. It can disguise itself as other feelings such as anger, hatred, frustration, sadness or loneliness and manifest as criticism or demonization.
</li><li><b>Roots of Jealousy</b>: Jealousy arises from a threat to one's identity or ego. The identity, built from one's self-concept, beliefs, and ideations about oneself, feels the need for protection. Our self-image, whether perceived as good or bad, leads to the sense of ego and identity. Any sort of failure in reinforcing this identity is met with jealousy.
</li><li><b>Jealousy and Defense Mechanism</b>: Jealousy acts as a defense mechanism when one believes something valuable is being taken away or the self-image feels threatened. The ego often refrains from acknowledging its shortcomings, resulting in an overprotective defensive mechanism, such as jealousy. Our self-image can also be harmed if it fails to align with reality, further triggering jealousy. 
</li><li><b>Ego and Self-Deception</b>: Leo details how the ego operates through self-deception and avoidance. Authenticity is often disregarded due to the fear of nonacceptance or unsuccessful outcomes. This perceived inability to be internally content reinforces the need to meet external expectations, promoting pretentiousness, and amplifying the issue of low self-esteem. 
</li><li><b>Addressing Jealousy</b>: The path to overcoming jealousy lies in confronting the core issue: challenging the self-image that the ego is constructed on. Recognizing that jealousy does not contribute to success or well-being can help assuage the emotion. Leo also suggests paying attention to both external and internal manifestations of jealousy, further aiding in identifying and addressing the ego's protective instincts.
</li><li><b>Jealousy originates from internal insecurities</b>: Jealousy arises when one leans on an external entity (persons or things) for happiness and fears losing them because of not finding happiness within oneself. This leads to a threat to self-esteem, self-image, and one's beliefs and results in jealousy. 
</li><li><b>Jealousy is an internal issue</b>: The solution to jealousy is not external; rather, it requires self-reflection and self-acknowledgement of the ego. Convincing oneself of this helps initiate the journey of self-awareness, consciousness, and self-honesty for inner work to eradicate jealousy.
</li><li><b>Jealousy is harmful</b>: Jealousy prevents self-actualization, an extraordinary life, career success, and fulfilling relationships. Embracing jealousy limits individuals and keeps them from living a passionate life and achieving great things. Hence, addressing jealousy is vital to avoid toxifying multiple life aspects.
</li><li><b>Mindfulness is key to dealing with jealousy</b>: Noticing, labelling, and logging instances of jealousy can greatly help in managing it. It is essential to center oneself and reflect on personal principles and values in life to find grounding.
</li><li><b>Jealousy contrasts noble values</b>: Jealousy is mostly against the noble life principles and values of most people, like honesty, integrity, or justice. Understanding this helps ground oneself with the realization that jealousy is petty and beneath one's standards.
</li><li><b>Jealousy for winning is counterproductive</b>: Jealous strategies like criticism or passive-aggressive behavior to win can be volatile and damaging in the long run. Reflecting on how jealousy strategies will ultimately affect one's life is crucial to identify the harmful nature of such actions.
</li><li><b>Jealousy Actions and Ramifications</b>: Leo speaks about the behavior and outcomes resulting from jealousy. He highlights that the actions driven by jealousy, such as criticizing, undermining, and sabotaging others, are fundamentally harmful. They fail to yield the desired happiness or satisfaction, instead toxifying relationships, violating personal values, and negative psychological impacts.
</li><li><b>Controlling Others in Jealousy</b>: Leo delves into the concept of controlling others stemming from jealousy. When an individual attempts to control or manipulate another person's actions out of fear or insecurity, this constant state of protection and fear does not lead to happiness, but rather increases distress.
</li><li><b>Recognizing Lack of External Value</b>: He emphasizes that external factors like possessions, social status, or others do not provide genuine value or happiness. True happiness, peace, and fulfillment come from within. He suggests that even though an individual may believe that acquiring something they're jealous of will make them happy, it doesn't. This realization that happiness is an internal mindset is essential.
</li><li><b>People Cannot Provide Real Value</b>: Leo considers the common misconceptions about human relationships and their fulfillment. He explains how relationships can provide certain comforts, but they don't inherently provide happiness. Even love, he suggests, does not make a person happy unless they're already content within themselves. 
</li><li><b>Consequence of Flawed Inner Happiness</b>: Lastly, Leo expresses that if one is fundamentally unhappy or dealing with self-esteem issues internally, no amount of external factors, including love, will truly bring them happiness. Rather, it could lead to a state of being miserable with a temporary layer of love. To achieve happy love, one must first achieve inner happiness.
</li><li><b>Recognizing the limited fulfillment from external achievements</b>: Leo Gura shares a personal revelation that even if he achieves all his business goals, gets his ideal partner, earns lots of money, gets recognition, or has many subscribers, these external achievements will not make him truly happy. Inner happiness is what matters. He underlines how this realization can be forgotten and needs to be constantly re-emphasized.
</li><li><b>Applying mindfulness to jealousy</b>: Mindfulness, as Leo explains, is the practice of non-judgmental observation of what's happening in the present moment. Applying mindfulness to jealousy, Leo advises viewers to start noticing and labeling their feelings of jealousy as they happen. He stresses this practice should be done without self-judgment or interference. 
</li><li><b>Journaling your jealousy:</b> Writing down instances of jealousy can help to observe it objectively and see how it operates. This regular practice helps to increase accountability and self-awareness, which can gradually cure jealousy.
</li><li><b>Examining the roots of jealousy</b>: Mindfulness also involves delving into the underlying reasons for jealousy. Leo advises viewers to analyze why they feel jealous, what they fear losing, and how this reflects a need to protect their self-image. This self-image is merely a collection of ideas and beliefs.
</li><li><b>Stepping back from the ego</b>: Leo Gura suggests that viewers temporarily set aside their ego or self-image, observe the 'self' trying to protect, and acknowledge how petty this can feel. This reality check can realign individuals with their higher principles and values in life.
</li><li><b>Mindset shift towards those we are jealous of</b>: Leo proposes thinking favorably of those we find ourselves being jealous of. Instead of judging or being critical, try admiring or commending them. This counters the ego's protective tendencies and initiates a positive mindset shift.
</li><li><b>Adjusting to abundance</b>: By indulging in the practice of acknowledging others' achievements or assets, one moves from a scarcity mindset towards an abundance mindset. This overcomes jealousy and helps enhance the personal perspective. 
</li><li><b>Persistence is key</b>: The process of overcoming jealousy requires habitual practice of mindfulness. Being consistent and constantly applying these techniques will lead to substantial improvement over time. Leo Gura emphasizes that this process is an ongoing journey, not a one-time event.
</li><li><b>Overcoming Scarcity Mindset</b>: Leo Gura stresses the importance of abundance mindset in overcoming jealousy. He suggests encouraging and celebrating the successes of others, as well as believing in one's own potential for success and abundance. He urges viewers to move beyond the fear-based scarcity mindset and develop faith in their own resources, attributes, and capabilities.
</li><li><b>Dealing with Low Self-Esteem</b>: Gura acknowledges the hurdle of low self-esteem in adopting an abundance mindset. He emphasizes that these issues might stem from past traumatic events, unfounded beliefs, or lack of love received during childhood. While these deep-seated issues cannot be addressed immediately, he recommends gradually pushing one's comfort zone and taking conscious steps toward developing an abundance mindset.
</li><li><b>Various Techniques to Address Jealousy</b>: Gura suggests employing practical techniques to overcome jealousy, including mindfulness, studying the ego, and seeking out resources on self-esteem enhancement. He encourages the use of affirmations, visualizations, and regular meditation to deal with low self-esteem, negative emotions, and to discover that true happiness emanates from within.
</li><li><b>Constant Practice and Commitment</b>: Gura stresses the importance of consistent practice in eliminating jealousy. He advises viewers to commit themselves to the implementation of discussed techniques until the issue of jealousy is completely resolved.
</li><li><b>Encourage Engagement and Spread Awareness</b>: Leo asks viewers to engage with the video by liking, commenting, and sharing it to help spread awareness about the topic and allow him to continue producing free content. Additionally, he invites viewers to sign up for a weekly newsletter at Actualized.org, which contains new videos and resources on self-actualization subjects.
