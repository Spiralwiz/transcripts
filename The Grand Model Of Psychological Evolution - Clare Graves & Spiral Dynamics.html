Hey, this is Leo, for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm really excited to be digging deep into the Grand
model of psychological evolution brought to us by Claire graves,
and the guys from spiral dynamics, this is a really
deep topic, and you're gonna have some mind blowing epiphanies
if you stick with me we have a lot to
discuss. So I'm just going to go right into it.
I have a lot of material that's kind of technical.
That involves lots of research that has been done by
amazing individuals in the last 100 years. One of them
being Claire graves, the other two being back, and Cohen,
who are the guys behind spiral dynamics. And also, I'm
going to talk about Ken Wilber, I'm gonna bring in
some ideas from Eben Pagan and why it would small.
So these were, these are amazing researchers, these guys, and
the depth of insight that they have put together in
creating this model. This is a model of how the
human psyche develops, both for individuals. But also, as societies.
It might seem a little bit abstract, it might seem
a little bit philosophical, like what what does this have
to do with improving my life or self actualizing? You're
gonna see that it has an enormous amount to do
with it. So let me first before I start getting
into all the technical details, and the history and all
the pieces of this model. Let me just give you
a little bit of why this is significant, and why
you should stick with me here, and why it's going
to be worth your time. All right, so imagine, if
you will, that there was a I don't know, like
a roadmap or a path, a well trodden path that
human beings have walked down for 1000s of years, because
it just so happens that this human brain has a
certain psychology to it. And the psyche, what we call
the psyche, that includes all the different psychological aspects of
the brain and the mind. What if that had a
certain structure to it and always tended to unfold in
a certain very predictable way? Wouldn't it be useful to
you? If you're trying to self actualize and trying to
get the most out of your life? And you're trying
to evolve to your fullest potential as one of the
psyches? Wouldn't it be worth it to you to study
what this path is? So you can see potential blind
spots and obstacles that are on this journey? Wouldn't you
like to know what the journey entails, rather than just
doing it the way that most people do, which is
just kind of assuming that, hey, I'm the first one
that's ever been alive. No one before me, really counts.
Let me reinvent the whole wheel. Let me make all
the mistakes myself. And let me not even look at
the research that has studied 1000s 10s of 1000s of
individuals, and as found common patterns between the problems that
they have, as they're evolving their psyche wouldn't be worthwhile
for you to figure that out, to take a look
at that research and to see oh, oh, there's that
thing up ahead. Maybe I can avoid it a little
easier now that I noticed there? Well, that's exactly the
benefit. So it really helps to know what the path
is like. And you know what, this might come as
a shock to you. But you're not the first human
being that's been born onto this planet. There have been
billions before you. That being the case, why reinvent the
wheel? Why not take a look at what has already
been discovered? Let's use the wisdom, discovering prior generations, and
from all the studies that have been done on entire
demographics of peoples, and use that to our advantage? Also,
wouldn't it be cool to have a model that would
help you to understand why human beings behave in the
ways that they do? Why are they so irrational? Why
do they hold such crazy beliefs? Why did they start
wars? Why do they have relationship problems? Wouldn't it be
cool to understand why that is happening? On a very
deep and fundamental level? Wouldn't it also be cool to
understand why we have the social problems that we do?
Why we have certain political problems, why we have certain
economic problems, while we have certain factions within society, that
fight each other, or wage, influence campaigns, political campaigns against
one another, or that demonize each other wouldn't be cool
to understand why that's happening. Might be useful, those things.
And also, wouldn't it be cool to know how to
speak to certain groups and certain populations of people? Because
you understand where They're coming from psychologically so that you
could lead them. If you want to be a leader
so that you can lead them. And you could speak
to them in your message instead of clashing with their
beliefs, actually dovetailed with them. And so that they understood
you, they're able to hear you and you can understand
them, would not perhaps be useful to you, as you're
trying to go out there, and maybe live your life
purpose, or starting a business or creating that dream career
of yours. But just maybe, just maybe, throwing it out
there for you. And I think that perhaps the biggest
and most significant thing is that, wouldn't it be nice
to see the blind spots created by your psyche, by
your ego. Because if you study personal development at all,
at any great length, then you know that it's you
who is your own greatest enemy. And it's the blind
spots created by your ego, that are the real obstacles
on this journey of self actualization. So wouldn't it be
cool to learn from others what those blind spots are,
so that you can maybe get a little bit more
awareness into what they are for you. That's the significance
of this model. All right. And what I'm gonna be
giving you here is kind of a hodgepodge of a
bunch of different research and ideas from different people, mostly
from Clare graves, Beck and Cohen from spiral dynamics, Eben
Pagan, and why would small who actually took a whole
seminar, a 25 hour seminar I watched on just this
model. Some of you bitch and moan that my videos
are long, no, try sitting through 25 hours of just
what I'm telling you here for 25 fucking hours. All
right. Now, if someone does a seminar for 25 fucking
hours on one topic, you would probably think that that
would be an important topic for you to know. So
maybe it's worthwhile for you to invest an hour of
your time, just to get a cursory overview, I'm not
going to give you all the depth, I'm just going
to scratch the surface for you here. This topic goes
extremely deep. And if you can master this man, you
are going to be in the top point 00 1%
of the entire global population, for understanding human psychology and
for understanding social psychology, and also in your own personal
development. So let's get into it. So basically, what are
we talking about here? What do we mean by psychological
evolution? And this whole topic basically falls under the theme
of developmental psychology. So what is developmental psychology? Well, what's
interesting is that they discovered that the psyche, the way
it evolves and grows, there's actually a directionality to it.
Meaning that it takes certain steps forwards, and it doesn't
really take those steps backwards, which is kind of interesting.
And here's just one example. Carol Gilligan, who's a psychology
researcher. She did some, some famous research, and she did
research on feminine morality. So she wanted to see you
how does the female mind cope with moral questions as
it matures and develops? What happens? And what she did?
She ran some studies, and one of the studies she
ran went like this, she just went around and asked
women do women have a right to an abortion? That's
what she did. And then she got basically three types
of answers. The first answer was yes. The second answer
was no. And the third answer was yes. But now
we need to dig into the reasoning behind each one.
So the first answer went like this, it was basically,
yes, women have a right to an abortion, because that's
what I say. And what I say is right, and
you can either take it or leave it. That was
the justification. Now, the second answer was no. And the
justification for that No, was no women cannot have an
abortion, because society or my religion or my belief system,
or the Bible says that it's wrong. And so therefore,
no. And then the third answer was, yes, they can
have an abortion. In certain circumstances, you have to take
into account a lot of different aspects of this issue.
And in certain situations, you can see that having an
abortion is a lesser evil, rather than the greater evil.
So you make a pragmatic choice in that situation. It's
a yes. Now, what's interesting is that as she did
this study, what she discovered is that someone who answers
first in their maturity level, you know, the first Yes.
Later on in life, they might evolve to No. And
then later on in life, they might evolve to the
next level of Yes. Which is the Yes. Which is
conditional on circumstances, the picking the lesser of the two
evils. And what she discovered is that people move up
this chain of levels, but they don't move back down.
So it's never the case that someone says yes, under
certain circumstances, when you analyze the facts of the situation,
and it's the lesser of two evils, then you can
say abortion is okay. They never regress back down to
saying, yes, because what I say is right, and that's
the end of the story. Or they never regress down
and say, No, because the Bible says it's wrong. And
this is a very interesting finding. It starts to show
and this is just one example, one case study here,
what are one study, out of many, many studies, which
I'm not going to go into, that show that there
is a certain directionality to how the psyche develops, morally,
spiritually, within relationships, within one's attitude towards the world, within
the way that one views religion, and belief systems, with
one's attitude towards society and the world at large. There's,
like a maturation process, their maturity happens, and that maturity
has a direction to it. Now, if we're doing self
actualization work, wouldn't it be nice to know what that
direction is? And where the arrow was pointing us to?
Like, what the hell is over there? And where am
I on this scale? Am I down here? Am I
in the middle somewhere? Or am I moving over here?
And what's above me if there is something above me,
and that's exactly what we're going to talk about now.
So, the research here, mostly comes originally from Claire Graves,
who is Claire graves. He is a researcher back in
the 1950s. And what he did is he was a
psychology researcher at a university in America. And basically what
he did is he just got curious about interviewing and
talking to various undergraduate students that were coming through his
university. And there was a lot of students coming through
foreign students, local students, hundreds and 1000s of students. So
what he did is over the course of like five
or 10 years, he would actually take every new student
that would come to the university, he'd sit them down,
and he would interview them and ask them questions. And
then he would run some various assessments that he developed
on them to see what's their thinking, like, what's going
on in their heads? And the question that he asked
him, it was really a simple question. It's like, what
are your values? What do you value? What do you
find meaningful and important in life? And what he discovered
after doing a lot of this kind of questioning and
questioning 1000s of students, both men and women, is he
discovered that, oh, there are certain patterns, values are not
just random. There seem to be patterns. Not only are
there patterns, but again, there's a directionality to the values,
it seems that certain people hold one set of values.
But then later in life, those values evolve. And then
those evolve, and those evolve, and those evolve. So where
are they all evolving to? And here's what he discovered.
And this has been kind of confirmed for many other
angles. Because there's been a lot of research done, it's
a whole field, this is called developmental psychology. And if
you want, you can go and read books and study
all the technical stuff that they've discovered about this. But
what I'm gonna give you now is I'm gonna give
you the, the graves model. It's got stages on it,
there's like seven stages. And then spiral dynamics, which is
a kind of taking the graves model, and then developing
and evolving it even further with some practical applications. That
was developed by Beck and Cohen. And they published a
book called spiral dynamics, which goes into a lot of
depth on this stuff. And what they did is they
took the original graves levels, and they gave them colors.
Colors are just like labels to help you to identify
and remember what these stages are. So here, I'm going
to give you these stages. Now these stages are very,
very interesting, because these are the major stages through which
human beings evolve. This happens both individually, so it'll happen
for you in your life. It also happens collectively. So
it'll happen to your country, it will happen to your
business, it will happen to your family. All right. So
this is extremely, extremely applicable. So let's get into these
stages. The first stage we're not going to spend a
lot of time on it because it's, it's not where
most people are. It's called beige, the color beige. And
what it is, is it's basic organisms survival. So here,
what the organism is doing is, it's realizing like, Hey,
I'm an organism I was born, I exist, and I
need to survive. So the organism basically just uses its
innate instincts to meet its biological needs, for food, for
water, for warmth, for safety, for sex, just the basic
stuff. So you might think of it as like, you
know, a very animalistic way of life. And what are
some examples of beige that you might see, well, for
example, babies or infants are in the beige stage, because
they're not really interacting with other people, they're not really,
you know, cognitively developed yet, they're just kind of like
surviving as an organism, they're struggling just to survive. Also,
the mentally ill, they're just basically struggling to survive and
just kind of meeting their basic biological needs. Also senile
elderly people. And perhaps you might think of a bum
on the street, who's a little bit like, got a
few screws loose in his head, and it's just kind
of surviving on the streets. And so, every one of
the stage, you're gonna see that there's like patterns to
these stages. So we're gonna kind of go through, and
we're gonna talk about each stage. And we're gonna talk
about what the stage is about. We're gonna give characteristic
examples of each stage. So you can practically know what
it means and where you find it in your life.
And also, you're going to have something called the transformational
dilemma, each stage of the transformational dilemma, which is kind
of like you might think of it as the barrier
from stage one to stage two. Like, why is there
even two stages? It's because there's a barrier between the
two. And that's what Eben Pagan and then White Wood
small called the transformational dilemma. And for each stage is
slightly different, the barriers are different. And so for beige,
the dilemma is that, well, yes, I'm an organism. And
I'm living here, and maybe I'm surviving just fine. But
there's other organisms around me. And so now I need
to learn how to interact with those other organisms. And
so I can't just really survive off on my own,
I have to survive collectively with other organisms. So me
just focusing on meeting my own biological needs, that's not
sufficient to really survive and thrive. And so I have
to transcend and move into the next stage, if I
really want to survive and thrive in the world. And
so then the next stage comes, and the next stage
is called Purple. That's the color. And the key labels
here are magic and tribal, Purple Magic tribal. What is
this stage? Well, here you have the first tribes or
groups of human beings coming together. So you have ethnic
tribes. And this is like, you know, think about how
human beings probably lived 50,000 years ago, very, very basic,
before there was even civilization. Before there was even really
societies, people lived in tribes of maybe 20 or 50
individuals, maybe 100 individuals, you can still find such tribes
living in remote parts of the world. So maybe tribes
in the Amazon, or tribes in Indonesia, you know, they
have these tribes or tribes in Africa. So they're living
in this purple stage. This is not just describing the
social structure, it's also describing the individual psyche, because the
social structure is kind of a outgrowth, you might say,
of the psyche. Now, what characterizes the Purple Magic, tribal
psyche? Well, it sees the world as a very mysterious
place, fundamentally, because it doesn't have science. It doesn't have
philosophy, it doesn't have a lot of advanced technology. It's
just very basic and very primitive. And also, it needs
to protect itself from dangers from the environment, which are
still very serious, because you don't have technology to protect
you. And also, you need to protect yourself against other
tribes. Because one of the most dangerous things when you're
living as a human being in a tribe is not
lions and crocodiles. It's other tribes, other tribes will come
and kill you. And they'll steal your women and they'll
rape them. Right? And then they'll murder all your children.
So you need to protect your tribe. So it's really
much very centered on tribalism. Not only that, not only
are you living as part of a tribe, and really
your identity is not as an individual, the way we
think of ourselves nowadays, is mostly as a unit of
the tribe. You're like a school in a big I
mean, you're like a fish in a big school of
other fish. Like a little fish in something larger. So
in a sense, you're like, a little piece of a
larger organism, and that is the tribe. Now, this seems
pretty foreign to us, because we don't live in tribes
anymore. But still, this is our heritage. This is where
we came from. Also this kind of psyche, the magic
psyche, why do they call it magic? They call it
magic. Because this kind of mind who's not familiar with
rationality yet, or science, it, it thinks in supernatural ways.
And so it sees the world is inhabited by powerful
spirits, ancestral spirits, or ghosts, or different deities. It also
thinks of the world in terms of good and evil.
Like good is everything that's good for the tribe. And
evil is everything that's bad for the tribe. So what's
the most evil thing for one tribe? It's the neighboring
tribe, who they're at war with. That's what is most
evil, right? So you make demons out of your nearby
neighbor tribes? Or maybe you make alliances with them, and
then they're their friends. So this is how the mind
thinks, what are some examples of this purple stage? Well,
we'll already said the Amazon tribes, Voodoo, practicing voodoo might
fall into this category. How about folk remedies? You know,
there's all sorts of weird folk remedies that you might
find in third world. As far as like medicine goes,
it's not necessarily rational, it might be like very far
fetched and kind of mystical or mythological. Who knows if
it even works or not? It's kind of like, just
weird, right? Modern science wouldn't approve. So this is what
I call folk remedies. Also, clan warfare, very characteristic of
this stage, magic rituals, you might see people in the
Amazon, you know, putting on masks and then dancing and
hollering and going into some ritual, and then maybe, you
know, slaughtering some animal, this kind of thing, because they
believe it appeases the gods. So this is very much
part of the purple stage. And the classic medicine man,
you know, the witch doctor, also a part of this
stage? What is the transformational dilemma of this stage? Well,
the barrier that keeps these people from moving on to
the next stage is basically this, that they're very much
identified with the tribe. And what they need to do
is they actually need to let go of the tribe.
And one of the problems is, is that you, in
this stage have to really sacrifice your individuality for the
sake of the tribe, right? You kind of become this
tribal zombie. And also, you're sacrificing for the tribe. And
as you're doing this, you kind of get this idea
like, Hey, why the hell am I giving away all
my power? And why the hell am I being an
equal in this tribe? Why am I not dominating everyone
here, if I dominate everyone in the tribe, and I
become the leader of the tribe, that would be much
more beneficial to me, that would be quite lucrative. And
so that opens the door to the next stage. And
the next stage is called read. And it's egocentric power.
This is pure, unadulterated use of power for self gratification.
So you have an impulse, and you want to satisfy
that impulse immediately. And to hell with what other thing,
what other people think about it, or how it might
affect other people. So you know, if I can go
steal that person's farm, and his woman, then I'll just
go do that. To hell with them, I don't care
about them doesn't matter to me how they feel, doesn't
even matter to me what the future consequences might be,
doesn't even matter that I might endanger myself by going
and starting a war with that farmer. I just want
his farm. And I'm powerful, and I have powerful friends,
and I have powerful weapons that I've developed. So I'm
just going to go and take what I want. That's
the characteristic type of thinking of the red psyche. It
wants to fight for physical domination, and has a total
disregard for rules. So all the rules that were set
up and kind of the the social norms that were
set up in the society, when you go to read,
you break all those, you try to distance yourself from
all those. And in fact, you use them to your
advantage in order to become more powerful, or more wealthy.
So, what are some examples of red? Well, for example,
a gang leader or a dictator. Or another good one
is the mafia. Or any criminal, maybe a con artist,
or a James Bond villain. I like that one think
of a James Bond villain. You know, it's like, they're
totally egocentric. They don't care about who they're stepping on.
They're ready to destroy the entire world as long as
they get what they want. And of course, the dilemma
for people that are in red, is that this kind
of impulsive thinking that they do, they don't really think
too far into the future. This impulsive thinking their need
to gratify themselves right now, in the moment is very
disastrous in the long run, for them, and for anyone
who's following them. Another problem is that physical force becomes
unsustainable. You can't just go around killing people all the
time. I mean, you can for a while. And that's
what a dictator does. But inevitably, every dictator gets deposed.
Because people don't like being dictated. And people don't like
being murdered. And so they don't tolerate leaders who murder
them in the long run, they never do. And of
course, there's a really deep problem is that this type
of behavior, of just taking things without considering other people's
feelings, it tends to hurt people close to you that
you actually love. Right. And so it really kind of
backfires on this individual who's going really, really read, it
starts to backfire, and they start hurting everyone around them,
they start hurting themselves, and so becomes unsustainable. And so
then that opens up the door to the next level.
Now, let me just pause for a second as we
go on here to make a couple of comments. So
first comment is that, notice that there's an alternating pattern
of the psyche fighting for itself, and in the psyche,
sacrificing itself for the sake of the community. So what's
interesting in these stages are that they alternate. So for
example, the first stage beige, it was mee, mee, mee,
Mee Mee it was all about me. The second stage,
purple, that was about the tribe. So there it was
all about tribe, tribe. So other other other other other,
not me, but other. Then it alternates and comes back
to red, which is again, me, me, me, me, me,
me, me, it's all about me. So what do you
think happens when you go from red to the next
stage? Right, it alternates again, and now it becomes about
other again, other other other other. And we're going to
see this pattern, continue to repeat. Also notice that when
you are in one of these stages, you generally don't
recognize that you're in this stage, it's not clear to
you, you're completely unconscious of this. So if I was
talking, this information right now, to someone who's stuck in
red, or someone who's in purple, or someone who is
in beige, it would completely go over their head, they
would have no idea of what I'm talking about. Also
notice, not only do the stages, not know that they
exist, they also actively despise one another, which you're going
to start to see as we move forward here, but
we're going to start to see and I want you
to look out for this is just how much one
stage fights and clashes with the next. Because that's what
actually kind of creates the compartment of a stage. For
example, the tribe, it was here at purple, and it
was all for the tribe. And then the next compartment
is actually breaking away from that and creating the next
stage, you have to kind of break away from those
values and move to almost opposite values, which is like
fuck the society, fuck the tribe, I'm going to do
exactly what I want. And they're going to obey me
or I'm going to kill them. Right? So it's kind
of the exact opposite. So you're swinging your pendulum. And
it's really interesting how the psyche works, because basically what
it's doing is the psyches kind of swing as pendulum
from one side, to the other side, back to the
next side, and to the next slide. So just kind
of swings like this as you're moving up this staircase.
And you're going to see this more and more as
I explained more these stages. Also notice that you probably
have a tendency to judge the stages as I described
them. So in your mind, you might be saying, oh,
yeah, stage read, that's the bad stage. No, there's not
a good and a bad stage. The next stage is
not necessarily better than the old On stage, we're just
kind of scientifically describing a pattern of development to the
psyche. Also notice that each of these stages comes in
a sequence. And you don't just get to skip stages.
So it's not like you go from beige, being a
person who's just concerned about biological survival, and then you
jump straight to read egocentric power lust, and you become
a dictator. No, you go through the intermediate stage, which
is tribalism. You have to go through that. And only
after you've gone through it, and you live through it,
and you've passed through that hurdle, the transformational dilemma of
tribalism, which is that, you know, it's not really that
cool to always be sacrificing for the tribe, you have
to pass through that barrier to then enter into red,
then you have to break through that barrier to go
into the next one. Right. So what's very interesting here
is that if we can peg you at one of
these stages, then we'll know what the next stage is
for you. And we'll know exactly what you need to
do to evolve past it. Is seeing the power of
this. Okay, good. So let's move on, from Red, to
now blue. What is blue, blue is called absolutist, conformist
rule, or civilization. This is where we have civilization emerge.
We had tribes before which were not real societies. Then
we had this kind of chaos and lawlessness, this kind
of gangsterism, this kind of Mafia ruling dictatorship, which, you
know, it's really hard to build a civilization, when there's
blood baths going around everywhere. So what's necessary to build
a civilization? Well, the psyche has to again go from
self swing from self to other, because civilization is about
other. So here, the psyche of sacrificing self for society?
And how does it do that? Tradition, rule of law,
heritage, family, obedience. These are the values that a person
in blue really identifies with. There's a strong belief in
good and evil. There's a strong belief in a god
and a devil. And there's a strong certainty that absolute
truth exists, and that you know, absolute truth. There's only
one religion. All other religions are false religions, only your
religion is the true religion. Likewise, there's only one God,
one true God, and he's the one that you know,
and all others are false. In this kind of thinking,
there's a cultural monetarism, what's called cultural modernism. What does
this mean? It basically means that you don't recognize a
plurality of cultures in the world, you only see your
culture as being the only valid culture. So it's kind
of like you're culturally blind. Right. And there's a sense
of cultural superiority. So of course, your culture is the
only really valid culture, your culture is the noble culture,
and all other cultures, their heathens and barbarians. This type
of psyche sees the world and the universe as simple,
rational, and able to be broken down into very rigid
categories. There's not a lot of gray area here, the
world is black and white. Here's how you do it.
This is how you build a society, we have these
rules, we have these laws, we have these customs and
traditions, this is what you do, it says so in
the book, go read the book, you don't agree, go
read the book. If you don't follow the laws, we're
gonna lock you up, or we're gonna kill you. Because
we can't just have people running around. And, you know,
behaving like gangsters or dictators, that creates too much chaos
to sustain civilization. So we're going to lock you up,
put you in prison. That's how this type of thinking
goes. And here, there's an emphasis on, you know, sacrificing
for the families, sacrificing for the country, sacrificing for your
nation, that sort of thing. And, of course, you know,
protecting your civilization from all neighboring civilizations, because you don't
want to be conquered by a neighboring civilization. So you
want to preemptively attack them, or you want to convert
them, maybe even better yet. We'll go find those heathens,
and we'll convert them we'll give them our Bibles. And
we'll teach them our language. And we'll teach them our
customs. And either they convert or we kill them. That's
the attitude here. And there's no questioning this. If you
question this, you're a heretic. If you're questioning this, we
exile you, we imprison you, we put you under house
arrest or we kill you doesn't even particularly matter. Your
disagreement is based on factual evidence, maybe you found some
new science, that tells us that something we believe isn't
quite true. Well, but it says in the book, it's
true. Look, the book says it's true. So it must
be true, we've been doing it for 10,000 years, so
must be the right thing to do. We've been doing
it for so long, it's correct. Tradition is important. You
can't go against tradition. That's how blue thinks. Now notice,
now we're starting to get into this territory, we're actually
you might start to identify with one of these stages.
Beige, purple, red, those stages are hard to find in
the civilized world. Why? Because, because those stages were all
kind of killed off. And civilization has overtaken those. But
as we keep going, you're gonna start to identify more
and more with type thinking. Also, notice that you might
have a lot of disdain for this type of level.
So if you're at a higher level, and you're looking
down on blue, you might be thinking yourself, man, these
people are crazy. How can they be so dogmatic? How
can they be so certain? How can they be so
black and white in their thinking? How can they be
so rigid? How can they not see the limits of
their thinking? This is characteristic of every stage, every stage
that looks down on the stage right before it sees
that stage as either stupid, crazy, or criminal, or insane.
One of those. This is a key insight key is
like 90% of the world's conflicts that are happening right
now that have happened through all of history come from
this one insight right here. And what's interesting is that
the stage that you're at right now, whatever that ends
up being, what's kind of shocking to realize that there's
always a stage above you. And that as much as
you might think that you're at the top, and you're
as good as it gets, and that everyone below you,
you've kind of surpassed, and they're all crazy and stupid
and criminal, well, you look crazy, stupid and criminal and
insane to the stages that are above you. And now
that's a bitter pill to swallow. But if you can
swallow that pill, that's where you get some massive personal
development, right there. And I'll point that out to you
as we go. So what are some examples of blue?
To me, what comes to mind is the Islamic world,
the Arabic Islamic world is very, very traditional. You know,
it's very rigid kind of system. In the West, we've
kind of moved a little bit away from blue. And
we've moved more towards the other other stage, which I'm
gonna get into in a second here. But you know,
I think about the Iranian government, for example. It's, it's
like a religious rule government. Think about other examples, such
as fundamentalism. And there are all sorts of different forms
of fundamentalism, from Islamic fundamentalism, to terrorism, to the fundamentalism,
even in America, and you got fundamentalism pretty much in
every country, if you you don't even even need to
look that deep. We have a pretty strong streak of
fundamentalism here in the US, actually, the Bible Belt, very
blue absolutist cause conservatives, politically, conservatives are absolutist blue. Think
about the Amish. How do the Amish live? They live
in this kind of system, right? It's a very rigid
system, where you have almost no individuality. There's no real
value for freedom or expressing yourself. Why? Because you're sacrificing
all that frivolous shit for society to make civilization strong.
And also, very interestingly, I would put the Zen Buddhism
in this category right here. Zen Buddhism, and I'll cover
that a little bit more as we go on. But
basically, you know, Zen is a very rigid way of
doing spirituality. It's like you do it this way. There
are these rules. If you don't obey this that I'm
going to hit you over the head with a stick.
That's a blue spirituality for you right there. Of course,
you know, Christianity, Catholicism, all the major religions, Islam, all
completely blue. See, what's interesting is that when you have
a very rigid and hierarchical religion, a bureaucratic religion, that
it helps to stabilize and cement civilization. So these two
kind of come hand in hand. In fact, one of
the characteristics of blue absolutist is that you have very
rigid hierarchies, and bureaucracy, because you need this in order
to sustain a civilization. What's the transformational dilemma that keeps
blue from advancing to the next stage? And what's the
problem with blue? I mean, seems like it would be
nice to have a great functioning civilization. So what's wrong
with that? Well, the problem is, is that this kind
of black and white thinking doesn't really work too well,
in a gray world. Reality is pretty complex, and gray.
And we don't admit that you have problems. Another problem
in this stage blue, is that you need to start
to interact with other cultures. And you have to start
to see like, Oh, my culture is not the only
culture, there's other cultures around, there's people on other continents,
the world is a big place. And I have to
somehow reconcile the fact that, hey, my culture might actually
not be superior to that culture over there, it just
might be a little different, but not superior. Another problem
is that the ego, because the ego was sacrificing for
society here, you know, after a while of doing that,
the ego gets hungry, again, for individual success, because the
pendulum has swung this way. And now it kind of
wants to swing back, because maybe it's swung too far,
in the self sacrificing direction. And the other thing, of
course, is that these rules and categories and hierarchies that
are created by civilization, these caste systems, they tend to
be pretty oppressive. And, you know, we like freedom. We
don't want to be oppressed, especially if you find yourself
on the wrong place in the hierarchy. I mean, if
you're at the top, you're happy. But if you're at
the bottom of the hierarchy, you're not happy. So you
want to change in that system. So what happens? Well,
after a while, you get fed up with all that
shit, and you want to move up, and you want
to move up into the next level, which is orange,
orange is individualistic. Now we get individualism. And there's a
focus on success. And now also science comes into play.
Now we got science. So here, we're getting into what
most of you who are watching this video, are probably
in this stage orange. And thinking about myself, I think
a good chunk of me is in this orange. And
this is where most of Western society is right now
is in orange. So let's describe orange in quite some
detail. What is orange, orange believes that the point of
life is basically material abundance and comfort. Also, the point
of life is scientific progress, technology, what we're going to
do is we're going to use science and technology, which
has been working so great, we can use it to
manipulate the world to create the most comfortable and exciting
and easy world that we could possibly live in. And
we're going to make ourselves happy by all this cool
technology. And we're going to allow ourselves to express ourselves
now we're not going to deny ourselves reckless sacrifice for
society. Now we're becoming savvy consumers. And so I'm an
individual thinker now. And I value freedom and liberty and
all this. And I'm a real smart consumer, I'm a
real picky consumer, I'm gonna go and I'm gonna, I'm
gonna go buy the things that I really liked to
buy, I'm gonna wear the things I like to wear,
I'm gonna get the sunglasses that look cool on me,
I'm gonna get the cool car, I'm gonna get the
nice house. I'm gonna impress everyone with the stuff that
I own, and I'm gonna be happy. That's how orange
things. Also, with orange comes the rise of business. Power
is no longer really in the hands of civilization, and
kind of government power shifts into business. Now, it's the
economy. Stupid, is the economy that's most important is money
that runs the show with money. I can buy anything
I want. I can control governments, I can buy the
government if I want with enough money. And so here
you have big businesses growing up, right? You've got the
stock market. You've got progress at all costs. How do
we keep the economy growing? The worst thing that can
happen is that the economy stops growing. That puts a
wrench into the wheels of the whole Orange paradigm, right,
because we need more progress, we need faster progress, we
want to be working 2000 hours a year, we want
to be working ourselves to death in the name of
progress and material abundance. Orange again shifts towards ego away
from selflessness towards ego. But it's different than it was
with red because red was also about ego. Whereas red
ego was about like, all just kill you, if you
don't give me what I want, like total blatant disregard
for others, orange actually cares about others to some degree.
So orange is not going to go out of his
way to just like, totally damage and obliterate other people.
So a person that orange is not gonna go murder
you, if you don't give them your wallet. But orange
will manipulate and scheme and plot and do something more
like white collar crime. So maybe he'll scam you. Or
maybe he'll come up with some system that will just
kind of get as much money from you as possible,
sell you some cheap, little flimsy product and exploit you.
So here it's kind of like business exploitation starts to
happen. So what are some examples of orange? Wall Street
as an institution is totally orange, right? It's just like,
me, me, me, me, me, give me the most money
I can get screw everyone else in the sense that
I don't care. Like if it bankrupts the, the taxpayers,
I don't care if it kills the company, I don't
care if it hurts the shareholders, I'm just gonna get
as much money as I can from the stock deal.
And fuck everybody else. It's not going to kill them.
But it'll hurt them financially. But yeah, I'll just rationalize
that away. Because, you know, I got to take care
of number one, first, I need to buy that jet
and that yacht and that house? Because that's what's gonna
make me happy. See how the psyche is thinking this
stuff. You see how the, the institutions and the customs
of the society at this stage actually come out of
the psyches thinking about these things. Another example is just
CEOs. Think about CEOs, modern CEOs with golden parachutes who
earn 50 or $100 million a year and are totally
on a on a shamed of it. Even though you
know they're earning 1000 times more than the people that
are working under them. Think about the modern businessman as
an example. Think about the scientist. The scientist is also
orange. What are the scientists doing he's he's fighting for
truth and progress route for rationality. And science is often
in league with business. So business funds science. Scientific research
comes a lot from the business sectors. So those two
just like you had to state in the religion in
blue in Orange is business and science. Now that's the
that's the Alliance there. It's important. Think about the corrupt
politician. What's the corrupt politician doing? He's not a dictator.
You know, he's not doing something as bad as a
dictator is but taking some money on the side here
he's selling a vote here he's he's kind of currying
favor with lobbyists here maybe he shouldn't be doing that
or whatever. But he does it anyways why? Because he
can buy his wife a nice still third or 10th
house or whatever. And he can take her to the
Bahamas and shit like that sounds like a selfishness there.
Republicans, Republicans that have as a political party, very orange.
They're both kind of orange they can also be blue
color who said conservative is an example of blue. Well,
orange the Republican is like a camp you know, it
can have some blue people in it. Have some orange
people in it? You know why? Because hey, lower my
taxes. I don't want to be paying for all this
shit for society. Fuck that. I want to keep as
much of my tax as I can so I can
spend it on shit for me. I don't care about
the poor. I don't care about health care. I don't
care about all this bullshit. I just care about me.
It's just all about me. They'll figure out how to
fend for themselves. Everyone should fend for themselves. Right. I
mean, look, I had to fight real hard to get
to where I am now. That person is a bum
he's lazy. He's not fighting for it. So he doesn't
deserve as much as I have. I deserve it. I
worked hard for it. I to fight for it. Maybe
even had to scam someone for it. Or construction sort
of business that sucks some money out of somebody. Other
examples? Well, probably you. You are probably here or some
aspect of your psyche is somewhere in this ballpark. And
you know But if I'm really honest that I have
to admit that I'm probably in the zone to at
least some psyche, or a good chunk of my psyche,
maybe a third of it is in this zone at
where I am in my development. Okay, so you might
say, well, Leo, what's the problem with, with being, you
know, success oriented? And science? Isn't science, good, and individualism
and freedom, those are all great virtues. What's wrong with
that? Well, I mean, it's a step up from blue.
But there's something above orange. The transformational dilemma for Orange
is that materialism does not get you happiness. So all
the shit that you're doing in your life that you
think is going to make you happy, once you do
it all, and you get it all. And you're, you
sell yourself for money. You realize, like, oh, shit, I'm
still not happy. What do I do now. All also,
you start to realize and become conscious of the fact
that your selfishness is hurting other people. Not as bad
as it used to when you read, but it's still
hurting quite a few people. And also, now what starts
to happen is that we have a huge civilization. And
we have the earth. And as we're doing business, and
as we're filling our bellies with materialism, so to speak,
we're destroying the resources of the planet. And here you
have these problems with, you know, companies who just shame
shamelessly rape the planet, you know, strip rainforest, and drill
for oil and spill it everywhere and don't give a
shit about anything. As long as they're increasing their shareholder
profits. That's all they care about. So that starts to
become a big problem. Because after a while, you know,
at first that works, but if you do that for
a couple 100 years, what happens is the planet starts
to get destroyed. And you as orange living in an
orange world getting polluted and kind of toxified by all
the shit that orange people have been doing. You look
around, you're like, wait a minute, guys, hold on. Can
we keep doing this forever? I mean, what happens when
like, the ice caps melt, and we all fucking drown?
Because we've put so much co2 into the atmosphere, what
happens then? Well, then you start to realize, like, oh,
shit, maybe my being orange, and my chasing for money,
and just selling myself out, has kind of like, robbed
me of my humanity, and put me out of touch.
And also, there really is some damage that I'm doing,
to people to the environment, and so on. Okay, so
once you realize that, what happens, then you move on
to the next stage. And what stage is that? That
one is called Green, green is relativistic. It's caring, and
it's communal. Those are the key words. So what happens
here is there's again, the pendulum swings, back towards other
away from self. There's a return to humanity. There's a
return to humanistic values. There's a return to spirituality. There's
a rejection of shallow materialism. I no longer care about
just getting money or making money. Now what I care
about is connecting with people. It's all about relationships. It's
all about connecting with others. It's about understanding others. It's
about peace and love. That's what we need in the
world. How do we heal the world? After all the
damage that orange people have done? Well, we feel it
through sharing and caring. Also, we have to recognize the
validity of other cultures. So you know, we need to
preserve every culture on the planet. No culture is superior.
No, religion is superior. They're all different and unique in
interesting ways. And we need to preserve them all. Not
only do we need to preserve them, we need to
help the poor, we need to make sure they have
health care. We need to make sure that people have
fair wages, and that they're not getting exploited by business.
We need to have unions to protect us from big
business and from those greedy CEOs. Also, we need to
look out for the environment, because the environment is getting
destroyed and Mother Earth is what you know, allowed us
to be born in the first place. And also while
we're talking about Mother Earth, we need to protect the
species that are here, because every day hundreds of species
are dying because of human activity. So we need to
prevent that we need to protect all the endangered species,
make sure that they're all safe and secure, and that
we're preserving the planet for future generations. You see what
I'm doing? I'm kind of taking on the voice of
green. This is how green thinks. This is how green
talks. This is a While green values, there's a real
turn towards empathizing. Now, with other organisms, human and even
non human, right? There's a deeper empathy here, you start
to care more about the feelings of others. Orange, and
Orange CEO doesn't really care. If he builds his new
oil drilling station on some natural reserves, he doesn't care.
A green CEO would be like, No, guys, wait a
minute, we have to run a sustainable company. If we're
going to drill for oil, we have to do it
in a very sustainable way. Let's go someplace in the
middle of the desert where there's no one that can
harm and we'll put the oil drilling station there. And
we'll make sure that even though you know, yes, we're
gonna, we're gonna sacrifice some profits, but it's okay, we're
gonna explain it to the shareholders. And we're gonna try
to tell them that actually, we're doing good in the
world by making this decision. Right? That's how a green
CEO would think. What are some other examples of green?
Democrats Lean Green, of course, hippies. New Agers the whole
New Age Movement, Greenpeace, great example. Liberal liberals in general,
progressives, social workers, think of a spiritual Meetup group, that
would be very green. Also, people in academia tend to
skew green. Think about support groups where people come together
and share their feelings and provide emotional support for each
other. And I like the example of the Care Bears.
The Care Bears are very green, you can call someone
a Care Bear. What does that mean? That means that
they just have this bleeding heart that they care so
much for everybody. Now, what's the problem with green? The
problem with green is that it's overly idealistic. Yes, you're
caring, and you're sharing and all this. But the problem
is that just caring and sharing doesn't solve the world's
problems. You're not going to save polar bears just by
caring about them. And you're not going to solve solve
the AIDS epidemic by just caring about people with AIDS.
And you're not going to feed the poor, with just
care and love. You need real tangible solutions for that.
So green starts to see after a while of caring
and sharing, and spilling their hearts out that that's not
helping the world as much as we need it. And
the other problem is what I call false spirituality. So
people in green, they tend to go to yoga, they
tend to meditate, they tend to read spiritual stuff, you
know, hippies, but actually, they're not really spiritual. They don't
understand what spirituality really is. It's kind of like a
very shallow surface level, spirituality is all the accoutrements of
spirituality without the real depth of spirituality. So that's the
problem with green. Now notice, it's interesting. Because if you're
orange, and you're listening to me talking about green, you
might be saying yourself right now, wait a minute, Leo,
what are you smoking? Green is not above orange. Greens
should be below orange. I'm scientific and rational. And you're
telling me that the hippies are above me? No, no,
no, no, you got it backwards. But yeah, I got
a bitter pill for you to swallow. The hippies are
above you. And what's going to have to happen for
you, if you're an orange, chances are you are an
orange, is that you're going to have to deal with
that transformational dilemma that we talked about, of how your
selfishness is hurting the world, and how your lack of
care for others is ultimately coming back and hurting you,
and how you're shallow materialism and progress and your champion
of spirituality, how ultimately, that's not making you happy. And
that's not solving the world's problems. You have to recognize
after a while that shit, that's a real problem. You
have to admit that and accept that and only then
what will happen is that you will move up to
green, and then actually, you will start to care more
about the world. Your circle of concern is going to
expand out beyond you. Now for Orange, that seems very
distasteful. Well, I got news for you. Going over the
barrier to the next stage is always distasteful. How do
you think blue felt when he had to move into
orange? He felt extremely unhappy and afraid doing that? Because
Blue was thinking that shit. Orange is the enemy because
orange is all individualistic. individualism was going to destroy society.
That's exactly, for example, how, how Islamic states and Arab
nations think, right? They're very rigid with their rules, because
they think that if they relaxed the rules, then like,
MTV, and the gays will come in there and destroy
their beautiful culture. And, you know, in a sense, maybe
that's what will happen. But nevertheless, you know, that's kind
of like, where the psyche and the developmental line is
going into this with. Well, likewise with orange, orange has
to let go have its selfishness to move into green
and it doesn't want to move into green because like
shit, I don't want to be a hippie, those hippies.
They're lazy, they have no work ethic. They're so sappy.
And Emotionally, I don't want to turn into that. But
that's kind of the bullet, you have to bite. And
then once you move through green, what happens? Well, green
is not the end of it. But here's something very
big and revolutionary happens. Because here we move from tier
one. Everything we've talked about so far, has been tier
one. Now we move into tier two. And tier two
is a whole new shift. Why? Because tier two is
called Yellow, I mean, NOC tier, but the next stage
is called Yellow. But Yellow is in tier two. It's
systemic thinking and integration. I'll explain what that means in
a second. But basically, the significance of the tears is
that yellow is the first stage that actually understands and
is aware of all the prior stages. Green, didn't know
about green, orange, didn't know about orange, blue, didn't know
about Blue, and it didn't know about anything else. That's
been true all the way up to yellow. Now, when
you get into yellow, oh, man, you start to see
this whole model. In a sense, this model, the graves
model that I'm explained to you, this is a yellow
development. Because now what's happening is now you're starting to
see the world in a much more complex, many shades
of gray sort of way. And what yellow is about
is about systemic thinking. So life is gray for yellow,
life is very complex life is also paradoxical. Also, we
have to start to see that people see reality from
different perspectives, and that there is no absolute truth. What
there is, there's multiple perspectives. And each perspective might have
a partial half truth to it. And we have to
somehow reconcile that a yellow source to see world problems
as systemic problems, not personal problems. It's not like that
country is evil, or these people over here are stupid.
It's not like that, is that no, society is evolving.
And society is this living, breathing organism, and it has
certain structures. Now certain structures are getting in the way
of other structures. So if we want society to advance
more smoothly, what we have to do is we have
to come up with better systems and structures, and make
sure that every complex thing interacts with itself in the
right way without hurting or sabotaging itself. And here, you
get into what's called ecology. Ecology is exactly this. It's
systems thinking, on a big scale. Yellow gets concerned about
how do we solve world problems? How do we solve
real problems, not by just ramming our solution down someone's
throat, but by actually understanding that person's perspective, let's go
study all these cultures, let's understand what their problems are.
Let's understand what levels of the hierarchy they're on. If
we're going to be dealing with those people in Africa,
who are at Red, or at Blue, or if we're
gonna be dealing with the Islamic world, which is blue,
and if we're gonna be dealing with Western societies, which
are orange, and we want them to all interact together
and communicate effectively and not kill each other, then we
to come up with some systems for how to make
that happen. Let's go do some research. Let's learn. So
yellow places a really high priority on knowledge and multiple
perspectives. Yellow also places a high priority on competency versus
bureaucracy and rank. So whereas before the people with the
power were the ones who were in the best, highest
position. Well, yellow doesn't believe it. That's right. Yellow things
that Hey, guys, let's put the smartest people in power.
let's elect a president who is like actually intelligent, let's
select a PhD professor as the president, not just some
charismatic guy who doesn't know anything about the world. Very
different way of thinking. Yellow is an extremely rare, very
tiny percentage of the population right now. Because yellow takes
incredible open mindedness, the kind of open mindedness that most
people are not willing to accept is frightening. Degrees of
open mindedness is also high levels of personal development is
required to get here, you don't just get born and
get here, you to work really hard to get up
here really hard, right? You need to be very self
honest need to be aware of the ego and how
it works. You need to be working on yourself constantly.
You need to be breaking through those transformational dilemmas at
every stage, right? Imagine how many of those you have
to break through to get to yellow. And each one
of those is very distasteful to break through. Now notice,
yellow, when you talk about yellow to someone who's in
blue or an orange, what do they see? They see
yellow as this relativistic space cadet, who's just like lost
in his head like a philosopher. That's what yellow looks
like. Because everything is so complex and nuanced and gray.
And there's like literally no more absolute truths for yellow.
Imagine that imagine honestly, approaching life as though there are
no absolute truth. Everything is a perspective. Everything is a
perspective. Science is a perspective. Religion is a prospective political
parties or perspectives, different cultures or perspectives. Think about that.
That's not how most people think. Most people say no,
Leo, this is how it is. This is what I
believe this what people told me this what I learned
in school, that's what the Bible says. But you've transcended
all that stuff to get up to yellow. Yellow is
also chill and cool with all the other stages to
an extent. Why? Because yellow finally understands what's going on
here. Yellow understands that there's multiple levels, yellow understands that
these levels spiked with each other. Yellow understands that each
level believes that it's the right level. And most importantly,
is that yellow finally is conscious of the fact that
it too is a stage and that it's not the
highest stage, and there's something above it an additional level.
And yellow finally sees like, Oh, shit. There's another transformational
dilemma ahead. There's a barrier, I have to pass through
that barrier to move to the next level. But Yellow
is cool with that. Rather than resisting it yellows like?
Yeah, it's gonna be kind of a pain in the
ass, but I got to do it. Cuz I'm just
gonna grow myself even more. So yeah, let's go do
it. Let's go face that transformational dilemma. You might wonder
who are some examples of yellow. And this is hard.
So hard to pinpoint examples because they're not that common.
They're quite rare. But I'll give you a couple of
individuals. I think that Eben Pagan, who's I think is
one of the most incredible modern self help guys out
there who's working in self help field. Definitely, if you
watch any of his material, it's got a very strong
yellow flavor to it. Like multiple perspectives very objective. Kind
of able to do the rational and the emotional combine
them together. Really cool guy. Also, Ken Wilber, Ken Wilber
epitomizes yellow, because he's got this, his whole, his whole
approach to philosophy and to spirituality is like taking 20
different perspectives and integrating them all together and coming up
with this kind of meta perspective, from all the little
perspectives. So these people tend to be like highly intellectual,
highly complex people. They tend to be somewhat individualistic, because
again, we shifted away from green, which was about other
yellow shirts back more towards ego and self. But now
the difference is that it's about self but it's not
about self and trying to hurt other people. It's about
trying to be very responsible as a self. So it's
like, Yes, I'm earning money for myself. Yes, maybe I'm
running a business, but I'm doing it in a very
responsible way. I don't want to hurt other people. In
fact, maybe what I wanted to do is I want
to empower other people with this business that I have?
Perhaps certain academics are in yellow. Maybe Albert Einstein, I
don't know, just kind of a guess. Maybe Albert Einstein
was kind of pushing towards yellow, or maybe he was
green, kind of hard to say. I don't know, I
think maybe Barack Obama might be yellow, because he's kind
of a complex thinker. You see that? You know, compare
Barack Obama with George Bush, actually very interesting. George Bush
was a blue and orange thinker. Barack Obama is probably
like a green slash yellow thinker. And it just shows
and how they communicate, how they do interviews, and stuff
like that. Although I can't be totally sure. So what's
the transformational dilemma for yellow? Well, yellow is stuck in
his head a lot, because yellow is building models for
everything. Kind of reminds me of me. And then what
the problem is, is that just building models, and having
complex gray thinking, still doesn't solve the world's problems. So
you disrupt a ton of except that shit, I have
to accept it. And then I have to move past
that, and move into the stage that's above me. And
what's above me, it's turquoise. Turquoise is holistic, global actualization.
Here, you're really concerned about the whole globe. Again, we
went from swing your pendulum here at yellow to ego,
now it's swinging back to other from self to other.
Here, what starts to happen is the rational and the
intuitive and the emotional, all starts to synergize. And come
together. In here, I think that you start to get
a taste of true spirituality, right, a real embrace of
spirituality, but not in a dogmatic way, in a very
open minded and judgment free type of way. And honestly,
I have a hard time talking about what's that turquoise?
Because I don't really understand turquoise, I don't know, what's
that turquoise? Really? I don't know who were examples of
people at turquoise? I really don't know. So I'm not
going to say much about that here. And that, basically,
is what we've got. So we've got this whole spectrum.
So take a look, where are you on this spectrum?
Kind of interesting to look, I'll give you a warning.
If you're trying to peg yourself somewhere here. Your ego
will play a trick on you. And what it'll say
it'll say this. Number one, it'll say, No, Leo, you've
got the order of all these stages backwards. You're not
right about this stuff. I'm, I'm orange, maybe I'm orange,
or whatever you say I am, I'm orange, let's say,
but you know, green and yellow, those are above me.
Or you might say oh, there's nothing above me. So
that's one thing you might say if you're real stubborn.
But if you're a little more smart and wise than
that, then the next trick your ego will play on
you. It'll say all I'm not orange, I'm yellow. I'm
not green, I'm turquoise. I'm not blue. I'm green. There's
a pattern here. And the pattern is that the ego
likes to think that it's two steps above where it
actually is. So blue will skip past orange and its
mind and go to green, blue thinks it's green. Or
orange skips past green. Orange doesn't want to be a
hippie skip past, green thinks it's yellow. Green, green doesn't
really like the idea of yellow, and it skips past
all the way to turquoise. That's what tends to happen.
And of course, red. Red, doesn't like blue, but it
skips over blue and thinks that it's orange. So like
a criminal is not gonna think of himself as a
criminal or as red. He'll think of himself kind of
like the Wall Street CEO. He'll justify that way. So
with that in mind, Peg yourself. Also, take note that
it's not that you're just in one of these categories.
This is a general schematic, and where you actually draw
the line is somewhat arbitrary. So you can be a
mixture of these things. You could be 30%, orange, 20%,
green and some other percent yellow or whatever combination. That's
possible. Personally, for me, I think that I've got like,
at least a third orange, maybe even 50% orange and
then I've got maybe 20 or 30% Green, and then
another 20 or 30% Yellow And, you know, if I'm
in my lower self, then I'm skewing more towards orange.
And if I'm in my higher self, that I'm skewing
more towards yellow. And I'm kind of a little bit
avoidant of green, maybe a little hard to judge yourself
on these things, but kind of give you an example.
So you can be a mixture also recognized and this
is important is that these stages also happen along different
developmental lines. So imagine different axes, if you will, for
example, moral, the moral axis, spirituality, the spiritual axis, mind
or cognition, the cognitive axis, there's also an emotional axis,
there's a relationship axis, there's a sexuality axis. And so
on each of these different axes, you can be at
different stages. So this can turn into quite a complex
model. So if you imagine like this, this bar chart,
and you've got different, you know, levels that you're out
here, so you can be in terms of morality, you
could be at, let's say, green, very high. So this
is the individual with a highly developed sense of morality,
and, but has a very low, maybe the sense of
spirituality, and then maybe he has a kind of medium
sense of, for development of his cognition abilities, and then
his emotional awareness might be very low, and maybe in
relationships, still a bit higher. And so you can get
this kind of complex matrix. So really, you know, if
you want to get technical and in depth, you can
go and kind of find different assessments or read different
books and find these different lines and axes and, and
actually kind of rank yourself on different places. But the
moral of the story is that you kind of want
to up yourself on all of these, if you're trying
to do personal development, you up yourself on all of
these different axes, especially anyone that's extremely low. So maybe
you're really low with relationships. Or maybe you're really low
with spirituality, or maybe you're really low with sexuality, then
you gotta raise that up, and you got to pass
through all those stages. Remember that you can't just skip
stages. So if you're orange, you're not going to be
able to skip to yellow, if they go through green,
you would like to skip to yellow, but you can't.
Likewise, if you're blue, you're gonna have to go through
orange, you can't just skip to green either. So some
bitter pills to swallow, that's what's going to be necessary.
The problem with the world, generally speaking, is that the
stages do not understand that they exist. They hate each
other. And in fact, they, they just can't even comprehend
It's baffling to one stage, how the other stage things.
And this is why we have war. It's why we
have violence. This is why we have theft. This is
why we have all sorts of problems, both individually. And
collectively. This is why we have problems with global warming.
This is where we have problems with religion. This is
why we have the Palestinian Israeli problem. This is why
we have the US versus the Islamic world problem. That's
why we have terrorism problem. That's why we have economic
collapse problems. That's why we have a Wall Street problem.
It's all explained right here. That's the power of this
model. Lot of information today digest. So you might be
wondering, okay, Leo. So how do I actually use this
to develop myself? This model is very good for building
awareness. I'll probably shoot more videos in the future like
a part two, or Part Three to this series that
will tell you more about how to practically apply it.
But just for now, what I want you to do
is I want you to see and accept, first of
all, that there are these stages, and that they do
have a trajectory of directionality to them. And that you're
probably much lower than you think you are, or than
you would like to be. And just if you can
accept and start to appreciate and become conscious of just
that right there. That will already help you a lot.
Because what we really need more of in the world
is we need people moving from tier one thinking to
tier two from orange and green to yellow. Because yellow
is the one that starts to understand this whole thing.
And this understanding is very powerful, because it actually makes
you kind of chill and relaxed about all these different
stages. You can also start to think about them because
you're coming up with solutions and ideas for how to
solve world problems, once you understand these things, you can
become a strong leader. How about you peg your company
on this hierarchy, you might be working for a company
that's orange, or maybe it's red, or maybe it's green,
or maybe it's blue. And if you're the owner of
a company, if you're a CEO, or if you're entrepreneur,
then you probably want to grow your company. Not only
do you want to grow yourself, you want to grow
your company through these stages, too. Because guess what, the
higher you go on this hierarchy, the more chance you
have of surviving in this world. Because the fact is,
the world is complex, it is evolving, evolution is happening.
And if you notice, people in beige, and purple, and
red, those people are all dying out. Those structures are
not sustainable. Once blue comes into play, once orange comes
into play, once green comes into play, and what's going
to happen in the future is that society, the whole
world is just going to shift on the spectrum this
way, right? Towards yellow. So I encourage you to be
ahead of the pack, lead that move, evolve yourself, first,
evolve your company, evolve your relationships, evolve your family, of
all your friends, up towards yellow. And the way you
start to do that is just by getting a sense
of this model. And how do you apply yellow thinking
to the world? Well, you have to give away something
that you've been cherishing for a long time, which is
rationalism, very dogmatic rationalism, and absolute truth. You have to
stop thinking of the world as having absolute truths. If
you start seeing the world as really being a collection
of perspectives, and that every belief or idea that you
have no matter whether it's the most proven science to
some social system theory, to your political systems, to your
philosophical convictions, your religious beliefs, your spiritual convictions, any of
that those are all perspectives. Maybe there's some truth to
them. But maybe there's also some untruth to them. That's
a really bitter pill to swallow. For most people. Most
people cannot handle that, that takes extreme open mindedness. Which
is why in the future, and I've already started doing
this with my videos, with actualised.org, as I'm just going
to keep hammering, and hammering and hammering, and just hammering
on the idea of open mindedness, because I think it's
one of the most important ideas, both socially, but also
just personally. It's so important, even though it sounds kind
of abstract and a little woowoo is super important. Because
the thing that's holding you back the most, whether you're
at blue, orange, green, and green, is dogma. Belief in
your beliefs is holding you back. And how do you
break your beliefs down? Well, that's a, that's a real
can of worms that I'm not going to get into
here. Because we're already running long. Anyways, I'm gonna wrap
it up here, think about all this stuff. Kind of
look at the world through this lens of yellow. Start
seeing everything, the way that a yellow person would see
it. It's pretty cool. It might be a little scary,
or awkward, or crazy, little insane or criminal. But try
it. Right. One of the beauties of seeing this model
is that now you can see what your obstacles will
be in the future, the psychological obstacles, and now you
can kind of anticipate them, maybe you can even jump
into the next level and just kind of swim around
in it and see, oh, it's actually not so bad.
You know, if you're orange, try going to some hippie
commune, or a meditation retreat, hang around with hippie people.
And their happiness will start to rub off on you.
In a good way, you'll actually like say, oh, hippies
are not as bad as I thought they were. I
personally do that myself in my life. And you know,
if you're blue, start hanging around with more orange people,
and just kind of kind of accept them and push
yourself even though you're resisting, just push yourself into orange.
And just you'll see like, oh, or just kind of
cool. I get to like, be an individual. I like
being an individual and I have freedom. I like freedom.
And I like to get money and Now I can
build the business. I like building a business. So you
can see some of the benefits there. And if you're
green, then come over to yellow. Start seeing the world,
and even more shades of gray. Stop just caring and
sharing, and stop just being empathetic. But start seeing the
world as perspectives and start coming up with systems for
how to solve the problems in the world that you
really care about. That will put you to yellow. All
right, this is it a lot of deep discussion here
a lot to think about. I'll let you digest it.
I'm gonna go Leave me your comments down below. Please
click the like button, share this video with a friend.
And lastly, come check out actualized.org Right here. I've got
a free newsletter there so you can stay up to
date with future videos. I release new videos on self
actualization topics, really deep fucking videos every single week, right?
I don't know who else is putting out videos of
this step for free. It's pretty damn rare. So I
hope that you can see the value in this in
these models. You can use these models to transform your
entire life. Not just your life but the whole world.
You want to become a leader in the world. You
want to go out there and accomplish amazing things. You
want to have a life purpose. You want to get
your life not just handled but like thriving. This is
the information that you need. So stick with me. I've
got a lot more deep stuff coming soon. And I
will see you a bit later.
