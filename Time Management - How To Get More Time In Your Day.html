hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're going to talk about time management alright so
let's talk about time management and by time management I
really mean how do we get you more sanity around
your schedule how do we get more time for you
to do the things that you want to do get
you feeling less stress less hectic how do we do
that I think that one of the biggest challenges that
I see out there in our modern world this is
one of the biggest issues that people come to me
with coaching that I coach people on is that they
don't have enough time in the day to do everything
that they want to do people are so frazzled they're
so overwhelmed running around with a million things on their
plate doing all this stuff sometimes they're so busy that
they'll pay me for coaching they'll pay me a lot
of money to coach them and they won't even have
time to take a one-hour phone call to get coached
which is just ridiculous so how do we actually work
around this problem how do we get more time how
do we get sanity around our schedules I'm sure that
if you are working in any kind of serious career
then you're having a lot of stress around managing your
schedule finding enough time do everything you want to do
especially if you're trying to balance your schedule with also
your family life maybe you have got kids you've got
obligations at home you've got other stuff you're doing you've
got hobbies you've got the gym so how do you
make it all fit into a 24 hour day and
not drive yourself nuts and make it all sustainable all
right so I'm going to give you some very deep
but simple wisdom I want you to not just discount
it alright it's important because this is the aunt this
is the answer this is the key but a lot
of people will discount this and say ah that makes
sense but what what's better and they go they try
to look for something else the problem here is not
for you to find out how to be more efficient
I'm not trying to to jam more into your schedule
that is the wrong paradigm to be coming at if
you're coming at this whole time management thing from the
paradigm of how do you optimize your schedule how do
you cram a little bit more in how do you
how do you get everything locked tight that's the wrong
paradigm to be coming from and you've probably been coming
from that paradigm for a while now because that's a
traditional way to do time management to do productivity improvement
and you probably realize that it doesn't work it doesn't
really work here's what actually works this is the solution
you want to know what it is it's pretty simple
stop doing stupid that's the bottom line that's what it
takes to do proper time management you have to buy
into this idea you have to first of all admit
you're doing a lot of stupid right now am i
right how much stupid you have on your schedule ask
yourself really how much stupid you have on your schedule
it's not about doing more life is about doing less
what I want you to do after you finish watching
this video is I want you to really sit down
and ask yourself what are my priorities what is really
really important and what are the things that I'm doing
that are not important because this whole efficiency paradigm that
I've been running on this whole idea that I can
jam a little bit more in there it's not going
to work all it's going to do is going to
make me more stress more frantic and it's not going
to get me to ultimately where I want to go
instead I'm going to use a new paradigm and the
new paradigm that I'm going to use is the minimalist
paradigm that means what you do is you sit down
and you get very very methodical with all the different
activities and commitments that you have in your life and
you sit down and you get really critical about them
and you start to ask yourself is this really essential
is this essential to my life what is it really
adding to my life because right now you've got a
lot of stuff that you're doing in your life that's
not really adding very much it's not producing a lot
of satisfaction it's not producing a lot of joy and
happiness and love and it's not Perdue for even producing
a lot of financial success for you it's basically doing
nothing it's a distraction it's wasting your time but you
have very good reasons for why you're doing it because
you've not always done it in the past or because
you think you need it or you could because you
think someone's going to reject you if you stop doing
something or if you pull out of some commitment well
the trick is to start pulling yourself out of commitments
and to only make commitments to those things that are
absolutely critical and essential to your life the things that
you do in your life have to line up with
your highest values and everything else you have to drop
off the map forget about it how nice would your
life be if just you were doing three or four
things for your whole week just three or four things
that we're really contributing to what you want your life
to be about maybe they were contributing to your awesome
career or they were contributing to your finances or they
were contributing to your family life or to some special
relationship that you have and everything else was just off
the radar you can just drop it and forget it
this is ultimately where you want to get to this
is where you want to be and to do this
is not easy because it's going to have to mean
that you have to change the way that you've been
approaching your whole schedule you can have to be prioritize
you have to really think you're going to make some
hard decisions a good analogy that I like to use
is it's like being an editor you have to be
a very good editor disciplined editor of your own life
right when you bring a manuscript when a writer brings
a manuscript to an editor to get published before they
publish that book before they take this big manuscript and
they publish into a book what happens to that and
an editor will sit down so this is a professional
who will sit down and he will very critically go
through that whole manuscript and it'll start marking it up
with red ink and he'll start hangout all the fluff
all the extraneous stuff all the garbage all the nonsense
because he knows that when that book gets on the
bookshelf in order for it to sell that book has
to be tight has to be concise it can't be
repetitive it can't be filled with a lot of fluff
if it is and no one's going to buy it
it's not going to be a good seller so this
editor because he's edited hundreds maybe thousands of books and
manuscripts in the past he has a keen eye for
what is necessary and what's extraneous and so he's really
good about going in there and cutting this stuff up
and throwing stuff out he's got to be ruthless about
that a lot of times the the writer when he
gets this manuscript back he gets to edit back from
the editor he'll look at it and he'll cry literally
he'll be heartbroken because the writer will think well all
this amazing stuff that I wrote half had this manuscript
has basically been crossed out and it's filled with red
ink well that's because what's happened is that all that
fluff was condensed down to just the juicy concentrated bits
and for the writer his ego doesn't really want to
handle that a good writer will understand once he goes
through that editing process multiple times he'll come to understand
that the editor is an important part of this whole
process that in fact editors making is writing better he's
making the writing something that is very concentrated and something
that is worthy enough to be put on a bookshelf
because this fluff that we started with that's not going
to that's not going to fly not commercially well the
same thing is going on with your life right now
your life is like this big bloated manuscript filled with
all sorts of junk and fat that needs to be
trimmed off and you've never had professional editor going there
and start crossing this stuff out you've never done that
you are not a very good editor of your own
life and you certainly haven't allowed anybody else to come
in and do it for you so really this is
something that you have to get better at this is
a skill you have to develop is have to say
okay I'm really going to get disciplined here and this
is what a good writer will do when a good
writer understands the editing process he'll get discipline with himself
and this is what you need to do is you
get very disciplined with yourself and you start saying okay
this thing here this thing I'm doing here do I
really really need that what is it really adding to
my life is it getting me towards my highest values
and goals how about this thing here is this thing
doing it what about that commitment I have to Bob
do I even need to be meeting with Bob every
week what about this time that I spending over here
what about this time that are spending over there you
got to start really looking at it and you have
to kind of start from from the ground up start
with a clean slate and say okay pretend like my
whole schedule is clean what is really essential and then
you have to start adding just the things that are
essential when you do this this is how you ultimately
slay all the fat and all the demons that are
inside your schedule you cut that stuff out and then
your schedule becomes clean it becomes minimalistic and then all
of a sudden you have time to breathe you have
time to think you have time for a little bit
of alone time so you can be stress decompress from
your workday and that's important that's ultimately what you need
that's ultimately what you want to be at a high
performance peak state in your life now a lot of
a lot of people what they do is they spend
a lot of time complaining about their schedules they'll complain
about the fact that they don't have enough time the
boss is putting all these demands on them they've got
all these projects that are due they've got the kids
the wife the girlfriend the boyfriend the activities the gym
all this stuff not enough time not enough sleep time
etc if you want to master your schedule this is
principle number one is you have to do this you
have to take full responsibility for your schedule take full
responsibility for your time what does that mean that means
that you are no longer allowed to complain about your
schedule ever you are no longer about allowed to complain
about lack of time ever I want you to commit
to this and you know that there's something true here
there's a nugget here that's true because if you've been
complaining about your schedule for years and years and years
and you've been trying various little fixes and they haven't
been working then you know what I'm saying is true
here and you're probably at the point where you're willing
to accept it and that's the truth that until you
take full responsibility and you start making the hard choices
then your schedule is never going to be fixed and
to make those hard choices you have to say okay
my schedule has been crazy up to now but from
now on I take full responsibility that means everything that
I that is on my schedule I allowed myself to
put it there I allowed myself everything even everything that
my boss throws at me in the end that's me
allowing it to be there on my schedule when you
take this when you commit to never complaining about your
schedule and you say that you have control over it
all that can be hard to do your ego doesn't
want to do it but it can be also very
empowering because now that means that you have full responsibility
for your schedule that means you can do with your
schedule whatever you want and that can be a big
relief big relief to realize that your schedule is yours
and nobody else's and then if you are allowing other
people to take up your time and you are agreeing
to all sorts of commitments and if you feel overwhelmed
that's not because there's not enough time in the day
it's not because the world is crazy it's not because
we live in the era of Internet and mobile phones
and texting and Facebook and Twitter that has nothing to
do with it it all has to do with you
it's because you are allowing it to be there it's
because you are allowing these things to be on your
plate and you can always choose not to and the
only reason you have it up to this point is
because you've been creating excuses for why you can't but
I think it's time for you to realize that those
are just that excuses and if you really think about
it then you have full control over your schedule that's
where it starts this is the Golden Nugget of how
to do proper time management so practically what I'm going
to leave you with here is I want you to
end this video and I want you to sit down
and really what we're doing here is we're going to
use the 80/20 rule the 80/20 rule to help you
figure out what needs to be cut from your schedule
that means you're going to write down all the tasks
that you have coming at you every week you're going
to take a look at Jim and your personal hobbies
that you're doing and the work projects that you've got
going and your business and your family your relationship you're
going to take a look at all that you're going
to write down all the stuff that's recurring every week
for you make a list of it they're going to
sit down you're going to ask yourself which 20% of
this entire list and you might have 50 things which
are the top 20% that are getting me the 80%
of my results that are getting me the 80% of
my fulfillment in life which of these things are actually
making me happiest if you sit down and do this
earnestly what you're going to discover is that it's probably
just going to be a couple of things that are
really giving you a lot of happiness and the rest
of them aren't doing much you're going to discover that
20% of your whole list is generating 80% of your
results in your fulfillment in life and you're going to
find the other 80% of that list are only generating
the other 20% of your results in fulfillment that means
that you can cut out the 80% which we'll call
the fad you can trim that fat from your schedule
and you're still going to be getting 80% of your
results and now your schedule is gonna be so much
more free you can just add a couple of more
things maybe expand those things that are generating the most
full fulfillment and success for you you can expand on
those and Wow now not only have you freed up
your schedule but you're also going to have more fulfillment
and more success amazing this is how you do proper
time management so in the end what I'm leaving you
here with is that I want you to sit down
actually do this until you do this you're not going
to have full control over your schedule and before you
can really do this exercise in earnest you have to
commit to taking 100% responsibility for your schedule are you
willing to do that have you suffered long enough with
the overwhelm and the stress in your life I hope
so I hope you're willing to commit 100% to no
longer complaining taking full ownership saying that this schedule is
mine I own every commitment on my schedule I can
cut it if I want to and I'm willing to
take any kind of sacrifices or any kind of costs
that come with cutting stuff I'm willing to do it
because what I'm going to do is I'm going to
design an amazing schedule for myself from scratch from the
ground up that really honors the performance that I want
my life that honors the peace of mind that I
want my life that honors the things that are really
making me happy in life and that's also going to
make me very very productive and very very successful and
when you do that that's when you're really going to
have total control over your own time alright this is
