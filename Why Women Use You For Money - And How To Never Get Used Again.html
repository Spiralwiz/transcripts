Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this video,
we're going to talk about why women use you for
money. So why do women use you or men for
money, a lot of guys get hung up on this,
a lot of guys will hold this kind of bitterness
against womankind, based off of past relationships that they've been
in and past interactions with women, where they feel like
women are users of men. That's what I want to
cover in this video. And if you're a guy, this
video is for you, I want to help you see
the other side of what is going on here. Because
actually, I'm giving away the punchline here. Actually, the reason
that women are using you for money is because it's
your fault, and you're letting them. And it's because you
don't understand what really attracts women in the first place.
And you're looking for a shortcut to attract a woman.
So let's really get into the details of this. Because
I spent the last few years really studying female attraction,
really understanding women by talking with them dating a lot,
being in relationships, really studying this area of my life,
because I was in a very bad place, I sucked
with women, and I wanted to get better. So I
really took it upon myself to say, You know what,
I'm going to start from ground zero and work my
way up and learn how it really works, how it
really works, not the stuff that they tell me in
the media, or in popular culture, or what my intuition
tells me about how women work, but actually how they
work. And here's some of the things that I've discovered.
Because I also ran into this problem, when I started
off on my journey is I didn't understand women. So
I fell into some of these traps in the same
way that you're falling into. And it really sucks as
a guy to go out with a girl, take her
on dates, buy her stuff, and then get nothing in
return, and then have that girl run off with somebody
else. That's really like a dagger on your heart, you
feel like you've been stabbed. And that's something that then
can build up to certain bitterness, which then you can
hold against women in general. And the problem with that
is that it creates, then the sort of resentment that
is there in all your future relationships with women and
all your future dating situations. And that's not something that's
either healthy for you, or will that produce the kind
of results that you actually want? So I want to
help you get the results with women that you really
want. And the answer here is that once you understand
this, that actually attracting women is is a lot easier
than you think it is. So let's crack into that.
So here's really how it works. The problem that you
have here as the guy who was getting used, because
not all men are getting used. Equally, you are getting
used, the men that really understand women, they're not getting
used by women. So why do you get used by
women, the reason you get used because you have this
flawed model of how Attraction works. You fundamentally misunderstand female
attraction, what attracts a female. What attracts a female, in
a nutshell, are emotions. She's interested in emotional stimulation. She's
also interested in the status and confidence that you have
as a man. So she wants you to be confident
she wants you to have status, but really, she wants
you to emotionally stimulate her. And as long as you've
got that, then you really need nothing else. You know,
it's funny, because I hear some guys in the comment
sections that I read, or other places on forums, they'll
talk about how women are just out to use them
for money, or that the thing that they need to
attract that really beautiful girl is lots of money. And
so the reason they can't go out and attract a
beautiful girl, a really hot girl, a supermodel quality girl,
they can't do that is because they feel like they
don't have enough money to attract her. Well, what's really
nice is that you don't need any of that. All
you need is the emotional stimulation, whatever guy can stimulate
the woman in the most in the most stimulating way.
That's the guy who's going to end up sleeping with
her the fastest other guys in her life, they could
serve the provider roles, but she's not really going to
be attracted to them. Let's let's look at the scenario
how this works. So a typical guy who doesn't really
understand women too well, here's how he thinks it's going
to work. So he sees a cute girl. Maybe he
thinks that oh, she's She's really nice. She's really fine.
She's a little bit out of my league. Maybe she's
a little bit of a above me. So he puts
hold it on a pedestal. And then he says, You
know what? I'm gonna go and I'm going to be
like the really, really great guy in her life. I'm
gonna take her on some nice dates. I'm going to
take her to a really nice fancy restaurant, impress her
with that, you know, and then after that, we'll go
and we'll do some shopping or buy or some some
stuff, some clothes, a person earrings or whatever, I'll buy
or whatever she wants. And then after that we'll go
and we'll go to the, to the amusement park rides,
and I'll borrow some popcorn and we'll go to the
movies. So I'll be buying all this stuff, we're gonna
go through this courting process. And then as that's happening,
she's gonna get attracted to me, she's gonna see that
on this on this cool, responsible guy who's got status,
who's got money, and she's gonna fall in love with
me. She's gonna like this stuff that I'm doing for
her. And that if I don't do this, for if
I don't pay for checks in her dinners, that in
fact, that's gonna be, that's gonna be perceived as negative,
and it's gonna be perceived as me losing attraction. Now,
of course, the woman, let's look at this from the
woman's perspective. Here you are the sky, and you're lavishing
her with all these gifts. You're lavishing her with all
these favors? You're doing stuff for her? You're buying her
dinners? Okay, what is she gonna think she's gonna say,
okay, cool. And she's gonna take it right? What would
you do if I was a rich friend of yours?
And I said, Hey, you know, let's go over the
weekend, I'm gonna buy your dinner, or devise a lobster.
And then we're gonna go and go to a party,
and we're gonna do all this cool stuff, I'll pay
for it all don't worry about it. What are you
gonna say as the guy of course party on right?
I mean, who would refuse free money? See, this is
where guys make the critical mistake, they assume that because
a woman will accept free money. I mean, she's only
human, you will do the same is that because of
that, you think that she will fall in love with
you. But really, there's no connection there whatsoever. And if
anything, there's an inverse correlation. Because as you're paying for
her stuff, what's happening is that she's seeing that you're
supplicating. To her, she's seeing that she's the prize in
this relationship. And women hate that. Women really hate that,
because women are very sensitive to status, they want a
guy who's more confident than she is, they want to
date a guy who has more status than, than she
does. And she's suddenly evaluating these things, whether consciously or
mostly subconsciously. And so when you're buying a supplicating, then
you're actually shooting yourself in the foot, and you're putting
yourself in the provider frame. That's not what you want.
So you think that you're gonna give her all this
money, and all these, all these favors that you're doing
for her and gonna be really nice. She's gonna like
you. But what ends up happening is that as you're
doing all those things, and you're doing this long, drawn
out courtship process, some other guy in her life, who's
just the fun, carefree party guy, he comes along, he
is broke, he has no money, he doesn't buy her
anything, he treats her a little bit like a dick.
And she ends up sleeping with him. Now, why does
this happen? I'll get into that in a second. But
it pisses you off, right? As that guy who's been
doing all this stuff, and really, working really hard to
attract her. This like, is a dagger in your heart,
because you went through all this work. And now you're
standing there left, standing there with holding or digging your
hands while she's off screwing on the guy. Why is
this happening? It's happening, because you assumed the money would
attract her. That doesn't work. Women aren't attracted by money.
What attracts them as emotions. So see, guys will call
women horse when they see this happening. Actually, no, she's
not a whore. She would be a hoard if she
slept with you, because you bought her all those things.
And if you interact with a lot of women, what
you'll tend to find is that they're not very harsh.
They love sex. And a lot of them are sluggy,
which means that they're very, they're very likely to go
to sleep with you very quickly. If you stimulate the
right emotions. That's all she is. She's, she's a whore
to emotions, she's not a whore to money. Now, look
at what's happening. In fact, what you're trying to do
as a guy, when you're giving her money in favors,
is you're actually trying to make her a whore. And
women don't actually like this, and they don't respond to
it. Now, you might say, well, Leo, but you know,
sometimes you see guys are really wealthy, who don't have
good looks, and there was cute girls that are out
of their league. How is that happening? Either those guys
are stimulating that woman emotionally even more so than the
money factor. But also, I'm not going to deny that
sometimes a woman will fall into the trap. Right? A
woman will take free money, she will take gifts, and
she'll even sleep with you for it. Sometimes. The problem
though, is that when you attract a woman based on
money, then that's what the relationship is based on. And
she's never actually going to be as wet for you,
as she would be. If you treated her with the
emotional component first, rather than the money. If you treat
her with money, she might sleep with you. She might
even be your girlfriend a little bit. But ultimately, she's
still going to be always on the lookout for the
guy who's more emotionally stimulating than you are. And as
soon as her radar locks on to that guy, she's
gonna leave you because you attracted her with this false
thing that she didn't really want. Now, of course, some
women are out there and then we'll just use do
for money. So some women are really, that's like their
name. Obviously, you have to watch out for that too.
But you can nip all that in the bud by
simply refusing to pay for women's simply refusing to supplicate
to them and understanding this model, they really don't want
you to be paying for them. They don't want to
be hoarse, they want to be mostly stimulated, they want
to be swept off their feet by that knight in
shining armor, or the bad boy, or whatever kind of,
you know, stereotype you want to, you want to cast
yourself as she wants that exciting, stimulating, adventurous, edgy man
who's very masculine, who's very sexual, who's very dominant, you're
aggressive, that's what you want. And you're not giving that
to her with money. And here's, here's the problem is
that mainstream media and culture and society are telling you
the exact opposite of all this. If you look around
in the media, you see examples of the opposite. Also,
your, your naive and kind of intuitive brain. If you're
just starting out with women, you don't really understand them
too much to telling you. Well, she would she would
enjoy me doing something nice for her, you know, what
if I do a favor first, would not skew things
in my favor. Actually, that's not what happened is very
counterintuitive. This is a process that men have to go
through. When they're learning to become very, very good with
women, they have to go through this process of getting
out of this mindset, where they're this provider and getting
to this mindset where there's this fun, carefree emotionally stimulating
guy, when you make that transition. Wow, the success and
the results you get with women, totally, totally changed. Because
this is a very counterintuitive thing. For a lot of
logical, analytical guys. This doesn't make sense why women work
this way. But they just do and it's not that
complicated. See, the problem is that you're trying to use
money, actually a shortcut. Wouldn't it be nice if you
could just go out and hand a woman $1,000. And
she would just sleep with you. If you could just
like see a really cute girl on the street, you're
like, oh, man, I really love her, I got I've
got some extra money in the bank, let me just
go and like, pull out my ATM card or the
ATM machine. And then like, take out a wad of
cash and just like go and give it to her,
and she'll sleep with me. Unless she's like a proper
whore, she will do that no woman will do that.
And even if she does, she's not actually going to
be attracted by that. She's just going to do it
for the money. And see the reason that you as
the man want that. I mean, it would be nice,
wouldn't it be nice to go and pay $1,000 That
would be actually very cheap. The expense that a man
encouraged to actually attract really quality women is a lot
more than $1,000 per woman, the blood and sweat and
tears and labor that you put into building up your
game, to becoming more confident to building up your personality,
to becoming more masculine, to becoming more carefree and fun,
letting go of your emotional baggage, all that nonsense that
you had all that negative thinking that you had from
childhood, to let go of all that and be that
fun, carefree guy that she wants. That's That's hard work.
That's hard work. For me. I spent the last two
years really working very hard on that. I literally put
my my business on halt to do it. Right. So
if I calculate how much time I really put into
becoming really much better with women, I'm not that good
with women now, but I'm much better than I used
to be. And the difference that that happened, there was
me investing literally hundreds, and probably over 1000 hours practicing
and studying this to understand Understand it. Don't I wish
that I could just paid some woman $1,000 to like
be my girlfriend. It doesn't work. But see, the reason
that you want it is because you want the easy
way out. You want a shortcut? Guys want a shortcut.
That's why you're buying girls dinners in the first place.
That's why you're taking them to fancy restaurants or you're
going shopping with them is because you want to impress
the girl, and you want the shortcut. You don't want
to try it with your personality, that would be difficult,
you know that your personality sucks. Because if you've got
a good personality, you know that you don't need money
to attract women. Women are magnetically attracted to you, you've
probably got more options with women than you care to
capitalize on. But if you've got a weak personality, if
you're strong introvert, you're pretty much in your head, you're
very logical. You come from that kind of traditional thinking
about how dating is supposed to work, which is completely
flawed, then, then you've probably got a pretty bland personality.
It's hard to attract women with that kind of personality.
It's very interesting because I want to share an example
with you of of how I learned this. When I
started going out and I started approaching lots of lots
of women, literally 1000s of women. One of the first
girls that I then ended up putting up with she
was a girl in a new town. I moved to
that town just for the month just to be practicing
hitting on girls, and I was there for that month
just practicing every single day for 30 days straight and
I bumped into this girl at the mall, and I
opened her up as like a five minute conversation. I
grabbed her number she she's really happy that I They
stopped her dead cold in the middle of the mall.
She was walking and talking to her mom on cell
phone. So I stopped dead cold. Just tell her she's
beautiful. And I want to, you know, I want to
grab her number and go out with her. And she's
like, totally down. So like it hooks. And then later,
we ended up going for coffee in the evening, a
few days later, and we ended up hooking up that
night. And it was amazing, because this girl, she was
very beautiful woman. Very beautiful. I would say she's like,
a nine, eight and a half or nine on one
to 10 scale, just like a very beautiful woman, the
kind of woman that would be like girlfriend material. Not
only she's like very feminine, very fit, like, what's her
health, beautiful face, beautiful body like beautiful everything. She was
also intelligent. She's also smart, she had a good, good
career, she was a nurse. So she had, she was
like, nice package. And she was a kind of woman
that was looking for that boyfriend who would then become
the husband. So she was she was really looking for
that nice long term relationship. And it was very funny,
because when I hooked up with her, those few weeks
in that new city, it was funny to me, because
she just moved to that city. She escaped a turbulent
relationship with really dysfunctional abusive relationships. She got out of
that she moved to this new town. And now I
was interacting with her. But already she had other other
suitors, right, because she's got status, because she's, she's beautiful.
So other guys that know her want to date with
date her and you know, be with her sleep with
her. But see, the problem is that those guys, they
were trying to attract her with the money. And it
was really funny, because even she didn't understand what was
going on. Until I kind of pointed it out to
her. I remember one time we were sitting and we're
driving the car. And she was telling me about her
her nursing career and how how people were very nice
to her as a nurse. And she was telling me
about how some of the doctors and surgeons that she
worked with in the hospital, how they would be very
nice to her. And in fact, one of the surgeons,
he offered her a free surgery. Free surgery. Now why
would he do that? What does free surgery cost? I
don't know, depending on the operation, but surgery is fairly
expensive. Surgery usually cost between 10 to 20 to $30,000.
It's for a minor surgery, major surgeries. Go beyond that.
So a minor surgery, let's say it costs even $10,000
Why would a surgeon offer her a free surgery? And
it was funny because I instantly I'm like, Whoa, like,
that's amazing. And she said that in the car. And
she's just she's just talking, she's not really thinking about
what she's saying. And then I'm like, I'm gonna kind
of like put my hand on her on her knee.
And I kind of look at her with a slight
smile and say, I wonder what you have to do
what you had to do to get that. And she
looked at me. And she went like this. She's like,
she opened her mouth really why she's a call because
like it clicked in her brain that what was going
on here was that like, she was looking very, very
whorish here. And she immediately said, no, no, no, no,
we didn't do anything. We didn't do anything. And I'm
like, Yeah, of course. Okay, you didn't do anything, I
believe you. But think about the guy in that situation.
The guy in that situation, that surgeon, he gave her
surgery because he wanted to in, right. He wanted to
sleep with her he wanted an in. And he noticed
that she was was kind of maybe a little bit
warm to him. But he wanted to really like get
in there. Right? So he was supplicating. That's why he
offered it. And when she understood that it was funny,
because to me is very interesting, because even she didn't
quite realize and put the two together until we started
talking about it was very funny. And of course, the
surgeon didn't end up getting her I ended up getting
her. And it was funny because a few days later,
after we had sex, like the whole day, we I
drive her back to her house. It's a new house.
And she didn't have very many friends in the city
yet. But she does have like an aunt and an
uncle. And they know a guy who they want her
to date already. And so we're driving back to her
house. And she before we even before we even like
get up to the driveway, she immediately like tells me
to stop the car. Okay, look, I gotta tell you
something. We're getting to my house. But in my house,
my aunt and my uncle are there now. And there
were there with a guy. They want me to, like
get hooked up with that guy. And I'm sitting here.
We've been like having sex all week. I'm sitting here
I'm like, okay, so this guy like he's also like
a suitor. This has been the next student that she
has. I noticed it was hilarious. Because because she doesn't
want to get with that guy. Right? Of course. Why?
Why would she want to get with that guy? That
guy is not emotionally stimulating her. I'm emotionally stimulating her
in this situation. That guy, he's just trying to get
an in. She doesn't want that she wants to be
stimulated. And so it was funny because we were sitting
there in the car and she's like, should I go
in I don't really want to go in and all
this stuff. And I'll tell you how to go in.
You know go in and maybe maybe you really like
that guy and you can suck his dick. Right tonight.
Right? Go suck his dick tonight. He's gonna be an
amazing match for you. See, as soon as she heard
that, like that guy was immediately blown out. Right like
no chance of getting with her. ever again. Why is
that? Because now she's associating what's going on there, right?
With the sex, the guy is there just for sex.
And like he wants that in. It was funny. I
mean, I said that very deliberately, just to show that
I'm like carefree, I honestly wouldn't care if he did
go in there and suck his dick, it wouldn't matter
to me. But see, when I played that role to
her, that's super attractive, that makes me look like really
confident in myself, like, I don't care, go do whatever
you want. Honestly, I don't, it won't upset me. But
I know that when I tell that to a woman,
that she's never gonna go do anything with somebody else,
she's going to be with me. She told me to
drive her to my place five minutes later, and we
ended up having sex all night. So it was it
was very funny. And this is not the end of
it. After that, I still I known her, I knew
her for about a few more weeks after I thought
I was in that town, you know, we were still
there, we're still hanging out a little bit. And what
was happening is that she had a third suitor. This
was a guy who put her through nursing school. And
he didn't, he pulled a lot of strings for her
in her youth, to get her educated and to get
her like, really, from what I understand, I don't know,
the details to get her really situated in her nursing
career. And in hospitals, because hospitals have a lot of
politics involved, keep a lot of strings for her. And
this guy, he wanted to marry her. So now she's
hanging out with me, she's coming, she's coming home to
me. And she's telling me how distraught she is because
this guy who used to support her and help her
in different ways, who never had sex with her. But
he was doing all that because he wanted to marry
her, then now she feels like she's obligated to the
sky. But she doesn't really like the guy. She's just
not attracted to him. But now because she took his
money, and because she did all these things. You know,
he did all these things for her, and he opened
all these doors, she now feels obligated. So see, in
that situation, that man, she put her into the role
of the whore. And now she feels really bad about
that. So will that guy ever marry her? Probably not.
Because she she's not really attracted to him, she just
feels obligated. Now you want to hear this whole story?
And you might say, Well, what a like, what a
cunt, why would she do all this stuff, and you
got to understand that she's only human. If I was
giving out free money, and pulling strings for you, would
you refuse it, you would accept it too. And see
women, they don't really see how calculating men are. Men
are very calculating behind the scenes, they're doing all this
stuff, women, sometimes, if she's a experienced woman, she'll understand
what's going on. Sometimes they don't even understand. They're just
running kind of off emotions. And that's what they're going
after. And they'll kind of sweep up whatever favours money
you throw them, but they're not gonna get attracted to
you. So the moral of the story here is, don't
be like those guys that didn't get with the girl,
be like the guy that did get with the girl
by stimulating her emotionally and not paying for anything, not
providing anything, that doesn't mean that you never pay a
woman for anything. That's not what I mean, here, don't
get extreme, you can be nice and buy her some
stuff sometimes. But don't use money as a crutch, as
a shortcut to get your way in there and get
some action. Or get a girlfriend, get a marriage. That's
even worse. It's ridiculous. That never works. So Toby, that
guy understand that. If women are using you for money,
it's not their fault. Women are actually very sweet creatures.
It's your fault, because you are looking for that shortcut.
And all that she is doing is she's going along
with the flow, you would go along with the flow
as well, if you were put in the same situation.
So don't hold that against them. Start to understand that
emotions are what you're really supposed to attract a woman
with. And you need to work on your own personality.
That's the lesson here. Stop the money bullshit. Start working
on your personalities for doing personal development, look and study,
pick up where you want to go to pick up
or start studying dating theory for going out there dating
many women. And you're gonna start to learn, that's how
you learn. That's how I learned that's the best way
to learn is just through sheer experience. And also learning
from guys who are also very, very good at this
stuff and have come before you and learn this stuff.
All right, so kind of an in depth topic on
a detail here. But I think this is important because
