            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/-cZ5gGloYa8' target='_blank'>The Sneaky Psychology Behind Conspiracy Theories</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding of Epistemology and Conspiracy Theories</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that one of the main reasons why conspiracy theories thrive is because people have a poor understanding of epistemology, the study of knowledge, and are prone to its common pitfalls. This lack of knowledge leads to a tendency to hold onto conspiracy theories.
</li><li><b>Role of Social Media in Spreading Conspiracy Theories</b>: Social media platforms have become effective tools in creating ideological echo chambers where individuals engage with like-minded peers, creating a fertile ground for the propagation of conspiracy theories. The platforms, still in their early stages, lack efficient moderation, thus allowing the dissemination of such theories.
</li><li><b>Impact of Late-stage Capitalism on Conspiracy Theories</b>: Late-stage capitalism, characterized by the concentration of resources at the top, has led the majority to fight over limited resources, leading to frustration and a susceptibility to conspiracy theories which can provide simplistic blame outlets for complex issues such as economic inequality.
</li><li><b>Conspiracy Theories as a Simplified Explanation of Reality</b>: Conspiracy theories often offer a crude but straightforward explanation of reality, a feature that's appealing to those struggling to make sense of complex societal issues. These theories often feed to common psychological factors, which include seeking emotional satisfaction, a sense of purpose and empowerment.
</li><li><b>Conspiracy Theories as a Manifestation of Ignorance</b>: Gura posits that conspiracy theories are a projection of an ignorant ego mind. Individuals with a low level of intelligence, intellectual laziness, and a lack of interest in questioning their beliefs are more likely to be drawn to conspiracy theories. 
</li><li><b>Problems in Distinguishing Beliefs from Reality</b>: People often struggle to distinguish between their direct experience and belief systems, Gura points out. This confusion leads to further entrenchment in belief systems, including conspiracy theories, resulting in toxic ideologies, cult-like behavior, and fanatical belief systems.
</li><li><b>Conspiracy theories as a form of conformity</b>: Leo Gura discusses how individuals often turn to conspiracy theories as a simplistic way to understand complex realities and thus give an illusion of being contrarian or rebellious. This, however, is just a form of conformity to a certain content (such as particular conspiracy theories) rather than a genuine contrarian attitude.
</li><li><b>Examples of conspiracy theories</b>: Gura highlights several popular conspiracy theories including flat earthers, moon landing being faked, JFK assassination, and David Icke's reptilian races theory. He also includes anti-vaxxers with left-wing origins (attributing vaccines to heavy metals and potential autism) and right-wing origins (considering vaccines a form of mind control by globalists).
</li><li><b>Belief in conspiracy theories as a waste of time</b>: Leo warns against spending excessive time delving into conspiracy theories. He argues that such activity robs individuals of time and energy that could be utilized for higher consciousness purposes or for personal growth.
</li><li><b>Conspiracy theories about COVID-19</b>: Gura touches on COVID-19 related conspiracy theories, which include the virus being engineered in a Chinese lab and Bill Gates intending to use a vaccine for mass mind control. He critiques these theories and dismisses claims of Gates seeking profit from the pandemic.
</li><li><b>Dangers of pedophile ring conspiracy theories</b>: Leo mentions the negative consequences of popular pedophile ring conspiracy theories, such as 'Pizzagate' which were started with Jeffrey Epstein's case and further fueled by QAnon claims about a global pedophile cabal.
</li><li><b>Common targets of conspiracy theories</b>: Gura points out recurring targets in these theories usually involve Jewish elites, communists, and certain famous individuals like George Soros. He also alludes to other common buzzwords in conspiracy theories like the New World Order, Illuminati, and deep state.
</li><li><b>Role of high-profile individuals in propagating conspiracy theories</b>: The video mentions roles of figures like Alex Jones and Donald Trump in popularizing various conspiracy theories, including chemtrails, false flag terrorist attacks, Obama birtherism, and climate change denialism. 
</li><li><b>Issue with perceiving reality</b>: Closing the section, Leo Gura discusses how the mind constructs a perceived reality based on narratives, making it problematic when reason and logic are manipulated by ego for selfish purposes - often giving birth to conspiracy theories.
</li><li><b>Conspiracy theories and political ideologies</b>: Leo Gura mentions a host of conspiracy theories associated with both left-wing and right-wing ideologies. Some examples include theories around the origins of the Iraq war, the 9/11 attacks, the Clinton scandals, technology suppression, and fears around white genocide. Conspiracies tied to McCarthyism, the Red Scare, and cultural Marxism are also discussed. Gura suggests that more conspiracy theories tend to stem from right-wing ideologies and that the lower one's cognitive, moral, and spiritual development, the more susceptible they are to such theories. 
</li><li><b>Government conspiracy theories</b>: Gura mentions conspiracy theories related to gun control and fluoridation of water. He elucidates some people's belief that school shootings were staged to enable authorities to take away citizens' guns while others think that the government puts fluoride in water to control people's minds. Gura expresses his personal stance on fluoride, advocating for more organic and natural products, but clarifies that he doesn't believe the government is implementing these measures with the intention to harm people.
</li><li><b>Conspiracy theories, fires, and witchcraft</b>: Leo discusses recent conspiracy theories circulated by right-wingers blaming Antifa for wildfires on the West Coast. He also delves into historical conspiracy theories, with an emphasis on witch trials. Gura suggests that the persecution of witches was a church-orchestrated conspiracy, aiming to demonize witchcraft and consolidate spiritual power within the church. He argues that even though witchcraft is real in the sense of being a practiced tradition, its popular negative perception is a result of misinformation and demonization by religious institutions.
</li><li><b>Cognitive, moral, and spiritual development</b>: Gura introduces the concept of cognitive, moral, and spiritual developmental stages. He posits that liberal, progressive, and left-wing individuals tend to be at a higher stage of consciousness and development than their conservative and right-wing counterparts. As a result, those at lower developmental levels, characterized by lower consciousness, less wisdom, and less morality are more likely to fall into the trap of conspiracy theories. He acknowledges the potential for bias in this assessment but maintains its general validity.
</li><li><b>Conspiracy Theories and Corruption</b>: Leo Gura acknowledges that corruption exists in various government systems, police force, military, business among others. Additionally, he accepts that institutions like the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA conduct secret operations and there is propaganda in the media. He also admits that capitalism distorts the flow of information due to corrupt practices. However, conspiracy theories don't provide a valid understanding of corruption. They themselves represent a corrupt way of thinking, externalizing corruption and blaming it on 'evil' external entities. 
</li><li><b>Critiquing the Government and Establishment</b>: Leo advices to critique the government from 'above'  from a place of understanding and acknowledging the systemic issues and workings of the government, rather than critiquing from 'below'  which might involve ignorant assumptions. 
</li><li><b>Conspiracy Theories Vs Conspiracies</b>: Leo differentiates between conspiracy theories and actual conspiracies. While he acknowledges that instances of government conspiracies exist and have been proven, these are not to be confused with conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories combine pieces of truth with false narratives, making them seemingly convincing. 
</li><li><b>Self-deception and Conspiracy Theories</b>: According to Leo, conspiracy theories are a form of self-deception. He explains that deception is not purely falsehood; instead, it involves sprinkling falsehood into kernels of truth, making the lie convincing. Hence, such theories are difficult to completely dismiss as they contain an element of truth. He further states that the deception around conspiracy theories isn't just about pure lies; instead, it is a mix of lies and truths that makes it convincing.
</li><li><b>Conspiracy theories and their construction</b>: Leo Gura explains that conspiracy theories often mix bits of truth with exaggerated narratives to create convincing stories, which become difficult to debunk once firmly lodged in someone's mind. With topics like pedophilia, calling others pedophiles immediately incites a negative response, thereby removing the responsibility for understanding other's perspectives. Conspiracy theorists put the blame on specific targets, such as elites, without concrete evidence. An efficient way to denounce certain perspectives, ideologies, or individuals is by attaching them to pedophilia, which is universally seen as abominable. 
</li><li><b>Effect of demonization in conspiracy theories</b>: Labeling others as pedophiles not only creates a moral divide but also inhibits engagement with nuanced viewpoints different from one's own. Gura criticizes the notion that elites are more likely to be pedophiles, arguing it is more common among lower and middle classes due to sheer numbers. However, conspiracy theories favor targeting elites due to pre-existing grievances against them, exacerbated by the refusal to critically analyze larger systemic issues. 
</li><li><b>Investigative journalism versus conspiracy theories</b>: Gura distinguishes between investigative journalism and conspiracy theories. He appreciates the rigorous standards, commitment to truth, and potential risk of repercussions in investigative journalism. In contrast, conspiracy theories lack such standards and proceed with scandalous speculations without concrete evidence. 
</li><li><b>Systems thinking and conspiracy theories</b>: He distinguishes between systems thinking and conspiracy theories. While conspiracy theories blame a separate group, systems thinking considers the interconnected parts within larger systems. Gura refers to conspiracy theories as software entrenched into the mind and reinforced by sociocultural systems, serving the survival mechanism of the ego.
</li><li><b>Definition and nature of conspiracy theories</b>: Gura uses a Wikipedia definition to explain that a conspiracy theory is not a simple conspiracy. A conspiracy involves actual covert plots carried out by a group, whereas a conspiracy theory posits manipulation of events by a small hidden group to make sense of the world. Conspiracy theorists believe they have special knowledge or unique understanding about these plots.
</li><li><b>Conspiracy theories as a form of scapegoating and a sense of heroism</b>: Leo discusses how individuals may buy into conspiracy theories as they provide a sense of purpose and makem feel like heroes fighting against perceived evil groups. They can derive a sense of satisfaction and self-validation from these theories, despite them offering no real solution to actual problems. For example, pedophile conspiracy theories don't actively prevent pedophilia but may worsen the issue by diluting serious accusations.
</li><li><b>Flawed vigilante justice and modern witch hunts</b>: The detrimental consequences of extremist views fueled by conspiracy theories can range from de-platforming innocent people to witch trial-like scenarios. Leo discusses the dangers of vigilante justice directed at allegedly guilty parties with no indefiable proof, emphasizing the importance of enforcing law through proper channels like courts, juries, or organizations responsible for monitoring civil rights abuses.
</li><li><b>Illusion of singular control over reality and complex societal systems</b>: Leo contends that reality and society are too complex and distributed to be controlled by any singular entity or group. Even if there are groups with nefarious agendas, counteracting forces coupled with their varying individual survival instincts make it impossible for any one group to dominate. These systems are mostly run by individuals acting on unconscious, survival-driven impulses, making them inherently uncontrollable and chaotic.
</li><li><b>The unfeasibility of the evil elite narrative</b>: Given the inherent conflicts and differences among individuals and groups, the notion of there being a singular, unified, malevolent elite group controlling everything is deemed unfeasible. In reality, even within such a hypothetical group, there would be internal discord as each member would have different agendas and ideas, which would prevent them from achieving a cohesive plan. The control narrative is often propagated by conspiracy theories to fuel us versus them mentality. 
</li><li><b>Misunderstanding of collective decision-making and cognitive constructs of reality</b>: Leo suggests that a misunderstanding of collective decision-making and cognitive constructs of reality could potentially be at the root of conspiracy theories. Human minds, driven by survival instincts, often construct differing versions of reality, making unified control unlikely. Instead of clashes between homogeneous groups (as suggested by conspiracy theories), society is shaped by the interactions of various different actors with diverse survival agendas. This complexity negates the conspiracy idea of a group secretly controlling society.
</li><li><b>Understanding the Origins of Evil and Conspiracy Theories</b>: Leo Gura discusses the relationship between the human perception of evil and the tendency for the mind to create conspiracy theories. "Evil," according to Gura, is not a product of conscious malicious intent from an all-powerful evil force, but rather arises from unconsciousness, selfishness, and ignorance. Conspiracy theories are appealing because they provide a simplistic answer to complex problems and challenges, such as the existence of evil. 
</li><li><b>The Mind and Conspiracy Theories</b>: Gura explains that the mind, which dislikes confusion and the unknown, creates narratives to make sense of its surroundings. In this continuous, seemingly effortless process, most individuals aren't aware that they're engaging in it. The complexity of reality is often too challenging for the mind, leading it to oversimplify and distort situations, which can foster the development of conspiracy theories. 
</li><li><b>The Danger of Simplified Narratives</b>: Leo cautions against adopting simplified narratives such as conspiracy theories. Accepting a simplistic explanation can provide a quick sense of meaning and purpose, making it appear more desirable than undertaking the difficult task of introspection and self-questioning. Embracing such theories allows individuals to shift the blame onto others, minimizing the need to confront their own faults and responsibilities, which ultimately prevents personal growth and deeper understanding. 
</li><li><b>The Role of Conspiracy Theories in skewed Understanding of Evil</b>: Gura emphasizes that one of the most harmful aspects of conspiracy theories is that they promote an erroneous view of reality, characterized by duality, separation, and the notion of "us versus them." Problematically, these theories reinforce a sense of separation and dominance of the duality principle, which can prevent a non-dual understanding of reality, ultimately leading to a toxic outlook characterized by suspicion, judgment, and blame. 
</li><li><b>Conspiracy Theories and Problem-Solving</b>: Gura highlights that although conspiracy theories might provide a sense of purpose or a simplistic framing of complex issues, they do not contribute to problem-solving. Addressing societal problems requires tackling the root of these issues, requiring intellectual effort, innovative thinking, and the application of science. Therefore, conspiracy theories can often distract from genuine attempts to improve society, serving as more of a hindrance than an aid.
</li><li><b>Disadvantages of Conspiracy Theories</b>: Leo Gura points out that conspiracy theories do not offer solutions for societal problems but rather waste time and energy. They distract individuals from working on their own personal growth and development. Conspiracy theories tend to polarize and radicalize people, causing division and preventing collective action.
</li><li><b>Conspiracy Theories and Personal Responsibility</b>: Gura reiterates that constant focus on conspiracy theories can veer individuals away from improving themselves, becoming sources of entertainment rather than tools for growth or real problem-solving. 
</li><li><b>Challenges in Understanding Pedophilia</b>: Gura highlights the challenges and complexity of understanding pedophilia, suggesting that knee-jerk reactions or demonization avoid addressing the root causes. Pedophilia is described as a deeply troubling societal problem that is still not completely understood or addressed. 
</li><li><b>Personal Experience with Addressing Pedophilia</b>: Gura shares an anecdote about interacting with someone who identified as a pedophile, asking for advice on how to cope with their condition. While Gura admits he was unable to provide solutions, he acknowledges the gravity and complexity of the issue.
</li><li><b>The Need for Dialogue & Compassionate Solutions</b>: Gura criticizes societys inclination to demonize pedophiles instead of engaging in a deeper, more comprehensive discussion about this issue, its causes, and potential solutions. He proposes the exploration of alternatives like virtual reality as outlets for such desires that do not harm anyone. 
</li><li><b>Thinking Beyond Simple Solutions</b>: Gura maintains that the issue of pedophilia cannot be simply solved by imposing harsh punishment like imprisonment or death. Instead, it requires an understanding and humane approach acknowledging its complex nature.
</li><li><b>Understanding Pedophilia</b>: According to Leo Gura, pedophilia is more akin to natural sexual cravings or fetishes, which individuals have little conscious control over. However, he stresses the need for robust measures to prevent the abuse of children, which can cause lifelong psychological trauma.
</li><li><b>Demonization and Its Limitations</b>: Gura warns against the demonization of individuals with criminal tendencies or socially unacceptable fetishes. He posits that stigmatization does not alleviate criminality and may even exacerbate it. Instead, he advocates for compassionate solutions that address the root causes of such issues, potentially involving changes to economic systems or enhanced social safety nets.
</li><li><b>Conspiracy Theories' Appeal to Lower Consciousness</b>: Gura suggests that conspiracy theories are often embraced by individuals at lower levels of consciousness, who are more susceptible to fear and selfishness. According to Leo, these theories serve as a survival mechanism for the ego, confirming its initial phobias. Public figures like Donald Trump and Alex Jones, who also operate at lower levels of consciousness, promote conspiracy theories to manipulate and control others.
</li><li><b>Projection and Conspiracy Theories</b>: Gura discusses the concept of psychological projection in the context of conspiracy theories. He asserts that conspiracy theorists often project their own undesirable traits or fears onto others, creating narratives that externalize personal shortcomings. As an example, he claims that those who frequently condemn pedophilia or homosexuality might themselves be grappling with suppressed tendencies or desires.
</li><li><b>Conspiracy Theories as Emotional Attachments</b>: According to Gura, conspiracy theories act as emotional attachments rather than objective beliefs. They can offer emotional satisfaction and a sense of empowerment to individuals who may otherwise feel powerless. Leo emphasizes that these theories are often an evasion from confronting complex realities and taking collective responsibility.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Collective Responsibility via Conspiracy Theories</b>: Gura argues that blaming societal issues, like crime or pedophilia, solely on particular individuals or groups is a way to avoid addressing the collective responsibility in fostering environments that allow such issues to emerge. For instance, if a society produces many criminals, it should examine how its structures and policies may contribute to criminal behavior. However, Gura asserts that individuals focused solely on personal pursuits often neglect considering these larger dimensions.
</li><li><b>Misuse of skepticism in conspiracy theories</b>: Conspiracy theories often misuse skepticism, weaponizing it rather than applying it constructively. Skeptics are often skeptical of their opponents but fail to apply skepticism to their own worldviews and defense mechanisms. Conspiracy theories exploit low consciousness emotions like anger, fear, and shock to create a devoted fanbase.
</li><li><b>Conspiracy theories increase with decreased political efficacy</b>: Individuals become more susceptible to conspiracy theories when they feel disillusioned with political systems, distrust government institutions, and struggle with personal issues. Conspiracy theories can appeal to these individuals as they provide a sense of order and power.
</li><li><b>Mainstream culture shields against toxic ideologies</b>: Mainstream culture and media, despite its flaws, serve to protect individuals from toxic and potentially harmful ideologies. The breaking down of this mainstream consensus can give rise to toxic ideologies. Elite leadership is crucial for guiding the uneducated majority in society and preventing them from falling into harmful beliefs.
</li><li><b>Conspiracy theories as a form of gossip</b>: Conspiracy theories often share similarities with gossip, playing on people's liking for entertaining, and sometimes controversial, narratives. They can create deeply-engaging content feeding on suspicions, speculations, and paranoia.
</li><li><b>Railing against the elites can lead to conspiracy theories</b>: Complaining about elites or establishment systems can become a slippery slope leading to toxic conspiratorial thinking. It's important to criticize the status quo from a place of consciousness and understanding rather than as an emotional reaction.
</li><li><b>Direct experiences versus beliefs</b>: As belief systems can be quite malleable and subjective, distinguishing between one's beliefs and direct experiences is crucial in navigating complex realities and avoiding the pitfalls of conspiracy thinking.
</li><li><b>Dangers of removing elites</b>: Dismissing or removing elites could lead to a lack of guidance for the more uneducated and selfish members of society, potentially exacerbating societal problems. The masses need conscious leaders to prevent them from spiraling into delusion and toxic ideologies.
</li><li><b>Democracy and society run by elites</b>: Leo Gura asserts that while elites can be selfish, he would choose an educated elite over an uneducated and selfish mob to run a society. He states that democracy must be handled by individuals who can use it in an intelligent and selfless manner.
</li><li><b>Understanding of reality</b>: Gura explains how reality is mind-constructed and often unconsciously so. As such, it's crucial to remain aware that the mind is constructing reality, otherwise, it might construct a delusional bubble. Examples of such bubbles from history include Nazi Germany.
</li><li><b>Conspiracy theories as civic engagement</b>: Leo Gura criticizes viewing conspiracy theories as a form of civic engagement. While he agrees with being civically and politically active in a healthy way, he stipulates that this should not be done through conspiracy theories.
</li><li><b>Potential harm caused by conspiracy theories</b>: Gura discusses the potential harm conspiracy theories can cause, including violence triggered by unfounded beliefs and damage to the reputations of innocent people by false accusations.
</li><li><b>Mind-made narratives and personal growth</b>: He suggests the importance of refocusing efforts from conspiracy theories to personal growth and mindfulness. Gura emphasizes that belief in conspiracy theories can distract from inner work and personal development. 
</li><li><b>Addressing the belief in Conspiracy theories</b>: While Gura openly states his belief in UFOs, he clarifies that he doesn't let this belief dictate his work or narrative. Unlike conspiracy theorists, he distinguishes his beliefs from his direct experiences. 
</li><li><b>Conspiracy theories vs Direct Experience</b>: Gura highlights that most of his work involves deep introspection and questioning his line of thought, which drastically separates him from conspiracy theorists. His statements are grounded in deep research and direct experience.
</li><li><b>Addressing Russiagate</b>: Relative to the Russiagate conspiracy theory, Gura believes there is some substance to claims of Trump's financial conflicts of interest with Russia, but he doesn't believe Putin is a puppet master for Trump. He emphasizes that his work is not about presenting beliefs but encouraging individuals to unravel spiritual concepts for themselves.
</li><li><b>Discussion on Trump-Russia Relations</b>: Leo Gura explores the possibility of financial connections between Trump and Russia. Though he lacks concrete evidence, he suggests that Trump's financial links with Russia or Russian oligarchs would make sense given his sons' videos and the shady financing behind Trump's projects. He predicts that more concrete proofs will emerge about Trump's financial conflicts of interest in the coming years.
</li><li><b>Leo Gura's Teachings Vs. Conspiracy Theories</b>: He differentiates his spiritual teachings from conspiracy theories, arguing that his theories are based on direct consciousness and experiences that individuals can validate for themselves. In contrast, conspiracy theories often lack evidence and can lead to distortion of truths or reality. 
</li><li><b>Understanding the Nature of Reality</b>: Gura discusses the dangerous power of the mind in being able to construct any narrative, even those detached from reality, as long as it maintains internal consistency. This reinforces the idea that reality is primarily constructed in the mind and that the reason and logic used to support certain beliefs can often be manipulated by the ego mind to serve selfish purposes. 
</li><li><b>Egos Manipulation of Reason and Logic</b>: Leo emphasizes the fact that reason and logic can be manipulated to serve the egos selfish interests, leading to self-deception and misinterpretations of reality. This further aligns with his argument against the validity of conspiracy theories, as they often use reason and logic to rationalize dubious claims.
</li><li><b>Imagination and Reality Construction</b>: Leo talks about the complexity of imagination in constructing reality. This process, he says, is tied to survival needs, making it not easily controlled or stopped. This points to a deeper understanding of consciousness elevating beyond the illusionary constructions of the ego mind.
</li><li><b>Detecting Unhealthy Conspiracy Theories</b>: Leo offers a solution to detect harmful conspiracy theories. He suggests turning inwards and practicing introspection to feel the emotions fueling these theories such as fear, paranoia, bitterness, hostility, judgment, scapegoating, and closed-mindedness. He maintains that truth lies beyond the confines of the ego and its accompanying negative emotions. 
</li><li><b>Role of Introspection in Untrusted Beliefs</b>: Leo Gura stresses the importance of introspection in understanding and identifying false beliefs or conspiracy theories. He argues that feelings of fear, paranoia, blame, and other negative emotions often associated with conspiracy theories are indicators of an ego-driven perspective rather than a truthful understanding of reality. He underlines the importance of self-reflection, open-mindedness, and acknowledgement of personal ignorance in achieving higher consciousness.
</li><li><b>Importance of introspection and interest in truth</b>: To combat the influence of conspiracy theories, people must have a genuine desire for truth, which entails keeping an open mind, introspecting, and prioritizing truth over any personal theories, grudges, biases, or political attachments. Obtaining truth requires the person to surrender all personal theories and sincere practice, which can take years.
</li><li><b>Need for open-mindedness and education</b>: Achieving a broader and truer understanding of the world also requires open-mindedness, diverse perspectives, education, and rigorous science. As a solution to conspiracy theories, people must seek multiple perspectives, and not become attached to any single one. 
</li><li><b>Valuing intellectual integrity and admitting ignorance</b>: Leo Gura mentions that combating conspiracy theories requires intellectual integrity, a commitment to the truth, and being comfortable in admitting ignorance. 
</li><li><b>Distinguishing beliefs from direct experiences</b>: In the quest for truth, differentiating what one believes from what one has directly experienced is crucial. 
</li><li><b>Non-dual mystical experiences as a solution</b>: Gura suggests having non-dual mystical experiences as a powerful solution to conspiracy theories.
</li><li><b>Promoting love and consciousness</b>: As an ultimate solution to conspiracy theories, Gura places love, consciousness, truth, and selflessness above everything else. The more conscious, loving, selfless, and truthful a person is, the less likely it is for conspiracy theories to take root in their thinking.
</li><li><b>Further exploration of the topic</b>: At the end of his video, Gura encourages viewers to explore related topics by watching his other episodes on cult psychology, how ideologies work, belief mechanics, self-deception, and systems thinking.
</li><li><b>Anticipated discussions on science</b>: Gura also indicates that he will be releasing deep dives on the epistemology of science, where he will dissect the way scientific mechanisms can also get fooled by certain self-deceiving thinking patterns and lack of deep understanding of how the mind can play tricks on epistemology.
