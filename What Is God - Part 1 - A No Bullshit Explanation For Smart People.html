[Music] you what is God this is an advanced explanation
and FAQ this is going to be a two-part miniseries
in part one we're gonna cover the fundamentals we're gonna
give you a full explanation of God and in part
2 we're gonna address commonly asked questions and objections so
this here will be a complete explanation of God based
on my own direct experiences not dogmas that I believe
or a particular ideology that I like and that I
defend but stuff that I have become directly conscious of
myself needless to say nothing that I say here should
be taken on faith or blindly believed by you you
should use your critical thinking and you should follow it
up and try to verify the things that I talk
about in your own direct experiences the things I'll be
talking about can be verified by you that's my claim
at least and it's your job to actually do it
and I'm inviting you to do it the whole point
of this conversation is so that you can see the
potential of doing it and then get inspired and motivated
to actually do it of course you're going to have
a lot of objections to the things that I say
here and lots of questions all of these objections will
be addressed I'll try to address as many as I
can as we go here in part one but there's
just too many of them to address them all which
is why we're gonna have a part two specifically focusing
on those so if you really want a comprehensive understanding
with all of your doubts allayed then make sure you
stick around for part two now this question of God
what is God you have to appreciate the depth of
this question this is a very advanced topic and it's
a quite challenging communication that we're about to have here
how do I communicate something to you that is beyond
words your mind doesn't want to hear what I have
to say on this topic your mind wants to misinterpret
what I have to say on this topic this is
probably the most controversial and confusing topic that the human
mind can tackle of all time of all the topics
you think calculus is challenging you think quantum mechanics is
challenging no understanding what God is that's the real challenge
because it's full of so much trickery and deception this
topic is fraught with dogma self deception and closed mindedness
it's deeply counterintuitive and paradoxical and it threatens your entire
way of life so the mind Faiz finds ways to
misunderstand what God is very easily and we're gonna have
to address some of those before we can really tell
you what God is I can tell you right now
but first we have to lay a little bit of
introduction because it's it's pointless to tell you when you're
not going to understand when you're gonna fall into various
ways of misinterpreting what's being said you have to appreciate
this question of what is God what we're really asking
about here is we're asking about the source and origin
of all of existence all of creation we're trying to
go beyond the Big Bang beyond where science can typically
go and so you should expect that's not gonna happen
easily you're not just gonna be able to go on
google and type in what is God and then get
a five-minute video that explains to you what it is
I mean you can find that but you're not gonna
really understand which is why we're spending quite a bit
of time introducing this and setting it up properly I
want you to appreciate that people who delivered these teachings
as little as a couple hundred years ago were burned
at the stake and even today in the 21st century
in certain parts of the world if I was to
go and deliver this teaching seriously I would be stoned
to death or beheaded or kicked out of the country
see so uh this is serious stuff we're talking about
we're talking about life-and-death issues here this isn't just some
entertainment or some philosophy now of course mankind has been
teaching about God for thousands of years since the beginning
of time but also for all of that time many
of these teachers have been murdered killed suppressed persecuted especially
when they're teaching it in a way that doesn't fit
with the orthodoxy of their culture and especially in the
way that I'll be teaching it here because I'm not
beholden to any orthodoxies or try to satisfy any cultural
norms so just keep all that in mind of course
the elephant in the room the first question we have
to answer before we even get to what God is
is does God even exist what are we saying that
exists when we talk about God the answer is yes
God does exist this is not a personal opinion of
mine this is not a dogma that I hold this
is something that you can verify for yourself it's a
fact but of course the question is what does that
really mean to say that God exists certainly I'm not
meaning that there is a bearded man in the clouds
sitting down looking upon you and judging you and throwing
you into hell that's not what we mean that's a
metaphor so what do we really mean when we say
God exists you see a lot of people they get
so heated about God and they have a very strong
opinion about yes God exists or no God doesn't exist
that they don't really even bother to question what are
they saying yes or no to what is this thing
you're affirming or denying so while God does exist God
is not what you think it is is what I'm
saying and I'll tell you what it is in a
minute here but we got to build up a little
bit more there are three types of worldviews or people
that we need to contend with here in this explanation
firstly is the fundamentalist theists the religious people the evangelicals
the Christians the Catholics the the Jews the Muslims and
even certain fundamentalist Buddhists and so forth these people we're
calling them the theists who of course still deeply believe
in God and they live a godly life or so
they think then we have the second type of person
which is sort of the opposite we have the atheists
the materialists the rationalist and the scientifically minded people the
pragmatically minded people these are the people that don't believe
in God because they trust their eyes and their senses
and halia where's God there's no God so why are
you talking about it those types of people these are
the people who believe that God is a is a
creation of mankind created by mankind to brainwash others and
the third type of person is the agnostic which is
an interesting case because you would think well maybe the
agnostics have it right because they're somewhere in the middle
well the agnostic believes that oftentimes what they believe is
that it's not possible to know who are we to
really know we have to be humble and we have
to just kind of stay out of it and we
have to be open to both possibilities maybe the theists
are right maybe the atheists are right who really knows
well all three of these worldviews are confused deeply deeply
confused and misunderstand what God is they're confused and mistaken
in their own unique ways but each of them also
has a little kernel of truth a tiny kernel of
truth that is being missed amongst all the confusion and
error and so what we really want to do is
we want to separate those two apart sort the wheat
from the chaff we want to save that kernel of
truth collect all the kernels of truth from all three
of these and then discard all the confusion and the
delusion now if you know about my history I was
an atheist for the majority of my life so I'm
not coming at you from some religious tradition I wasn't
a fundamentalist Christian or evangelical or anything like this I
was an atheist for a good 25 years of my
life and then just as little as three or four
years ago I had my first direct consciousness of God
and then of course my views quickly changed and I
became very aware of all the traps and limitations of
atheism and also I've done a lot of study into
theism into agnosticism so I'm very familiar now now having
experienced God I'm very familiar with with with all the
confusion that goes on here so I can help you
to clarify this now to understand the problem especially if
you're a theistic Lea minded you have to understand the
pre trans fallacy and this is a concept popularized by
Ken Wilber the pre trans fallacy helps us to make
sense of this whole sticky wicket and the way that
it basically works is we have three categories of worldview
and these are stages of cognitive development that the human
psyche evolves through individually and collectively it's the pre rationale
the rationale and the trans rationale now the pre rational
these are your classic stereotypical fundamentalist religious zealot types these
are your jerry falwell x' of the world who have
a strong faith bible-thumping christians and fundamentalist muslims and even
Buddhists and so forth a good chunk of the world
is pre rational they're not interested in scientifically validating God
they just believe that God is what they believe it
is and it's not even a doubt in their mind
about that and they try to live an upstanding moral
life and they follow the scriptures their Bible and so
forth that's the pre rational and they're prone to superstitious
and various kinds of mythical thinking these people could buy
into our mageddon and various kinds of stories that they
take literally like Noah's Ark and so forth of course
many people in the developed world are too evolved for
that they've move on to the next level which is
the rational stage at the rational stage you shed some
of those superstitions and dogmas and you start to question
you start to doubt you become more skeptical you start
to become more empirical you start to appreciate the value
of science and thinking through things rationally for yourself proof
consensus building in this source of stuff that is done
by the modern scientific community and so you buy into
that and so really science becomes your sort of new
religion so the fallacy comes in in that the people
who are at the rational stage they think of themselves
as being so far above and more evolved in the
pre rational stage that they ignore that there is a
trans rational third stage of development what is the trans
rational well it's a little difficult to describe because it's
beyond language and beyond the mind the trans rational is
not a rejection of rationality it's a going beyond rationality
and realizing the limits of rationality and really when you
start to get into vision logic something called vision logic
you get into the trans rational realm and then the
trans rational realms have a huge amount of stuff in
them that I have talked about in past episodes and
will continue to in the future but anyways so the
pre trans fallacy is what the scientifically minded or atheistic
Allah minded person does is they think that there is
no such thing as a trans rational they confuse the
trans rational with the pre rational and so this communication
that I'm having right now with you many people will
be tempted to say well Leo you're talking about God
and you seem so confident and cocky and arrogant about
knowing God and you talk about spirituality and other kinds
of mystical things that means that you're just like one
of those fundamentalist Christian type of people so that's the
pre trans fallacy this communication is a trans rational communication
and you need to be able to see that it's
very important because most of you listening to we are
gonna be in the rational stage so from the rational
stage there are some things that you're right about there
are many problems with the pre rational stage there are
many ways in which it's deluded full of dogma and
untruths when pre rational people start to literally interpret the
Bible or various holy books and laws and scriptures they
can really go wrong but while religion is chock full
of delusion you're right about that and I have many
criticisms of religion trust me I've been a critic of
religion for a long time for most of my life
I'm very much allergic to Dogma into ideology and to
conformist cult thinking so while all of that is true
about religion you're still missing one very important thing there's
one thing that religion is right about fundamentally and that
is that God is an actual phenomenon not a figment
or a creation of the human mind that's what you're
missing so be open to that possibility the key insight
I have for you in this episode is that God
is an experience not a belief or a theory God
is an actual experience that I've had many other people
have had and that you can have and that's even
important for you theists to understand because the problem with
you theists is that you believe in God so much
that you confuse your idea and and I and your
image of God for God itself and that actually becomes
your greatest obstacle to actually understanding what God is all
of the preconceived ideas that were taught to you and
brainwashed into you through Sunday school or wherever you got
your beliefs and God from so don't think that you're
out of the woods yet if you're a theist superficially
it seems like I'm agreeing with you the theists because
supposedly I agree that God exists but actually in a
certain sense the things that I'm communicating are closer to
what the rationalist and the atheist holds then your pre
rational theistic ideas of God is some bearded man in
the clouds now of course the very first objection we
gotta answer here is that Leo what are you talking
about personal experience you're saying that you experience God and
now you think you know what God is how arrogant
of you after all we know that personal experience man
that's not reliable people hallucinate all sorts of things they're
people who have all sorts of psychotic visions and things
like that and they misinterpret them and they think sometimes
people even think that their God so I mean so
Lia how can you trust your personal experience what does
this really show this isn't proof I need solid concrete
proof I want a double-blind placebo-controlled study that shows me
that there's a God if there is such a thing
because you know Leo extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence so
where's your evidence so far all I'm hearing you say
is just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo and and talking and
philosophy but no real proof so prove to me provide
to me the tangible evidence and then maybe I'll agree
with you about the existence of God such the rationalist
and the atheist Thanks and the rationalist actually believes that
this is this is a valid way to think about
this problem here's the reality of the matter when you
say this objection you really demonstrate that you don't know
and you haven't really thought carefully about what experiences or
what proof is or even how science works or how
knowledge works because in this objection you're just assuming that
proof is a given and that proof is just an
easy thing it's like you just go and find proof
you find proof for God in the way that you
might find proof for some murder like you find a
knife with blood on it use some DNA testing and
then BOOM you go you've proved it and in the
same way we can prove God but that's not how
it works because when we're talking about God we're talking
about the most fundamental thing ever we're talking about the
origin of existence itself so as you can clearly see
proof requires that first you have existence science and rationality
depend on certain fundamental things that need to be in
place before they work see so where you're not realizing
is that proof it's actually a second-order phenomenon we have
to build up to proof proof is not something we
just take for granted after all what qualifies as proof
whose standards for proof are we going to use to
prove existence exactly your standards my standards are community standards
our culture's standards you're taking all of this completely for
granted consider that truth or being is prior to proof
because proof itself requires being in order to get itself
off the ground so here's a little analogy for you
it's as though we have lego building blocks and we're
gonna use these to build a castle so the lego
building block itself if we have one block right here
this let's think of it as truth or as being
these are like the atomic particles that make up everything
in our LEGO building universe proof is a second-order phenomenon
in the sense that out of these bricks we can
build a castle the castle is made out of the
little bricks so it's really an emergent second order right
you can't have a castle without bricks but you can
have bricks without a castle you see that you see
how the castle depends on the bricks to exist first
well that's how proof works so in a sense when
you're telling me that you need proof for God the
critical mistake you're making it says though in this Lego
universe by way of analogy it says though you're asking
me to formulate a brick in the shape of a
castle you see you've put the cart before the horse
you've misunderstood what depends on what because you're taking the
castle as the primary and the brick as the secondary
it's sort of like you're asking me to prove the
existence of bricks to you because all you've ever experienced
are castles you see the problem there you've got it
backwards doesn't it work like that if you're familiar with
Kirk qoodles incompleteness theorem then you should also be familiar
with the notion that proof cannot be systematized or symbolized
all right yeah the truth cannot be systematized or symbolized
and that proof is always a weaker notion than truth
if you want to understand that in a much deeper
way go check out my episode on doodles incompleteness theorem
it's a very important discovery within epistemology and it wasn't
just girdle but uh alfred tarski was also instrumental in
demonstrating that proof will always be less than truth the
domain of truth is everything and the domain of proof
is a sub-domain of truth because proof itself is part
of truth but not the entirety of it another way
to explain this to you is proof to me that
you exist how would you do that you see the
problem with you rationalist types is that you ignore your
own direct experiences and the necessity of your own existence
and the fact that you aren't intimately in the world
you're not standing outside of it as some observer outside
the universe looking in you're intimately in the universe so
it's actually not possible to prove that you exist because
existence is more fundamental than proof the only reason you
think you exist is because you feel that you exist
and that happens through personal experience or for example try
to prove that colors exist to a blind person think
about that think about it for a minute and what
you'll realize is that it's not possible because for proof
to happen a lot of stuff has to be in
place for proof to happen we already have to assume
existence we already have to assume a common base of
experiences between individuals and we have to assume that our
experiences aren't similar enough that we can work with each
other we can build a consensus we can have standards
around what qualifies as proof and what doesn't these standards
can be different based on which community or culture you're
a part of which time in history we're talking about
and so forth right so proof is a very complex
notion that requires a lot of stuff to build it
up it's mad at various building blocks which themselves cannot
be proven so appreciate that it's not as simple as
you think there's certain things in life that can't be
proven and yet they are true consider that possibility because
many scientists and rationalists and atheists they just assume that
everything that's true automatically must be provable and that's false
that's been demonstrated to be false by curt girdle and
alfred tarski go check that out if you don't believe
me study their work think it through moving on though
the main reason why God doesn't make sense to you
is because you're failing to account for different states of
consciousness yeah this is it right here it's the answer
because what all of you rationalists basically don't consider is
that there could be different states of consciousness and that
rationality and science and proof are only operative within certain
states of consciousness and not others so what do I
mean by different states of consciousness well right now you're
in what we might call the conventional physical state of
consciousness the conventional normal waking state other states of consciousness
that you might have experienced as being drunk it's a
very different state of consciousness certain things are open to
you in that state and other things are closed every
state comes with its own limitations and possibilities for example
when you're very drunk you're not going to be able
to do logic and science and rationality but there's other
states like dreaming again which come with their own possibilities
and limitations there shouldn't things you can do in your
dreams that you can't do in the quote/unquote real world
and vice versa and then there are rarified superhuman high
levels of consciousness which very few humans have ever accessed
beyond what we consider the highest level you know normally
you just consider that this normal waking consciousness like the
highest level of consciousness well that's just not true that's
what you're failing to account for and so to understand
God what you need to understand is that it's not
possible to understand God from your current state of consciousness
you need to raise your state of consciousness significantly a
lot by ten or a hundred or a thousand fold
and then you have a chance of understanding and you
see that's why this communication is so challenging is because
I'm trying to communicate something to you from a high
level of consciousness that I gathered down to your current
level of a consciousness right now and so by definition
it's not going to work it's like I'm trying to
explain colors to a blind person can't work the only
way you can understand colors is to directly experience colors
what you need to appreciate is that science is a
figment of consciousness you can only do science and rationality
because you're in a particular state of consciousness for example
an ant cannot do science or rationality and ants the
state of consciousness is significantly more limited than that of
a human and this is a great example because think
of how limited the ants universe is compared to what
we know as humans the ant spends its whole life
mostly living underground within a small area and even when
it ventures outside it's still basically living its whole life
on let's say like one square acre of land the
ant doesn't know about galaxies Jupiter the moon the ant
doesn't know about humans in many cases unless he had
stepped on and even then he doesn't understand why or
what's really going on the ant doesn't know about all
the different creatures and races that exist around the world
the ant knows nothing about language about math about science
about history the philosophy about art about entertainment about pornography
like what does the ant know none of this stuff
the ants universe is so limited so now imagine that
the current state of consciousness that you're in right now
that you've been in your whole life and that all
of your friends and family in your entire community has
been in has been like that ant and that what
you know is the conventional universe is just like that
ants reality very limited and that I'm talking about states
of consciousness that are a thousand times greater just like
you know imagine the difference between you and an ant
you might think that an ant probably has a thousand
times less consciousness than you well now imagine someone who's
a human but has a hunt times more consciousness than
a standard human that's a person who can understand God
and unless you become that person you ain't gonna understand
God another reason you fail to understand God is because
you fail to take into account states of cognitive development
which I've already explained to you in the pre trance
fallacy those three stages of pre rational rational post rational
that was me describing stages of cognitive development I've also
talked in the past about spiral dynamics that also talks
about different stages of cognitive development so what this means
is that see ordinarily we just assume that all people
are the same same stage same level of consciousness which
is just not true the human psyche evolves and grows
as does human culture and the culture that you're in
right now and the stage of development you're in right
now is not the highest stage not even close so
you need to be able to anticipate that stuff that
you that you can't understand at one stage of consciousness
you will at the next stage and so you need
to be open to new stages rather than denying them
like most people do I mean that's the mistake people
make people don't like to acknowledge their stages because of
course that means that they have to admit that they're
not at the highest stage and they have a lot
of growing to do and of course they don't want
to admit that because especially these rationalist types they can
get very arrogant intellectually arrogant thinking that they're so far
above and superior to religious superstitious people that they've figured
it all out well I got news for you you
haven't you're in for a rude awakening another reason why
you can't make sense of God is because you assume
that reality is the material physical system which is just
wrong fundamentally your conception of reality is wrong reality is
not a physical system rather reality is a giant and
mind which can imagine and think up all sorts of
different sub realities within it one of which is what
we call physical reality this universe as you know it
so see if you assume that the universe is just
a physical box with objects in it just kind of
like bouncing around like billiard balls and everything's just random
and it's just according to the laws of physics and
all this if you assume that that's is what's true
that's what is objective then your universe is very limited
because it's constrained by all that and you think that
that's how it has to be and that's that's that's
all that there is and then of course you assume
that consciousness comes from the brain from neurons and it's
just an algorithm it's just calculations happening in there you
have this very materialistic explanation for the universe which is
wrong when you assume that then you're very stuck you
don't open yourself up to those trans rational states of
consciousness that are possible or even if you experience them
you bring the back and you interpret them within your
materialist paradigm and from the Retiro spera dime God makes
no sense it's impossible it's crazy it's ridiculous it's outrageous
it seems childish to even talk about God from within
your paradigm and that's exactly right the mistake you're making
is that you're clinging to your paradigm and you're refusing
to actually question your paradigm now the material's paradigm you
tell yourself is scientifically validated and proven that's not true
at all the paradigm I'm talking about has never been
scientifically proven science has never demonstrated the existence of a
external material objective world never and it never will and
no such thing exists and of course science has never
demonstrated the existence of other human beings nor will it
ever hm-hm you see these things are metaphysical dogmas of
science don't you think that science can't have dogmas science
can definitely have dogmas and it does has many metaphysical
and epistemic dogmas which construct the paradigm these are just
assumptions that are never proven there's assumes that that's how
it has to be so that's what needs to be
questioned if you really want to understand God have you
noticed that God is a very controversial and emotional topic
for most people most people have a very strong opinion
about it one way or another whether you believe or
don't believe even when you don't believe you still believe
you just believe in the opposite or you believe it's
not possible to know it's very difficult to escape the
the trap of believing firmly in in this stuff and
the reason it's so controversial is because it's it's this
question of God's it's the very core of your web
of belief and your web of belief is sort of
like your operating system which governs your whole life and
it's fundamental to how you understand reality how you perceive
and how you interact with all aspects of reality from
human beings to objects affects your morality affects what you
think is right and wrong affects how you love how
you hate affects what kind of things you pursue in
your life what you devote your time and energy to
so it has enormous practical consequences the mistake that people
make is they think that god has no practical consequences
this is just a purely a philosophical topic that's not
the case in fact it's just the opposite it's precisely
because the ramifications of realizing what God is are so
widespread and so practical it'll change your entire orientation to
life which is precisely why you're so threatened by it
and you get so emotional by it because the emotions
the dogma is there as a smokescreen to get you
from not to not deeply investigate this matter for yourself
because if you ever did you would discover how wrong
your old worldviews were and then that would be that
would be frightening to discover that that would be a
rude awakening now I want you to be honest about
what your true attitude is about God a lot of
times people aren't honest about this theists or atheists be
honest about do you think God is a positive thing
or a negative thing or maybe you believe that there
is no such thing as God it's just all a
waste of time or maybe you believe yeah Leo there
is a God and it looks like this this is
what I imagine God to be that's what I was
told it is in the Quran or in the Bible
be very honest about your truly held attitude about God
it's that attitude whatever it is positive or negative or
maybe you just have an attitude that it's not possible
to know that attitude is the chief obstacle to you
understanding what God is so are you willing to surrender
that attitude or are you gonna cling to it and
try to defend at all costs now see atheists get
very tricky here they say well Leo I don't have
an attitude god is not even a thing so what
ad is who I have no attitude it's just nothing
yeah that's your attitude see that's your attitude are you
willing to give that up and if you say no
leo I'm not gonna give that up because it's not
even an attitude and you know I'm not gonna open
myself up to various kinds of brainwashing why should i
well that's your attitude and that's precisely why you'll never
understand God another question I want you to ask is
have you actually ever experienced God for yourself yes or
no and that's very different from believing in God have
you actually experienced God or for you atheists have you
actually experienced that there is no God watch out watch
out not to confuse your beliefs for experience because many
atheists will say well yeah Leo I've never experienced God
therefore by definition I've experienced it there is no God
no no you haven't just because you haven't experienced God
yet doesn't mean that there is no God see watch
out and for you theists who have all sorts of
firm convictions in your belief in God it's very easy
for you to confuse your beliefs with an actual experience
be careful about tricking yourself here and the last question
I want you to ask yourself is are you directly
conscious of God right this second because many people have
had mystical experiences and trip reports and so forth that
they've encountered in the past but all of that is
the past and now it's just a memory so are
you conscious of God right now and if you're not
conscious of God right now then well you're disconnected from
God you don't really know what it is all you've
got our memories and pleasant stories interpretations you see your
interpretations the way your mind thinks about God even if
you've experienced it is still very different from actual consciousness
of God now let's take a look at the biggest
misconceptions about God perhaps the biggest one is that God
is a belief which I already told you it's not
another common one is that God is a superstitious religious
notion wishful thinking and the way that atheists think that
really all that God is is it's a it's a
sort of defense mechanism that naive people adopt in order
to avoid facing death it's the denial of death people
wish for an afterlife and they wish for more meaning
in their life than there really is they wish for
some overarching meaning to life something beyond just randomness and
chaos and and really what God amounts to is just
sort of a defense mechanism against the nihilism of a
reality the the brute cold hard reality that's there that
has no meaning and it's just a bunch of random
chaos this is also a misconception now of course it's
true that many people in the world who are the
pre rational stage of development in fact do use religion
and God as a sort of crutch to face some
tough philosophical realities to deny death to deny meaninglessness and
certain truths within nihilism that's correct certain people do do
that but that's not the origin of the notion of
God that's a that's precisely the pre trans fallacy that
I'm talking about so another common misconception is that God
is a bearded man in the sky I've read many
books by by great scientists quantum physicists cosmologists and astrophysicists
where they argue against God but the God they're arguing
against is the bearded man in the sky conception of
God which of course is not really what God is
it's so silly how a scientist could actually even argue
against this conception of God is ridiculous that's not what
God is God is also not a man not a
he not a creature not a being and not even
a thing so already you should start to understand the
difficulty of understanding God if God is none of these
things because what what do you know the only thing
you know are things beings creatures and God is something
else so that's what makes it so tricky another common
misconception is that God is incompatible with science evolution technology
or advanced society and whenever God has explained to an
atheist in the back of the atheists mind there's always
sort of a a suspicion because in his mind he's
like well but if I accept God if we carry
on this conversation further then that's going to mean that
we're somehow now denying science or evolution or technology and
I know that those things are true and so God
must therefore be false but that's a false dichotomy in
fact both can be true and that's what the trans
rational domain is all about you get to keep science
and evolution and technology but you also go beyond them
another common misconception is that God has rules that you
must follow that God looks down upon you and judges
you and punishes evildoers and sinners and that your role
in life is not to be a sinner this is
false God doesn't punish anyone God doesn't judge anyone God
doesn't care what you do or don't do and has
no rules that you must follow you are given total
freedom in fact that's the that's the the ultimate nature
of God and that's why God is so difficult for
many mere mortals to understand is because God gives you
total freedom to do anything you want if you want
to be a murderer God is fine with you being
a murderer if you want to be a rapist God
is fine with you being a rapist that's very difficult
for people to accept because pre rational people like to
use God to justify their cultural norms so you have
two separate cultural norms and morality from God it's really
problematic when you conflate those two another common misconception is
that God is exclusive to one religion either the Christian
God is right or the Muslim God is right or
the Hindu God is right the Jewish God is right
but they can't all be right or it's the notion
that my religion has the one right God and all
the other ones are wrong this is a false notion
no religion has a monopoly on God and all of
these religions are talking about the same one God there's
not as much diversity within religion as people would think
most atheistic people and scientifically minded people they actually use
this as an argument against the validity of God is
they say well but below you know if God was
if God really existed then surely every religion would agree
upon what God is well they basically do and now
you'll say but Leah but what about like the Hindus
they have many gods they don't have one God so
what are you talking about I mean yeah maybe the
Christian God and the Jewish God maybe they're the same
God and maybe even the Muslim God is the same
God which of course it is all eyes is the
same as the Christian God but what about the Buddhists
the Buddhist don't even have a God Leo and the
Hindus they have many different avatars and they have a
Vishnu and a Ganesha and a and Lakshmi and a
Christian and Shiva and the blah blah blah all right
so so which one is the right one and what
about the Greeks and the Romans they had all kinds
of different gods so how can you say that they're
all one well they are fundamentally if you know how
to interpret religious texts which is a tricky science learning
how to interpret religious texts it's not easy see if
you interpret them literally then of course you've got a
million different gods by different names and they have different
qualities and so you're so confused and it seems like
it's all contradiction and everyone's just making [ __ ]
up well that's not really the case if you properly
read the scriptures and you know how to interpret them
and more importantly when you have a direct experience of
God for yourself you realize that there's only one God
and that all these religions are fundamentally talking about one
God and for example in Hinduism even though they have
many different avatars fundamentally they have one God which is
Shiva or Brahman and the rest they're just different facets
different aspects of God which are symbolized and talked about
metaphorically through different minor deities and incarnations and avatars and
so forth and this has been the case not just
to Hinduism but really everywhere even within Christianity and within
Islam there are always polytheistic strands and various aspects and
in Christianity talk about the holy trinity and they talk
about the holy spirit which are separate from Jesus which
is from God so all this I mean you can
subdivide God into a million different ways which is what
every religion does every culture does but fundamentally they're all
talking about the same stuff and the last misconception and
this is a biggie is that God is other than
you this is so counterintuitive for people to get what
do you mean Leo God is other than me how
can God be me that sounds stupid but on the
other hand how could God be other than you we're
going to get back to this is a very big
point but for now I'll just tell you that if
you think that God is something separate from you like
God is some rarefied metaphysical object that hangs out outside
the universe somewhere hidden behind the scenes in some dark
corner some darker recess of the universe you've got it
wrong God is you but of course that means you're
gonna have to change how you conceive of yourself and
also how you conceive of God to bring those two
things together and you have to make sense of that
and right now in your current state of consciousness it
makes no sense because you don't have a sense of
being God it's likely oh if I'm God then how
come I can't just like create stuff out of thin
air how come I can't just think of a billion
dollars and have it materialize here in a stack of
gold bars how come I can't make that wall disappear
in front of me and you're right you can't do
those things because you're in this limited human form but
even though all that's the case you are still God
you see God is all about limitation so we'll get
back to that so let's now directly address the question
of what is God and the way I want to
approach this is the way that they might in a
introductory philosophy class in a university like if you took
philosophy 101 then they would introduce you to all sorts
of philosophical concepts and of course one of them would
have been God and in Western intellectual tradition in Western
philosophy God is defined a sort of classical standard way
which I want to present to you right here and
then let's take a look at these different facets of
God that are described let's take a look at how
many of them are correct which ones are correct which
ones are false that's going to be interesting to do
so here's how it's classically defined God is the supreme
being the first cause God is the source of all
creation and by creation we mean creation with a capital
C we mean the entire universe and all the versus
everything anything that is real God is also said to
be infinite boundless the all the one the absolute God
is also omniscient or all-knowing all intelligent God is also
omnipotent having unlimited power and the ability to create anything
that it wants God is omnipresent which means that it's
present everywhere there's nowhere in the universe that God is
not which of course is interesting because that uh that
ties in with that point about God being you see
if God is omnipresent he would have to be inside
of you as well sometimes I say God is a
he but you have to understand that God is not
he if I say that that's just you know in
the in the parlance of sort of colloquial speaking but
God is not a hear more properly as to call
it an it also God is said to be benevolent
or all loving and good with a capital G God
is said to be incorporeal eternal and immortal and perfect
and complete so that's basically the classic Western definition now
the question is how much of those are correct and
the answer is all of them this is precisely the
correct definition of God the problem is accepting it and
understanding how this can possibly be so the reason that
I'm saying that all of these are correct is because
over the last three years through my consciousness work I
have directly validated in my direct experience all of these
facets so I'm not just telling you because I've read
this stuff someplace but I have validated for myself that
God is the supreme being the first cause the source
of creation infinite boundless the all the one the absolute
that God is omniscient and all knowing and intelligent to
the infinite degree omnipotent with unlimited power omnipresent I've verified
that well I verified that God is benevolent and all
loving and good with a capital G I've verified that
God is incorporeal eternal immortal perfect and complete but how
can that be how is it possible to verify such
things you might wonder well we'll get to that so
hello now let's go a little bit deeper into into
this definition and explain more of these sorts of facets
of God so God is a radical state of consciousness
but also at the same time God is all states
of consciousness so don't think that you need to be
in a particular state of consciousness in order to experience
God or that God exists only in one state of
consciousness God exists everywhere including this state of consciousness you're
in right now the only problem is is that this
present state of conscious hero right now you're not conscious
that this state of consciousness is a facet of God
imagine if your consciousness expanded and exploded by a thousandfold
that's what God is God is also the absence of
self or you now this seems to contradict what I
said earlier because earlier I just said you are God
so Leo how is it possible that God is the
absence of me but also me well that's exactly right
that's the paradox both of the case the way we
explain this is God is the absence of you as
your limited egoic identity that thing you identify with that
you tell yourself was born that has a life story
that personal hue the biological youth the you that you
think is a creature that you is a false conceptual
self so God is the absence of that if you
get rid of that thing you will experience yourself as
God but then what remains of you well nothing really
you experience yourself as pure emptiness when we strip all
qualities away from you all that remains is just a
state of pure empty consciousness or awareness and that's what
God is so this is you with a capital y
you have to distinguish that from the conventional you that
we don't really talk about the biological you the biographical
you that's the false you that thing has to die
in fact that is the greatest obstacle to you realizing
God you are the obstacle you see and that's why
this topic is so tricky because how do you get
rid of you you want to see God and yet
the thing that's in the way of you seeing God
is yourself God is also synonymous with reality existence and
truth so in a sense the atheist and the rationalist
and the scientist they do subscribe to God but they
call their god reality they call their God nature or
existence but of course they object when I say this
because a rational saying but Leo I mean sure yeah
I believe in reality and in nature but that's not
what God is now see Leo here you're you're redefining
thing see Leo you're playing a word game here because
if God refers to reality then why do we even
need the word God why bring in religious connotations and
spiritual stuff when we can just say realities just like
this machine it's got no godlike qualities it's just a
machine so stop calling it God mm-hmm but you see
that's not what I mean the word God does refer
to reality existence and nature but the problem is is
that you as a rationalist as an atheist as a
scientist are not conscious of what reality or nature or
existence actually are if you were really conscious you would
realize that they are God now why do we call
it God because that's the most appropriate word when you
become conscious of what reality is it's conscious and it's
divine and these are inherently baked into reality and this
is the thing that the atheist the rationals and the
scientist doesn't understand because the atheists the rationals and the
scientists treats reality like I said before as a mechanical
system and God is not a mechanical system reality is
not a mechanical system it's a giant mind that is
what you're missing as an atheist so really you have
as an atheist created a sort of false God for
yourself that you believe in and take completely on blind
faith and which that is what what that is is
that that's mechanical reality an external objective reality that human
beings can study with science that thing doesn't exist you
invented that and that is your God and that is
the thing that you cling to just like the religious
fundamentalist cling to their notions of God is the bearded
man in the clouds God is consciousness pure consciousness the
thing in you right now which is conscious of anything
conscious of existence that's God the problem is that for
the rationalist for the materialist for the atheist they think
of consciousness in a very weak way they think of
consciousness as something that the brain does as consciousness being
something that exists within a physical mechanical universe that's not
what consciousness is there is only consciousness there is no
physical mechanical universe all of that is content within consciousness
consciousness is disembodied consciousness is not a computer simulation running
somewhere consciousness is not happening in a brain all of
those things your computer simulations and brains and BIGBANG's and
universes and signs and rationality all of that is content
within consciousness now you might say but how does the
consciousness occur well exactly see you you don't understand yet
you haven't awoken yet if you were awake and you
were conscious of what consciousness is you would realize that
consciousness is singular and has no opposite and that it
is pure magic pure irreducible magic and that's the thing
that you're avoiding as a scientist from acknowledging and that's
why you deny this see because there's no rational explanation
for it and you're looking for a rational explanation you're
looking to demystify reality and as it turns out that
is impossible that's a false assumption that you can demystify
reality God is also being what is being being is
the only thing that there is being is everything everything
is being everything in this room my face my hands
my the town's coming out of my mouth all of
this is being well then you would say but leo
so if all that's being then all this must be
God but I don't see a God here where's the
God what kind of word games are you playing the
reason you don't see the God even though it's right
here this is God hello wake up this is God
right here your entire life has always been God the
problem is is that you're not interfacing directly with being
you are interpreting being all the time and so your
interpretations and projections onto being create a sort of smokescreen
that doesn't allow you to directly be being and therefore
you're constantly disconnected from it and therefore you're not realizing
what it actually is you're not realizing the significance of
it and so what needs to happen is that you
need to remove all of your interpretations all of your
beliefs and everything that you know such that imagine if
you can remove all of your interpretations of reality completely
you wouldn't know what anything is you wouldn't even know
that I'm a human being you wouldn't know that I'm
leo you wouldn't know whether I'm good or bad you
wouldn't know whether I'm tasty or not tasty you wouldn't
know whether you should mate with me or not made
with me you wouldn't know anything you wouldn't even know
that I'm an object you wouldn't know what I am
you wouldn't know what any objects are you wouldn't even
know what you are you would be in a complete
state of not knowing but what she would have is
pure being stripped of all knowledge and all interpretations all
meanings all values everything so at the same time you
wouldn't know anything is but you would have being and
in that very moment you would have God you would
realize God as a pure being so the biggest obstacle
to you realizing God is all of the interpretations that
you're making constantly that you're not aware that you're making
see we just kind of like look at around the
world we think well the world is made up of
like trees and cars and lights and walls and people
and animals and bla bla bla bla bla no it's
not your mind is creating all of those projections and
interpretations so what's actually there is only pure being but
you are making sense of it such that it helps
you in your survival see so you're recognizing stuff that's
not really there you're sort of projecting it and that
needs to stop and that's why it's so difficult to
realize God is because we're making these projections and interpretations
constantly and so under the radar of our awareness that
we don't even know we're doing it and so for
therefore most people there's no possibility of stopping it and
stopping it is pretty difficult because it's tied in with
your survival Drive and so it's life threatening to do
so God is also now the present moment of now
now is the only thing that is real not the
past not the future now right here this very moment
this is God but what is now it's a good
question have you ever wondered take a look I mean
it's happening right now it's happening all the time there's
nothing but now but what exactly is it see it's
kind of mysterious you don't know how to put your
finger on it and that's the whole problem with God
is that you can't put your finger on it in
the way that you can when we're talking about a
star or the earth or a human being or an
animal or a rat in a laboratory God in fact
is the one thing that can't be pointed to because
the thing that's pointing to God is itself God if
God is everything which it is then you see the
problem this creates this this means that it can't be
pointed to because if I say well this finger here
is God so I'm pointing to it and you will
look at and say okay well maybe maybe Leo's pointing
at God here but what is he pointing with the
words he's using the finger other finger he's using to
point to it and your own mind the ideas your
own mind is using to think about this finger is
God all of those are also God so how do
we point to those now I have to use this
finger to point to this finger because this is also
God so see fingers pointing at fingers it goes around
in a circle so you're gonna be going round in
a circle if you're gonna try to use your mind
to grasp God and you're always gonna be missing it
because it's like right here all the time it's prior
to interpretation prior to language prior to the mind see
so this is why it's so difficult to get because
the process of getting it is itself getting in the
way of having it see you know why you can't
know that you're God because you are God are means
you are being God being is prior to knowing so
the mistake is that you're trying to know God without
realizing that knowledge is already one step too far you
need to be God not know-it-all so what God is
as non-duality no boundaries or oneness non-duality means that there's
really no distinction between things no boundaries so the boundaries
that we classically use to think and understand the world
with like male versus female good versus bad big versus
small existing versus non existing conscious versus unconscious one versus
two here versus there all of these are dualities categories
that we've created and so god is the elimination of
all these categories or the unification of all categories to
realize that actually even those those distinctions in a sense
they do exist at the same time they are all
unified and one the entire universe or all of reality
is one thing and you can become conscious of that
and to become conscious of the oneness of reality is
to become conscious of God and of course when we're
talking about oneness don't exclude yourself from that oneness you
as an object within reality are part of the whole
oneness you see so this is why God can't be
separate from you because if God was over there and
I was over here and I'm looking at God over
there that means that I am NOT God because I'm
separate from God but if I'm separate from God how
did I get created you see because God's creation isn't
something that God does sitting outside the creation God is
his own creation God is the very thing he's creating
or it is creating to say it more accurately so
right now what's happening is that ostensibly I'm sitting here
I'm a human being I'm sitting here before you in
front of a camera speaking to you through some computer
system that you're looking at through some LCD screen some
pixels and you're listening to me and interpreting the things
I'm saying and I'm using English and it seems like
that's what's going on here that's not what's really going
on here what's going on here is that God is
happening this whole process is God oneness one this is
happening the entire universe is like one movement happening in
concert together like one show or one movie you know
like in a movie you can you can think of
a movie as being made at a separate stuff like
there's lamps and cars and trees and sidewalks and buildings
and people in a movie but also you can realize
that the whole movie is just one thing like one
digital file if it's on your computer or one DVD
disc if you've got it like that see and you
can look at it both as both both are true
simultaneously so yes in a certain sense I am just
a human being sitting here talking to you but in
another higher sense all of this is God happening God
is also a strange loop now strange loop is a
bit of a technical term to really understand what that
means go watch my episode called reality is a strange
loop where we go into that with some cool visual
examples check that out but what a strange loop is
is it basically means that God created itself this is
a very tricky notion - it's a glimpse God created
itself you might wonder Leo how is it possible for
God to create itself that's impossible it's impossible from your
current state of consciousness because you're trying to rationally think
it through and rationally linearly using conventional logic it's not
possible for a thing to create itself but God is
not limited to that see when you realize that God
is infinite power infinite intelligence it actually has the power
to create itself which is quite stunning and mind-blowing it's
a very elegant solution to the question of where did
existence come from and where did God come from you
know for a longest time the reason that I never
bought into God when I was younger when I was
an atheist I always thought like well what's the point
of believing God because it God is just another object
and so God doesn't really explain anything because if you
say that the universe came from God like if the
Big Bang came from God then where God come from
you need another God to create that guy and so
on for infinity Kappa what you don't realize is that
God itself is infinity and because it is infinity it
accounts for everything absolutely everything every possibility and so therefore
it did create itself another way to say it is
that God exists for eternity it both created itself but
also simultaneously it has always existed and never needed creation
this is a far-fetched stuff you're not going to understand
it logically if that's what you're trying to do it's
not going to make sense you need to directly experience
it for example I directly experienced one day how I
created my entire body as God how I designed every
hair and every molecule on my arm so imagine a
state of consciousness where you can be conscious of that
that's a that's a pretty mind-blowing thing God is also
absolute infinity as I said absolute infinity that means Wow
infinity huh how do you explain infinity somebody actual infinity
actual infinity that's what this moment is right now this
moment is one out of an entire infinite of moments
I remember one day I became conscious that consciousness is
absolutely infinite and then it goes on forever and ever
and ever and it contains every possibility for ever and
ever and ever such that it's so total that there's
nothing not inside of it that's a mindfuck God is
also everything and nothing so this is what's so paradoxical
about God so my hand is God my face is
God every word coming out of my mouth is God
your body is God any thoughts you have or God
any objections you have to anything I'm saying that's also
God but at the same time God is still not
any of that how can both be true at the
same time well they just are you need to become
conscious that this is the case because God is consciousness
and consciousness is not a thing it's not located anywhere
and a thing that's not located anywhere is actually it
turns out exactly the same as everything to be nothing
is to be everything and to be everything is to
be nothing that's the reconciliation of the ultimate duality see
conventionally we think of there's everything and there's nothing in
there polar opposites no they're not they're actually identical and
they overlap and they sit right on top of each
other in the same way that if you have an
object floating out in the vacuum of empty space you
might think well the object occupies the vacuum and so
in that place where the object is let's say you
have a hammer floating out in outer space you say
in that place where there's a hammer there isn't a
vacuum actually no the vacuum is there the nature of
a vacuum is that it's always there the vacuum of
P space is right here right now my body is
inside the vacuum of P space of course there's also
air and other things here but the vacuum doesn't go
away the vacuum is always present stop thinking of a
vacuum as being only when it's empty of objects the
vacuum is empty even when there's objects in it you
just don't normally think of it that way because you
think dualistic ly and God is also the answer to
all questions now what does this mean well this means
it's the answer to all metaphysical and epistemic questions so
all the big philosophical questions that you think can't be
resolved like why are we here what are humans doing
and doing here why do we exist where it all
come from why is there something rather than nothing all
of that can be answered by becoming conscious of God
fully and these answers are extremely satisfying and complete such
that you have no more questions left but you're not
gonna get answers to things like what did your neighbor
had for lunch or an answer to some scientific because
these are all relative questions and God is the answer
to the existential metaphysical absolute questions not the relative stuff
you're not gonna know how much how many liters of
gas there are in your fuel tank in your car
so nor nor do you really need to know that
stuff that's all my new show right the problem is
that people get caught up on the my new show
and they think well Leo but but it you know
what good is knowing God if if knowing God doesn't
help me to figure out how to solve some scientific
problem that I have well your scientific problem doesn't concern
God what we're talking about if we're talking about the
origin of all of existence so forget about your little
stupid scientific problems or any other kind of personal problems
that you have you can work on those later if
you even think of them as problems anymore after if
you realize what existence is now of course people wonder
believe this stuff you're talking about it all sounds so
outlandish how can any of this be how can God
have created himself how can God be everything and nothing
and all the other stuff you said and the answer
to it is that it just is you see there's
a funny thing about truth truth just is people think
truth can be proven no it can't truth just is
truth can't be proven people think truth can be explained
or justified you can give reasons for why things are
no you can't truth just is and it's your job
to realize that and to stop looking for justifications endless
justifications and reasons and explanations see this is what the
mind is always doing this is the classic mistake of
the scientific mind it doesn't realize it at some point
when we're investigating reality we're gonna get to rock bottom
we're gonna get to the most ultimate fundamental thing and
when we get there we have to accept it as
it is as a given as a as a self-evident
element that can't be reduced any further and that's where
we're hitting here so when you realize God you realize
that it's the most fundamental element of existence you can't
get underneath consciousness because there is nothing there in fact
that's what consciousness is is the realization that there's nothing
there and there never was anything there to begin with
it just is but if you're still asking but Leo
how could it be this way and it's impossible that's
because you still haven't actually become conscious that it just
is you still don't understand what is this is and
of course isn't it's just anonymous with God and with
existence and you might say well Leo all this sounds
way too good to be true that's right and that's
one of the reasons why people have a hard time
actually grasping it or pursuing it because it makes you
sound crazy to pursue this stuff it makes you sound
crazy to believe this stuff you can't really believe it
you have to directly become conscious of it you might
wonder what does God look like or feel like and
there's a some some good things we can say about
this God feels like awakening from a dream that's a
very good description of it which is why we call
it awakening or enlightenment I remember when I had my
one of my deepest awakenings it was so shocking and
startling that I just sat there with my mouth a
gate in my room just like stunned like this and
all I was just like kind of like babbling to
myself and I was just babbling one word awakening awakening
awakening I'm awake I don't like I'm awake like I'm
awake for the first time in my life I'm awake
it's just like waking up from a dream so imagine
that everything that's happening right now including me sitting here
talking to you you sitting there trying to figure this
stuff out for yourself all this is just a dream
and that when you discover God you can realize that
all your entire biographical life from the moment you were
born up till right now has all just been a
figment of one's imagination within consciousness this very moment that's
happening right now is God imagining this moment because what
God is as God is a universal mind that means
that that physical wall behind you the floor you're sitting
on the entire earth all the physical stuff that you
thought was there the whole time that was objective and
real that grounded your reality all of that is just
a figment of your imagination and now that does not
mean that you have the power to think the floor
out of existence you have to understand it when I
talk about the figment of the imagination of God we're
talking about a much more robust concept than what we
traditionally think of as imagination conventionally we think of imaginations
just like oh yeah we're just thinking stuff up in
the human mind in a human brain images and thoughts
of course that is imagination but but you're also ignoring
that imagination is a much broader thing which actually encompasses
all of reality this very moment is being imagined it's
not a physical thing that exists anywhere it's being imagined
by God and what does God nothing so this very
moment is nothing it's not that God has a brain
God doesn't look like a human with a skull and
a brain inside of it that has consciousness in it
according to the materialist paradigm that's not how it works
the way it works is that this very moment is
an imagination within the mind of God but this very
moment is also identical with the mind of God so
a another way you can think of it is that
that wall that floor my face the voice coming out
this is think of this ad this is the brain
of God this is the machinery of God the physical
machinery of God so to speak putting it into the
materials frame is identical with a consciousness or the mind
the brain and the mind are actually one thing and
how does God's brain or mind look like precisely this
very moment look this is God right here this is
God's mind this is God's brain can you see it
what else does God feel like it feels like dying
it feels like the end of life as you know
it and this is why God is so so difficult
for most people to to pursue and to finally grasp
is because who wants to die do you want to
face your death as an atheist you think you've faced
your death no you haven't you don't know what death
is see you spend your whole life avoiding death and
the funny thing is is that collectively as a culture
what we have labeled death is actually God we've literally
named the realization of God death and we hold it
as the worst most terrifying thing possible and we try
to avoid it at all costs so our entire society
and culture is built around the avoidance of death we've
demonized death and we view death as the worst possible
thing that could happen when actually all that happens when
you die is you become God you realize God you
wake up you get this the only thing that's gonna
die is your idea of physical reality and your idea
of you as a biological self nothing real is gonna
die so in a sense there's no such thing as
death death is a concept that you've imagined God cannot
die because God is infinite so God has no place
to go where's God gonna go if he dies he
ain't got nowhere to go cuz he's already nowhere and
nothing see so when you realize that it will feel
like death to you because you've been identified with being
this biological creature your whole life and you've you've thought
the physical reality was real your whole life so when
that's taken away from you it it it is like
that and you will be terrified by it God also
feels like a total surrender imagine if from this day
on you completely surrendered all control of your life all
of it so you know that all that struggle you
do everyday all the manipulation you do all the scheming
all the hard work all the effort that you put
into life to trying to make things turn out the
way you want imagine if you just said [ __
] it I'm surrendering everything I'm not gonna try anymore
at all I'm just gonna all leave it up to
God I'm gonna leave it up to the universe whatever
the universe wants to do I'll just do that that
would be taking your ego out of life which is
precisely the realization of God and then imagine living your
whole life under this constant state of total surrender where
you don't feel like you have separate control over the
universe anymore that's what God feels like God also feels
like the disillusion of all boundaries because you you you
enter this state once you're fully awake you enter this
state of non-dual awareness where all the duelists two categories
of life versus death man versus woman good versus bad
all of them melt away all of them merge into
one and that's what allows you to feel the oneness
with the entire universe God also feels like a mindfuck
or an epiphany it is the biggest mind [ __
] ever you haven't experienced a mind [ __ ]
until you've glimpsed God or awoken you know the word
epiphany colloquially we just use that word as like someone
who has an insight an epiphany and insight but really
that's a word from the Christian tradition from the Christian
lexicon and what it means originally what it meant was
the realization of God it's an epiphany that's literally what
it is it also feels like the words Wow and
oh my god oMG chances are when you realize God
for the first time the words out of your mouth
will be wow wow wow oh my god oh my
god oh my god it feels simultaneously awesome and terrifying
it's awesome because it's so big and infinite and so
beautiful and it's terrifying because it eclipses and threatens your
little ego and your personal identity and your biological biographical
self it also feels like exiting the matrix you know
the movie The Matrix where neo discovers that the matrix
is just a computer simulation and then he breaks free
of it and then he looks out onto the quote-unquote
real world outside the matrix and he's blown away by
how grim and horrific it is out there and all
this and so there's the stark difference between what's inside
the matrix what's outside the matrix so finally he's breaking
broken free that's what it feels like except when you
really wake up and you leave the matrix that we've
called reality the matrix within which we do science when
you leave that what's outside the matrix nothing see that's
where the movie the matrix really faltered is that in
the movie they exit the matrix but the place they
exit to is fundamentally like no different really than the
place they left inside the matrix outside the matrix I
mean yeah the content is different there's robots outside the
matrix and it's kind of dark and grim and dirty
but but like the laws of physics are the same
logic and rationality and it's basically the same universe inside
and outside but when you realize the matrix that is
real life and physical science and existence you also realize
there's nothing outside of it which is even more freaky
than discovering that this is a computer simulation it's more
radical than that and it simultaneously leaves you in the
matrix but transforms the matrix in a profound way and
also it feels like you can't tell the people in
the matrix that you've exited the matrix because they won't
understand you so neo goes back in the matrix and
he does stuff but most the people are the matrix
they don't know he has broken out of the matrix
and so if he tells them about the outside world
outside the matrix they'll think he's insane which is probably
what you think of me right now you think I'm
insane the things I'm saying here are completely insane they're
completely impossible right because you're stuck in the matrix and
you won't know you're stuck in the matrix until the
day that you break free of the matrix and when
that happens you'll be saying oh my [ __ ]
god how is this possible how could I have missed
this it's so obvious and at the same time it's
so seductive and deceptive God also feels like a metaphysical
orgasm hopefully you've had regular orgasms sexual ones but a
metaphysical orgasm is a thousand times more powerful and life
transforming than a physical orgasm you don't even know what
an orgasm is until you've had a metaphysical orgasm it
also feels like a cosmic holographic fractal I remember one
day I became conscious of this very distinctly this was
a very discrete specific insight that I had I was
sitting on the floor and I was looking at my
hands and I realized that the entire universe is a
cosmic holographic fractal now that sounds like a bit of
a word salad there what am I really saying some
new-age terms but no what I'm saying is that the
cosmos which is everything and everything you think about space
the galaxies and all that there's no separation between the
galaxies and me sitting here right now and my hands
and in fact you can I can keep zooming in
with consciousness I was actually able to zoom into my
hands and realize that I can zoom into them forever
you think like well if you zoom into this hand
with a microscope eventually you'll hit rock bottom and there'll
be like atoms or quarks or something or strings and
then you'll get to the bottom but no it just
keeps going forever this hand is infinite my head is
infinite the galaxy isn't that it just keeps forever you
can keep zooming out forever you keep zooming in forever
and in this sense it's a fractal and it's holographic
in the sense that every point of consciousness contains within
it the rest of the universe like a hologram and
I remember there was a specific moment where I became
conscious of the holographic nature of consciousness which was stunning
and mind-blowing it also feels like the entire universe is
being aware through your eyes I remember this as well
I became distinctly aware how the entire universe is not
some separate thing from me I am NOT in the
universe like an object in the universe the way a
materialist conceives of it I am the universe and what
the universe is is this conscious thing that's sitting here
right now and talking the universe is that thing right
there that's listening to me you are the universe can
you become conscious of this the universe is aware through
your eyes the hands that you can move these are
the universe's hands the universe is using you like a
puppet try to notice that God also feels like universal
mind like idealism and salep cistern philosophy you might be
familiar with these concepts of idealism and solace is Emile
ISM is the opposite of realism or materialism idealism tells
us that there's no such thing as physical objects or
external reality there's only mind-stuff and that everything is mind
stuff and solid system tells us that there's no such
thing as other sentient entities there's only you and that's
exactly right as God you are all alone oneness necessarily
implies aloneness God doesn't have friends there also aren't multiple
gods that's another this is another common question that I
had when I was younger when I didn't believe in
God I wondered like well but why would there be
only one God why wouldn't there be two or three
isn't it kind arbitrate only believe in one is that
kind of silly there could be a million guys but
no what what I didn't realize and what you might
not realize is that the reason that has to be
one is precisely because it's infinite absolute infinity there can
only be one absolute infinity because absolute infinity already includes
everything you see its totality so well there are other
kind of gods you might be imagining include those in
the idea of infinity it's all of that plus more
imagine everything you could possibly imagine that exists and add
even more to it until you become so full that
you can't be any more full and at that point
you've reached absolute infinity and at that point you realize
the oneness of everything and at that point you realize
that there is only one God there could be lesser
gods but they really wouldn't be God per se there
can only be one ultimate God the absolute lesser gods
wouldn't really be absolute they would be something else you
know there could be space aliens out there who knows
what's out there there could be a lot of different
stuff out there but all of it is ultimately one
and you can become conscious that but also at the
same time what I'm talking about the realization of God
is not limited to salep system is that it still
doesn't go far enough it's still not as radical as
what I'm talking about what I'm talking about it's non
duality and the difference is that salep system is still
mostly conceptual and theoretical it's not actual you're not actually
conscious of solid sysm and also the province ops ISM
that it still assumes that there's a biographical biological self
which exists which of course gets eliminated through non-duality God
also feels like emptiness and nothingness but it's not the
kind of nothingness or emptiness you're thinking of it's different
it's almost the opposite this emptiness feels light and radiant
and full it's a pregnant emptiness or a plenum as
the Greeks knew it a plenum it's a full emptiness
pure potential ready to burst with infinite possibility that's fundamentally
what consciousness and God our God is also well it
also feels like infinite intelligence infinite power and creativity infinite
understanding and that's why God is called omniscient I remember
one of my biggest epiphanies and mind Fox was when
I became distinctly conscious of the infinite intelligent aspect of
God go check out my episode what is intelligence so
I talked about that and I literally became conscious of
pure intelligence disembodied intelligence intelligence to the infinite degree it's
so intelligent that it figured out how to create itself
and it's creating this very moment that's here right now
the intelligence that I'm using right now to speak to
you and the intelligence that you're using right now to
understand what I'm saying all of this is just little
tiny slivers of universal infinite intelligence and this intelligence is
baked into the design of the entire universe so contrary
to what the materialists believe there's nothing random about the
universe it's not chaotic and accidental it is deliberately designed
using disembodied infinite intelligence and you can become directly conscious
of that this is not something you believe this is
something you verify it's incredible when I experienced it I
could hardly believe it God also feels like infinite beauty
you know sort of how like when you go out
in nature and you you experience a beautiful sunset or
some mountain range or you look up at the stars
and it's so beautiful and wonderful and you feel little
bit of that spiritual connection to reality well imagine that
times infinity and you get infinite beauty when you realize
the beauty of your own creation that all of creation
is this beautiful work of art that God is constantly
performing and I'm sitting here right now talking to you
through this camera and this is God performing its work
of art and this is just one out of an
infinite number of works of art that God is producing
all the time even all the stuff you think is
ugly it's actually still beautiful from the right state of
consciousness not from your current egoic state of conscious cuz
he you're so judgmental you're too judgmental to see the
beauty of everything when you have a when you remove
that ego then you can see it God also feels
like profound peace it feels like time stops it feels
like eternity because it is eternal the present moment is
eternal this is what's happening right now it seems like
it's happening within time and space but actually this is
an eternal moment at the right state of consciousness not
for you in your dualistic state of consciousness you need
a much higher state of consciousness to see the eternal
Ness of this moment which is why God can't be
killed or destroyed because God is nothing so there's nothing
within it to kill or destroy and therefore it exists
forever this moment that's happening right now can you become
conscious that it's existed forever within the singularity that is
God probably not but you can try and ultimately you
can succeed and realizing that God also is immortality see
once you realize that you exist as an idea as
a conceptual destruction that there is no such thing as
a biological creature or a brain that is responsible for
creating this right here then you realize that you're immortal
ask God see if you're identified with your body and
your biography that will of course die and in that
sense you're scared of death but when you identify yourself
with all of existence that can't die it's immortal now
you might say all Blio but what about the Big
Bang you know the Big Bang what if the Big
Bang turns into a Big Crunch wouldn't that be the
death of the universe I'm talking about a different universe
than what you're talking about scientists when they say universe
they're talking about a very specific thing our little universe
and there could be multiverses outside of it and so
forth to infinity and in fact there are it doesn't
stop at our University keeps going forever when I'm talking
about universe I'm talking about universe with capital u which
means everything all the multiverse is every possible thing that
thing the universe with the capital u that thing can't
die it's immortal it's infinite God also feels like the
greatest gift like it's too good to be true it
feels like the greatest joy a joy beyond your wildest
dreams infinite joy it feels like actual paradise heaven or
nirvana you don't even know what joy is until you've
fully realized God God also feels like you so if
you go inside of yourself right now you go past
your biological body past your emotions past your thoughts past
your feelings pass any stories you have or beliefs you
have about yourself past your personal identity pass your self-image
if you go past all that what you'll feel inside
of you is pure i am-ness pure consciousness that's what
you've been from the moment you were born is really
you were pure consciousness filled with various kinds of content
biological biographical historical psychological social all sorts of content so
if you go past all that content you'll feel the
pure i am-ness of this very moment that thing is
God it also feels like infinite love I remember moments
where I became fully conscious of the infinite love of
God you don't even know what God what love is
until you've experienced infinite love God also feels divine radiant
magical miraculous and alive so the reason we call it
God and spirituality is because spirit has an inherent divine
radiant magical quality to it because it's spontaneous being or
spontaneous self creation it's miraculous it's literally a miracle the
entire universe this very moment right here is a miracle
you've just become so jaded to it because you're so
preoccupied with just living life pragmatically that you ignore the
miracle that is life the magic that is here the
divinity that's here you don't see the divinity because you're
like a fish and water and it feels alive in
the sense that life is not a limited category that
only applies to organic life forms or biological creatures the
entire universe is alive it's sentient it's conscient or it's
it's it's sentient and its conscious so when you realize
that that that radically reinterprets how you related to the
universe because before that you had a materialistic paradigm under
the materialistic paradigm you viewed most of the universe except
for creatures you viewed most of it as dead dead
matter but after the Epiphany of God you realize that
it's not dead at all it's alive everything's alive molecules
are alive the earth is alive it's a much broader
more expanded notion of what life is God also feels
like not knowing God feels like irreducible mystery you might
think that you're gonna know God but really you're not
gonna know God you're gonna not know God because like
I told you you can't know God you can be
God but to be God means you can't know it
precisely because knowing is a second order emergent or phenomenon
of being knowing is always indirect knowing is what separates
you from God not knowing is as close to God
as you can get and see this is the whole
problem with the scientific paradigm is that science is always
trying to explain and reduce away the mystery of existence
and the way it does is by substituting some other
object so it's taking content within existence and explaining it
by by by pointing to some other content so you
know how did the earth get here well because of
some space dust from some star but how did this
space dust get there well because of some other star
that exploded and how did that get there well some
other star exploded but how did it ultimately get here
well because there was a big bang but how did
that get here well we don't know see so science
is playing this game of explaining one thing in terment
another thing until ultimately you take it to the big
bang and then you just say oh we'll forget about
it we can't really know and then let's just go
about living ordinary life see this is the whole game
the whole point of this tail-chasing exercise that it never
ends it's infinite but you're not realizing that it's infinite
and therefore you're not realizing that that science ultimately doesn't
explain a goddamn thing see all you're doing is you're
explaining one corner of creation in terms of another corner
that's what science is doing it's drawing connections but it's
not seeing the totality all at once which is what
differentiates science from spirituality god also feels like the greatest
moment of your life for sure the greatest moment of
your life nothing else comes close and it feels totally
life transforming it feels like after this epiphany nothing in
your life will ever be the same again alright now
let's talk about why God is so confusing this is
an important point to address because otherwise people don't take
this topic seriously enough they underestimate just how self deceptive
this topic is so let's go through the list firstly
like we said because God is a level of consciousness
and most people don't appreciate that there are different levels
of consciousness and they never accessed the higher rarefied levels
of consciousness and therefore they try to understand something which
is beyond them it's like they're blind people trying to
understand what color looks like the solution there is to
actually look at colors cure your blindness rather than trying
to intellectually understand what colors are while you're still blind
another reason is because God is formless God can't be
pointed to and that's a very confusing notion for people
because people are used to form form is everything you've
ever experienced about reality so how do you get the
mind to become aware of the formless when the mind
can only deal with the formed that's very challenging how
do you get scientists to admit of the formless when
all they do is study form how do you run
a lab experiment on the formless see this is why
people deny God is because they don't know how to
turn it into a form and it's precisely because God
is all form that you can't see it see if
God was one particular it would be easy to point
to and say there it is but not when God
is formless and therefore all form God is also confusing
because it's beyond the mind there's just an inherent assumption
that's made by people that if something exists and is
true and if it's important and significant then hey my
mind can just think about it understand it believe in
it and there we go problem solved but that doesn't
work with God because God is a different type of
question different type of issue the types of issues that
were used to using our mind for are actually inside
of the universe we never asked our mind to go
outside and beyond the universe but we have to when
we're asking the question of where do the entire universe
come from that's a different type of question see the
difference between existential questions and scientific questions are that scientific
questions are about the content of one state of consciousness
whereas existential questions are about consciousness itself beyond the content
the context science can't grapple with context so for example
inside of a matrix like in the movie there are
people doing science supposedly in that movie The Matrix and
how many scientists are in that movie I mean in
the fiction of that universe well there's millions billions of
them right but all the science they're doing I mean
it's good it's good science relative to the context of
the matrix that they're in but if you exit and
leave the context of the matrix then what is their
science amount to nothing it's just a fiction in the
same way that you can imagine that you're a scientist
inside one of your dreams when you're sleeping but then
you wake up and you realize that all that was
nonsense so the problem that science has is it can't
see that the science is being done inside of a
dream and so it it attempts to use science to
understand dreams without realizing that science is part of the
dream that's never gonna work another reason why God is
so confusing is because it's so big staggering and incredible
that it's hard to take it seriously it sounds too
good to be true its consequences are epic another reason
is because God is a total mindfuck and most people
don't like to get mind [ __ ] personally I
have a hard time relating to this because I love
getting mind [ __ ] and that's probably why I'm
sitting here today talking about this stuff but uh but
for most people ordinary people you know your grandma she
doesn't wanna get mind [ __ ] she wants her
life to be simple clear-cut black and white just mundane
stuff simple truths cuz it's scary getting mind [ __
] is scary it's uncomfortable also God is confusing because
it's a deep paradox and it's a strange loop and
people find it very difficult to deal with strange loops
Western intellectual tradition has has spent a lot of time
demonizing paradox and being threatened by paradox because paradox threatens
the conceptual castles that we build within philosophy or even
within science paradox threatens that paradox and strange loops threaten
the illusion of simple cause-and-effect linear explanations of how existence
works God is also confusing because it requires radical open
mindedness and most people are closed-minded they're not willing to
to open their mind to radical ideas for example are
you willing to open your mind to the possibility that
death can't happen are you willing to open your mind
to the possibility that if you shoot yourself in the
head that it won't be a bad thing but it'll
be a good thing see most people don't want to
go there are you willing to open yourself up to
the possibility that your parents and your friends are just
creations of your imagination and that they don't really exist
see that's too much for most people God is confusing
because people aren't willing to do existential investigation and because
they already assume that they know for religious people their
biggest obstacle to God is their ideas about God they
think they know everything about God so when I tell
them what God is they think they know better Leah
who are you to tell me what God is let
me tell you what God is but have you done
the existential investigation how many thousands of hours have you
spent doing the work or for those atheists you know
they do the opposite they have a mere problem where
they try to convince me Leah let me tell you
how God doesn't exist but have you done the work
do you even know the foundations of science and knowledge
do you even know how that works do you know
how proof works have you investigated these things have you
investigated a scientific method have you questioned it have you
questioned materialism have you questioned whether an external physical objective
reality exists probably not because if you did and you
would be agreeing with me here you wouldn't be challenging
me because people are egotistical and arrogant God is confusing
because God conflicts with ego with control and with survival
see most people are preoccupied with their own survival they
aren't interested in lofty existential questions they just want to
know how to earn money and have sex and create
a cushy little for themselves and God goes against all
of that God requires surrendering your ego surrendering control taking
energy and time away from chasing money and chasing sex
and chasing material luxuries and chasing power it's the opposite
of survival survival makes you callous about truth because truth
can inhibit your survival God is confusing because it requires
facing your own death and who wants to face his
or her own death do you not just as an
idea but actually facing it and seeing what lays on
the other side God is confusing because being cannot be
symbolized like I said earlier God cannot be depicted spoken
or written cannot be put into words or communicated what
I'm doing here it might seem like i communicating God
no I'm not I'm giving you various pointers but I'm
not really showing you God with my words nor can
you draw a diagram of God or a schematic or
a picture nor can you put it into some equations
and what scientists and intellectuals don't understand is that you're
never gonna be able to put God into equations because
all equations aren't necessarily finite and limited whereas God is
infinite you can't put infinity into an equation because your
equation is itself part of infinity you can't put the
larger into the smaller the way you're trying to do
this needs to be recognized but most people doing scientific
work don't understand this they failed to distinguish between symbols
and being God is confusing because very few people have
the direct experiences that I'm talking about and because it
requires thousands of hours of meditation or contemplation or various
forms of inquiry and investigation to have these direct experiences
they don't come easily and most people are not willing
to put in this amount of time because they can't
foresee how it's gonna be worth it and also because
they don't take us seriously enough to actually do the
research that needs to be done you need to already
be radically open-minded to see the possibility that this might
lead you somewhere to then go and follow up on
that for thousands of hours and do very difficult emotionally
laborious work to ultimately break through to some Epiphany God
is confusing because our culture society and media is very
materialistic and really it's still stuck in the dark ages
people take for granted how much more evolution we have
to do culturally societally we just tend to assume we
have technology and gadgets and internet and smartphones that because
of this we're an advanced species and because of this
we understand how the universe works this is an illusion
we are barbarians and apes still very much still stuck
in the dark ages but that won't be recognized for
hundreds of years yet to come so if you were
born a thousand years in the future then all of
this would be very easy you'd be taught all this
stuff in preschool or in first grade and you would
just pursue it you do the practices you'd be taught
how to meditate this would all be just standard practice
you wouldn't even question it and you'd probably be fully
conscious of God by the time you're 10 years old
if our education system was structured properly but it isn't
because of our culture our society and our media our
politics and God is confusing because metaphysics and epistemology aren't
taken seriously they aren't taught in school elementary school through
high school you're not taught about metaphysics epistemology at all
and in university our only taught about it if you
take specific philosophy courses which a few people take most
people don't take and even when they take them they
don't take them seriously it's just like a fun class
you take which there's no practical impact on your life
even scientists I'm shocked at how poor of a grasp
of metaphysics and epistemology most scientists have including astrophysicists and
quantum physicists just it's pathetic this is a deep cultural
problem a problem with our education system if we structured
our education system properly metaphysics and epistemology would be the
foundation of all education but see it seems too impractical
seems too abstract but again hey I mean you took
12 years of math and that was complex and abstract
and you don't even use math in your everyday life
almost unless you have a some very technical field you
basically never use math beyond just a basic arithmetic God
is confusing because success of science creates a false illusion
of existential understanding we have been lulled into a false
sense of complacency due to the last hundred years of
the success of science and technology and we think that
just because we can build a rocket ship or a
supercomputer or the internet that because of this that now
we have existential understanding no we just figured out how
to create technology these are two very different things and
we need to make sure that we don't get seduced
by our technological advancements we are much more technologically advanced
than we are cognitively developed or consciously developed or socially
developed or politically developed and this is creating a lot
of problems a lot of existential problems are actually now
being caused by these um technological imbalances God is also
confusing because the foundations of science are misunderstood and I've
already touched that on that before God is confusing because
it doesn't seem possible it doesn't seem possible that there
could be a God or should be a God it
doesn't seem practical Leo what am I going to get
out of this your ego asks but that's exactly the
problem is looking at reality in such a way that
you're only looking at it from your little personal ego
at the point of view if you look at it
that way you're never gonna be able to access God
God doesn't care about you in the sense that you
think in the sense that you care about yourself in
preserving your petty little existence God has way bigger plants
for the universe that are unfolding and hey you know
what maybe they won't involve you God is also confusing
because reality is subjective and relative and the mind has
a difficult time dealing with relativity pre rational people don't
understand relativity and even many rationalists don't really understand relativity
you have to be a spoiler Nemec sage green to
start to understand relativity and even then the full scope
of it hasn't hit you yet you haven't realized yet
that the very substance of existence is relative atoms and
molecules are relative to your own mind you constructed them
they don't exist for other creatures but for you and
the subjective of nature of reality is denied by science
and by most people we're trying to access objective reality
without realizing that objective reality is just a concept within
your subjective conscious experience there is nothing objective about the
universe it's pure subjectivity pure relativity God is confusing because
the mind is self deceptive go check out my three-part
miniseries on self-deception which covers all that God is confusing
because skepticism is misused go check out my episode called
true versus false skepticism where I talk about how skepticism
can be misused many skeptics these days PI you know
skepticism is popular especially amongst atheists but they misuse it
because what they they make a mockery of skepticism because
they will say well Leo prove it to me other
way if you don't prove it to me then it
doesn't exist it can't possibly be real it's the sort
of attitude that the truth must be delivered to you
with overwhelming proof and evidence and only then will you
accept it this totally takes responsibility away from you from
actually doing the hard work of discovering the truth I'm
not trying to prove anything to you here in this
episode I am presenting you with possibilities of things that
you can verify for yourself so you need to get
off your lazy ass and verify the things that I'm
talking about that is true skepticism a true skeptic puts
his own skepticism to the test and also questions his
own assumptions skepticism itself must be questioned how do you
know the skepticism is the right way to get to
the truth could it be that skepticism itself is just
a self-deception could it be that your own crippling skepticism
is keeping you from actually doing the work that is
necessary in order to experience higher states of consciousness which
are beyond skepticism God is confusing because it reveals everything
to be an illusion and who wants that do you
want everything to be revealed as an illusion society culture
government language religion science rationality logic your own humanity your
own personal biography your own birth your parents your your
friends everything will be revealed to be an illusion can
you deal with that most people can't most people are
in denial about that this possibility God is also confusing
because it threatens power hierarchies our entire economic governmental political
and social system religion business is all built upon power
hierarchies that try to maintain status quo this is what
the ego does this is how survival happens and it's
all built on illusions false justifications trying to ground its
power in some sort of fixed position within reality which
of course doesn't exist so mankind especially those at the
top of the power hierarchies try to justify their power
through some sort of appeal to God or the truth
or to justice or fairness or goodness or whatever and
whenever they're doing that they're always lying that's always the
ego at work because in truth there's no reason that
there should be this power hierarchy many of these power
hierarchies are false but of course the ego doesn't want
to give up its power the tyrant is not gonna
step off the throne willingly gotta be forced out so
of course the tyrant is always playing games of illusions
trickery deception and isn't interested in the truth and also
God is confusing because once you know God no one
will understand you and you will not be able to
communicate it to anyone other than those people who have
already also experienced God in which case it's pointless to
communicate with them because they already know so it's a
catch-22 how are you gonna convince people in the matrix
that their inner matrix when they're in the matrix they
won't know until they break out of the matrix appreciate
that appreciate all of these challenges appreciate how tricky this
is it's really a work of art the trickery of
God is a work of art now let's move on
to the next section which is I want to share
with you the various names of God various words that
point to the same thing it can be a big
insight to realize that all religions are fundamentally talking about
the same thing so here's a list that I've compiled
that I really like God enlightenment awakening oneness the one
the all Godhead nothingness truth non duality the absolute ego
death infinity absolute infinity self transcendence self-realization consciousness awareness presence
now with a capital N being the capital B existence
reality is Miss suchness liberation moksha no self true self
with a capital S the self with a capital S
universe with a capital S universal mind mind with a
capital M spirit with a capital S the Great Spirit

Yahweh Jehovah ohm I am Tott vom a/c Hashem Deus
Zeus Toyota Lord Supreme Being creator the all-seeing eye and
as big as that list is there's a lot more
that I could add to it if you really want
to go and Hana on a mission to find all
the names of God that'll take you a long time
sorting through lots of history books and religious texts now
those of you who are a little bit more advanced
you might want to split hairs here with me and
nitpick and you might say well Leo what are you
talking about Samadhi is not the same thing as kensho
is not the same thing as Toria is not the
same thing as Nirvana is not the same thing as
the Holy Spirit look yes we can make very fine-grained
distinctions and when you become a dancer you will do
that all of these words are fundamentally pointing to the
same thing but of course like we said before there's
many facets and aspects to God so some of these
words points to one particular facet versus another other words
point to the whole thing and and so forth so
just you know you want to make sure that you
don't let your pedantry and your splitting of hairs to
interfere with your broader understanding of what we're really talking
about and for newbies this list is a great starting
point you can research these names go google them find
them on Wikipedia read about them draw the interconnections that
you need to use them to do the research to
verify the things that I say so now how do
you experience God what are the techniques well there are
a variety of different ways one is metaphysical questioning questioning
the very fabric of reality and existence and what knowledge
is in a lot of depth another one is deconstruction
deconstructing your entire life and belief system questioning everything to
death until nothing remains and what that is is God
another is self-inquiry which i've talked a lot about you
can find my latest episode on how to do self
inquiry if you search for how to do self inquiry
you'll see that you can also go to the forum
and I have a practical guide for how to do
self inquiry pinned at the very top of the meditation
and enlightenment sub forum another technique is meditation of course
and there's many different kinds of meditation that you can
use many of them are effective but in general it's
gonna take more than just regular meditation it's gonna take
meditation plus deconstruction of some kind a lot of people
will do meditation for years but they will never actually
experience God because they're doing meditation is sort of not
an industrial grade level you're just meditating for 20 or
30 or even 60 minutes a day is really not
going to be sufficient you need something more than that
another way is through concentration and visualization there are many
visualization yogic techniques and concentration techniques in fact see my
episode called concentration versus meditation where I compare and contrast
those two concentrations a little bit more difficult and a
little bit more powerful and really if you want to
become conscious of God the most direct way is to
build crazy high levels of focus and concentration which you
do through concentration practices another way is through yoga there
are many different kinds of yogic systems one that I
highly recommend is Kriya yoga but it's a little bit
involved and detailed and technical and it will probably take
training with a master or to really learn it or
if you go to my forum into the spirituality subcategory
the sub sub forum there you will find a mega
thread about how to learn Korean yoga I highly recommend
Kriya yoga as a as an Avenue towards God it
can be very powerful it can be more powerful than
meditation concentration or self inquiry especially if you have a
lot of monkey mind the way that I used to
do another way is psychedelics I highly recommend psychedelics of
course five Meo DMT is the best psychedelic for meeting
God but also mushrooms LSD and n DMT and others
can be just as effective in certain cases all depends
on how you use them psychedelics are a remarkable tool
in this regard because with all these other techniques usually
you're talking about thousands of hours of practice before you
start to experience God and for many skeptical people well
that's a you know that's a tall order to feel
they're not gonna do it not gonna be motivated enough
but psychedelics they're so wonderful precisely because they can open
the gateway to God just within 30 minutes within 60
minutes within a few hours and while it won't last
you won't be able to stabilize in that consciousness you
will have your first glimpses and that will be sufficient
to then get you to start to do the serious
practices another way to experience God is through deep suffering
and deprivation and this is a time-honored technique people have
been using fasting and isolating themselves out in the desert
without water and food for 4 weeks you know people
have been doing this for thousands of years this is
a time-honored way to to reach God very quickly the
problem is that involves a lot of suffering why do
you want to incur that much suffering I mean most
people will just not be able to do it meditation
concentration in and of itself has got plenty of suffering
and already to just put yourself through a deliberate process
of deep suffering and deprivation probably it's beyond most people
although it can work as well another technique is meditation
retreats and solo retreats so even though meditation you might
say meditation retreats meditation was a difference well even though
I already talked about meditation the retreat is really we're
seeing God happens so if you've been meditating for years
and you haven't experienced God you might be wondering like
Leo how do I do it well it's because you
haven't been meditating for long enough really what you need
is you need to retreat or you for ten or
thirty days straight 24/7 even as you're going to sleep
you're you're basically in a meditative zone and so you're
meditating for literally hundreds of hours straight back to back
and that increases your chances of discovering God by a
thousandfold so I highly recommend that and also there's dark
room retreats where if you lock yourself in a dark
room pitch-black room with no sunlight whatsoever for an entire
week that will help to stimulate various neurotransmitters in the
in the brain to then help you to attain those
rarefied high states of consciousness is sort of like a
natural psychedelic so those are the ways there's probably I
mean not probably but I know there's many other ways
but I'm just talking about the most direct that I
have some experience with what are the ways not to
experience God so this is also important so that you
don't go fooling yourself thinking that the practice that you're
using will actually get you there so you're not going
to experience God through the mind through beliefs through thinking
concept ideas opinions imagination knowledge or language throw all all
that out the window God is beyond all that prior
to all that you're not going to experience God through
rational inquiry or feed your ring God out or figuring
existence out you're never gonna be able to figure it
out or through traditional Western philosophy you're also not going
to do it through scientific modeling theorizing more equations if
you think you're gonna find God through mathematics you're wrong
you won't because mathematics are always finite and God is
infinite you won't experience God through proof or double-blind clinical
studies doesn't work that way you need a direct experience
which means that you're intimately involved it's gonna have to
be subjective don't go looking for an objective experience of
God your experience of God will be subjective and in
that moment objectivity the notion of objective experience will be
expunged out of your mind you're not gonna experience God
through cynical skepticism debate or discussion academic study studying scriptures
or sacred texts now about this point I need to
make a little caveat it actually is possible to have
epiphanies and mystical insights by studying scriptures and sacred texts
but only as an adjunct to your other work sometimes
you read a powerful scripture or spiritual text and the
author if the author is speaking from truth and from
non-duality can say something that will trigger something in you
to have some kind of aha some epiphany and those
can be very powerful and legitimate and I recommend that
you do study some scriptures and some spiritual texts as
you're doing this work but definitely don't make it your
sole technique because that's not going to fly because it's
too much language too much concept you're not going to
find God by going to church or through traditional prayer
for the most part now certain prayer again a caveat
certain prayer is quite meditative and so at that point
prayer basically turns into meditation or concentration and in in
that case that can be legitimate and you can actually
experience God that way but this is not traditional prayer
where you pray for God to help you with your
egotistical goals and plans that's not the kind of prayer
we're talking about here we're talking about real meditative prayer
you're not going to find God generally speaking through ritual
or ceremony although certain ceremonies can be quite powerful and
you're certainly not going to find God through books audios
videos lectures and podcasts although all those can be very
helpful as supplemental material on your journey they're not enough
to actually get you the consciousness states that you need
and certainly not through online commentary and online forums where
you're going to waste a lot of your time debating
discussing but not actually doing the work so watch out
for all those all these can easily become distractions and
traps from doing the other stuff that I said that
really does work so the reason people do this stuff
that doesn't work is precisely because the ego mind doesn't
want to do the stuff that works precisely because it's
afraid of death and it's too threatening to do techniques
that are actually very powerful so a lot of times
people will waste decades doing weak piddly techniques and that's
really by the design of the ego you need to
open your mind to the possibility of Samadhi Samadhi means
direct consciousness or being this is how you're gonna access
God through Samadhi not through knowledge not through belief not
through concepts not through language not through the mind and
not through thoughts not through theory not rationality Samadhi is
not knowledge Samadhi is not even ordinary experience because ordinary
experience presupposes a subject object duality between the experiencer and
the experienced thing Samadhi is a collapsing of those it's
a non dual form of perception or knowledge you might
say knowledge traditional knowledge also doesn't work because traditional knowledge
also assumes a separation between the knower and the thing
that is being known Samadhi collapses those two together Samadhi
is not even perception because perception as you understand it
conventionally is actually also presuming a subject object duality between
the perceiver and the thing being perceived that needs to
be collapsed as well the problem also with perception is
that perception is grounded in a certain metaphysics that you
have the materialist metaphysics so you're thinking of perception as
a process of you a biological entity with the brain
and neurons looking at an object light bouncing off of
stuff going in your eye going in your brain and
this produces a perception this is not going to work
because that is indirect so you need to go beyond
perception and this is the problem is most people don't
realize that there's something beyond experience beyond perception beyond knowledge
Samadhi is also not hallucination Samadhi is not fantasy and
Samadhi is not scientific experiment or data it's something new
most people 99% of people have never experienced Samadhi and
they don't even know that it's a possibility so if
you want to experience God you need to open yourself
up to the possibility of Samadhi and more than that
you need to go and actually experience Samadhi for yourself
for yourself it's a hell of a thing good stuff
blow your socks off that's what we call a mystical
experience is this a samadhi of some kind now I
recommend if you're new to this and you just want
to get a quick test to verify the things that
I'm talking about and you want to get fast glimpse
of God so you don't waste thousands of your hours
doing various kinds of arcane practices I recommend psychedelics plus
a little bit of existential inquiry start to get a
journal and deconstruct your own beliefs your own ideas and
then find some good psychedelics and that will be your
doorway into spirituality but then you're gonna have to go
beyond that because psychedelics can prove to be a trap
if they are your only technique but why I love
Sai kit O so much is it's the only tool
that lets you access these very advanced truths very quickly
without having to spend years studying and reading books and
doing all the sorts of stuff that most people simply
won't do in this regard psychedelics are amazing psychedelics in
a sense are the most scientific way of accessing God
because he'll we can take a person and administer 30
milligrams of 5 Meo DMT and a vast majority of
these people are gonna have direct experiences of God this
has been proven through scientific clinical studies that have already
been done you know go do the research there's an
enormous amount of scientific research if you're looking for it
about the the mystical experience is possible under psychedelics now
of course none of this will really mean anything to
you unless you go through the experience yourself it doesn't
matter what psychedelic experience I've had or others have had
you have to get into it yourself you have to
get intimately involved that's the only way you're gonna discover
God so that's the end in conclusion what I'll tell
you is that if you truly understood the things that
I said here then you will do two things number
one you will immediately begin to do research into the
things that I've said googling around going to Wikipedia reading
books and so forth to validate the things that I
said because I don't want you to just to rely
on me and take this as a new dogma of
yours that's not gonna fly it's not going to help
you you need to really become convinced that this is
a possibility for you and that it's worthwhile to do
and then secondly of course if you really understood what
I said is that you're gonna have to dedicate some
serious time and energy into these practices to actually get
you there how seriously you do your practices is a
direct reflection of how well you understood the significance of
the things that I said what I said here was
extremely significant if true now from your point of view
I could be diluted I could be lying I could
be hallucinating I could be a religious fanatic I can
be a cult leader or whatever and that's right from
your point of view you don't know that's why you
got to do the research and start doing the practices
and then come back to me and we'll talk about
it stay tuned for part two of this miniseries where
we will address a lot of fa Q's and more
objections also check out my other episodes check out my
two-part miniseries called understanding absolute infinity if you want an
even deeper explanation into the actual existential mechanics of the
Godhead how it really works with great analogies and examples
I really like that that miniseries one of my favorite
I put a lot of my heart into it and
also check out my episode called what is spirituality that's
also really good introduction also check out what is perception
and what is consciousness so that's it I'm down here
please remember to click that like button for me and
come check out actualize that org right there at the
at the website you will find my blog you will
find the forum you will find the book list you'll
find a life purpose course the book list is going
to be very valuable for you on this journey so
when I talk about doing research what you have to
understand about actualize I don't work that it's it's grounded
in an enormous amount of research that I do over
the last 10 years I've read hundreds of books hundreds
of audiobooks courses retreats like so much so much research
from lots of different perspectives because nobody takes the possibility
of self-deception and delusion and fantasy more seriously than I
do I'm always concerned about am i deceiving myself am
I really understanding these spiritual ideas properly that's why I
literally cross reference hundreds of sources from the best Yogi's
and spiritual masters and teachers from all the different religions
and all the different traditions from Buddhism to Hinduism to
yoga to Tantra to Judaism to Islam like I'm ferocious
and cross-referencing all this stuff because I know how dangerous
it is and how tricky it is how easy it
is for me to fool myself that's what actualize that
orgas grounded in and you need to drink a bit
from that cup as well which means you can't just
be following me and just be believing me and assuming
that everything I do is correct you need to do
some amount of reading now you don't probably need to
read as much as I've read you don't need to
cross cross reference as much as I have cross reference
it's a full-time job honestly I mean I spent sometimes
weeks and days just sitting around on the couch contemplating
stuff I've read in books validating against my own experience
trying to make sense of this stuff that's my work
so you probably don't need to go that hardcore into
it but you need some degree of that otherwise you're
gonna delude yourself and to fall into various kinds of
traps it's not just enough to know the things that
I talk about you also have to learn about the
various other traps that exist in this work and there's
so many different ways that you can trick yourself that
you can get caught up in some kind of pathology
some kind of half-baked mystical experience or vision that you
have which isn't really complete your ego misinterprets it right
your mind can misinterpret these experiences very easily so don't
think that just because you had one mystical experience that
this now makes you infallible and that now you understand
everything just the opposite it's very easy to become a
Zen devil unless you are you're really careful and a
lot of the material that I release is designed to
make you a very careful student of these topics so
that you're not sloppy you're not a black-and-white thinker so
you don't get caught up in some cult or some
ideology or some theory of yours and you you go
off the deep end somewhere and get yourself into trouble
and get other people into trouble so start doing the
research if you understand the significance of what is being
communicated here you're going to start doing the research and
start doing the practices and I'll see you in the
future you
