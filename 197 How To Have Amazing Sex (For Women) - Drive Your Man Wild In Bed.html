</li><li><b>Balancing Responsibility in the Bedroom</b>: While most responsibility of making sex amazing is on the man, there is still a portion assigned to the woman too. In this, women are advised to be feminine, girly, dirty, and submissive in the bedroom.
</li><li><b>Staying Fashionable & Clean</b>: Apart from maintaining health, women are recommended to keep up their appearances by wearing stylish clothes that complement their body type and personality. Furthermore, basic hygiene, including keeping the body and intimate areas clean, is highlighted as crucial.
</li><li><b>Overcoming Sexual Obstacles</b>: Three major psychological obstacles that hinder amazing sex are discussed - prudishness, the inability to let go in the bedroom, and the inability to be in the moment. Overcoming these can lead to improved sexual experiences.
</li><li><b>Importance of Open Communication</b>: Communicating about one's fears, stresses, and experiences can remove inhibitions and strengthen the intimate bond between partners. 
</li><li><b>Encouraging the Dynamic of Domination and Surrender</b>: In the bedroom, the man is expected to play the dominant role while the woman is encouraged to surrender and let go of her inhibitions. This dynamic is said to produce the most exciting and passionate sex.   
</li><li><b>Acknowledging the importance of an Active Lifestyle</b>: Good nutrition and regular exercise are stressed not just for overall health but also as an attraction for a man who values a fit partner.
</li><li><b>Practice makes Sex Perfect</b>: Experimenting with different techniques and adopting ones that work is advised to enhance sexual experiences, ultimately leading to a deeper connection with the partner. 
</li><li><b>Investing in Self</b>: Women are encouraged to see taking care of their bodies as a form of self-improvement, with the added benefit of attracting their man by satisfying his visual instinct. 
</li><li><b>Developing Dressing Sense & Hygiene</b>: Dressing stylishly, keeping the body clean and maintaining personal hygiene, especially the intimate areas, is put forward as very integral in attracting a man's attention. 
</li><li><b>Overcoming Neuroses and Anxiety about Sex</b>: The lecture highlights the need for women to overcome prudishness, learn to let go, and be present during sex. This would not only enhance their sexual experience but also lead to a stronger intimate bond with their partner.
</li><li><b>Importance of being present in the moment during sex</b>: Leo Gura underscores the significance of being present and in the flow during sex, highlighting that distractions can interfere with achieving an orgasm. 
</li><li><b>Skill in oral sex</b>: Gura stresses the need for women to learn to give amazing oral sex, suggesting learning through experience and feedback from the partner. He mentions that a woman who excels at this is highly prized by men.
</li><li><b>Being more sexually adventurous</b>: Gura advises women to be more sexually adventurous, more open about their sexuality, and willing to explore new experiences. He prompts women to want and enjoy different aspects of sex, which could include sex outdoors, threesomes, and playing with toys.
</li><li><b>Emphasising on initiating sex</b>: Gura encourages women to initiate sex more often, which he says is attractive to men. He suggests that women can engage their partners using their hands and being more active.
</li><li><b>Importance of vocal expressions</b>: Leo enumerates the power of vocal expressions in turning men on, suggesting that women should purr and scream their partner's name during sex, thereby releasing the ego tied to men's sexual performance.
</li><li><b>Learning to move your body</b>: Gura brings attention to the importance of women learning to grind their hips like strippers and porn stars. He inspires women to move their bodies with their partners, describing how this can greatly improve the quality of sex.
</li><li><b>Significance of dirty talk and intimate talk</b>: The video concludes with Gura's insights on dirty talk and intimate talk during sex. He describes how these forms of communication can enhance the sexual experience, urging women to be vocal about their sexual pleasure, including during climax.
</li><li><b>Dirty Talk</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance and impact of dirty talk during sex. Dirty talk can enhance the quality and intensity of sex. There are two types: intimate talk, which fosters emotional connection, and more graphic or hardcore dirty talk. Mixing these two elements can significantly improve sexual experiences. 
</li><li><b>Communication during Orgasm</b>: Leo suggests that women should actively communicate with their partner during sex, especially when approaching orgasm. This allows the man to lead the situation better and feeds into his sense of satisfaction and ego. Many women fail to do this which leaves men unsure and questioning their performance.
</li><li><b>Being Expressive and Losing Control</b>: Women are encouraged to exaggerate and express their pleasure during sexual activities with their man, from moving their bodies passionately to making loud sounds of enjoyment. Leo likens this to a "cat in heat", a metaphor to emphasize the need for women to surrender in the bedroom, exciting the men and making them want to dominate.
</li><li><b>Expressing Desire for Ejaculation</b>: Leo talks about the importance of expressing enthusiasm and desire for the man's ejaculation, something he says men find extremely sexy. He underlines that denying a man this gratification robs him of a key part of the sexual experience.
</li><li><b>Importance of Male Orgasm</b>: Leo explains that for men, ejaculation is essential to the sexual experience. If a man doesn't achieve orgasm, it often means he's left frustrated. He suggests that women should be aware of this and ensure their man achieves climax, possibly by taking breaks, removing condoms or engaging in oral sex. 
</li><li><b>Active and Feisty Participation</b>: Leo encourages women to be more active and feisty in their sexual encounters, not just accepting pleasure but also initiating it. He urges women to embrace the idea of multiple orgasms and squirting as part of their sexual experiences.
</li><li><b>Embrace Squirting</b>: Leo discusses how squirting can be one of the peak experiences in sex that creates a strong intimate bond. He suggests that women should read up on squirting if they have prudishness issues about it and encourages them to desire it with their partner.
</li><li><b>Show Gratitude and Respect to Your Man</b>: He stresses the importance of showing gratitude and respect to men due to their big egos. This includes appreciating the effort they put into planning things, leading in the relationship, and having sex, which can be shown through small nurturing gestures like fetching a glass of water or a towel after sex.
</li><li><b>Sexual Improvement is Personal Development</b>: Leo mentions that some women may think that becoming the "perfect girl" for a man is inauthentic and suggests they should see improving in the bedroom as personal growth. Even if the current man in their life doesn't appreciate it, they should continue growing for future partners.
</li><li><b>Continuous Sexual Skill Improvement</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of incremental improvements in sexual skills by having sex, reading books, and watching videos about it regularly. He suggests such a continuous learning process can transform one into a sexual goddess in a year.
</li><li><b>Attracting Better Quality Men</b>: The better your own sexual skills, the better quality men you can attract. He advises investing in books, videos, toys, workshops, and even sex seminars to elevate sex from a fun activity to an area of self-improvement. 
</li><li><b>Best Way to a Man's Heart</b>: Leo concludes by reiterating the old adage, the way to a man's heart is through his pants, implying that sexual mastery is key to attracting and keeping men. He invites viewers to engage with his content on personal development and self-actualization.
