Even specialized fields like programming can benefit from these skills to succeed in the corporate environment.
</li><li><b>Oversimplification of self-help by spiritual individuals</b>: Spiritual individuals often oversimplify self-help, asserting that all aspects of life reduce to enlightenment. While spirituality is significant, life presents many specialized problems that require specialized solutions, necessitating the need to explore various subfields within self-help. 
</li><li><b>Gurus and teachers can't provide all solutions</b>: Although gurus and teachers may be experts in certain areas, they might not be equipped to solve all aspects of life. It is important for individuals to direct themselves towards the materials and teachings they need to solve their specific problems. 
</li><li><b>Subfields cater to different life aspects</b>: Subfields such as career, finances, health, education, relationships, family, time management, law of attraction, creativity, business, and entrepreneurship cater to different aspects of life. Realizing the vastness and depth of self-help fields helps individuals find relevant materials for their specific situation.

</li><li><b>Shadow Work</b>: This is a process addressing repressed memories and neurotic issues that individuals often carry. This subfield is significant as the "shadow" often holds individuals back and work on it is needed in addition to other spiritual activities like meditation.

</li><li><b>Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and Hypnosis</b>: These techniques offer a way to program the mind, aiding in changes in emotions or productivity.
</li><li><b>Religion and Spirituality</b>: While studying various religions can offer wisdom, caution must be maintained against adopting dogma. Spirituality, on the other hand, addresses root existential issues and incorporating techniques from this subfield can transform lives.
</li><li><b>Non-duality, Meditation, Mindfulness, Yoga, Psychedelics, and New Age practices</b>: These are considered subfields of spirituality, each offering distinct insights and practices. The so-called "New Age" subfield encompasses a wide range of practices including astral projection, clairvoyance, out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences, chakras, auras, and channeling.

He recommends undertaking comprehensive research in this area, asserting that it can lead to the development of these abilities and enhance one's life.
</li><li><b>Caution on Diving into Occult Practices</b>: While shamanism and occult practices can be fascinating, Leo warns that they might serve as distractions from focusing on non-duality and consciousness work. He advises mastering everyday life aspects like emotions, family, career, finances, before going deep into occult practices.

He notes that people need different healing methods depending on their specific issues, and it's crucial to research to find the right fit.
</li><li><b>Value of Different Branches of Psychology</b>: Leo notes the value of works from psychologists like Abraham Maslow, Erich Fromm, and Carl Rogers. He appreciates the contribution of positive psychology to practical life applications and labels transpersonal psychology as the best branch as it covers spirituality and new-age paranormal stuff alongside psychology, providing a more complete perspective.

</li><li><b>Understanding Philosophical Basics in Self-Help</b>: Leo Gura argues that self-help is deeply rooted in philosophy, metaphysics, and epistemology, which are foundational to understanding the nature of reality and truth. He contends that traditional schooling inadequately covers these topics, leaving individuals unable to deeply question their own reality.
</li><li><b>Importance of Social Psychology, Cognitive Psychology, and Anthropology</b>: The role of these fields in understanding human behavior, the functioning of the mind, and social structures is highlighted. Existing research and emerging studies exploring these topics can be insightful and provide perspectives on various societal aspects.

Although not directly related to self-help, these subjects provide a foundation for a more profound understanding of the world.

He encourages individuals to take initiative in educating themselves in these subjects.
</li><li><b>Valuing Books As Resources for Self-Growth</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of reading books written by experts in various fields, asserting that most problems have already been resolved by someone, and that finding their books or courses may hold the key to personal growth.

</li><li><b>Importance of Independent Learning</b>: Personal development requires that individuals take control and guide their own learning journey. Self-help resources allow individuals to set their own direction and focus on topics relevant to their lives or interests.
</li><li><b>Introductory Role of Actualized.org</b>: Leo Gura acknowledges that his platform doesn't cover all subfields of self-help but serves as an introduction from which viewers can branch out and find more specialized resources. The channel presents a broad array of topics, and users need to understand that they can't rely on a single source for all their needs.
</li><li><b>Importance of Choosing the Right Subfields</b>: Depending on personal needs, struggles, genetics, and interests, individuals need to decipher which subfields to study. Each subfield has the potential to revolutionize ones life, but its true value is often realized only after an in-depth exploration.
</li><li><b>Be Open-minded About Subfields</b>: Preconceived biases can often lead individuals to dismiss certain subfields. Every self-help subfield exists for good reason and addresses specific problems encountered by thousands, if not millions, of people.

</li><li><b>Benefits and Challenges of Spirituality</b>: Spirituality, with its potential for life transformation, is suggested as a foundational subfield, despite its slow-reward nature.
</li><li><b>Homework Assignment: Exploring New Subfields</b>: To expand their knowledge, viewers are encouraged to identify and explore three new subfields, purchasing three books from each. This gesture, coupled with subsequent reading and research, can open doors to unforeseen solutions and opportunities.
</li><li><b>Confidence in Problem-Solving</b>: With a broad understanding of various self-help subfields, individuals can grow confident in their ability to find solutions to any life problems they encounter, either through their own knowledge or knowing where to find the necessary resources.
</li><li><b>Importance of Self-Education</b>: Understand that most problems can be solved by seeking out relevant knowledge and expertise, often available in books. Many people live with challenges for years, unaware that solutions exist because they haven't looked for them.

</li><li><b>Updated Book List</b>: Leo updates his book list with high-quality books twice a year; this promotes the discovery of new books beyond his recommendations.
</li><li><b>Levels of Information</b>: Videos, lectures, or talks don't always provide enough depth and detail on a topic. Reading books offers additional insights and deeper understanding.
</li><li><b>Personal Adjustment to Learning</b>: Leo shares a personal story from tenth grade about struggling with a European History AP class. He realized the struggle was due to not reading the textbook that had all the information he needed.
