hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about how to get [
__ ] done the inner game of creating results one
thing that I notice looking at people around me is
that generally speaking people are really bad at generating results
and this is very important if you want to self-actualize
you need to become a results maker I don't know
if you realize this if you've noticed but the world
runs on results right whether it's business or money or
career or fitness or even your internal mood all that
stuff is a result everything that you're looking for in
life is a result so if you can't do this
if you're not a results maker and you don't have
this in your pedigree to be able to go out
there and achieve extraordinary results uncommon results then basically you're
[ __ ] in life you see this see how
this is a very fundamental problem and then most people
who are having problems in life like getting their finances
together or getting the relationship together or getting whatever other
facet of their life together it's because they're poor results
makers it's not because they suck in that one particular
facet although that can certainly be the case but it's
more general than that it's like you're sad at making
results happen you're not a results maker and you want
this kind of pedigree so that you can say to
yourself you know I've made big results happen in the
past whether it was my relationship or with my internal
mood with my finances or with whatever and that I
can trust myself to make big results happen in the
future this is like an attitude thing it's an attitude
you take towards life so what I want to talk
about here is I want to give you a little
bit of deeper understanding of the mindsets and attitudes that
a results maker takes towards life why this is important
and then I want to give you a very juicy
list of ways that you can adopt some of these
results maker 9 sets can it give you a whole
nice juicy list so when we talk about self actualizing
when we talk about living up to your full potential
do you realize what that actually entails that entails getting
results not just dreams and ideas and theories cuz yeah
those things are nice and you could argue that everything
starts as a dream at first but the problems that
many people just get lost in the dreams and the
theories and the ideas and then they talk a lot
of [ __ ] about what they're going to do
with their life how they're going to change it or
what they're going to create for themselves or how they're
going to lose some weight or go get married or
whatever but then all that talk and all those dreams
they don't mean [ __ ] unless you know how
to translate them into the real world and that's an
ability that's something you train yourself to do and what's
interesting is that modern-day society in a sense makes it
easy for us to lose sight of results because what
you can do is you can just kind of go
with the flow of society and you can just go
get your standard nine-to-five jobs some basic career just kind
of work that and live and survive you can even
maybe thrive in that kind of environment because life's pretty
easy these days it's not like it was ten thousand
years ago think about what it was like ten thousand
years ago ten thousand years ago you couldn't just plug
yourself into the system ten thousand years ago it was
like create results or die and a good way to
prove this to yourself is uh try just going on
a camping trip for a couple of weeks maybe for
a whole month or at least do this in your
mind if you're not gonna do it in practice do
it in your mind right now imagine you go on
a camping trip and it's just you you and nobody
else no one to help you you don't have any
food with you all you have is a tent a
knife and a gun that's all you get maybe you
got a canteen for some water that's it now what
are you going to do to survive for that whole
month out there in the wilderness by yourself well you're
gonna have to create some results aren't you you're gonna
have to go first of all find some water because
if you don't get water within two days you're gonna
be dead so you got to go find a good
clean source of water make sure that it's actually clean
if you find a bad source of water and drink
it you're going to die within a few days if
you don't find water you're going to die within a
few days so there's just that then you're gonna start
to go hungry so you have to go and hunt
using your rifle now you got actually learn how to
shoot the rifle you actually learn got to learn how
to sneak up on animals find the animals in the
wilderness because it's not like animals are just running around
and waiting for you to shoot them you got to
spot them first track them down and then after you
shoot them you got to clean them up make sure
they're edible you got a user knife to skin the
animal got to cook it somehow got to start a
fire somehow right and you don't just how to do
that once but you got to keep doing that consistently
in fact you got to probably shoot half a dozen
animals a day in order to feed yourself just for
that one day because hunting requires a lot of expenditure
of energy so that's just the basics there but then
you also need shelter so you've got to build yourself
some kind of shelter make sure that it's not getting
like overheated by the heat by the Sun so it's
not getting too cold at night and you got to
manage all of that and you got to be actually
creating a certain result because in the wilderness if you're
not getting the result then basically you're dead something's going
to kill you at some point now it was easier
to be in touch with that ten thousand years ago
than it is now because nowadays if you just kind
of let yourself go Society will kind of take care
of you and even in the worst case scenario like
a bum on the street who doesn't have a place
to live still you know they have a lot of
luxuries these days that you wouldn't have ten thousand years
ago so that's one problem right the other interesting fast
this is that I find that there's this interesting dynamic
going on here of why people are not good results
makers and it's because they don't hold their own feet
to the fire of reality that's what I call it
so what I noticed in myself especially when I was
younger is that I would come up with cool ideas
and dreams for like a business that I want to
start or how my career is gonna go or for
how I'm gonna earn a lot of money or travel
somewhere do some cool thing so I would you know
have these ambitions but then what would happen is that
I would spend a lot of time thinking about this
and planning it all out but that was like me
living in my little bubble my fantasy bubble it wasn't
connected to reality anyway my feet weren't getting held to
the fire reality then what happened is I was getting
older and older and older and I started to get
out of college and I started to actually have to
go into the job market find myself a real job
actually start paying my bills that sort of thing all
the sudden it's like oh now the rubber meets the
road and now all my dreams are suddenly shattered and
thrown out the window because there's no way they could
work in real life because now what happens is that
the bubble like touches the edge of reality and when
it does that usually bursts because the bubble is not
strong enough and so what has to happen is they
have to kind of scramble and you start to think
oh [ __ ] how do I get readapt my
beliefs and my dreams and my ambitions to actually what
will work in the real world because you try to
get something to actually work in the real world you
discover like oh well the marketplace doesn't want this project
that I was dreaming up no one wants to buy
it or it's like well I thought I could charge
a thousand dollars for it and it turns out that
people don't even want to pay fifty dollars for it
turns out people don't even want it for free oh
I didn't anticipate that oh that's how markets actually work
[ __ ] what am I going to do now
and now you have to scramble and the interesting psychological
dynamic here is that it's emotionally disturbing and uncomfortable for
us to have our bubbles popped we don't like it
we like to live in Fantasyland and so what a
lot of people do I suspect is that they live
in Fantasyland but then they never ground themselves because this
grounding process it doesn't just happen once you have to
keep doing it again and again and again and again
and this is what a really good results maker is
able to do is he's able to hold his own
feet to the fire whereas the other people what they
are is they're just dreamers there are dreamers and they're
big talkers and they talk a lot of [ __
] but they don't actually get anything accomplished and I
think that one of my personal strengths is that I
am results oriented and for me this happened actually there
was like a shift in my life when this happened
because I used to be very big dreamer throughout middle
school and high school and as a college and then
was after college you know I had to get very
serious had to start going off on my own leave
the family nest um and this shift happened psychologically within
me where I kind of had to bite the bullet
and tell myself [ __ ] if I want these
dreams to actually get accomplished if I really value my
dreams then that means I have to be willing to
do what's necessary to be done and that's usually dirty
work I have to be willing to get into the
mud get myself dirty in order to translate the dream
into reality and that translation process that's a very messy
dirty emotionally difficult thing to undertake because what has to
happen is first of all you have to be flexible
enough to relinquish a lot of your fantasies and beliefs
because here's the cool thing about reality is that reality
doesn't change for you you got to change for reality
now there's really two options that you have one is
you can come up with all these cool dreams and
then when you try to implement them within reality you
see that oh [ __ ] it's not working and
then you have a choice you could say okay ah
it's not working so let me just go and fantasize
some more and forget about this whole thing of trying
to make my dreams real let me just not do
that it's kind of painful kind of unpleasant and uncomfortable
I want to go through all that so that's one
option that's the emotionally easy option then there's the emotionally
difficult option which is to say and this is the
mature option which is to say man I was really
misguided about my understandings of reality I thought this thing
would fly it's not gonna fly not even close [
__ ] let me go back to the drawing board
let me think of a new idea let me not
only just do that but also let me intro what
kind of beliefs do I hold about the world which
are making it impossible for me to make this project
actually fly in the real world oh yeah I've got
a couple of those beliefs I can see now how
those beliefs are probably wrong but man I don't want
to give up those beliefs oh man but I have
to give up those beliefs if I want to make
this work and so basically what happens is that you
have to mature and you have to evolve and you
have to let go of your old dogmas about the
way you think things should work and then actually you
have to be humble enough to let reality work on
you this is what I call holding your feet to
the fire of reality and it's an emotionally painful thing
you know for me I discovered this when I started
to to work within the video game industry and one
thing I want is I want to create these cool
games but you know creating cool games cost lots of
money takes lots of work and when I quickly realizes
that all my fancy ideas for games that I've been
dreaming up for the last five or 10 years that
a lot of those are not going to fly and
I'm enough to make a lot of sacrifices to make
some of those work right and that's when my face
not just my feet but like my face got smashed
into real and that was painful that was difficult um
and it's um it's disillusioning right disillusioning when people tell
you that oh I used to be idealistic like you
but then you know reality showed up and now I
have to have to lower my expectations lower my dreams
and all that stuff well you could do that and
some people they do is they just keep living in
their fantasy bubbles and then they they don't actually admit
to themselves that all the [ __ ] that they're
fantasizing isn't getting translated into real results it's interesting because
I talked about the Clare graves stages in my science
versus religion video so if you watch that one then
you know what I'm talking about here which is stage
green stage green is a certain stereotype of people a
certain level of a psychological development actually it's a pretty
high level most people aren't even at green but the
green stage is stereotyped as the hippie or the New
Ager and what's interesting about these people is that they
really have this sense of concern for the world right
so their circle of concern increases so that they don't
just care about themselves selfishly but now they care about
other countries and societies and other people and even animals
so that's a cool thing and also what happens is
that they become empathizers they start actually caring and they
have genuine concern about the emotions and feelings and suffering
of other people right so these people usually are interested
in like charitable causes like saving the whales and saving
the polar bears and helping poor children Africa so right
and that's a that's a good intention but one of
the problems with this stage Green is that even though
these people have really good intentions and they're very like
idealistic and they want to come together and share ideas
and they want to talk it out and they want
to come up with a plan for how to live
in harmony and in peace and so that everybody loves
each other right they're not actually good results makers and
so what happens in practice is that they come together
sit in a circle and they sing Kumbaya and they
talk about how everyone should live in peace and everyone
should love each other and how we're going to save
the environments and save the whales and do all this
nice stuff but then in reality what happens is that
you just have that moment of sitting in a circle
and then everyone disperses goes home and nothing actually changes
in the real world so they're not very good results
makers are you that way in your life do you
talk a lot of [ __ ] but then don't
get anything done do you have a pedigree of creating
results that's very important if you really want to create
either success or even happiness you might think like well
happiness doesn't depend on creating all these tangible results but
actually it does and in fact you know these green
hippy people who like to preach spirituality and how spiritual
they are and who also are very big into relationships
they also talk about you know how connected they are
to everybody else and they very much value intimacy and
relationships and communication well these things spirituality and relationships these
are actually categories within which it takes serious results making
to get good results it's one thing to talk about
how you're going to have this loving relationship and then
it's another totally different thing to actually have a loving
relationship and to actually engineer that to design it to
make it happen because a loving intimate relationship doesn't happen
by accident that takes a lot of skill to develop
that you need to develop yourself as a human being
in order to be able to sustain a really high-quality
intimate relationship and a lot of times these hippie people
they might talk about relationships and how great they are
but then in practice take a look at their lives
and you see that oh man their relationships are [
__ ] or spirituality they might talk about how spiritual
they are and yadda-yadda-yadda talk about chakras and energy and
love and all these fancy spiritual concepts but then you
actually take a look at them are they actually spiritually
developed do they actually understand are they conscious of their
own ego and all the illusions that are happening there
and what you find is oftentimes they're not in fact
what they're doing is they're using all this spiritual talk
as a way to muddy the waters so that they
can distract themselves from having to look at the fact
that actually in reality they aren't spiritual at all this
is what I mean by holding your feet to the
fire what you need to do as a results maker
if you want to really be a results maker and
self actualized you need to bite this bullet at some
point in your life and you got to save yourself
man okay um I can't be one of these people
who just dreams [ __ ] up and then doesn't
make it happen I gotta bite the bullet on this
and I actually I got to get humbled by reality
like if reality wants to beat my face to a
bloody pulp then I'm willing to take those hard knocks
because that's worth it to me because I actually care
about getting my dreams realized and then you actually got
to take those knocks and pay that cost and what
that might mean for you is giving up some of
your very cherished beliefs that you're clean to or reconciling
some of the issues you've got with money or the
way that the economy works or the way politics works
or the way that relationships actually work not your fantasy
ideal of how love works and how everyone should love
each other unconditionally because that [ __ ] doesn't happen
in real life in an intimate relationship an intimate relationship
is not unconditional love it's a very selfish kind of
love it's really like a business negotiation is what it
is but do you have the balls to admit that
to yourself should hit that and then work within that
and then transcend that that takes some real doing right
and that requires a willingness on your part to take
on the burden of expending emotional labor to make this
stuff happen which is what most people are not willing
to do so instead of talking a bunch of [
__ ] what I like from you is to actually
do the things and ask yourself to get the real
results that you want so if you're going to start
a small business go start the business stop talking [
__ ] about it if you want to go earn
more money and take care of your finances shut the
[ __ ] up and go take care of your
finances so that actually the numbers in your bank account
are increasing that's the thing that you should be judging
yourself on not how well you can talk or how
well you can dream some [ __ ] up you
know if you want to move to a new country
when you actually move to that new country that's when
it counts before then it's just a bunch of talk
same thing with losing weight same thing with your relationships
same thing with your happiness levels are you actually increasing
your happiness levels are you just talking a bunch of
[ __ ] enlightenment are you pursuing um are you
really pursuing alignment or you just talking too much a
[ __ ] about alignment you need to shut the
[ __ ] up do less talking and more doing
and when you do doing don't confuse just doing four
results there's a very big difference between just doing stuff
and getting results because you could do certain things that
will never generate a result at all in fact a
lot of people make this mistake a results maker makes
this distinction very clear in his mind ifs I'm doing
something and it's not jetting you're generating a result within
a week or two I got to change that [
__ ] up so that I'm doing something else kind
of change my approach can't get stuck a lot of
people they get stuck in these cycles where they're just
doing stuff they think it's going to produce something later
and then it never produces anything and they don't want
to change because change is emotionally difficult now let me
make the counter point which is that some people might
listen to this and say okay Willie oh you're really
hammering on results but isn't there more to life than
just results and the answer of course is yes there
is more to life than just results so I don't
want you to take my point here as being that
you got to be now this neurotic results maker only
focusing on results everywhere no but first what you got
to do is I think you got to build a
pedigree of creating results after you've done that and you've
proven that you're a results maker and you've developed that
discipline and that skill and those mindsets then you can
kind of ease off the pedal and maybe sit back
and just like meditate enjoy life a little bit don't
be so results focused but I think for most people
what they need more of is they need more of
this results making mentality because the results making is usually
the hard thing it's the emotionally difficult thing just sitting
back and relaxing in a sense that can be emotionally
difficult to to actually properly relax you know if like
you're if you're a workaholic type who's always working his
ass off then you probably actually have this opposite problem
which is that you can't sit back and just relax
and enjoy yourself so for you maybe you got to
swing the pendulum the opposite way but for many people
that's not the case so I'm not telling you here
to become a workaholic necessarily you don't need to work
yourself to death but you do need to develop this
kind of mentality it's a mentality thing so with that
said how do you actually do this let me give
you a good juicy list here's how a results maker
thinks so the first thing is that you actually have
to value tangible results this is a mindset thing an
attitude thing so for example if you're an employer and
your employees are coming to you with stuff they're supposed
to be doing for you right you have to be
the one that actually sets the standard for tangible results
being created if you're an employee right now well one
thing you can do is again you can start to
value tangible results are the people around you creating tangible
results are you holding yourself to that standard of I
got to create tangible results otherwise I'm not really doing
anything that's the first thing the second thing is you
actually have to create [ __ ] seems a bit
crafts and oversimplified but it really is this simple are
you a creator in your life or are you doing
something else for me I'm creatively minded I'm also project
minded what this means is I see my life as
a series of projects that I'm working on and I
find this is a very useful mindset for creating results
because if you are like an average person who doesn't
think about their life as a series of projects and
instead just thinks of it like oh yeah I got
my job and you know I'm just going to keep
doing that while it pays me money and maybe later
I'll get a new job and I'll just keep bouncing
from job to job and just kind of survive that
way if you're that kind of person you're gonna suck
at generating results see the way I think about it
is like this okay I got a project that's due
six months from now I got to release this product
if I create this product and I release this product
then I'm going to go on and create the next
product then maybe I'm going to go create this business
then I'm going to you know start a new business
two years after that and so on and so forth
those projects are like specific tangible things I got to
put out at the real world whether it's a website
a blog a video a video course a set of
audios a book I want to write or whatever that's
how I think of my life is like in terms
of these milestone projects which I want myself completing every
six or 12 months or so right some of them
are small or some of them are bigger but that's
important start thinking of your life in terms of projects
what are you actually creating in the next six months
is it a tangible thing when it's a tangible thing
that means you got to actually make it because then
it's very clear in your mind that if you don't
make it within the next six months you know you
failed now if you never set that tangible thing in
the first place then it's like well you can't even
tell whether you failed or not because you had nothing
you were working towards another point desire to impact people
for me this is huge personally this is the reason
why I want to be a results maker is because
I want to actually change how people think and what
they feel and I want to change the world to
have an impact on the world you need to actually
create something that is the impact so by definition you
have to be a results maker if you want to
create impact now for me that's because I actually want
to change people or you know I want to change
something whether it's creating a more beautiful piece of art
or whether it's you know writing a cool blog post
or creating a new video that's going to change someone's
mind right the video has to be created in order
for someone's mind to change someone's mind is not going
to change just for me sitting and dreaming [ __
] up most people though they don't care about impacting
anyone all they want is they want a cushy life
if all you want is a cushy life you're going
to be terrible at making results because you really don't
have a strong enough motivation to create results when you
have a real valid reason to be creating work which
is connected to your life purpose well then you can
go out there and really make some strong result tap
next point is something I call talk is cheap and
it really is people tell me all the time all
the [ __ ] they're going to do people will
email me and you know tell me projects they want
to collaborate with me on and hey Leo let's let's
write a book together or let's do this or oh
I want a sort of business or like oh I
want you know I want to start this charity organization
it's going to transform the world or I on a
cure AIDS in Africa but all this is talk is
just talk like one in a hundred people will be
serious when they're telling you this stuff the other 99%
are just Jokers just talking [ __ ] so in
my mind what I've done a long time ago is
I've just I've totally discounted talk when someone tells me
they're going to do something in my mind it means
nothing it's like empty just sounds sounds you're gonna do
something don't tell me you going to do something go
[ __ ] do it don't tell me you're gonna
lose 20 pounds go lose the [ __ ] 20
pounds then come talk to me about it don't tell
me you're going to write a book write the book
then come show it to me then we can talk
oftentimes talk is just a distraction from holding your feet
to the fire another point is work for excellence value
excellence for its own sake want to be putting out
the best you can be putting out it's crazy to
me because I work with contractors sometimes that help me
do stuff for my business and I've worked with contractors
for a long time and other businesses that I've had
and basically you know they're they're either writing stuff form
you're doing some coding or whatever tasks I have them
do but then they submit their work in their work
is just like this sloppy work now granted I don't
always pay them that much to like be doing the
beautiful most beautiful work ever but still it's like it's
sloppy work you would be a shame to submit that
kind of work to a boss or somebody it's just
crap work no excellence is put into it it's like
they don't value excellence if you don't value excellence then
how can you be a strong results maker another point
is take personal responsibility for making it happen whatever it
is losing way starting a business and project at work
you know earning more money for somebody whatever personal responsibility
has to be taken you have to believe that it's
your job nobody else is going to do it for
you stop waiting for somebody else to lead you to
show you the way to tell you what to do
if there's some initiative at work that needs doing step
up and do it take personal responsibility I always assume
that if I don't get it done it'll never get
done and no one will do it for me that's
like my general operating principle for life whatever it is
I have to do it sometimes I can even get
a little neurotic where you know it's even difficult for
me to work with other people because I just tend
to assume that they're inherently unreliable because a lot of
them are but you know there's still an art to
finding reliable you can find reliable people so don't let
that be a limiting belief another important point is working
the big picture a results maker is powerful because he
has a big picture high level understanding of what we're
working towards and why we're working towards it there's like
a purpose behind what he's doing he's not just doing
some menial labor for somebody else just because he's going
to get paid for it that's a terrible way to
go about it instead it's like he can see from
a thousand foot elevation what needs to be done why
needs to be done I think that's another attribute that
I have that some contributed to my success in life
is that I'm always looking at the big picture why
am I doing this how is this thing going to
play into the next thing and how is that going
to connect with my long-term vision for my life and
for how I want to impact the world a lot
of people don't think this way you have to start
thinking that way the next point is work ethic you
got to just build a strong work ethic and that's
something that's lacking these days because again in modern society
especially you know kids growing up these days we're so
spoiled with all the [ __ ] that we get
all the free entertainment and free this and free that
everything's taken for granted just think back even a couple
generations ago a hundred years ago when your great-grandparents were
alive the kind of work ethics that people had then
mind-blowing it's amazing sometimes I read books about you successful
people in the past uh you know think about something
like Benjamin Franklin or Nikola Tesla you know people that
lived a couple hundred years ago of Thomas Edison uh
Thomas Jefferson what these people were able to accomplish in
their lives is amazing and they had to work through
a lot more [ __ ] than we have to
do these days it was a lot harder back then
but they had these like incredible work ethics they were
like work mules these guys um that's rare these days
it's tough to develop that especially in our modern culture
our culture is very much focused on spoiling us and
making us comfortable and it really devalues work ethic so
you have to go against the grain on this and
you have to be willing to use brute force that's
something I've always left open as an option is that
if there's some result that I want to get to
and I can see that I can just like brute
force my way with work to get to that result
then I'll just do it I'll gravitate towards doing it
whereas what I see with some people is that it's
like yes we could accomplish this goal by brute force
but it's like oh well I don't want to brute
force said like isn't there a shortcut isn't there some
magic solution do I really have to sit there for
five hours and just hammer on this thing until it
gets done I don't want to do that and so
what they say is yeah let me go look for
another approach and then they never find that approach and
they never get anything done now this is not to
say again that you have to be a workaholic and
work stupid no you work smart you don't want to
be just working for works sake and doing a bunch
of menial labor but if you can see that menial
labor by doing it for a short period of time
can get you to the next level then you have
to be willing to go there and do it that's
brute force next point sacrifice comfort a lot of times
you've got to sacrifice some of your own personal comfort
to generate some powerful result in life maybe you got
to stay up late to finish writing this you know
this book for the publishing milestone or maybe you got
to skip your next vacation in order to do something
and advance yourself well are you willing to do that
or are you living life just for comfort if your
life is lived for comfort then your life is going
to actually vary ironically be a very miserable life because
it's like this some it's like the self-serving you know
ego indulgence it's like hedonism and hedonism counter-intuitively doesn't actually
produce the greatest happiness so watch out for that next
point which is a really important one you have to
be willing to change yourself to get the result this
right here is actually the whole foundation of actualized org
if you realize it or not is that the reason
we're growing and we're self actualizing is so that we
could produce better results so that we could impact the
world in a more powerful way that to me is
the nutshell of it most people are not willing to
do this most people they'll go as far as kind
of getting up to their edge of their comfort zone
and saying okay well this is the edge of what
I could possibly do so that's it that's it I've
maxed myself out know the real results maker what he
does is he says well right now I'm only capable
of going here but my result is like five steps
beyond my current ability level so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to transform my entire psyche as
necessary to get those five steps extra that I can't
get to right now whatever takes building skills reading books
taking coaching seminars studying practicing research all that stuff not
just that stuff that stuff is basic that's like a
mandatory thing you've got to learn technical skills to get
good at what you want to create I'm talking about
even going further than that like dropping entire chunks of
belief systems out of your world like deep psychological changes
right changing how you view the entire cosmos your thoughts
on God and on on physics and on science all
this [ __ ] I found has to be changed
in order to really become an amazing results maker and
it's hard for most people to see that why are
these changes necessary right these changes seem so deep and
so abstract and so loosely connected to being able to
generate practical results but for me it's all interconnected for
example if you're a very dogmatic person if you're not
able to be very open minded you're going to have
a difficult time generating the best results you possibly can
and most people are so dogmatic they don't even understand
what the word Dogma means and they will deny their
their dogmas till they're deaf to me this is ridiculous
right because like like I said a long time ago
I made a decision that I'm going to align myself
with reality no matter what the emotional cost is to
me I'm not going to try to preserve my ego
and make myself more comfortable I'm going to align myself
with the harshest truths that are out there because I
know that that's going to eventually pay off really big
for me and it has and it's going to continue
to I just have like a that's like one of
my founding principles by which I live life which I
think that most people don't do I'm kind of surprised
by it honestly next point throw yourself into demanding situations
there's nothing like just throwing yourself launching yourself outside your
comfort zone think about a military boot camp this is
exactly what it is you take some soft new recruits
throw them into a couple of months of brutal intense
boot camp training and all the sudden they come out
soldiers in the end and what happens that process is
that their psyche just gets shell-shocked into transforming right he's
like a total shock to your system and you have
so much emotional pressure on you some people break down
some people lose it some people can't handle it but
then those that do survive the process they come out
much stronger and that's what you got to do in
your life so if you're living that easy comfortable life
and you have been for the last five or ten
years how about throwing yourself into a demanding situation such
as moving to a new country um you know launching
yourself into a new relationship starting a new business or
whatever else you can think of like that next point
be around exceptional people if you surround yourself with mediocre
people who are not generating any results in life then
you will assimilate their attitudes and mindsets and you will
think that that's that's normal whereas if you're a results
maker what you do is you actually want to distance
yourself from those people surround yourself with out the results
makers and then what happens is that those results makers
bring you up to their level because if you're friends
with a person who's able to generate incredible results use
her to see that oh [ __ ] I didn't
even know it was possible to generate results of that
caliber and if that guy could do it maybe I
could do it too and if this guy could do
it and if that guy could do it then I
could probably do it too it raises up your expectations
of yourself important the next point is and I just
touched on this but starting your own business I think
that nothing holds your feet to the fire more than
starting your own business and seeing the harsh cutthroat and
brutal realities of the marketplace because when you first start
your own business you have these you know fancy business
ideas but then what happens is then you write up
let's say you write up this cool nifty business plan
and what happens is you actually go and you try
to implement it and it all goes to [ __
] none of it works no one's willing to pay
you a dime your marketing doesn't work here you know
you're not able to attract a single client no one's
interested in your stuff even for free they don't care
and then that's when you have that real big eye-opener
it's like oh [ __ ] I really don't understand
how the marketplace works my understanding of the marketplace is
so childish it has to really mature and that's where
your feet get just burned on that fire and that
burning that's a good thing see most people when they
feel that burn they don't like it it's not comfortable
to them so they run away and they feel like
oh the burn is bad but actually the secret to
life is that the burn is good you have to
train yourself to love that burn in a kind of
masochistic sadistic sort of way right just don't take it
over the top for me starting my own business was
really big that was the point where I really took
on the challenge bit the bullet and said okay um
I'm gonna figure it out somehow and I'm gonna take
full responsibility right and the stakes were so high that
I had to figure it out because literally and I
left my 95 job and then what happened was that
if if I was going to be earning money if
I wasn't going to be able to attract the clients
and actually get dollars in my bank account then I
would be homeless within a relatively brief period of time
so that really lit a fire under my ass and
the stakes were high and when the stakes are that
high then what happens that you usually your ego relents
and it surrenders and it says okay I'll change myself
to live I'll change myself to live so take that
leap if you really want to master results making in
the last point I'm going to say is think about
your death it's a little odd think about your death
how does that help you be a results maker well
for me very directly in fact I find myself thinking
about my own death on a daily basis nowadays like
just randomly thinking about my own death how I'm going
to die like maybe I'll get killed by a meteor
landing and smashing into the earth tomorrow and I won't
even wake up to know I'll just burn away or
some nuclear war starts while I'm asleep and then I
never even wake up to see it to me this
is important because it shows me how little time I
have to get [ __ ] done I don't have
eternity a very short window within which to make my
results happen so this makes me focused on generating results
right my own death this is something that most people
don't do is they don't they don't really think about
this stuff in fact they actively try to distract themselves
from thinking about their own death so that they can
pretend that they have forever to live and then you
know when they think that they have forever to live
they don't do anything they piss away all their time
piss away their youth and then when they're old and
you know in their 60s and 70s then they start
with all the regrets and all the [ __ ]
that they should have done when they were younger and
yadda-yadda we know how it works right don't fall into
that trap think about your death often so that you're
reminded of how little time you actually have so that's
my list the point in all this and what I
want you to take away from this video is simply
that you need to get off your ass now if
you've been falling into this rut of watching a lot
of actualized Org videos thinking that they're making you smarter
and cooler and and all this stuff stop that [
__ ] take action on the things I'm telling you
every video you should be thinking about how can I
take action on it and your ratio of watching my
videos to taking action should be like 10 to 1
10 times action taking one part watching a video write
whatever you want what is it a career more money
relationship happiness meditate better decide the result that you want
make a project out of it get off your ass
start doing it hold your feet to the fire feel
that burn and learn to love that burn and also
