            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/hgvVEW3XEo8' target='_blank'>As Good As Your Life Will Ever Get</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Accepting the present moment</b>: Leo asserts that the present moment is as good as life will ever get. It is a realization that irrespective of your external circumstances, the way you feel will essentially remain the same.
</li><li><b>Limitations of external achievements</b>: While encouraging the pursuit of goals like career, fitness, or relationships, he questions their ability to provide lasting happiness. Even if these goals are achieved, the cycle of seeking the next achievement for happiness tends to continue.
</li><li><b>Perpetual pursuit of happiness</b>: People often envision happiness as a future milestone. They hold onto the belief that they would be happy once they achieve a certain goal. But Leo points out that even after achievement, the question of 'what's next' arises, leading to a never-ending quest.
</li><li><b>Wiring of the brain</b>: The brain is wired in a way that makes our current state of being determine our overall sense of happiness rather than the external circumstances. This implies that having a million dollars, a great job, personal fitness or any other external achievement won't fundamentally change how you feel. 
</li><li><b>Meditation and finding happiness within</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of finding happiness within by sitting alone and being content in the present moment without relying on external factors. He suggests a mental experiment to visualize having everything you desire and acknowledging that ultimately, this doesn't change how you feel in the present.
</li><li><b>Self-development and internal happiness</b>: Leo argues that lasting happiness comes from self-development and addressing internal issues rather than seeking external solutions. Acquiring external possessions only provides temporary relief and feels empty because of a lack of internal development. He suggests that we should strive to generate our own happiness and possibly need to remove certain beliefs that hinder us from doing so.
</li><li><b>Understanding contentment</b>: The ability to feel satisfaction from being in the current moment, just as you are without distractions, is a significant concept that Leo explores. He likens it to a form of meditation and challenges viewers to sit quietly for twenty minutes, to see if they can endure tranquility and tackle the thoughts that may invade their minds.
</li><li><b>Happiness in achievement</b>: Leo posits that if you're not happy in your current state, acquiring something you desire, like career growth or improved physical fitness, might not necessarily bring the happiness you anticipate. While Leo admits he is driven by goals himself and believes that his life will improve, he also holds that life is perfect as it is.
</li><li><b>Balancing life truths</b>: This prompts a paradox; how does one reconcile the pursuit of goals with the acceptance of life's perfection in the current state? Leo reconciles this by adding elements to his life that form an ecosystem where he feels good about himself. These elements might include travel aspirations, financial capabilities, and desired comforts.
</li><li><b>Material possessions vs self growth</b>: He emphasizes that the material things align more with the outer dressing of life, whereas the meat and potatoes relate to working on oneself, and being comfortable and satisfied in the moment. Achieving internal contentment can be a complex process and not easily attainable overnight. It requires development, and he suggests meditation as a useful habit to foster comfortability in the moment. 
</li><li><b>Distraction vs lasting happiness</b>: Leo underscores that distractions such as hanging out with friends, watching TV, shopping, partying, or indulging in food, drugs and alcohol are fleeting and shallow. They may provide temporary relief but do not confer lasting happiness. He insists that true, sustainable happiness comes from within.
</li><li><b>Goal pursuit and appreciation of the present</b>: When chasing goals, Leo stresses the importance of occasionally pausing to realign oneself with the understanding that the satisfaction derived from the present moment is paramount. There could be a risk of focusing too much on goals to the point where one loses track of the journey, making the process burdensome instead of enjoyable. During such moments, reminding oneself that things may not improve beyond the present can be a grounding technique.
</li><li><b>Taking the pressure off</b>: Pressure can be reduced by pacing goal achievement, giving oneself more time. This technique also enables more appreciation of the process. Leo emphasizes that death could happen any day, hence focusing solely on hard work can lead to resentment due to neglecting the beauty existing in the present moment.
</li><li><b>Finding joy irrespective of location</b>: Lastly, Leo explains that one should not require specific environments, such as being near a waterfall, to induce feelings of joy and peace. It's possible, and more profound, to experience those feelings in an empty room, attesting to the concept that happiness comes from within and isn't reliant on external factors.
