I've had an awakening unlike any that I've ever had
and I've had Medi already up to this point but
recently I had my deepest awakening yet and it was
so astounding that I wanted to to speak about it
for a bit here so that you understand where I'm
coming from because this awakening was a a life transforming
event it feels like from this point on my whole
life has to change it was just utterly radical realization
of myself as God which of course you know I
realized many times in the past but um but the
month yeahit's I'm struggling because there's no words to describe
it it's absolutely impossible to convey to you in any
way that you can possibly imagine or understand it's completely
outside of your ability to imagine it in your current
state of consciousness you can't imagine it you can't understand
it so when I use the word awakening whatever you
think that means in your mind you have some image
of what that means you're wrong that's not what it
means and whatever other image you might conjure up you're
also wrong so no image that you can have can
possibly do it justice so this awakening was so profound
that it put me beyond anything that I've studied or
learned from any other enlightened teacher and what I became
clearly aware of is that basically no teacher that I've
learned from and I've learned from many teachers some that
I consider the world's best teachers whether reading their books
or watching their videos or actually working with them in
person interviewing them having conversations with them behind the scenes
and so forth [Music] I've interacted face-to-face with with probably
over a dozen what I would consider woke elope and
people teachers and masters and so forth and from the
awakening I had that I'm describing here it became perfectly
apparent that they're not truly awake in the way that
I experienced this awakening now you might be wondering you
know Leo you every time you keep telling me about
a full total awakening this over and over again how
many how many total awakenings can you have well that's
that's the paradox of it that's the mindfuck of it
that's what's so astounding about it is that you have
an awakening and it is total but because the very
nature of what we're dealing here is with absolute infinity
it seems to have no end or bottom to it
and so every awakening you have feels very total and
complete and then you discover that there's more and that's
precisely what makes us so tricky is that it's very
easy to get to a certain point where you think
oh okay I'm good I think I got it I
figured it out I understand what I am I understand
what consciousness is I understand what reality is I understand
what Awakening is but that's a trap because there's a
deeper level that you don't even you can't even imagine
that it's there and get it's there and there's not
just one of those there's there's many of those and
it's not that one contradicts the others they all basically
go in the same direction so there's no contradiction between
them it's not like you're trying to decide you know
we'll is this the true awakening or is that the
true awakening no they're all true awakenings it's just a
matter of depth how deep do you understand what existence
is and why it's here so in this awakening I
became completely consciousness my consciousness became so self transparent so
transparent to itself that it completely understood how it was
creating all of itself which is basically of course you
creating the entire universe how are you creating the entire
universe right now you're not conscious of that are you
are you conscious right now that you're creating the entire
universe that you're creating this entire moment right here every
single word coming out of my mouth is your creation
a creation of your own mind but see you're not
conscious of that not only are you not conscious of
that it's probably difficult for you to even conceive of
what a consciousness of that would even mean how that's
even possible it makes no sense to you from your
current state of consciousness but now imagine that something happens
and in a moment you become totally aware of how
you're creating everything everything is being created by your mind
and this mind is of course infinite it has no
beginning or end but of course you know it can't
be really explained to you the words don't do it
justice um cuz you know I've spoken these things in
the past but it's just it's again it's just a
matter of how deeply you grasp it we have my
whole during this awakening and and even now the process
is continuing I felt my entire mind and body starting
to rewire itself to embody this level of consciousness so
that I could live from it on a daily basis
but there's still more rewiring work to do my work
is not complete there's there's a lot of integration work
that needs to happen and so in a sense these
awakenings are kind of a pain in the ass because
they disrupt my normal flow of life basically after this
awakening you know I had I had plans for like
what I'm gonna do this week what kind of video
I'm gonna release what kind of topic I'm gonna talk
about and all these plans get up ended and it's
it's quite it's quite challenging because you're not able to
live a sort of a normal life where you like
you go to work on time you go to sleep
on time you have some plans to see your friends
you have some plans to complete this project at this
date like all this flies out the window with such
a profound awakening so I'm just speaking off-the-cuff here and
just sharing my thoughts with you but there's gonna be
needed there's gonna need to be a significant period of
integration and even deeper awakenings so more work basically I
need to go even deeper inside of myself and going
into solitude and isolation I talk to really to really
seize on it and to align my entire life with
with this god awareness to completely live life as though
you are God creating every single moment that's not easy
to do because we have a lot of patterns all
patterns of how we used to live life and so
undoing those habits and patterns and addictions are part of
that emotional reactions are part of that thought patterns are
part of that cravings and desires are part of that
so there's a lot of work that that needs to
be done to really be able to align oneself with
such a such a level of consciousness and so and
so yeah so truly now my understanding of awakening has
has become so rich and so full that I can
really appreciate the subtle differences between different teachers and different
teachings and different religions and traditions and basically what I'm
talking about now is a level of awakening that transcends
everything transcends all teachings all teachers transcends the Buddha transcends
Christ transcends every master that you've heard about transcend Zen
transcends Buddhism Christianity Advaita all of it all of it
becomes like a joke it transcends the chakras it transcends
meditation transcends yoga there is no way you can reach
this level of awakening through meditation through yoga's through self
inquiry nothing none of that beyond all of that so
how do you talk about it how do you teach
it how do you even get someone to believe you
it is it's unbelievable even I sitting here now can
hardly believe it it literally is like a miracle happening
to you it's it's utterly shocking you completely realize that
you're God and that you're absolutely infinite and eternal and
that you're constantly creating everything everything is your own imagination
also while I was conscious of this I started to
become conscious of the root cause of all diseases and
ailments that humans have and that of course I also
have suffered from and that's still a part of this
work that that I'm now I'm gonna get real serious
about starting to understand even deeper and to master deeper
because I haven't fully understood this yet is how actual
healing works how to do healing from this ridiculous state
of consciousness it's possible to do miraculous healing it's it's
patently obvious that it's possible but exactly how it works
and what is necessary to do it this is still
something I'm not clear about this is part of the
work I have yet to do but it's quite clear
to me that if I fully go into this work
and I do it properly that I will be capable
of levels of consciousness that perhaps only a handful of
humans have ever been capable of on the entire planet
in the entire history of mankind and that literally miracles
will be possible it's a tall order to fill I'm
a little hesitant even put this out there because it
creates false expectations and many of you because many of
you start to thing like oh well Awakening means that
you should be able to perform miracles and do whatever
you want and you should be able to have a
million dollars and this and that see this is the
ego wants this sort of nonsense it has nothing to
do with that so be very we have to be
very clear here that the actual act of awakening itself
has absolutely nothing to do with healing or miracles or
or doing anything or changing anything about reality whatsoever nothing
whatsoever is changed by awakening you simply realize that everything
that's happening is already your own will and your own
creation of your own mind now in addition to that
once you do awake into that I mean that that's
really the important thing once you do awake and then
of course there can be questions about now how do
you how do you live with it how do you
align your life to it and then of can there
be abilities you can develop after the fact from this
new level of awareness and consciousness that you have and
that of course it's gonna depend on how well you're
able to embody it on a daily basis so these
are these are separate issues so there is a potential
for doing some amazing stuff healing and other what would
be called paranormal extrasensory perception type stuff there is that
potential but I don't want you to confuse in your
mind that if a person can't do these things that
they're then they're not awake because there's many levels of
course of awakening and at the lowest levels you're not
going to really have enough consciousness to really manipulate reality
but also you have to understand that the desire to
manipulate reality is completely a function of ego so really
to be able to do these healings and to perform
these miracles it can't be coming from your ego if
your ego wants to do it you won't be able
to do it it has to be coming from absolute
love it has to be coming from total selflessness that's
what I understand so far but even knowing that I'm
still I'm still not capable of doing it because there's
there's there's just I can sense that there's even a
deeper understanding of how my mind is constructing this reality
right now even though I can be kind of conscious
that I am doing it I'm not conscious enough to
actually change it or to manipulate it so that requires
even more consciousness so clearly there's even even deeper levels
but I just want to be upfront with you the
reason I'm sharing with this with you is because I
want you to understand kind of where I'm coming from
because I will be saying things in the future that
will contradict things you've heard other teachers say and you
might wonder you wisely oh saying these things and so
I'm explaining to you why I'm saying these things because
I've access levels of awareness it's clear to me that
people that I've studied under don't have these levels of
awareness and you might wonder well isn't that arrogant how
could you possibly know that again that can't be explained
to you you will only know that by going through
these radical stages of awakening yourself and then you will
be able to look back in retrospect and find subtle
clues about teachings or teachers where you will see that
they're still playing games and they're still not fully awake
to to what they are and how they're constructing reality
and that's because you're not gonna meditate your way to
this level of consciousness no way and you're not gonna
do some yoga to get there no way there's really
no good way that I know of getting there other
than through psychedelics and specifically through five Meo DMT just
there's no there's no other comparison and I know you
guys some of you guys don't like me saying that
because you have a stick up your ass about psychedelics
but honestly you know I just gotta say what what
is the case what is true for me from my
point of view given all my experience I've hung around
many people who've done yoga and meditation and self inquiry
I've interacted with many of them I've done all these
practices myself I've gone to the past and retreats I've
done all this stuff and it's just paint li obvious
to me now that these methods are woefully inadequate for
the kinds of levels of consciousness that I'm talking about
it doesn't mean that these are useless methods they're useful
but they're not you're not gonna be able to understand
the things that I'm talking about with those methods does
that mean you should stop doing those methods not necessarily
cuz you you know you got to do the best
you got if that's all you got do do the
best you got better than doing nothing but uh but
there are better ways there are much better ways that
will save you years and decades of frustration and really
in the future I will my teachings will become more
psychedelic oriented because it's simply the most powerful tool for
this work if you're serious about understanding what the nature
of reality is if you're serious about understanding that you
are God and how all of consciousness works then simply
there's no better tool than psychedelics and if you're not
using psychedelics honestly you're wasting your time you're just wasting
decades of your life in frustration asking stupid questions going
to seminars and workshops and reading books you're just wasting
your time that's what I've learned in over five years
of pursuing awakening and having various kinds of awakenings and
doing various kinds of practices that's what I've discovered maybe
you're different maybe for you it won't work that way
but this is this is how I see it and
I just want to be upfront about that so take
that into account and anticipate that I'll be talking more
about psychedelics going forward in the future because they're so
powerful and so that you just at this point I'm
becoming very intolerant of people's games and ignorance and closed
mindedness like if you want to follow my work you've
got to be radically open-minded and you got to be
super serious about testing all of this stuff for yourself
and if you're not if you're just gonna be keyboard
jockeying and sitting there and posting stupid comments as snarky
remarks then like I don't I don't even want to
talk to you at this point and I'm not gonna
be entertaining your stupid ideas and your games I've been
far too tolerant of people's ignorance with this work and
so you're gonna see me cracking down and taking a
sort of a no-bullshit stance and being less just less
tolerant of people's ignorance both on the forum in the
comment sections and throughout my content so really I'm going
to be sort of streamlining my entire teaching to be
the highest teaching that can be taught that has been
taught on the planet I'm gonna be streamlining it this
is will be a process that will probably take me
a couple of years to really figure it all out
to streamline it and to really help you those of
you who are open-minded those of you who really are
serious about this work I can help you to discover
that you are God that's ultimately what we're doing here
do you want to fully understand how you created the
entire universe if you're open to that possibility I can
show you every single obstacle that is preventing you from
realizing that your God and there is nothing else for
you to do in this life but to realize that
your gut that's the only game in town everything else
is a distraction when you do realize that your God
this will instantaneously solve every single problem in your life
not only that but it will heal you it will
heal you of every disease and problem that you have
that's how powerful this is I've been struggling with health
issues for a while now as I was doing this
work you know I've spoken in the past about having
low thyroid and dealing with thyroid problems I've had that
for for over ten years been struggling with that and
it's been progressively getting worse I've been dealing with a
lot of chronic fatigue and some digestion problems and and
other weird symptoms that were just sort of adding on
and adding on and adding on and I've gone to
many doctors both traditional ones and alternative ones I've gotten
various kinds of healings I've taken various medicines I've tried
hundreds of supplements I've gotten Reiki I've got an acupuncture
I've got like everything you could imagine I've done and
probably many things you don't even know exist I've done
and basically it wasn't helping me and it was it
was getting difficult it was getting difficult just to even
do my work and there was no explanation for what
was what was really going on with my body and
I'm still dealing with those you know and sometimes in
life you'll face stuff like that you will face mysterious
illnesses you'll face problems like this and so in this
awakening that I had I sort of in one fell
swoop realized the source of all of my my health
issues and really not just mine but all of mankind's
the source of all disease in a sense all disease
and all all of your suffering and all of your
problems whatever they are are pushing you to awaken their
signs and Clues left by you for your own self
to help you to awaken now that doesn't make a
lot of sense probably to you you might wonder like
how is cancer a sign to awaken doesn't make sense
and you're right from your current state of consciousness it
doesn't make sense but when you fully awake and in
retrospect looking back on your whole life you'll be able
to understand every little detail of your life and how
all of it was just pushing you to awaken everything
every person in your life every book you've ever read
every video you've ever watched every link on the internet
you've ever clicked all of it was like a breadcrumb
trail that you left for yourself in order to one
day awaken to yourself as god god left these breadcrumbs
for itself and then it's just a question of will
you follow these breadcrumbs or will you ignore them and
overlook them see most your life you've been overlooking all
these breadcrumbs you don't even know that they're there but
the more tuned in you get the more conscious you
get the more you notice it and then eventually when
you awaken you'll see it all in one sort of
flashback you'll you'll see how all of it interconnected and
led you precisely to where you need to be to
go through all the stuff you have to go through
in order to fully awaken to yourself as God and
that is that is what's so astounding about it so
one of the things I'll be doing now is I'll
be going into a period of solitude where I will
be working to embody in to deepen this awakening and
to have more awakenings along the lines of this one
and to to start to understand how healing works and
to use that healing first of all to heal myself
proving on myself that I will be able to heal
myself with these abilities and then attempting to use it
to to help others and then to teach it that's
sort of my mission here so that's what that's what
I'm up to will it work I don't know I
don't know there's no guarantees but I have a vision
that it's possible and that this is the most worthwhile
thing for me to do so I'm gonna follow on
that intuition and on that vision and see how far
I can get again there's no guarantees it's it's definitely
risky and we'll see where it goes but yeah I
have been struggling with these health issues they've been quite
debilitating some some days it's been it's been difficult to
just even do any work at all and I think
the reason ultimately that I'm facing these health issues you
know I have a good diet and so forth so
it's not that mmm it's really it's it's a hurdle
that I need to overcome which is part of my
spiritual path is that I need to overcome this and
be able to heal myself so that then I have
a deep personal understanding of what it's like to to
be ill of what it's like to suffer you see
because if my path was easy then I would never
have the kind of compassion that I will have after
having gone through the kind of torture that have going
through right now so in a sense you might say
I am creating my own torture so that the awakening
can be all the more deeper and so that I
can do profound work in the years and decades to
come at least that's my best current understanding of it
um because no traditional no traditional approaches help no traditional
medicine helps and not even alternative stuff helps so um
it's pretty clear to me though that I can heal
myself but it's gonna take a lot of work I
still have a lot of work to do on myself
and so really what's happening is that the universe is
sort of grooming me to become its vehicle for transmitting
the highest teachings but to do that requires enormous inner
purification spiritual purification which I still have yet to do
I mean I've done a lot of it already but
a lot more of it yet to do to really
be able to live up and to lead at the
kind of level that I know I'm capable of and
so that's the work that I have cut out for
myself that I need to do and to do that
work I have to take a step back from actualize
that organ from from releasing the kind of weekly content
that I currently release so what I'll be doing going
forward right now is I'm gonna be taking 30 days
off and I'm gonna spend these 30 days in isolation
working on myself doing this stuff that I was just
explaining and I'm gonna see how far I can get
in those 30 days maybe I'll come back after 30
days and resume the normal content but maybe it'll take
me longer maybe it'll require 60 days maybe it'll require
90 days if it will then I'll take that time
and I will let you guys know on my blog
what the well you know when I'm coming back when
I anticipate I'm coming back yeah but eventually after 60
years 30 or 90 days whatever it's gonna be I'm
gonna come back and the content is gonna resume but
it's gonna be at a new level and you're gonna
see that it's gonna be at a new level and
I'm gonna be at a new level and overall what
you should be seeing in me right now is already
the transformation is happening my mind in my body is
already currently in the process of getting rewired to take
me to the next level of teaching and embodiment of
this work and so that's just gonna be continuing I
don't know how long the process will take I might
take a month might take three months might take six
months I don't know so I got to just kind
of play it by ear we'll see how it goes
but of course the intention as always is to come
back and to do the work even better so of
course the videos you know one of my biggest challenge
is that there's so much content that I want to
shoot hundreds of videos that I have planned so many
important topics so many things to two guys that I
don't have enough time and energy in the day to
do that to the kind of level that I want
to do it at so and so it's very challenging
for me to you know to even take 30 days
off it's very challenging because there's so much I want
to share so one of my biggest challenges is that
at the on the one hand I just want to
share and there's just this pure desire pure selfless desire
just to share and to to share insights and and
to teach there's that on the other hand there's a
need to go inside and to really go into solitude
and to not teach and just to master my own
self understanding at deeper and deeper levels and just to
become more and more conscious and more and more spiritually
pure so that I can then come back and and
just do that teaching work at a even greater level
and so what you're going to see over the next
six months let's say is a complete transformation of Who
I am my energy my abilities you might see changes
in my teaching style and so I'm just warning you
of that from your point of view they might not
all seem positive it might seem like I'm getting more
serious for example and you might perceive that as some
sort of negative or it might seem that I'm you
know I'm getting too philosophical or I'm getting too abstract
or I'm getting too impractical all of all of how
you interpret it how you see it depends on where
you are in your life and what you feel you
need so as my teachings become more and more advanced
of course they're gonna appeal to fewer and fewer people
they're gonna be misunderstood by more and more people they're
gonna be demonized more because now we're really getting serious
and really blunt about getting you to understand that your
God and just that very eye that your God just
that very idea doesn't sit very well with people but
this is how it has to be and so yeah
I have to go through a process of figuring out
how to live life in a new way that's aligned
with with these radical awakenings that I'm having and it's
a challenging process and you know if you're gonna be
realizing that your God well you're gonna probably be going
through a similar process to me it'll be a challenging
process for you it's gonna turn your whole life upside-down
and you probably will feel like you're lost and you
you won't know which way to go for some period
in your life you might get depressed you might have
health issues you know who knows what might come up
a lot there are a lot of potential side effects
and variables and it's all these which are holding you
back from really fully awakening to yourself as God because
you really do need a a complete shedding of your
old skin it's just like um like a a snake
shedding its skin or a lobster shedding its carapace to
grow bigger but that process when the lobster is in
the process of shedding its carapace it's vulnerable for some
number of days because it's new shell isn't fully hardened
yet and so that's a vulnerable dangerous time and yet
that's what you got to do to grow to ever
higher heights yeah this is the most amazing work that
you can possibly do I think the most amazing thing
is is just realizing at greater and greater levels that
you are constructing everything here all of this is your
own mind at work and so with awakening what's happening
that you're discovering more and more that you're God that
you're the only being in the universe and that you
are constructing everything around you including all people all things
animals beings everything you're also constructing all of your spiritual
ideas all of your spiritual techniques and teachings you're constructing
and imagining all of that as well it's the most
astounding thing to realize that you're doing it all and
yet that's the ultimate truth you are the truth you
are consciousness you are infinite you are loved so all
of those things still stand that's not changing we're actually
just doubling down on all that so going forward in
the future what am I going to be teaching the
core of my teaching is gonna be the following you
are God there's zero separation between you and God not
only is it that you are an avatar of God
but there's not even an avatar of God everything is
God you are God without even an avatar even to
say that you're an avatar of God is is too
far removing you from God you are absolutely God with
absolutely zero separation between you and what God is but
you have no idea what God is God doesn't know
itself until it becomes conscious of itself so that's what
the process of awakening is so that's the core of
my teaching next is that there is nothing but consciousness
God is infinite consciousness and everything is made of consciousness
and there cannot be anything but consciousness that's another core
pillar of my teaching another core pillar of my teaching
is that there's nothing but states of consciousness and everything
at all times is a state of consciousness so however
you are whatever you are that constitutes your state of
consciousness and then if you're some other way that's a
different state of consciousness and so all there is are
these different states of consciousness some states of consciousness are
more self conscious than others and there's nothing but that
another core teaching is gonna be love that you are
love love is absolute you are completely selfless you are
so in love with yourself that you construct an infinite
universe out of your love and that this love is
the antidote to all of your problems and to all
fear when you become fully conscious that you are everything
that you are God that you are the universe you're
going to love yourself completely for the first time in
your life not just yourself not just your body but
your self meaning everything you're gonna love your entire creation
and only through that love will you understand what God
is and why the creation exists as a product of
your love for your ownself and at that point there
will not be any more fear because all fear is
fear of your own self which only comes from a
lack of self-awareness when you have total self-awareness when you
are completely transparent to yourself there cannot be any fear
fear becomes impossible because fear is just fear of those
aspects of yourself which you have disconnected from and which
you have stopped loving but when you love all aspects
of yourself what can you possibly fear and of course
your immortal your eternal so you ain't goin anywhere you
have no beginning and you have no end so that
will be a core teaching going forward radical open mindedness
is going to be a core pillar of my teaching
going forward we still have more to talk about with
open mindedness a lot of topics within epistemology we're gonna
be talking about how science works deconstructing science helping to
understand that and many many other important topics and so
basically what this teaching is gonna be is it's going
to be me helping you to remove various obstacles from
your stream of consciousness which are preventing you from realizing
that your God that your consciousness that your infinite that
your love so that's all that we're doing with this
work it's just we're removing these obstacles but these obstacles
exist in many domains these obstacles exist in the domain
of sexuality and relationships they exist within the domain of
money and career taking care of yourself financially they exist
within a domain of health you know physical nutrition exercise
they exist within the domain of epistemology so that's why
we talk about epistemology so much is because the epistemic
blocks are really preventing you from realizing that you're God
they exist within the domain of science because you don't
really understand how science works for example or what reason
or what Logica or what language are these things prevent
you from from realizing that you're God and many many
other domains which we've covered in the past but I
want you to see all of that in the sort
of overarching big-picture perspective like the reason we're talking about
all these domains is ultimately because we're trying to get
your mind free of its own internal obstacles and resistance
to awaken to the fact that your God at some
point and so for each of you that will be
a long and different drawn-out process you know depending on
what your obstacles are for some of you it's gonna
be the religion that you were brainwashed with when you
were a child whether it's Christianity or Islam or Buddhism
or whatever for others of you it will be your
your constricting sense of atheism and nihilism and materialism your
scientism it will be that or your rationalism for others
of you it will be your closed mindedness to the
idea that you could be God because you assume God
must be separate from you for others it will be
fear fear of being abandoned fear of people not liking
you fear of not getting sex fear of not having
enough money fear of not knowing how to survive in
life fear of living in a bad part of the
world where life is dangerous and difficult so all of
these sort of fears and obstacles that you have projections
and biases and defense mechanisms and ways that you're misusing
your mind all of this these are just form resistance
against waking up to yourself as god that's all they
are including all of your health problems as well whatever
they are mental health physical health it's all just resistance
to you waking up as God really their wake-up calls
see life is pinging you in a subtle manner with
signals and signs all the time that you need to
wake up that's what suffering is about but what do
you do you ignore these signals because you want to
keep going through life the way you've always gone through
it and you hope that you can get the benefits
of changing yourself without ever really changing yourself you see
the problem here is that all of your problems in
life come from you being who you are and you
think you can outsmart life by maintaining who you are
but just changing the outcomes and the results that you're
getting so you think that right now if you're not
getting enough money or enough sex or you're depressed or
whatever problem you might have right now you think oh
well what's the magic pill that I can just do
what what what technique can I use to change that
part of my life so that I'm no longer depressed
or I'm no longer you know desperate for sex and
no longer needy and I'm you know no longer struggling
with money but the deeper thing you don't understand is
that it's you who's the cause of all those the
root causes you so for you to change those outcomes
what really needs to happen is that you need to
change your own self but that's the last thing you
want to change is yourself you want me to give
you techniques that you can get the results you want
without you having to change yourself that's what you really
want from me and this channel but that's not what
I'm gonna give you what I'm gonna give you is
I'm gonna give you a way to transcend and to
to kill that part of yourself which is responsible for
all the bad results that you get it's through the
death of that part and through an expansion of your
sense of identity of who you are that's what's really
going to solve all of your problems and of course
that's what you don't want because you're afraid of what
will happen when that part of you dies that whiny
bratty arrogant selfish child within you that wants it's life
to go smoothly that wants to be happy and excited
all the time that part of you needs to die
and then honest corpse will stand the new you the
larger you the stronger you the selfless you the true
you as God who will be able to live a
life in peace and happiness and joy and fulfillment and
then you'll see that you could never have lived this
kind of life through the old you and so that's
the challenge with all of this work is that we're
talking about changing you at very deep and fundamental levels
but the problem is is you don't want to change
because that inner child and you is terrified that it's
going to die because it is if you keep going
down this road but of course the secret is that
it's death will not be the death of you it
will actually be the flourishing of you the higher you
you don't really want to change you don't want to
change your lifestyle you don't want to change your worldview
you don't want to change your mind you don't want
to admit you've been wrong you don't want to open
your mind to new perspectives and new possibilities you don't
want to change your diet you don't want to change
how you view the opposite sex you don't want to
change your relationship to society you don't want to change
how you interact with your family you're comfortable with all
of these things as you've been doing them and you
think that the way you are doing all these things
is correct and good and maybe it is to a
certain extent but it will only get you to where
you currently are it won't get you any higher there's
a limit to how high you can go being who
you currently are if you insist on doing things fundamentally
as you've always done them if you're going to only
make changes on the periphery without really going to the
core of changing your own self that's the really dangerous
work then your improvements in life will also only be
on the periphery it's gonna be window dressing it's not
going to be a deep transformation of your life because
at the core of it will still be that rotten
arrogant bratty closed-minded ideological clingy self that inner child of
yours will still be running the show and that's really
what's creating your suffering and your deepest problems and keeping
you from fully flourishing into your full potential as what
you really are which is God imagine living the rest
of your life from a place of consciousness that you
are God the creator of all of life not a
victim of it so that things are just happening to
you but you truly take back your full authority and
power that's what we're talking about here that's what you
really want and everything else that you want whether it's
sex a marriage children a car a big house a
fast yacht or a lot of money all of that
these are this is just this is tangential to getting
your own self in order see the problem is that
your own sense of self is out of whack and
it's corrupted by falsehood by bias you're looking at all
of reality in a biased way to try to serve
yourself thinking that you have to do this and keep
doing it otherwise you're going to die and so you
keep playing this game you keep juggling these balls trying
to maintain life trying to survive trying to play various
social games and deep down it's eating away at your
soul you see it's making you depressed it's making you
anxious and fearful and sick causing physical sickness in you
all these games that you play because fundamentally all of
these games are a distraction and all of the ways
in which you see the world they're false they're biased
you think you need to keep looking at the world
in this biased way because it serves you and you're
afraid of what will happen otherwise but if you just
let go and you pursue the truth eventually what will
happen is that you will purify all the falsehood and
biases out of you and then what will happen is
you will become fully selfless infinitely selfless that's when you
become God when you're infinitely selfless then you realize that
you've been creating all of this that all of this
is your own dream and then finally you can reconfigure
your life to live in in alignment with the truth
rather than falsehood you can look at reality in in
a selfless unbiased way and then you can become a
leader and a vehicle for truth and consciousness in the
world and then you would finally be satisfied with yourself
see you're never gonna be satisfied with having less than
your full infinite selfless self as long as you don't
realize that you're God you're never going to be satisfied
in life never because deep down the truth is that
you're God so anything less than that anything less than
infinite anything less than absolute love anything less than absolute
consciousness is not going to satisfy you it's going to
be only temporary and that's what all of life is
it's a process of God realizing itself and it's just
a question of what are the different obstacles it's gonna
go through there are so many different paths it's like
tunnels it's almost like God is taking different tunnels different
wormholes all of them ultimately leap back to the same
place but these wormholes and tunnels can be very different
you know they sink around and loop around like a
maze and then go in all sort of twisted different
directions and that's the trip that life is life is
you know whichever wormhole you're currently going through huh so
that's the only game in town there's no other game
really here for you to play once you realize this
so my question to you is are you willing to
change yourself how much are you willing to change yourself
are you willing to change yourself so much that it
scares you as to how different you will be after
the change that's what's necessary here that kind of seriousness
because there are many scary changes that you're gonna have
to make to really get your life to go the
way you want you went into this whole process of
self-improvement and spirituality thinking that you'll just make a few
tweaks here and there and then you'll be good but
then you're shocked to discover that the that the problem
is way worse than you think it's a thousand times
worse than you've ever thought there are so many deeper
problems in you you start to discover so much rot
and corruption in you your whole mind is like a
cancer or like a rotted out tree stump that needs
major reconstructive surgery to get back to its healthy condition
but the beautiful thing is is that even though the
work is a thousand times more challenging and more comprehensive
than you ever imagined the fruit of completing the work
is gonna be a million times more amazing than you
ever imagined so you underestimated the workload but you even
moreso underestimated what's actually possible because you came into this
thing thinking like oh well if I just get a
little bit more sex and a little bit more money
and a little bit more happiness in my life and
a little bit more health than a little bit nicer
house I'll be good that's what you came in with
you didn't expect that you would that you would get
the entire universe in return you didn't respect that you
would get God in return but that is what you
will ultimately get if you go to the very end
of this work and so I'll be here to help
you to identify those obstacles get over those various obstacles
in your own mind because that's all it is just
various obstacles in your own mind it's what's preventing you
from realizing that your God a lot of social conditioning
a lot of bad stuff that your parents taught you
that your school teachers taught you that your university taught
you a lot of bad books you've read a lot
of bad spiritual teachers you've listened to a lot of
your own personal hang-ups and neuroses a lot of stuff
from the past when you were abused or mistreated by
people all the lack of love you received throughout your
childhood in your teenage years all of the broken heart
relationships you've had and all the times you were screwed
over in business and with your finances all of this
all the threats you receive in your life all the
bullying you got all the illnesses that you suffer through
all of that fundamentally that lack of love is what
is what is creating the suffering in you and also
creating a sense of of seeking because what you truly
seek without knowing what you seek is you seek infinite
love and you just seek it through very finite means
like through food or through drugs or through sex or
through a house or through a car or through a
yacht or through a career but none of those will
be enough to get you there you have to go
at it directly to realize that you are infinite love
and so that's what I'll be helping you with to
realize that and then in the whole process of that
is opening up your mind more and more and more
and more breaking down the different walls breaking down your
religious paradigms materialistic paradigms and so forth until one day
you could have one of these radical astounding awakenings that
I've been experiencing lately and that I want you to
experience for your own self so there it is I
got a lot of work to do I'm gonna get
to work on myself I recommend you get to work
on yourself and then we'll reconvene in a month's time
or in two months time whatever it takes but definitely
I will be back all right that's it for me
