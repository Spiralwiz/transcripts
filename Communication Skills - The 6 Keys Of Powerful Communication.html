hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about communication skills all right
so let's talk a little bit about communication skills and
what it really takes to improve your communication skills and
how do you become a good communicator before we go
into that and I'm going to give you six six
key points that you need to follow to become a
very effective and lethal communicator but before we get into
that let's talk a little bit about why this is
even important why this is something that you should be
concerned about communication skills it's something that I see ruining
people's lives lack thereof when you lack communication skills if
you lack communication skills you're going to have a problem
in your intimate relationships if you have lack communication skills
you can have a problem at your job at your
work if you lack communication skills you can have a
problem managing employees or running a business if you do
that working with clients that's something that's really big that
I found communication skills are important in and overall in
life having solid communication skills is important to make your
life smooth just like little things will work better for
you when you have good communication skills even something as
simple as like placing an order at the restaurant placing
a clear order and doing it in a way where
you get what you want from the waitress or the
waiter and getting your way in life this is much
easier when you have solid communication skills rather than when
you're you're unclear you're mumbly you're not sure what you
want you're not assertive and you have all these other
problems so let's go into that and talk about it
communication skills are something that you want to work on
because this is something that's going to last for your
whole life right as your life goes on you're going
to run into people you're going to have problems communicating
you're have problems writing your even to have challenges with
marketing yourself whether you're selling yourself in a resume format
where you're pitching yourself to new employers and you try
to get a better job or you're selling some sort
of business proposal that you got or maybe a product
or service that you've created that you really want to
be successful and that's important to your purpose in life
well to do all those things effectively you need to
be able to communicate effectively so let's talk about that
what does it really take to become a good communicator
I would say that there are six pillars at least
for me that I sat down I kind of thought
about okay what is it really what are the essential
components so here they are I'm going to list them
off and then we going to go into each one
into some detail and you're going to some get some
clarity around that and then you can go and work
on whatever one of these six or maybe more than
one you are deficient the most in so it's kind
of like looking at your sticking points where are your
communication skill sticking points so here are the six number
one is assertiveness number two is authenticity number three is
open-mindedness number four is empathy number five is clarity and
number six is listening listening skills so those are the
six now let's go and talk a little a little
bit about each one so first of all assertiveness being
a communicator and the reason that you're communicating anything at
all is because you usually want something to happen because
of your words or however you're communicating you can communicate
not just using words you can communicate using body language
and imagery and other things but ultimately you're trying to
convey some sort of message have some sort of impact
so a lot of people they will communicate things but
then they don't get what they actually want with the
communication because their communication is not assertive they're not really
pushing for their own agenda they're not sticking to their
guns so then they end up not getting what they
want maybe this is happening to you in a relationship
maybe this is happening to you in a debate maybe
it's happening to you in an office meeting or somewhere
else in your life right you have to be assertive
you have to be assertive that means that you can't
be a doormat you can't just let other people impose
their agenda upon you your communication has to be such
that people perceive it as as serious that way they
take your words and your language seriously and they take
your intentions and your ideas seriously so this is something
that is very important you have to know how to
be confident in your delivery not just that but also
be insistent and persistent right like I know people friends
of mine who are really really good at this personally
I struggled with assertiveness myself I was always kind of
meek in the way that that I would interact with
people and I still am to a certain degree I've
worked on it a lot but this kind of meekness
really holds you back because a lot of times you'll
want something simple and you won't be able to get
it simply because you give up before your message has
been delivered and sometimes your message has to be repeated
and repeated and repeated persistently until you get what you
want it can be just a very simple thing like
maybe you go to a hotel and they don't have
your room for some reason they sold your room to
somebody else and now you need to you need a
room for the night so basically what can you do
well you can just accept it as it is maybe
ask them about why they screwed up your reservation then
accept it or you can be assertive you can be
persistent you can get the manager to come out you
can get his manager to come out you can kind
of pummel away at the problem until maybe some something
clicks and something happens and you'd be surprised how how
often something like that where you're being assertive and being
assertive sometimes just some sort of spontaneous solution presents itself
whereas if you were meek then you would have just
been hit you would have taken that hit and you
wouldn't have ultimately gotten what you wanted out of the
situation so sort of this is important the next point
is point number two authenticity authenticity is critical authenticity is
about being true to yourself how often are you true
to yourself in community or communication if you're like most
people then what most people do is they hold back
they want to be polite they want to be curious
they they don't want to offend somebody and they'll do
anything to to make the transaction the verbal transaction go
well the communication go well and they won't really worry
about whether they're being honest and true to themselves whether
their own values are being honored here in this situation
to do that yet first of all know what your
authentic self actually is so you have to kind of
be clear about your own values you have to know
about what your own agenda is what you want out
of life and what is true what is not true
for you you have to know where the boundaries are
and then you have have the courage to go out
there and and fight for that because being authentic that's
not something that comes spontaneously to most people for most
people that takes effort and work because we've always been
taught and been conditioned to be polite and to put
this big smile on our face and you know that
can be fine in some situations and that will hold
certain situations over but in the long run it doesn't
work in the long run people see that they can
see right through your inauthenticity and when you are communicating
with someone who's inauthentic you can clearly feel it off
that person and so his message and his ideas they
get diluted they don't have the power that they want
to have but not only that but the person who's
doing that communication who's being inauthentic he or she is
a is ultimately unfulfilled with him or herself so that's
why authenticity is critical number three is open-mindedness you have
to be open-minded when you're interacting with other people open
9 does this means that you're willing to consider other
perspectives alternative scenarios and ideas don't close your mind off
to alternate points of view because you will be coming
into contact with many people in your life and their
points of view might be very different than your own
and a lot of times our gut reaction to say
no that's not something that I'm interested in that's not
something I want that's clearly wrong that's that's awful whatever
and you judge and you criticize and you draw a
basically a wall between yourself and the other person or
his ideas and when that happens then there's that wall
there's that wall between you two and so no effective
communication can happen if all you're doing is just being
very very insistent on your own points of view being
very dogmatic and grounded on that but then you're not
willing to consider other perspectives well other people are not
going to want to communicate with you you're going to
be a very stubborn person people will label you as
such and then they'll try to avoid you because who
wants to be in that kind of environment who wants
to communicate with someone like that people want to communicate
with somebody who is willing to listen to them to
consider their ideas not just in a superficial way but
honestly like there should always be a chance without a
person to convince you of their ideas so if someone
is talking to you and if you don't like what
they're saying you you can still stay there and listen
and entertain an idea just because you're intelligent and you're
willing to entertain various ideas that are necessarily your own
and that doesn't mean you have to adopt them but
you can entertain them you can play around with them
and then once in a while you actually do adopt
one it's actually something that's very critically important to your
own personal development because if if you're not taking on
this kind of open receptive mindset then that means that
you are you're kind of stuck in your own place
you're stuck in your own beliefs and your own ideas
not only is going to create communication problems it's just
going to limit your growth as a human being ultimately
you're hurting yourself by doing that so open-mindedness is very
important the fourth point for the fourth point is empathy
empathy is very important for communication in fact human beings
we have and this has been a study by neuroscientists
we have what are called mirror neurons mirror neurons what
they are are their specialized neurons in the brain and
what they do is they allow us to have empathy
with other human beings and even other creatures so for
example we can see maybe someone like a friend of
ours or spouse of ours walking across the room and
stubbing let's say her toe on on the on the
coffee table and so she stubs her toe on the
coffee table and when I look at that I wince
I go ah right because I see the pain in
her face I see her grabbing her toe and I'm
wincing because I feel the pain literally in my own
brain and those are my mirror neurons firing off and
what the mirror neurons allow us to do is they
literally allow us to to experience the emotions that we
would have experienced if we were in that situation but
we're not right when I'm seeing someone stub their toe
on the coffee table I'm not in that situation but
I'm seeing it and I'm imagining it and now I
actually feeling the pain of it a little bit not
as much but a little bit of that pain I
actually feel that's what makes my face scrunch up and
wins so those are the mirror neurons happening that's empathy
now why is empathy important for communication well the other
person wants to feel like they're being heard and they're
being understood empathy creates a common ground when you can
empathize with the person that you're communicating with that person
will feel like okay he gets me she understands where
I'm coming from okay she's just like me we have
common ground let's communicate let's see kind of like where
this goes and it come it creates this kind of
a cooperative dynamic whereas if you have no empathy for
the other person and you don't understand their emotions you
can't relate to their emotions they will sense that off
of you and they will think well this this guy
or this girl she doesn't know anything about me he
doesn't know my problems and my challenges so how can
how can I listen to him how can I listen
to her her message is not going to resonate with
me because she has very different experiences very different for
me and so there's now this this gulf of separation
if you notice a lot of my videos I talk
about a lot of the problems that you have when
I start off a video I start talking about a
problem and I talk about the emotions of it that's
because I want to build empathy and I don't just
do that to kind of curtsy favor with you I
do that because a lot of times I've come and
I've experienced those negative places that I'm talking about right
so if we're talking about some sort of negative emotion
or some sort of negative situation in life that you're
trying to fix well I've had those situations my life
and now I can use those I can build a
common ground between us so that you'll be more receptive
to what I'm saying so empathy is going to hit
you a very long way in your communication skills especially
in intimate relationships empathy is very important the next point
this is point number five now is clarity communication needs
to be clear there's an old idea I don't remember
where I got this from but I think it's a
classic idea that communication is not what you meant to
say but it's what the other person received so a
lot of times will think that we said something and
then the other person will hear our words hear our
message and then do something else or believe something else
other than what we intended well here by this more
rigorous standard of judging our communication what we really want
to say is that whatever the person hears understands that's
what was really communicated now what we intended so clarity
is all about getting your intention in line with what
the other person actually perceives the best type of communication
is extremely clear it's accurate it's easy for other people
to understand what is being meant it's not loosey-goosey and
nebulous and too abstract which allows for many many types
of interpretation clarity is very important because if you're not
clear in your communication then what you're communicating will get
misinterpreted then people will start doing things that you didn't
really intend them to do they'll start believing that you
believe things that you didn't actually believe this can create
problems in your business this can create problems when you're
giving instructions to people to do things this can create
problems with just very simple things like you tell your
kids you call your kids on the phone you tell
them to to do something very specific and if you
don't say it clearly in the right way then they
won't do it they'll do what they want to do
so clarity is something that you need to work on
if you have problems where people are miss perceiving what
you're telling them then maybe it's not them but it's
you and the way that you're communicating you're not articulating
yourself accurately and the last point point number six is
listening so communication just talking and talking and talking it
doesn't really work unless you also hear back right as
I said before people want to want to feel like
they're being listened to they don't they don't want to
just be talked at they have to be listened and
listening is not just about opening your ears a lot
of times it's just as simple as opening your ears
but you have to also let the other person know
that you're listening to them and they were heard so
for example just like very simple things being an active
listener what that means is nodding your head when you're
standing there and you're listening to somebody nodding your head
so that they're registering it saying mm-hmm once in a
while mm-hmm oh I see okay Oh interesting point so
make a little comments like that asking questions clarifying questions
about what was said so the person feels like you're
actually listening and you're engaging you want more those are
those are very critical they're very critical when you're sitting
down face to face with somebody especially when the stakes
are high when the issue is big you need to
let the other person know that you're actually listening to
them and hearing them and you have to actually want
to do that okay so if these are the six
pillars now you have to ask yourself if you have
trouble with communication skills or you want to improve which
one of these six are the one or two that
are really holding you back they're causing you the most
friction in your communications is it a service authenticity lack
of open-mindedness lack of empathy lack of clarity or lack
of listening pick one or two of those and then
say okay I want to improve that I want to
work on that I'm going to devote the next 30
or 60 or 90 days really focusing on that and
looking for ways that I can improve let's say let's
say you want to prove your clarity I'm going to
look at ways that I can improve my clarity how
can I write more clear emails how can I give
more clear presentations at work what does that mean do
I have to study you have to read some books
but to take some notes you have to you have
to spend more time preparing for my presentation do I
have to look to maybe get feedback from my boss
in a way that I haven't begin before to have
to maybe learn some new vocabulary maybe have to simplify
down my vocabulary instead of being all highfalutin and trying
to be sophisticated maybe I should just boil my vocabulary
down to something very simple where people can actually understand
what I'm saying rather than trying to impress them with
my big use of fancy words so that would be
a way that you can work on clarity and you
can do this for all the other ones as well
and then practice practice at work practice in your intimate
relationship practice at even like very simple places when you're
going out and you're ordering a coffee at the Starbucks
practice there as you're chatting with the the cashier you
can practice all these things all the time throughout your
life and the more you interact with people than the
better and better and better you get at this but
I think that it's important to put your attention on
it because a lot of people they'll just assume that
communication well that's something that just kind of kind of
comes naturally I don't really need to work on it
well if you are any any kind of professional setting
then you know that it takes it takes actual work
and practice to get really good at communication and you
can join organizations like Toastmasters and and maybe volunteer to
do more types of public speaking other types of things
at your at your job in order to become a
better communicator okay this is Leah I'm signing off this
