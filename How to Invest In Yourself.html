this is Leo from actualized org and today I'm going
to do a little video blog on the idea of
investing investing in yourself investing in life and even investigate
money because it's all the same it's all investment and
the question I really have is are you a short
or you a long-term investor why is this important well
I tend to think of short-term investing as being something
that's flaky and not something that pans out really well
whereas long-term investing can be very lucrative and very valuable
to you and I don't just mean investing in stocks
although that can certainly apply to that domain and I'm
by no means a stock investment expert so I don't
feel qualified to give advice there but I'm more mostly
talking about investing in yourself and investing in life I
find that a lot of times people have short attention
spans and they tend to jump on stuff and then
get out of it and jump on new stuff they
tend to dabble and jump from one thing to another
that leads to kind of short-term investment mindset which is
not very good towards building lasting success and whatever kind
of success that might be financial personal fitness relationship any
of that kind of stuff it's usually great and very
very valuable to be able to invest in something over
the long term so a great you know a great
example of this is is investing in your career because
with career what you're doing really and this is talked
really well about a book by Cal Newport called what
is it called it's called so good they can't ignore
you and there he really talks about building career capital
and really in order to become happy and successful in
your career what you need to do is you need
to start investing in it and building up the skill
that makes you valuable relative to others in the field
so that when you go to your employer's your ask
them for a raise or even if you're running your
own business if you go and you start charging anyone
charge clients more money or you want to move moving
on into a different domain and expand your business what's
preventing you from doing that ultimately is skill and knowledge
and know-how and so building that up to be able
to be valuable to other people because whether you're in
a career or you're running the business yourself the reason
you're making money on it is because you're providing value
to others and it's a value exchange and you're usually
offering more value than you're receiving at least that's the
ideal way that you want to be running your business
that's the most sustainable way so to do that to
provide a kind of value you need to you need
to have value in yourself you have value to give
and do that you need to build your skills so
you know let's say you're a graphic artist and you
want to advance in your career well the best way
to do that is to really get good at doing
graphic design and graphic arts it's not so much about
hobnobbing with other people although that can be useful in
its own rights and in its own you know in
different types of jobs there's varying degrees as to how
useful that is but generally if you're doing something skillful
like you're a writer you're an artist you're a designer
whatever it is that you're doing it's good to become
better and better skilled at it then you'll have more
leverage in the value that you're willing to provide others
and so others will give you more in return so
if you want the company car and you want the
four week vacation and you want the great health insurance
that somebody might provide you when they employ you well
you better provide a lot in return that means you're
providing awesome writing or awesome graphic design or awesome you
know art if that's your thing whatever it is so
that's a great you know a great starting point for
long and short term investment because with a career usually
to build skills that is something that you need to
invest a lot of time into and to do that
you need to have some discipline and you need to
also kind of understand the process of mastery I have
other video blogs on mastery to deep topic you can
research that so that's that's a that's another good shooting
off point for a tangent but I won't go in
that into that here what I really want to focus
is more on the investing in yourself so you know
thinking about how to invest in yourself and that that
is the most valuable use of your time it's not
I'm matter of going and you know asking for a
raise per say that's going to get you the big
bucks it's not a matter of saving money that's going
to get you the big bucks so stop thinking in
terms of of that it's not like winning the lottery
it's not you know saving on your groceries that kind
of stuff is not really what makes you rich and
successful what makes you rich is successful is building is
building your brain because what are skills what is knowledge
it's building your brain so the more you can build
your brain the more knowledge and experience you can have
that's valuable to other people that is what's going to
make you sustainably rich because when you have that experience
that's something that you know very few people can take
away from you and yet at the same time everybody
wants from you so that's something you can use to
trade with especially in in modern American society where most
business and work is done as a service now it's
not we're not doing manufacturing anymore we're not doing farming
it's more about you know what kind of services can
you provide to other people and a lot of it
is about information services marketing services that kind of stuff
and and that all requires massive amounts of skill and
you know as society advances it's just going to get
more and more skill is going to need to be
required to do that stuff well so think about that
they go out when you're trying to optimize your time
and make the most efficient use of your time and
your day and your week and you're playing that stuff
out try to plan more time for improving your skills
improving your experience with with whatever it is that you're
working in because as you're doing that that's making you
a better more valuable asset to others in the long
run and for sure this is not something that will
immediately pay off it might not and on the other
hand it also might so you have to take a
look at it and and and weigh the pros and
cons of getting a short-term gain versus a long-term gain
but you know this is a classic classic problem that
I'm sure you know you've heard of before is that
you want to be focused more towards the long term
than the short term immediate gratification because as you're building
yourself up to be a valuable asset to there's that's
that's where the big bucks are going to come for
you that's where your your biggest success is going to
come and there's multiple levels on which you can do
this so one way I just talked about was just
like pure skills like you can just become you know
let's say a better let's say a better artist if
that's what you do that's one thing but then there's
another level you can do it on an even higher
level where you're really focusing more on abstract in your
game than you are on specific skills so for an
artist specific skills would be you know learning to paint
better maybe learning Photoshop that kind of stuff if you're
a traditional artist that those would be kind of skills
that you want to develop to get more value there
the soft skills you might want to develop though are
also important and they might in fact be more important
which I'll make the case for that they actually are
and that's stuff like you know what do I mean
by soft skills soft skills I mean let's say people
skills let's say your business involves selling art so not
only do you have to paint the art you also
have to be able to hobnob with you know with
clients and you have to be you have to be
funny you have to be entertaining you have to be
likable you have to also be political you have to
be savvy you have to be a little bit witty
you have to be maybe a little bit conniving at
times to get to get what you want to get
the kind of success there so it's not that you
just you know paint a painting and all the sudden
you're you're Picasso and you're you know you're wealthy and
famous there's marketing involved with that so you have to
manage public expectations to be successful there so what kind
of soft skills do you need to get there and
another way to ask that question is to say who
do you have to be how do you have to
change yourself to get to that position where you see
also yourself being as that like successful artist that also
is loved by clients and gets a lot of business
well in that case you know the soft skills like
we've said are probably like people skills maybe a humor
develop a sense of humor develop some business acumen so
what are all the ways that you could do that
you know well you can maybe take some improv classes
maybe read some books on comedy maybe start practicing that
stuff with with your friends start bringing it into your
work start going to networking events that's still a little
bit of not like full inter game when I'm talking
about full in our game and this is like the
really deep but also abstract stuff is like what's holding
you back as an artist you know where's your creativity
coming from because I would assume that as an artist
creativity and originality innovation would be something that would be
very valuable to you beyond all the other stuff probably
more so than everything else and that everything else that
you do kind of hinges on that so if that's
the case you know how do you reconnect with your
creativity how do you heighten your creativity so you start
thinking about you know ways that that you can become
more creative what kind of what kind of things do
you have to think about to start putting yourself into
creative modes of thinking so you're feeling creative throughout the
day so you start structuring your life around that so
you have more creativity also you know if you're an
artist maybe you have blocks what's blocking you from from
achieving that kind of success that you want maybe it's
some sort of issues in the past where you know
you've painted great stuff and it hasn't sold and so
that has become like a limiting belief or a block
on how successful you think you can be and that
that's holding you back so maybe if that's the case
then really to be successful to really be that the
top level artist which you're going to have to do
is you have to work through that stuff right you're
going to find your sense of confidence again you have
to have find a sense of confidence in in your
creative expression this is now getting into really abstract territory
you know how do you help someone find their confidence
and their sense of expression actually that's not that hard
the trick is just figuring it figuring out what the
challenges are first so you start there you also need
to have a vision of where you're going and then
you start breaking you down to small bite-size pieces and
there's there's steps you can take there's always concrete steps
you can take to take to develop an abstract aspect
of yourself so if you want more confidence there's so
many different ways that you can do it you know
you can start painting painting or types of art maybe
10% of the stuff you paint now is going to
be less mainstream and more quirky and you're going to
be showing that more to other to patrons and to
clients and you're going to start getting their feedback and
you're going to mentally start telling yourself that each time
that you're stepping out of your comfort zone and you're
doing this quirkier type of work maybe it's work that's
a little bit offensive a little bit on the edge
that you're not going to care what other people think
and it might be hard at first but after a
while you know you start to do that and so
you you move yourself closer to be comfortable expressing who
you really are and and then maybe you take that
from 10% to 20% and then from 20 to 30
and you kind of inch your way up and you
test the waters and you see and over time usually
if it's something abstract it takes time to develop you
sort of develop that confidence in your creative expression and
that's just one example you know I've just I've been
talking about artists this could apply virtually to anything weight
loss nutrition your business any sort of other career that
you that you might be in besides art any sort
of personal development goals that you have relationship goals whatever
it is making those kinds of long-term investments developing your
inner game so that you're changing who you are to
become who you want to be that's how you're getting
sustainable change it's not about a behavioral change behavioral change
you can make behavioral changes a lot of times you'll
backslide you'll lapse back into old behaviors because the underlying
problem has been fixed none of my palm is how
you're thinking about stuff so that's another example of long-term
investment and also about how you think about stuff how
you think about what you're doing and how much is
contributing to your overall success I think this is really
critical and this is kind of the crux of this
distinction between long and short term and I'll give you
an example of when I was starting my internet business
I used to be an internet marketer I still have
to some extent but really I used to focus a
lot on SEO and I did that for four years
and I had some websites when we were launching our
first website the way to launch it and I knew
that all my success and all my money from that
website would come from the fact that I'm doing SEO
on it and that I'm building backlinks and so you
know to have your site show up high on search
engines what you need to do is you need to
get other websites to link to it so I knew
that everything that I was getting was going to be
valuable and in my mind getting these links can be
tedious and it can be very just very mundane and
grindy work and the way that I kind of tricked
myself into making these links I made a lot of
them by hand myself was that I started to think
about what each link was worth and instead of thinking
of this oh this is just a link you know
was this is just a link instead of thinking about
it like that you know how valuable is one like
oh it's not worth anything I started thinking of every
link as golden as like a diamond in my collection
because I knew that if I got enough of them
the value of those links could literally be infinite and
here's how the math kind of worked on that you
know if I can get let's say I need let's
say I need two thousand links to get my site
to start ranking really well on Google and that with
those two thousand links my website is going to start
to bring in two hundred thousand dollars a year our
website actually started to bring in more than that and
just from one website from building links and and if
you do the math and you start to think you
know well if you're earning $200,000 a year and you
have two thousand links and all you need to do
is build two thousand links to start earning $200,000 a
year how much is each link worth at that point
well you can do the division and you'll see you
know how much it's worth it can be worth a
ton but then actually in reality that website will be
making you money for more than one year I'll be
making you money for years maybe for the rest of
your life so at that point how how much are
those links you know how much are 2,000 links to
achieve that worth to you that's yeah I'm simplifying it
but that's a good way to think about it because
literally I started thinking of every link is worth like
hundreds of dollars so if I can get one link
that's like $100 in my pocket it's like $1,000 in
my pocket is it's pretty can be priceless you know
the sky this guy can be the limit depending on
you know how I'm monetizing the website and all that
kind of stuff and that gave me a lot of
motion in motivation to create every link because think of
the difference on the one hand here I am thinking
about every link is worth a thousand dollars and then
on the other hand there's my competitor and he's thinking
and seeing every link as being you know worth a
dollar who's going to make more links obviously I am
because I'm valuing it much higher and so this is
the kind of mindset that is is good to apply
to let's say your career or any sort of investment
in yourself you know how valuable is it for you
for example to read a book that's going to make
that's going to help you deal with your emotions so
you're more emotionally stable well immediately it might not be
that valuable but over the long run calculate how much
value you get from that in your whole life that
can be a staggering amount because think about what that
gets you more emotional stability maybe you'll be better at
work you'll be able to communicate with colleagues better without
getting angry at them or pissing them off you'll be
able to manage social situations better so maybe you'll get
promoted at work you'll be put in project management positions
that's going to give you more prestige more visibility more
connections with other people it's going to give you bigger
paychecks raises all that kind of stuff just from that
and that's just one facet of your life that's your
that's just your work what about the emotional stuff what
emotional stability for example will get you in your relationships
well much less heartache now these are kind of a
less tangible list you can't put a money or a
dollar amounts or to put a dollar amount up for
example having less fights with the with your significant other
but you can also you can also see how valuable
it can be to to get that result you know
what if you can reduce the amount of the amount
of fights you have by 50% what if you're able
to to form deeper connections with your friends what if
you're less you become less folk you become more focused
so you're less easily distracted by other people from getting
off your path because you're emotionally stable so you're less
insecure right if you're insecure it's very easy to knock
you off your path someone says one thing all of
a sudden you're up in your head about it you
start to doubt yourself if you're very secure then you're
going to be going down the same route you're going
to be plowing and you're going to most likely inevitably
get success because if you plow it something hard enough
you're going to learn you're you're going to take your
knocks you're going to fail enough times you're going to
learn your lessons and so that's a good way to
think about what it means to invest in yourself you
know how to develop those more abstract qualities of you
all that stuff that I call self-actualization how to develop
those stuff like emotional stability security maybe creativity more more
peace in your life and think about all the stuff
that that gets you and how valuable those soft intangible
kind of things actually are because they are super valuable
in fact I'm going to be doing more video blogs
making my case about really the need for outer game
but also the incredible value of inner game and how
coaching can help with that all right so I'm going
to pause it there and wrap this one up my
name is Leo and I'm coming at you from actualized
org peace out you
