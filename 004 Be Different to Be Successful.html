            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/mlIYVsuIofs' target='_blank'>Be Different to Be Successful</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Being Iconoclastic for Success</b>: Leo Gura discusses in the video the value of being iconoclastic, which is going against conformity and rebelling against societal norms to achieve success. Based on his personal experience, Gura explains how he deliberately chose education and hard study, contrary to his peers, because he wanted to be different. This choice led him to value education and achieve success academically.
</li><li><b>The Downfall of Conformity</b>: Conformity, according to Gura, often leads to mediocrity, especially in the business world. Businesses that follow popular trends tend to face intense competition and reduced profits. Iconoclastic businesses, on the other hand, carve their own niche, avoid market crashes and bubbles, and can acquire better profits.
</li><li><b>The Importance of Originality and Uniqueness</b>: Iconoclasm also promotes originality and uniqueness, benefiting individuals seeking non-mediocre lives. Just like Gura, one must strive to do things differently to achieve different results from the majority, who often have unfulfilling lives.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Mainstream Pitfalls</b>: Mainstream society, according to Gura, has common problems like laziness and a desire for quick rewards, which generate mediocrity. He uses examples such as lottery wins and get-rich-quick schemes to illustrate people's attraction to easy success, which often leads to disappointment in the longer run.
</li><li><b>Making Informed Choices</b>: Finally, Gura warns that being different for the sake of it can lead to failure. Proper judgment is required when deciding to go against the grain, where one needs to evaluate if the contrarian approach provides value. Hence, achieving balance between following mainstream practices and creating one's unique path is vital.
</li><li><b>Appealing to mainstream desire:</b> The video discusses mainstream society and the desire for easy wins with minimal effort, such as schemes claiming to provide easy money from home. This can backfire due to the oversimplification of complex processes. Laziness is discussed as a significant problem in mainstream society.
</li><li><b>The impact of convenience on health</b>: Leo Gura talks about the impact of convenience on health. As it becomes easy to get food and other necessary resources, it may lead to abuse and neglect of health. For instance, the easy availability of junk food has contributed to obesity due to its high energy content and low nutritional value.
</li><li><b>Herd mentality and lack of originality</b>: Leo admits that herd mentality and social conformity can hinder innovation and creativity. He argues that conforming too much can make it difficult to stand out, which is increasingly required in service-based jobs. He points out that originality and innovation are valuable in the marketplace. 
</li><li><b>Unsustainability of groupthink in investments</b>: Leo highlights how following the herd in investing can make certain ideas untenable. Group think could lead to unsustainable situations such as stock market crashes or the collapse of pyramid schemes.
</li><li><b>Disadvantages of oversaturation in markets</b>: If too many players enter a market, it can become oversaturated which can result in diminishing returns for businesses even after they work hard.
</li><li><b>The importance of being original and idiosyncratic</b>: Leo Gura asserts the importance of originality and idiosyncrasy in forming a unique personality. He shares his personal experiences and reflections on how he matured to appreciate people's quirks and unique mannerisms that he initially deemed as weird. 
</li><li><b>Embracing and expressing quirks</b>: Expressing personal quirks is seen as an essential part of self-expression and authenticity. Leo suggests that suppressing these original aspects can lead to a homogenized and unsatisfying life. There is an acknowledgment of the need for balance to avoid being labeled derogatorily. 
</li><li><b>The value of standing out</b>: Authenticity and "being oneself" can be polarizing but more rewarding as it attracts genuine connection and appreciation from people who understand and appreciate the real you.
</li><li><b>Balancing uniqueness and conformity</b>: Leo suggests that individuality is important, but a balance between conforming and standing out is necessary. People should not worry too much about being universally liked and instead focus on expressing their true selves. This helps in building a magnetic and distinct personality, attracting those who appreciate the real you. 
</li><li><b>Expression of individuality</b>: Leo argues that peculiar behaviors or 'mannerisms' are what make a person unique and shouldn't be suppressed as they are reflective of one's personality. This means even if not all quirks are attractive, they contribute to making a person interesting and stand out from the crowd. However, he cautions about standing out in a negative or extreme way and stresses maintaining an overall balance.
</li><li><b>Drawbacks of conformity</b>: Leo highlights that, though conformity sometimes leads to collective success, it can also precipitate massive failures in situations like stock market crashes and economic bubbles. When too many people flock to the same investment, resource exhaustion leads to the collapse of industries, bringing about detrimental consequences on a large scale.
</li><li><b>Constructive conformity</b>: While emphasizing the dangers of herd mentality, Leo also acknowledges its advantages. For instance, the societal expectation to pursue education, trending technological advancements like the adoption of internet and PCs, can be beneficial when followed. Thus, collective tendencies can sometimes lead to personal or societal progress.
</li><li><b>Ideal Strategy for Success</b>: Leo suggests the key to success lies in an individual's capacity to balance conformity and independence. To avoid blending in with the crowd, one should not disregard social trends or groupthink entirely but rather use them as indicators of opportunities while retaining their uniqueness. By adopting this approach, individuals can chart their own path to success.
