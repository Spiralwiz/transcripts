[Music] understanding war and conflict part one so war has
been in the news lately as you might have heard
and i thought this would be a great opportunity for
us to think about and contemplate the existential roots of
war uh i'm not going to be talking about specific
wars here we're going to be taking a very meta
perspective as we like to do here with this work
so this will help you to make sense of all
wars not just the current one that's going on and
there's always going to be some new war going on
so we might as well look at war more generally
than getting lost in the the forest i mean like
getting lost in the trees and not seeing the forest
so that's what we're going to do here and actually
it's really profound to think about what war is and
why it exists like i remember when i was a
kid maybe 7 10 years old i would see war
on television in the movies and stuff like that and
it always baffled me why do people go to war
i could understand why would somebody knowingly risk his life
uh and go into the trenches uh into impossible odds
and fight for what like what is the point of
it uh it seemed nonsensical and uh i think for
a lot of people they struggle making sense of war
and because of this they get naive child like black
and white ideas of war being good or evil this
sort of stuff or taking sides within a war one
side being good one side being evil and this is
just really not appropriate for understanding what war is and
really more fundamentally what conflict is because war as i'm
defining it here is just a a subset of a
larger category called conflict and that's really what we're going
to help you to understand here with this episode so
um it baffled me and i think war if you're
honest with yourself war should baffle you too and rather
than just saying that one side is good and one
side is evil this gives you an opportunity to enter
a kind of a not knowing and a kind of
a wonder of like why is reality constructed this way
and if you've had some mystical experiences and you've had
experiences of god and you understand that god exists for
example and that god is love and god is goodness
you might wonder well why would god create war and
so it's very important for you to contemplate these questions
and then to gain understanding and insight into the whys
of it because otherwise you're never going to be at
peace with war and that's the whole point here so
in this episode we will explore the existential route of
not just war but all conflict of any kind conflict
actually has a profound metaphysical and spiritual root to it
which is not discussed or understood by almost anyone in
society you don't hear on the news people talking about
the metaphysical spiritual roots of some war that's going on
mostly what you see on the news is people taking
sides people blaming and demonizing others and talking about atrocities
and so forth and while that's happening like the real
gold is being lost in the conflict and human conflict
is made much worse by people not understanding these metaphysical
and spiritual roots the existential nature of conflict and so
the conflict just keeps building on top of itself keeps
escalating keeps perpetuating in these cycles over and over again
it never really occurs for people to even wonder why
why conflict at all and nobody in school or university
taught you the true source of all conflict in the
world sure your history teacher might have taught you about
wars over oil or resources or for certain nationalistic causes
or ideological causes or border disputes things like that but
these these are still just like surface level understandings of
really what conflict is about and what source is it
so existentially why does conflict occur within reality at all
why isn't reality peaceful you might wonder if you're a
spiritual person you might wonder you know like why didn't
god structure reality in such a way that everything is
just paradise in heaven after all if god is all-powerful
and god exists couldn't god create a peaceful world what
kind of [ __ ] up god is this well
we're going to answer that for you but first i
want to broaden this idea of war to include all
conflict and so here i want to give you an
example of a list of examples of different kinds of
conflict beyond just war uh so war is maybe perhaps
the biggest and the worst of it but also think
about think about how how broad of a category conflict
really is so we've got war we've got all forms
of violence included in that we've got genocide we've got
racism as conflict think of all the violence that comes
with racism we've got physical abuse we've got bullying we've
got rape this is all conflict uh very sort of
a very primordial form of conflict is you can look
at the animal kingdom look at animals fighting look at
birds when you go outside you can see sometimes birds
fighting with each other attacking each other sometimes you'll see
like small two smaller birds flying and attacking a larger
bird to chase it away or if you go outside
i remember i would i would go meditate outside my
apartment where i used to live in vegas i'd i
would meditate outside my apartment on the lawn there's like
a big grassy lawn and then i would just observe
the birds there and i the more i meditated the
more i saw how these birds were interacting with each
other and a lot of times they were fighting and
they were fighting over mates i guess maybe food stuff
like that um think of conflict when you have two
animals locking horns with each other two rams or two
elk budding heads you see this all over the animal
kingdom if you watch some of those discovery channel documentaries
and of course humans do the same thing over mates
as well a lot of what that is is about
conflict over mates humans do that too in their own
way think about power struggles political battles political parties and
how they fight with each other coups revolutions assassinations think
about sports competition that's a form of conflict boxing mma
martial arts think about business the domain of business various
kinds of business battles that go on legal disputes that's
also conflict uh i read about how these large companies
like google or apple or microsoft they buy up smaller
companies just to acquire their patents so that they have
a a portfolio of patents that they can use to
sort of pummel and bludgeon the other company with to
threaten them with lawsuits so all these companies basically infringe
on each other's patents um shamelessly and then it's a
question of you know how many patents do i have
in my portfolio versus how many patents do you have
in your portfolio and who's infringed on how many of
those patents right so if i infringe on one of
your patents the best thing i can do is shore
up my portfolio of patents so that i can then
claim that you infringe on one of my patents and
so my infringement why my one infringement cancels out one
of your infringements right and these these patent disputes can
be in the billions of dollars so um actually google's
biggest acquisition was the acquisition of motorola for like 12
billion dollars and the reason they acquired you might wonder
like why would google acquire motorola motorola is this sort
of like lame old cell phone company they don't make
very good phones you probably nobody nobody you know probably
owns a motorola phone so why would google pay 12
billion dollars for motorola well it's because motorola had a
giant portfolio of patents that google needed in their fight
against apple and uh qualcomm and other sorts of um
big players in the you know telecom smartphone sector so
just you know interesting to observe how that works and
of course that's just one example of legal disputes there's
so many other kinds of legal disputes that you see
in the news how about within relationships relationship disputes fights
within relationships divorces uh fights within families a lot of
family conflict maybe you've been unfortunate to have some of
that most of us have to some degree how about
ideological battles ideological disputes and arguments how about all the
conflict we see online these days online debates online battles
twitter wars flame wars on forums and reddit and elsewhere
there's so much that going on even war in the
media now different forms of media are attacking each other
in conflict with each other there's mainstream media now there's
the rise of sort of alternative social online media independent
media and then they they they fight with each other
interesting how that works or different mainstream media channels fight
over each other you know fox news blames msnbc msnbc
blames fox news and cnn and they're all fighting with
each other battle over resources geopolitical posturing religious battles religious
conflicts think about how much of that there has been
in history culture wars those have been really popular lately
the weaponization of sort of cultural divisions bar room brawls
gang rivalry tribal feuding and warfare border disputes issues like
israel-palestine for example military campaigns of course terrorism business negotiations
are filled with conflict predator prey relationships in the animal
kingdom of course enslavement exploitation academic rivalries there's conflict within
academia conflict on college campuses conflict between corporations and unions
negotiating for workers rights billing disputes have you ever had
a conflict over a bill with your insurance company or
with some debt collector who thinks you owe them something
that you don't actually own them owe them or maybe
you do owe them you don't want to pay children
fighting with each other of course that's very common on
in school and on playgrounds competition over mates of course
is huge um gender wars genders in conflict with each
other men and women not understanding each other cyber warfare
now is common and popular hacking every day i read
the news and i hear of new hacks just like
hacking hacking hack every day there's a new hack of
somebody some giant company or some some government gets hacked
theft of course is a form of conflict and then
there's even internal conflict you have conflict within your own
mind within your own self you're conflicted and sometimes it
feels like you're within battling yourself over you know one
party who says don't eat the chocolate cake because you
want to lose weight to look good in front of
all your friends and then the other party who says
you want that chocolate cake you're conflicted uh there's even
conflict interesting um psycholo like within abnormal psychology and various
kinds of neurological disorders there's interesting conflict that results there
for example with people with split personalities sometimes there's like
a severing of connection between the left and right hemispheres
of the brain and then what that results in is
that literally one half of your body um starts to
act at odds with the other half of your body
so one half of your body might want that chocolate
cake and you're like for example let's say your your
left hemisphere wants the chocolate cake so it tells your
right arm to reach for it and then your right
hemisphere says no i don't want the chocolate cake i
want to look good in the mirror and it tells
your left arm to to to take the fork away
out of your hand and so there's funny examples where
it literally works like that where one hand will reach
for the cake the other hand will grab that hand
and pull it away and then it'll be like a
tug of war between the two hands and then how
do you know which one wins out see this is
why it's so important to integrate your mind and to
be acting as a whole person and not just as
a split you know a collection of split agendas and
personalities because then you get disorder and absurdity and a
lot of times it feels like our society has this
sort of split personality disorder especially within american politics lately
um and and also within global international affairs there's also
the sort of split personality disorder where you know different
parts of the world are aligning with each other and
then acting against each other so a lot of disagreement
discord and conflict and just even sometimes you can find
conflict on very on a very mundane level in your
own personal life like disagreement about which restaurant to go
to with your friends or family or disagreement about who
gets to keep the dog after a divorce that could
lead to conflict so those are just some examples of
conflict beyond just war and so now when we're going
to be answering this question of why does conflict occur
we're really addressing all of that at once and also
war so why isn't life peaceful well i would like
to suggest to you that the existential reason for this
is because conflict occurs because of finitude so we have
the infinite and we have the finite the finite is
the ordinary world in which humans live and survive most
of the time this is what we call life right
it's your friends it's your work it's your family it's
international affairs it's governments it's societies it's business it's law
this is the fight the world of the finite then
there's the infinite the infinite is god the infinite is
what spirituality is about and many people have never become
conscious of the infinite but let me assure you it
exists and you can become conscious of it so there's
infinite consciousness that's like the highest level of reality infinite
consciousness creates divisions within itself and imagines boundaries these boundaries
or forms are what create the physical world the thing
we call the physical material world if there's no division
if there's no difference if there's no boundary then there's
no creation and there's no form so division is form
and form is difference we've talked about this in the
past so i won't recapitulate that here but just think
of form as difference so what that means is that
like a cat is different from a dog literally what
a cat is is the difference between it and everything
else that it is not likewise for a dog so
it's a specific finite set of differences that creates a
cat versus a dog and then they fight with each
other so even though reality as a whole we've talked
about many times is infinite and it's one it's one
whole thing it's indivisible at the same time it also
contains divisions within itself it has parts and those parts
even though they're always part of a unity those parts
are finite and so then what happens is that these
parts come into contact with each other and because they're
finite the nature of the finite is that it conflicts
with itself because fundamentally what we're talking about is we're
talking about division we're talking about divisions within oneness division
then creates conflict see you have different parts of reality
these subparts we might call them of reality they must
struggle with each other for survival and if they don't
then they cease to exist as that particular form they
become infinite they merge back into infinity right so for
an object to be born it has to be born
out of infinite indiscriminate oneness into something specific and finite
and then it has to you know if it wants
to stick around for any significant amount of time it
has to defend itself and its boundary to be that
thing otherwise it deteriorates and collapses this is true not
only of living organisms like cells and animals and humans
but it's true even if static inanimate physical objects like
a chair or your computer it all degrades your chair
degrades your computer degrades it's going to collapse it's going
to lose its form and eventually it's going to turn
to dust and that dust eventually will get absorbed into
some black hole or into the sun or whatever and
literally merge into into oneness so this is the fate
of all things not just living things but um inanimate
objects as well and so what's important to realize is
that there is a fundamental existential trade-off between finite things
uh most fundamentally for you to exist something else has
to not exist do you understand this for example for
you to exist as that human that you are right
now you had to not be a kangaroo you had
to not be a coffee table you had to not
be a taco you had to not be your mother
you had to not be your nemesis or your enemy
you had to not be black or not be white
or not be asian or not be russian or not
be american or not be japanese or whatever there's a
lot of things you're not which define what you are
see what you are is interconnected existentially with what you're
not that's what makes you the finite thing you think
you are this is true not just of humans but
of all objects for a rock to exist as a
rock it must not be a plank of wood it
must not be a taco it must not be a
kangaroo or anything else it has to be exactly what
it is that specific rock the way that you see
it and what a rock really is it's not an
object per se it's a division within an infinite field
of consciousness and so it's a set of imaginary boundaries
with an infinite mind which is the mind of god
which is your mind of course your mind is the
mind of god imagining you to be a human creating
a human boundary that is what you call you so
the question then arises which imaginary boundaries will survive all
boundaries are imaginary if you stop imagining them they all
collapse back down into uh pure indiscriminate infinity so which
of these forms and boundaries will survive and who gets
to say which forms will overpower other forms and so
fundamentally conflict is equal to incompatibility or a lack of
harmony and coherence because if you have a bunch of
parts and those parts move around without siphoning energy from
other parts then you might say you have harmony and
coherence the energy is kind of being passed along in
a smooth way but a lot of what we see
in reality and in nature is where one part is
leeching off of some other part and in fact this
is sort of necessary this is how all organisms survive
every organism has to feast on some other organism and
you might say well what about the ones that are
just like photosynthesizing and getting their energy directly from the
sun they don't they don't feast on anything well still
even those who are just photosynthesizing they still have to
convert for example molecules they have to destroy molecules they
have to take oxygen atoms split them apart they have
to take water water atoms molecules split them apart they
have to take carbon dioxide split that apart carbon oxygen
combine them together right so even within a plant an
innocent plant you might say a peaceful plant that peaceful
plant is still it's taking up space in the environment
its roots are still they need to ground themselves into
the ground so they're literally shaping the earth as they're
doing that sometimes they will actually break through rocks and
concrete have you ever seen like the roots of a
tree breaking through a slab of concrete on the sidewalk
right well what is that fun i mean that's conflict
the roots of that tree are in conflict with that
rock or that concrete um and so you might look
at that and actually might see that there's a sort
of a lack of harmony there and so this is
happening all across all across reality not just with living
organisms but even inanimate objects uh for example for for
a river to maintain its course through the land the
river has a certain form to it a certain shape
and then the land has its own shape the land
ship reshapes the river and then the re the river
simultaneously reshapes the land right they're both acting on each
other at the same time and sometimes the river will
cut through rock over years and decades and centuries and
then sometimes the rock will be too strong and it
will divert the river causing the river to overflow or
to flow in different directions and to change its shape
see so even when it comes to a river and
just the terrain there's a conflict happening there that's pretty
profound huh see i bet you you never thought of
war as something that like is common to rivers and
trees and concrete and rocks and the earth itself you
tend to think of of war just as very limited
narrow thing that only humans do but when you really
broaden your idea of war to something like conflict and
then you start to look around you start to look
at nature you start to see just how much conflict
there is going on around you like a lot of
times we tend to think of like nature oh nature
is so peaceful really nature is so peaceful have you
actually looked at nature nature is pretty brutal a lot
of things are happening in nature that are quite violent
not just of course within the animal kingdom which is
obvious to see but even just within uh earth itself
you have volcanoes erupting and exploding uh like a a
giant volcano can release more uh ash than a nuclear
bomb a super volcano exploding can cause a like a
nuclear-like winter on the planet [Music] trees you know trees
seem like such peaceful beings right but trees are not
very peaceful trees are always fighting with each other go
look at the at a rainforest and you'll see all
the trees you'll see vines that are growing on top
of trees leaching nutrients from trees different trees growing to
different heights competing with each other for sunlight occupying and
stealing sunlight from other trees right the taller the tree
the more sunlight it absorbs and then anything growing under
it is going to die that's that's war for you
right there that's an arms race for who is the
tallest tree in the forest similar to like who's the
biggest gorilla who's going to get all the best mates
so if you're a living organism you need things to
survive because a living organism feasts and sucks energy from
its environment in one way or another so you always
have a list of things you need for survival every
organism does so you might need x to survive but
the problem is there's some other organism within reality because
see by definition an organism is not the totality of
of reality an organism is a subpart of reality every
organism is only a part of the whole so by
definition if you have one organism you're gonna have multiple
organisms and these organisms by virtue of the fact that
they're different from each other they're not all the same
organism they're going to have different survival requirements because every
form has a different need to maintain its different shape
you see and so if i need x to survive
you might need the opposite of x to survive you
see and therein lies the fundamental incompatibility and conflict so
there are zero sum dynamics baked into finite things all
finite things all forms exist as trade-offs with other forms
if you want to think of it very abstractly you
can think of it as like concave versus convex if
you take an object like a rectangular object and you
want to make it you want to cut it into
two you can either cut it straight down the middle
then you'll have two equal parts or you can do
sort of a circular section cut then you're going to
have one that's concave and one that's convex but when
you're making that circular cut through this rectangular single solid
object you're going to cut it into two parts two
subparts but you see how the concave and the convex
are just they're interdefined you can't really have one without
the other so this is the nature of how consciousness
works in these dualities this is just the existential nature
of form so then what happens is that you you
draw these boundaries and you have these forms and then
they enter into a competition with each other and in
a sense what's happening is that god is playing a
tug of war with itself because god is the entire
thing it's all the subparts but then the question arises
which subpart is stronger than the other because they're not
all equally strong each form has its own pros and
cons as to what it's able to do for example
the form of a screwdriver is different from the form
of a hammer is different from the form of a
knife and they all do different things and they can
excel at different things but they also have their own
weaknesses there's things that a knife is weak at that
a hammer is strong at and vice versa and same
of course for all living organisms and you see so
the problem for god then is um you have all
these parts and all of these parts are not infinitely
powerful they all have weaknesses there's always a trade-off and
so because of this no one part is able to
monopolize and gain a stranglehold over all the other parts
you can't have one part of god rule over all
of god this is the interesting aspect of god's design
every part must must have a weakness because god itself
the totality is the highest power you see the highest
power in the universe is not to be a finite
thing it's to be infinite and by being infinite you
include all the finite sub components within yourself right so
wholeness we've talked about this in my episodes about wholeness
and holism uh it is the highest power oneness is
the highest power and so then that leaves god observing
its finite subparts wrestling with its with themselves you see
and then because god is indiscriminate and a lack of
bias and infinite love it can't choose favorites it can't
love one part more than another part see it's only
the parts that have biases and that prefer one part
over some other part so you might think that like
well leo surely god loves um the defending side in
a war more than god loves the attacking side of
the war like the invading army like surely god loved
the polish people more than he loved the german people
in world war ii more than he loved hitler who
attacked and you know invaded poland surely right no that's
your bias because you're a human and you have a
certain allegiance an agenda maybe an anti-german agenda or a
pro-polish agenda or whatever or maybe your agenda is that
you want world peace that's still your agenda see god
can't have such a bias in such an agenda so
for god it just observes and loves all of it
equally that it has to because that's what god god
is it's oneness it's love oneness means it incorporates everything
that means it has to love hitler it has to
love the invader as much as the defender and so
god can't choose sides it has to remain totally neutral
now for a very selfish and biased organism this seems
like there's something wrong with god it's like leo this
is this is very wrong god can't just be neutral
about hitler god has to hate him hitler and punish
hitler the way that the way that i want the
way my ego wants the way my survival demands but
that's precisely what god cannot do you see because you're
selfish and god is selfless and your selfishness is preventing
you from realizing the power of god's infinite selflessness and
infinite love and so when you are asking god to
hate on your behalf you're actually infecting and corrupting god
with your own ego so the dilemma for god is
how does god divide up its power well it's not
really a dilemma for god because god doesn't really care
but we as if you're identified as some subpart of
god then you really care see you're attached to having
power given to you by god you want as much
power given to you by the universe see you want
the strongest army you want the strongest country you want
the strongest family you want the biggest bank account you
want the most sex you want you want all the
most favorable conditions for your survival that's your selfishness talking
um but you see the problem is that you're not
the only one you're not the only subpart of god
there's an infinite number of subparts of god so why
would god give you more of that power than it
would give to others see you want all of these
goodies but so does hitler so do your enemies see
and you feel that you deserve it more than hitler
and your enemies but god doesn't see it that way
reality doesn't see it that way because it's truly unbiased
so god cannot create a peaceful world because peace is
actually only possible under total unity and indifference that's literally
what peace is to be at peace you have to
be completely indifferent so indifferent that you don't care about
which forms survive or not but this is unacceptable to
you because you're so attached to maintaining your particular form
and surviving as that particular human thing that you've identified
yourself to be and total unity this is not what
you want you want to dominate you want to monopolize
you want your country to be the strongest you want
your company to be the best you want your family
and your children to have more than others you don't
want an equal distribution of resources within reality you don't
want uh well i guess it depends on your position
for example if you're living in a affluent part of
the world you don't want an equal distribution of resources
in the world because that means that for example poor
people in africa the millions of them that there are
they're gonna they're gonna have to take some of your
resources you have to share your resources with them you
don't want to do that because that will take resources
away from your children every dollar you send to africa
for some charity to help some poor hungry child is
a dollar you take away from your own child because
there's only a finite number of dollars in the world
and in your bank account and the reason there's a
finite number of dollars in your bank account because there's
only a finite number of days you have to live
as a finite human organism and there's only so much
money you can earn given those finite number of days
there's so much so so much value you can generate
for the world even if you generate billions of dollars
that's still a finite amount and even you might say
well but leah what about those really wealthy people like
jeff bezos who have a hundred billion dollars elon musk
and so forth um it seems like they have an
infinite supply of money but actually they don't they don't
uh every billion dollars that one of these billionaires could
give to a charity he has to decide whether he's
going to give it to save the animals save the
children in africa save the children in ukraine save the
uh you know uh something else in some other place
save the world from global warming how do you decide
think about if you had a billion dollars to give
away who would you give it to how would you
decide that says that's an interesting interesting problem notice that
your biases your personal biases and your selfishness would inform
that decision like maybe you have a real like soft
heart for animals you know cute cuddly animals and you
want to give a billion dollars to save all the
animals okay i mean that's your bias you see but
as you're doing that and saving all the cute kittens
and and dogs and so forth from getting euthanized let's
say you do that okay but what about the the
starving children in africa or even the homeless people in
your own hometown forget about africa just in your own
hometown there's homeless people who are starving and hungry you
might say okay so so what's more important is it
more important to save the animals or is it more
important to save the the starving people in your hometown
because they're closer to you or is it more important
to save the children in africa because they suffer even
worse than the the people in your hometown because the
people in your hometown they might be for example homeless
but at least maybe there's like a uh they can
get free food or something but people in africa they
don't even get free food or maybe even the people
in africa you might say i don't have it so
bad um because they can like forage for stuff in
the forest for example but maybe you got to send
it to like a place where there's war to a
city that's just bombed to hell they don't even have
water supply maybe they need it there because they're going
to get bombed out of existence where do you send
your money you see how challenging this is existentially you
can't help everybody the nature of finite things is they
can they can only exist at the cost of other
finite things this is basically the principle of conservation of
energy so you've been taught about conservation of energy as
a sort of a physical property of the universe of
the physical universe and physicists usually talk about it in
terms of like inanimate objects or sometimes biologists might talk
about it in terms of like you know animals siphoning
energy from other animals and species and so forth but
but it goes so much deeper than that really conservation
of energy is this the nature of all finite things
because when you have one thing reality as a whole
one consciousness the only way to create parts or objects
within it is to create forms by subdividing this one
object every subdivision you see every cut through a single
object creates two objects at the same time in a
sense this is duality when you make that slice you're
creating two parts at the same time we've talked about
this in my episode called understanding duality part one part
two part three go check that out we go deep
there on how duality works i give you a list
of a hundred or more different dualities that are important
for you to contemplate but like fundamentally you can't have
a north without a south you create both the same
time north and south are interdefined see that so if
what you really want is peace you can only get
that with formlessness and indifference by realizing the unity that
unifies all differences all forms forms or differences and as
long as you're interested in survival and you're attached to
survival then you cannot have peace and the degree to
which you're struggling to survive is the degree to which
you don't have peace and so one definition of what
god is is god is peace absolute peace infinite peace
how do you get infinite peace through complete indifference to
everything and another word for complete indifference to anything is
love love is indifference love is a lack of distinction
love is a lack of bias or preference for one
thing over another thing you might say well you know
that's that's not what love is leo love is is
some some human emotion uh i've discussed this elsewhere go
check out my episodes about what is love part one
and part two and i've i've covered love a lot
i'm talking about here a much deeper love than human
emotions i'm talking about platonic love metaphysical love so survival
cannot be peaceful and you are attached to survival now
so am i so i'm not blaming you here so
it's interesting to observe that no part of reality can
monopolize all the other parts and yet almost every part
of reality tries to monopolize all the other parts have
you noticed this these monopolies don't just pertain to businesses
gobbling up smaller businesses although of course that is the
quintessential example of that but um even something like a
black hole what is a black hole a black hole
is an object a form that is sucking up all
the other objects next to it in a certain sense
the black hole is like the perfect uh physical manifestation
of monopolization this is what all um corporations aspire to
they they basically turn into black holes trying to gobble
up everything nearby it's also what countries and empires aspire
to a a country grows so big it turns into
like a sort of a black hole sucking up smaller
satellite countries around itself until it creates a giant empire
and then the empire grows larger and larger and larger
and larger and where does it end well what ends
up happening is see what you would think like well
why wouldn't a black hole just suck up everything in
the universe at some point well actually it doesn't and
it can't first of all because there's not just one
black hole there's many black holes so which black hole
is going to suck up other black holes you see
if you have two black holes next to each other
let's say black holes extend infinitely far and they can
suck up to an infinite for our distance um in
practice they really can't but if you give it long
enough time you know in theory every black hole in
the universe would eventually gravitate towards itself towards other black
holes and then they would all start to lump together
and sucking each other up but then how do you
determine which black hole sucks up the other black hole
what's going to be the bigger black hole right so
supposedly in our universe in our physical universe there's one
black hole that is the biggest and there's one black
hole that is the smallest and then there's a bunch
of millions of them in between somewhere and so of
course you have to go through all the nitty-gritty details
of you know which is bigger than which and who's
going to suck up whom the most but eventually it
doesn't really matter because all of them will end up
sucking each other up you know the bill the millions
of black holes will turn into thousands of black holes
those thousands will turn into hundreds those hundreds will turn
into tens those tens will eventually turn into two black
holes one of those are going to be bigger than
the other one um and even if they're identical it
doesn't really matter they're both going to merge into each
other and eventually you're going to end up with what
one object one single thing but of course in practice
it doesn't even work this way because these black holes
actually emit bits of radiation it's called hawking radiation so
in practice a black hole is never going to suck
up the entire universe because it actually for it for
a black hole to work it turns out that the
very the very structure of a black hole is that
yes it sucks stuff in but as it sucks in
it must also leak some stuff out otherwise it couldn't
work this is called hawking radiation so eventually a black
hole even though it sucks in a lot of stuff
around it eventually it peters out and it dies even
a black hole dies you see so even you might
think like if anything could monopolize everything in the universe
it would be a black hole but it can't because
even the black hole is a finite object and it's
not powerful enough to to unify all of reality the
only thing that's powerful enough to unify all of reality
is infinity or god or nothingness or consciousness or formlessness
or emptiness and so of course if a black hole
can't do it then certainly a corporation can't do it
see you might have a fear in your mind that
leo what if one corporation monopolizes everything every other corporation
wouldn't that be an awful dystopian world to live in
well don't worry it's not going to happen because there's
natural trade-offs see as a corporation grows bigger and bigger
and bigger it becomes so big it becomes unwieldy and
inflexible and it lacks the agility necessary to innovate and
so in practice when corporations actually become very big they
actually end up dying and going bankrupt and they get
out competed by smaller corporations which is not to say
that we shouldn't have antitrust regulation i think we should
that's important stuff so don't use these existential ideas to
say that oh okay we don't have any regulations on
companies no we we do uh there's plenty of need
for that and you know empires you might think well
what about an empire what happens if one country dominates
every other country in the world maybe the way that
hitler wanted maybe i don't know did hitler want world
domination maybe he did maybe it was just like europe
um did he did he want to dominate africa i
don't know or like south america i don't know i
guess he probably probably did um there were wars in
africa at least in the north but anyways um you
would think like what if there ever comes like a
tyrant and a dictator who amasses so much power that
he creates an empire that just takes over the entire
planet well in practice it doesn't work because again fundamentally
one part one finite part does not ever have enough
power because it have it has trade-offs by virtue of
being finite it doesn't have enough power to encompass everything
now it can go pretty far like for example the
american empire stretches pretty wide around the world um the
british empire used to as they say the sun never
set on the british empire hundreds of years ago that
it all collapsed so there's a lot of empire you
know the roman empire was enormous it also collapsed the
mongol empire of genghis khan was was i think technically
the largest empire that ever existed it basically stretched from
from the the east coast of china all the way
like across europe it's insane the size of the mongol
empire its height but it didn't last very long it
fell apart it fractured and divided itself so i have
an episode called unity versus division or rather division versus
unity search for that because because really what we're talking
about here is division versus unity and the sort of
back and flow back and forth flow between these two
things so um the design of of the world is
so incredible because thanks to this inherent nature of finite
things finite things must always be ever flowing and the
universe is always running and it's never locked into a
static state precisely because no one part can monopolize everything
like everything can't just be sucked into one black hole
because if it could then reality would sort of just
like get stuck into some static state existing as that
one black hole that can't ever happen and this is
the genius of the design of god this is the
highest good the highest love the way reality or god
is designed is that god is designed to ensure maximum
diversity it's all inclusive it's total right infinite diversity infinite
diversity is a maximization of love why because your love
is highest when it can incorporate the most within it
until literally imagine you incorporate absolutely everything that could possibly
exist within yourself that would be the highest that's what
god is that's what infinity is in a sense if
all conflict stopped reality would freeze even motion would stop
because you see even even molecules of gas in a
jar let's say we just have some oxygen in a
jar you might say well where's the conflict there but
even in that jar if the temperature is anything above
absolute zero the molecules are bouncing around that's what temperature
is it's a measure of the bouncing and velocities of
all the you know average of the molecules they're bouncing
around they're colliding and hitting into each other when they
collide they generate a little bit of heat and they
lose a little bit of their energy as they collide
right they're colliding colliding colliding heat is dissipating because they're
they're bouncing into each other they're losing momentum and there's
friction going on between these different little molecules eventually if
that jar was sitting there long enough it would it
would go to absolute zero all the heat would be
lost and all the motion the molecules would settle down
into a total freeze this is the heat death of
the universe and if that happened eventually it would all
just become one single thing right not only would the
whole universe freeze but it would literally fuse into one
singularity and that would be ultimate peace that would be
consciousness in its undifferentiated state that would be pure formlessness
pure emptiness that would be the godhead that would be
infinity that would be god's mind in total repose total
rest this is you know imagine what the universe was
like before the big bang that's what that would be
so even though you might say you want peace do
you really want peace because that's real peace you call
that peace death scientists call it heat death the heat
death of the universe it's hard to love that because
you're attached to existing within the formed world the formed
universe you don't want a formless universe you call that
death you're afraid of that so there's a paradox of
unity the paradox of unity is this absolute unity must
include division within itself it can't exclude division because if
it excluded anything it wouldn't be unity it wouldn't be
absolute unity so actually uh the same also applies to
infinity absolute infinity must include all finite things and so
therefore unity leads to division and division leads to unity
you see it's a cycle it goes in both directions
and as i talked about in my episode about division
versus unity you know what you see all across nature
and all across human culture and society is that things
become unified no let me rephrase it um things differentiate
themselves starting from unity things differentiate themselves and then as
they differentiate the differentiates pro the differentiations and divisions proliferate
and then it reaches a certain point like a pendulum
that swings back and forth eventually once there's enough division
the division starts to collapse and unif and reunify and
then as they reunify they redivide again in a fractal
fashion and this keeps happening fractally to an infinite degree
have you noticed this this is [ __ ] profound
this is the very heart of the design of reality
division creates an impulse towards unity and unity creates an
impulse towards division but this unification process is a struggle
to go from division to unity is not all rainbows
and butterflies people usually think of unity as some beautiful
positive peaceful thing but it isn't so simple in practice
and the reason that is is because you yourself are
not united yet see you're divided you are divided from
the world you're divided from your family you're divided from
other humans you're divided from other races from other species
from animals you're divided from inanimate objects so you have
all these divisions in your own mind about what you
are you're even divided about your own psychology you're divided
about what you want in the world do you want
to be fit or do you want to eat junk
food you're divided even about that do you want sex
with this person or do you want sex with that
person you're divided about that see so because your mind
is so divided that distorts your perception of what unity
is and your ability to love unity you actually can't
love unity when your mind is divided unity terrifies you
because you're attached to certain divisions you've identified yourself with
certain divisions and absolute unity would erase those divisions you
call that death so in practice when unity is is
occurring within reality this can look very ugly see ultimately
when you really zoom out and you look at what
is the universe doing it used to be a total
unity then it exploded into a big bang of division
it divided into all these different molecules and atoms right
or rather into into just like quarks let's say then
those turn into atoms then those atoms started unifying into
molecules then those molecules started unifying further into proteins then
those proteins into cells and to dna and then those
into organisms and then those organisms are like one single
cellular organisms then those single cellular organisms to multicellular organisms
those multicellular organisms into more complex organisms than and mammals
then those mammals you know they started dividing themselves into
males and females and they started to recombine together to
create more offspring and and so on like this um
and then we got humans and then humans started to
dev you know there was an original race of humans
maybe like in africa or someplace and then from there
they started to spread and proliferate and divide into sub-races
then you got the asians then you got the the
you know the people the north people in the south
then you got um whites and you got blacks and
you got native americans and all this right so there's
a lot of division now it's reunifying again all the
different races are interbreeding we have more mixed-race children every
single year and maybe in a thousand years we won't
even have races because all the races will interbreed so
much see how this works but that process is not
all peaceful it's not all beautiful and positive from your
point of view there are a lot of people in
the world who are opposed to interracial um marriages there
are a lot of racist people in the world still
who believe that their race is the best or their
culture or their nation is the best see even cultures
right now as the world is globalizing our cultures are
starting to unify and merge together as well there's less
distinct cultures and some people bemoan that as the death
of some culture we also have the death of languages
languages are unifying right there's a point in human history
where human history where most of the languages couldn't be
translated into each other and there was like thousands of
languages now every year languages are dying off and going
extinct some people bemoan this fact the people who study
language are horrified by this a lot of beautiful languages
are going extinct but at the same time it's all
unifying into one language eventually we'll probably have one universal
language whether that's english or something or chinese or whatever
see we don't know which language is going to win
out that battle we don't know now if you speak
english you want it to be english because that makes
life easier for you you have to learn chinese if
you're chinese you want to be chinese because you don't
want to learn english so how's that conflict going to
get resolved there's going to be a culture war there
see people are going to cling and there's going to
be pain involved with that but it's a unification process
you see take a look at how geopolitics works and
how wars and empires works for example from putin's point
of view he's trying to unify russia but look at
how ugly that looks when you turn on the news
how do you think the ukrainians feel about the unification
of russia when when putin doesn't even acknowledge the difference
between ukraine and russia see in a ukrainian person's mind
there's a division between russia and ukraine and in putin's
mind there isn't now the question is who's right the
problem is that the ukrainians are so biased that they
think they're right and putin is so biased that he
thinks he's right and then everybody watching is taking sides
and they think that their side whatever side they're taking
that they're right now of course it's all relative go
check out my episode called understanding relativism for more on
that which is not to say that i i'm sort
of making a um a false equivalence here and i'm
not trying to say that the ukrainian position is the
same as the russian position i'm not trying to whitewash
what putin is doing he's committing atrocities and that's obvious
um but we're just taking a very zoomed out perspective
right this is like i'm trying to explain to you
the perspective of god you know how does god view
the ukraine russia situation this is how god views it
this is not how normal humans look at things look
at china trying is uh china is trying to unify
taiwan and hong kong with china now from china's point
of view that's correct because they don't recognize the difference
between china taiwan hong kong but westerners have created these
differences and have fought wars over these differences and they
want to maintain these differences again who's right is there
going to be a war over that well if everybody
thinks that they're right yeah there's going to be a
war there there's going to be conflict there if not
a war at least conflict there's already conflict in that
situation because both sides think they're right and they don't
want to realize the re uh the relativity of that
situation of their position see the european union is trying
to unify europe that's happening and notice how many struggles
come from that see that's a that's a messy difficult
process uh the uk was in the eu then it
left the eu what happened why why didn't the unity
succeed see the u.s is a unification of all of
50 states and these states they have battles with each
other uh it's you know not war but uh there's
conflicts between different states and uh it's difficult to to
unify them all together to keep them all together some
states actually want to secede that's what the civil war
was about see there's talk these days of california seceding
or texas seating or the south succeeding there's people who
seriously want to do this there's actually secessionist movements within
the u.s that want to you know a divorce let's
divorce the the red states from the blue states but
see as you do that you actually weaken both if
the red states and the blue states turn into two
separate countries they're both going to be weaker than they
were together and then that makes them pray for china
or for russia so there is strength in unity but
what i want you to recognize is that the process
of unification is not all pretty it can be very
very ugly including brutal bloody wars what was world war
ii that was hitler's attempt to unify the world under
his command now the world didn't agree with that didn't
sit too well with them and he didn't succeed but
that was his idea see this is tricky stuff you
got to be very mature to like really think about
these things properly because you have so many biases political
parties these days especially in america are very divided uh
they're divided against each other you know democrats republicans are
very divided against themselves but also within themselves they're divided
even like within the democratic party there's a lot of
division between the sort of the corporate democrats versus the
progressive wing of the party conflict happening there what did
emperors and kings try to do what was their most
important function in the old days when they used to
exist it was trying to unify people that was the
function and that that's like that's the hardest job you
want the hardest job in the world is to unify
people it's so hard to do people just don't appreciate
how difficult this is to do to unify to unify
diverse people of different races different cultures different languages different
survival agendas the more diverse or survival agendas the harder
they are to unify and that's uh what emperors and
kings try to do the history of mankind you might
say is the history of unification at gunpoint and a
really great example of this that i love is actually
this goes back so far into history one of the
earliest examples in history that that we have of this
unification is ancient egypt did you know that ancient egypt
was divided into upper egypt and lower egypt and then
what we know of now as ancient egypt that amazing
civilization with the the pyramids and the sphinx and all
this amazing culture and temples and this power they had
this amazing military power at their height they had this
amazing architectural power they had amazing science and engineering they
had amazing uh agricultural power too supplied wheat to all
of rome basically before it became that powerful one egypt
it was divided and then and here now i'm quoting
from study.com quote sometime around 2686 bce upper egypt came
north and invaded lower egypt unifying the two kingdoms under
a single ruler who took the title of pharaoh and
wore a double crown most accounts attribute this moment to
the king menes or the king narmer end quote and
so if you look at depictions of the egyptian pharaoh
he wears a crown there's one crown within another crown
there's like one large crown with a smaller crown within
it that signifies the unification and the titles that the
egyptian pharaoh had was quote uniter of the two lands
and lord of the two lands and there's actually this
this artifact that we have called the palette of king
narmer which supposedly depicts this unification so in this palette
you see the pharaoh and he is smiting his enemies
subduing them so there's conflict and violence i'm sure it
was very bloody a lot of people died to have
this happen and then you see on the other side
of this palette you see this these like two i
don't know they look like lion creatures or whatever they
are with this like double helix like these two necks
of theirs are are spiraling together symbolizing this unification and
then from this egypt became this amazing great power but
that wasn't pretty a lot of people probably died a
lot of people got raped a lot of people got
their skulls cracked probably a lot of children were killed
to make that happen so do you see the problem
with unification which part is going to rule over the
other part going to be the servant and who's going
to be the master therein lies the struggle because each
part wants to be the master and there can only
be one master each part or self has its own
agenda these diverse parts then seek autonomy and communion so
we've also talked about this in the past autonomy versus
communion you seek both see on the one hand you
want to be an independent person completely independent of other
people you don't want to depend on their money you
don't want to depend on other people for sex or
for love or for anything you want to be strong
and all by yourself you want to be all powerful
but the problem is that as you become all independent
all-powerful you become lonely because then you don't need anything
from anybody and now you're lonely and now you want
a connection you want communion with other with something other
than yourself this is god's predicament god is all-powerful so
he doesn't need anything else and there can't be anything
outside of god because it's oneness but at the same
time god also wants communion there's a trade-off between these
two and so every whole on see my episode called
what are hold-ons every hold on within reality is seeking
both autonomy and communion and then that that creates a
tug of war and even in your own life for
example when you um you probably experience this you find
a guy or a girl that you fall in love
with have sex with have real passionate you know love
making and the first few weeks you just want to
spend all your time together but then after a few
weeks of just spending all your time together having a
bunch of sex and all this and just like never
leaving each other's side um eventually you kind of get
sick of it and you say okay that's enough of
that now i'm kind of sick of that i've had
too much communion now i want some free time i
want some space i just want to be by myself
so then you go and you be by yourself for
a while and then you get lonely again and then
you want to come back and make more love and
more communion and share more and then you get sick
of sharing and sick of making love then you want
to separate again so this keeps happening people keep getting
into relationships relationships keep getting broken up marriages then marriages
turn into divorces into new marriages and on and on
it goes so the seeking of autonomy creates contradictory agendas
because see autonomy means that i want to be sovereign
i want to have my agenda and i want to
have enough power to enforce my agenda but then everybody
is doing that right so then if i'm doing that
and you're doing that which now we're going to be
in conflict if we ever come near each other but
at the same time we can't just say separate all
the time because we actually want to come near each
other right because what's the point of having all the
power all the money all the wealth and all the
love in the world if you can't share it with
somebody you see it becomes useless so the more the
more you get in life the more fulfillment you get
in life the more the things of your agenda that
gets satisfied the more of your selfish needs get satisfied
the more you want to just share that with others
and eventually if you get to the point where you
you become fully realized as god and you acquire infinite
power omniscience consciousness love and everything you become completely selfless
you see what do you want then what what what
is the point of your existence at that point the
only point of your existence is to share that with
others but the problem is as we talked about at
that point you're so conscious you're so one there is
nobody else to share it with unless unless you can
fool yourself into thinking that you're not god fall asleep
divide your own consciousness into others and then you can
play the game of sharing but then you don't have
infinity to share anymore now you're sharing in a finite
way you're sharing in a selfish way so you share
a little bit but then also you want something in
return you want to give it a love but then
you want to get some love too see and this
is the existential predicament of human life you want both
autonomy and communion and they're at odds with each other
not all agendas can co-exist and due to self-bias see
my episode called understanding self-bias each being thinks that its
agenda is the most important so it's hard to convince
a being to submit itself to another's autonomy or agenda
because you're selfish and you think your agenda is the
right one and in a certain sense it is the
right one for you but not necessarily for me so
selfish agendas collide resulting in conflict so again to to
really underscore this the key insight i want you to
take away from this is that metaphysically speaking division equals
conflict and struggle and all form is division and peace
equals absolute selflessness or formlessness as we've talked about in
my episodes about whole laws and holistic thinking and holism
the human body is one of the best examples that
we can look at for how division and unity can
be harmonized in a in a profound way that human
society still hasn't figured out quite how to do uh
autonomy versus communion work together in an overarching harmony within
a human organism or any any living organism right because
you have all these individual cells millions and billions and
trillions of cells in your body which are arranged then
into into organ systems and these organs they have sort
of a mind of their own they have their own
agendas you know your heart needs nutrients your liver needs
nutrients your brain needs nutrients how do they figure out
where the nutrients go you see if every one of
your organs was selfish or some cell in your body
was selfish was sucking up all the nutrients for itself
and replicating itself endlessly that would be cancer that would
kill the whole organism right that would be a lack
of coherence a lack of harmony that would be selfishness
so the different organs have to be somewhat selfish because
they need nutrients in certain requirements but also they have
to be selfless enough to surrender their autonomy in an
intelligent way such that they can be part of some
larger thing called an organism right like the heart can't
have a mind of its own it can't just be
a dictator or a tyrant it has to recognize the
importance of submitting to the rule of the central nervous
system same thing with my hands right so like my
hands can't just do their own thing they have to
listen to the signals that are being sent to them
so that we can have like a some sort of
coordination here then the hands can do something they can
you know chop some food or use a hammer or
screwdriver or something it's amazing to think about this stuff
it's amazing to see the kind of harmony that has
arisen through evolution within the human organism within yourself but
then also notice that your own mind then becomes conflicted
even though your body might not be conflicted your mind
might be conflicted and then also if you have some
kind of disease like an autoimmune disorder then your body
could be conflicted too maybe your immune system is attacking
your body so uh really we want to study how
the body does it well how a healthy body does
it well remember we talked about how health equals wholeness
we're coming back to that point you know a healthy
body how does it harmonize and create peace within itself
right so like a healthy body is not at war
with itself fundamentally it's not a conflict with itself well
then how do we replicate that within societies and within
the whole global system of geopolitics empires nations cultures languages
families corporations the legal system see this is the real
work of mankind it's difficult work it takes a lot
of nuance and selflessness and neutrality lack of bias to
do this work most people are too selfish and too
biased too needy to really be thinking about these things
at this high level instead they're just taking sides which
just creates more conflict so fundamentally conflict is one part
of reality trying to preserve itself at the cost of
other parts all of this is unfolding of the is
an unfolding of the infinite fractal of god god is
this entire process god is not just the peaceful parts
god is all the parts including the most violent parts
and all of this is necessary inevitable and the highest
good so long as there are individual selves or parts
within reality then with autonomy there will be conflict if
your survival is assured if your needs are fully met
there is no conflict but for most of us our
survival is not assured and our needs are far from
met but as soon as your survival is threatened or
your needs go unmet then conflict arises and conflict is
going to be in proportion to how much your needs
are not being met the more a thing is needed
for your survival the sharper the conflict will be over
it and remember what i mean by survival here see
my episodes understanding survival part one part two is not
just physical survival although of course it includes that but
also more importantly survival in a sort of conceptual in
the conceptual domain in a very abstract sense your mind
is trying to survive your worldview is trying to survive
there's sort of a further paradox and complication here is
that it's hard to really understand and appreciate war and
conflict when you are sitting comfortably at home in a
peaceful country when war is not going on so uh
people might criticize me like oh leo you're taking this
such a philosophical and abstract position here like you're talking
about these things and the only reason you're talking about
these things is because you're sitting here you know you
know in your cushy house in some expensive part of
the world in a democracy and all this you're getting
the benefits of all that and so that's why you
can talk so flippantly about war and conflict but you
know those people who are in a war zone and
their children are getting bombed you know they don't have
this luxury to sit here and just philosophize about this
stuff they know what war really is like and leo
you don't know what war is really like because you've
never been in war that is that is a valid
point that's an important point to keep in mind you
can't really appreciate the significance of what conflict is until
you find yourself in a deprived position where your survival
is genuinely threatened to the point where you can't even
think straight you're so biased you're cornered like a rat
only in those situations can you really appreciate the necessity
of conflict however there's a flip side to that coin
here's the paradox is that it's also equally hard to
understand what conflict is and why it occurs when you
are caught in the middle of it and forced to
choose sides so those people who are caught in a
war zone and have been for their entire lives let's
say who do not have the luxury to sit down
and to contemplate peacefully about their experiences these people also
don't actually understand conflict and war and the reason that
is is because they're they're too close to it they're
too attached to it their survival is so so threatened
that literally they don't have the luxury to see the
truth and to understand conflict and war and to appreciate
it and to put it into a larger context because
if they were to do that they would be killed
and so all they're doing is just struggling to survive
now i'm not blaming them for that that's just the
position they're in but also they don't really see the
depth of of what's happening to them but at the
same time if you're just staying at home in a
comfy situation where your survival is never threatened you also
don't really appreciate the power and profundity of conflict but
you don't need to go to war per se you
don't need a war zone to really understand conflict you
have conflict in your life all the time we all
do to various degrees now of course if you were
to war zone it would be very poignant for you
unlike it is for most people but you have conflicts
with your family you have conflicts even with your dog
or your cat you have conflicts with your lawyer with
your accountant with your dentist you have conflicts with um
with your boss with your employees with political parties there's
plenty of conflict that you see that you can use
to start to understand right and you can feel you've
had experiences in your life where you felt very deprived
your knees were not met you felt very threatened even
if you were not in a war zone the difficulty
with understanding conflict is that it's like trying to understand
pain you see when most people are experiencing pain they're
so at the effect of the pain that all they
can think about is how to stop the pain they
don't even care about thinking about what pain is and
they mistake the sharpness of the pain and the suffering
they mistake that for the reality of the situation like
the more painful it is the more real it is
no that's not true pain doesn't make a thing more
real it just makes it more difficult for you to
to pierce through the illusion of it see that's precisely
the point of pain the point of pain is to
be such a sharp illusion that it distracts you from
even thinking about it as an illusion because if you
start thinking of pain as an illusion then very quickly
you're going to be dead it's like that with conflict
when you're really in a conflict about something that's important
to your survival you don't have time to sit there
and go met on the issue to really think about
the philosophy of it and the existential nature of it
and how it fits into god and love and you
don't have time for this you just want to quickly
get the fight over with you want to win and
get what you need to survive so what's to be
done about all this philosophy well first there is some
practical action steps for you here you have to start
to really observe how conflict occurs first of all notice
when conflict is occurring and label it as such start
to notice how diverse conflict is as a category of
thing start to draw sort of a common connection between
all the different kinds of conflict you see so when
you have a conflict with your roommate look at that
as though it's a war between two countries or two
empires just a microcosm of that see and then then
you can observe that there are commonalities the things that
will stop you from arguing with your wife or your
mom or your dad or your children it's a similar
sort of thing that will get two empires to cease
escalating and starting a third world war also notice that
there's individual conflicts and collective conflicts individual conflicts is like
you arguing with your dad uh collective conflict is like
you know two empires going to war with each other
or two political parties or two factions within a political
party fighting or two factions within a religious group fighting
and you know trying to splinter off contemplate what causes
the conflict that you're observing notice yourself being biased and
choosing sides and getting sucked into the conflict uh the
most strong example of this is when you're actually con
you know in the conflict yourself like if it's a
fight between you and your roommate obviously you're involved in
that so you're picking sides and you're biased already but
also sometimes maybe you have two roommates and they are
fighting with each other or you have you know your
mom and your dad are fighting with each other you're
a third party but then you're sucked in they suck
you in you know your dad tells you you should
be taking his side and your mom tells you you
should be taking her side and then they you know
they get mad at you when you take the other
person's side in the argument that sucks you in and
then you get biased and as you're getting sucked into
it you're failing to go meta enough to really see
what's going on and to appreciate it also as you're
getting sucked in i want you to actually like introspect
and feel yourself getting sucked in see my episode developing
introspection this is where that skill comes in you feel
yourself getting sucked into this conflict maybe you're watching a
conflict on the news maybe you're watching a debate online
you're getting sucked in feel that notice that and contemplate
why you're getting sucked in and notice that it's difficult
to stay meta in that situation also notice how other
people are getting sucked in and how easily and quickly
everybody is taking sides and getting sucked into the conflict
since you're watching my work and you understand the notion
of going meta and you're more conscious than the average
person you are less likely to get sucked in as
quickly and as easily as others around you but still
you're gonna notice yourself getting sucked in but you're gonna
see others getting sucked in so rapidly and so unconsciously
that they don't even understand they're getting sucked in but
you since you're doing this work and you're you're noticing
things you're being mindful you're being introspective you're gonna notice
yourself getting sucked in and then also you're gonna get
to a point where you're going to stop yourself from
getting sucked into a conflict so i want you to
reach that point where like the first step is that
you just you allow yourself to get sucked in but
you observe it observe it observe it observe it and
observe the consequences of getting sucked in eventually you'll start
to see that it's foolish to get stuck into these
conflicts and then one day you'll see a conflict happening
everybody else gets sucked in but you will remain meta
and neutral and you'll notice that other actually other people
will start to attack you they don't like when you
stay neutral and meta and when you try to help
them to understand the conflict they don't want help understanding
the conflict they want to win the war they're bloodthirsty
they want to fight and of course this is exactly
what perpetuates conflict and this is why conflict de-escalation is
so difficult so i really want you to see the
microcosm of a macrocosm of this notice this happening between
individuals like at your office or within your family these
sorts of conflicts and how this occurs and how hard
it is to get them to de-escalate like maybe maybe
your brother is fighting with your mother and you're trying
to de-escalate as you're trying to de-escalate they both start
attacking you so you've experienced this right um and and
then i want you to to take the lessons from
that and apply it to the larger macrocosm of how
this works between nations and between empires and coalitions or
between two companies or between two religions or even between
like two animals that are fighting with each other good
luck you know if two animals are really going at
it good luck getting them to calm down and de-escalate
so that's your homework right this is observation you got
to do observation you gotta do introspection and just kind
of like really work with this over the next like
year really observe conflict all around you work with this
ask questions try to prevent yourself from getting sucked in
just see how all this works this is where you're
you're really going to learn and grow from this work
if all you do is you just listen to this
episode and you don't do any of this observation work
it's going to be in one ear out the other
you're not going to gain much from this just from
listening to me see i'm sharing with you conclusions of
years of observing conflict and thinking about it contemplating it
and trying to find the profound aspects of it drawing
interconnections be different kinds of conflict and i'm not done
with that work i'm still doing it right like i'm
watching the news i'm seeing what's going on between russia
and ukraine for example i'm seeing western media versus putin
media i'm seeing how you know they're blaming each other
and fighting with each other and all this demonizing each
other and i'm observing that and i'm i'm thinking about
like what is really going on here and i'm really
careful not to take sides in it but really to
kind of see both perspectives and stay meta on the
issue with the hope that by staying meta i will
learn something deeper about myself and mankind and society and
countries and then ultimately consciousness and reality and love and
god and all this so this is a practice that
you do otherwise you don't gain the benefits all right
so you might wonder well how do we reduce conflict
are there you know what are the principles of conflict
reduction so i've contemplated this pretty deeply and i've come
up with a pretty good list for you so here's
the list take notes and then contemplate for yourself see
if you agree with me keep adding to the list
if if you find other points i'm sure there's other
ones it's not a total list but this is a
good place to get started so we reduce conflict by
first of all creating harmony and coherence that's really what
we're talking about how to create harmony and coherence that's
the problem that's a big topic i could i could
just talk about that for hours um this notion of
coherence is something i'm going to talk about in the
future there's this there's this powerful idea called game a
versus game b uh it's a bit jargony but we're
gonna i'm gonna have a whole episode on that in
the future um basically game a is sort of a
rivalries dynamic where where two sides are fighting with each
other sort of like classic game theory and then game
b is how do you create harmony and coherence cooperative
relationships um we'll talk about that later i don't have
time to get into that here but basically creating coherence
the next point is by understanding why conflict exists so
we've done a lot of that work here right so
everything hinges on proper understanding this is why all of
my work is about helping you to understand things at
a deep level because the idea is that if you
can understand a thing at a deep level like if
you understand war at a deep level it's going to
help you to then resolve it and to avoid the
worst aspects of it so we've done a lot of
that work here in this episode the next way we
reduce conflict after we understand its existential origins is by
simply raising our consciousness becoming more conscious and all the
practices that help with that spiritual practices meditation practices yoga
practices psychedelic practices that sort of stuff the next way
we reduce conflict is by a deep study of selfishness
devilry self bias ego and survival i've got you covered
there i have episodes on all of those topics go
see my episodes on every single one of those topics
it'll really help you with reducing conflict because if you
don't understand those dynamics also i would add in there
see my episode about my three-part episode about self-deception so
if you don't understand how devil reworks how self-bias works
how ego works how survival works how self-deception works there's
no chance that you're gonna be able to reduce conflict
effectively the next step is by understanding the survival agenda
of others you got to start to understand your survival
agenda and then other beings and parties survival agendas not
just individual ones but also collective ones you have to
understand the survival agenda of ukraine this rival agenda of
america the survival agenda of nato the survival agenda of
russia the survival agenda of putin these are all different
survival agendas that are conflicting with each other you know
even something like putin's survival agenda is not identical to
russia's survival agenda there's overlap there's significant overlap but they're
not identical likewise like you know the survival agenda of
the president of the united states is not the same
thing as a survival agenda of the united states these
are separate survival agendas although there's a lot of overlap
there as well um the next way to reduce conflict
is seeing multiple perspectives i've talked about this a lot
we've been stressing i've been stressing in this work the
importance of multi-perspectivalism the understanding of relativism of relativity i
have a whole episode about that go check that out
i'll have more episodes about relativity in the future another
way to reduce conflict is by creating abundance and reducing
neediness the more needy somebody is the more threatened they
feel the more likely there will be conflict when there's
an abundance of resources there's very little need for conflict
if there's way too much food way too much water
way too many diamonds way too much gold way too
many animals like way too much land what conflict is
there's not going to be a conflict the conflict is
when there's not enough of these things another way to
reduce conflict is to get your survival needs met don't
be thirsty you personally right take responsibility for meeting your
survival needs because nobody else is going to do it
for you pretty much once you're an adult you know
as a kid your parents help you but once you're
an adult no one's gonna do it for you and
if you don't do it you're gonna be needy and
thirsty and then you're gonna get sucked into conflicts more
easily if you're desperate for for food for water for
shelter for sex for love for approval it's like having
your hand in a fire when your hand is in
a fire you can't contemplate or care about the fire
all you care about is is getting yourself out of
the pain you don't care about the source of the
fire how to put out the fire all you care
about is getting your hand out of the fire and
coping with the pain and that's what most people are
doing in life is that they're just coping with the
suffering and pain of life so much so that they
can't even even be bothered to sit through a couple
of hours of of this sort of philosophy talk because
to them this doesn't immediately resolve their pain and suffering
i understand that but at the same time that doesn't
help the world to you know end conflict that actually
furthers the conflict understanding is crucial to reducing conflict a
lot of conflict simply comes from just misunderstanding the other
side and not even caring to understand the other side
because you're in such deep pain that you don't even
give a [ __ ] about understanding or the other
side you just want yours you want what you want
another way to reduce conflict is by transcending survival and
going beyond materialism connecting with the spirit connecting with spirit
connecting with being you might notice that when you're on
psychedelics and you're connected to being into spirit you don't
even care about suffering and pain anymore you don't care
about money anymore you don't care about sex anymore um
you're beyond it all because you're so connected to spirit
into being and to god the other way to reduce
conflict is selflessness ultimately that's what it takes conflict comes
from selfishness reducing it requires selflessness that's why it's so
difficult to reduce conflict and why conflict is so prevalent
is because we're all so selfish reducing selfishness means seeing
yourself in other treating other and self equally rather than
treating yourself as better than others and being willing to
take a hit on your own survival surrendering your own
selfish agenda transcending your own greed fear attachment and craving
this is crucial for reducing conflict another way is by
expanding your sense of identity the more limited your identity
is we've talked about this in the past the lower
your consciousness is the more selfish you are the more
you're going to cling to it but as you do
spiritual work your identity expands to include more and more
until your identity becomes infinite and the closer you reach
to an infinite identity the more god-like you become the
more selfless you become and the less conflict you're gonna
want and the easier it is for you to stay
out of conflict another aspect of this is is doing
shadow work if you don't do shadow work you don't
integrate your shadow you're going to be fighting with your
shadow another way to reduce conflict is holism thinking in
more holistic ways see my episodes about called um holism
and holistic thinking part one and part two that explains
that the importance of holism remember holism is health you
can't have health without holism another way to reduce conflict
is conscious communication clear conscious communication honest communication is such
a crucial um aspect of of healthy human living i'm
gonna have a whole episode about that in the future
stay tuned um an aspect of that conscious communication is
setting clear boundaries and communicating your boundaries first you have
to define your boundaries for yourself based on your values
and what you want and then you have to communicate
those to others and then you have to enforce those
boundaries so that whole set i'll have an episode in
the future about setting boundaries and forcing boundaries big topic
for relationships uh another way to reduce conflict is by
transcending dualistic morality this is huge most religions have this
dualistic morality thing going on which makes you very judgmental
by becoming judgmental a lot of conflict is created so
dropping morality realizing the relativity of all morality and moral
systems uh dropping all judgment i have episodes talking about
how to drop judgment um and letting go of blaming
blaming others this is a huge aspect of all conflicts
every conflict is about blaming the other and casting yourself
as a victim and to not cast yourself as a
victim requires that you take responsibility so extraordinary responsibility taking
is necessary to reduce conflict and people usually hate responsibility
taking instead they like to blame somebody else and because
of this this perpetuates more conflict the next thing you
can do to reduce conflict is seeing good in others
and not demonizing them you want to develop this capacity
i might have a whole separate episode on this because
it's such an important topic but like the ability to
look at somebody and to see the good in them
beyond even what they are able to see in themselves
usually people are very selfish and they think of themselves
as being better than they really are but it's possible
to have a way of looking at somebody that you
see them better even than they see themselves like it's
almost like god looking within you and seeing the goodness
within your own heart that you yourself don't even yet
realize is there that's a profound ability and if you
want to be a leader if you want to be
really good high consciousness leader you want to develop this
ability is to see the good in others that they
don't even yet see that in themselves because they doubt
themselves and you know their true potential you know their
true identity you know the heart i mean the the
love in their heart that is that can be brought
forth if they do the work on themselves that of
course they don't want to do that they fear doing
and then you guide them into doing that work that's
powerful that reduces conflict forgiveness and mercy reduce conflict i
have a whole episode about how to forgive people go
check that out mercy is a quality of god that
religions talk about forgiveness is the quality of god as
well another way to reduce conflict is with empathy and
genuine care for the other so practicing being more empathetic
usually in a conflict the opposite happens for example when
soldiers go to war they so demonize the other side
and they deliberately have methods that they kind of like
mental tricks they play on themselves to shut off their
empathy because otherwise it would be too big of a
conflict in their psyche you can't shoot somebody in the
face when you have empathy for them another important aspect
of reducing conflict is radical open-mindedness i have episodes about
that open-mindedness is so important because close the more close-minded
you are the more conflict you get into because you
simply can't understand the relativistic perspectival differences between different people
you're so locked into your own perspective that and your
mind is so shut down from exploring other perspectives that
you just can't you can't understand and make sense of
other people and the world from a closed-minded position that's
why that's so important speaking of perspectives the next step
for reducing conflict is exploring many different perspectives the more
perspectives you explore the less conflict you're generally going to
get into the more you appreciate perspectival differences the less
conflict you'll create the next way to reduce conflict is
epistemic humility basically admitting not knowing admitting when you don't
know a lot of conflict comes from the arrogance of
thinking you know more than you really do religious conflict
political conflict and so on comes from this kind of
lack of epistemic humility even conflict within science and academia
a lot of it comes from lack of epistemic humility
very importantly to reduce conflict you need to be willing
to admit you're wrong when you're wrong because if you
get stubborn and you refuse to admit your wrong your
wrongness or your mistakes well the other side is going
to know you're wrong and they're going to fight you
to get you to admit that you were wrong and
then you're going to play the game of denying you
wrong and that's going to create a whole battle right
there another way to reduce conflict is by being non-ideological
i've talked about that in my episode called how ideology
works go check that out non-ideology not being non-ideological is
so important another way to reduce conflict this is huge
is education and improving the quality of our education system
education needs to incorporate things like epistemology metaphysics mindfulness contemplation
direct experience spirituality psychedelics other things i've talked about i'm
gonna have a whole series of episodes in the future
that talk about problems within our education system and how
to improve our education systems and what's what's missing there
we have a very poor education system our education system
right now is still in the dark ages so no
wonder there's so much conflict in the world you can't
have a reduction in conflict fundamentally without improving our education
system that's so important another way to reduce conflict is
a commitment to truth and integrity a lot of conflict
actually stems directly from falsehood and a lack of integrity
corruption go see my episodes about integrity see my episode
about corruption another way to reduce conflict very practically is
to eliminate the urge within yourself to cheat steal or
look for shortcuts in life a lot of conflict comes
from this and a corollary to this point is develop
a willingness to work hard lazy people people who do
not have a work ethic people who just want to
mooch and slide by in life who want to just
leech off of others these people get themselves into a
lot of conflict a lot of conflict simply comes from
people not wanting to do hard work for example a
nation who doesn't want to actually build and be creative
on their own they just want to invade some other
nation or some other tribe nearby let's say tribe is
better than nation right like in the old days if
a tribe wanted to get wealthy it could either invest
years building up its infrastructure building houses building you know
fishing boats um developing infrastructure and so forth farms and
stuff like that weaving baskets creating art or they could
just go raid a neighboring tribe invade them uh you
know kill all their men take all their women and
uh you know uh annex the tribe steal all their
buildings and artifacts all their boats and baskets and art
and then take it as their own and what why
do they do it this way because it's actually easier
than building it all yourself it's more energy efficient so
so don't be that guy right actually be willing to
work for for the things you want in life that's
super important another way to reduce conflict is mindfulness over
your emotions when you get very emotional especially in a
negative way anger jealousy hatred fear these core emotions um
[Music] they drive you crazy they put you into a
low consciousness state from which then you create a lot
of conflict a lot of conflict is created out of
anger and fear basically another way to reduce conflict is
learning to let things go just the practice of letting
go i have a whole episode about the power of
letting go learning to let go of emotions learning to
let go of fear and anger learning to let go
of grudges learning to let go of just bad [
__ ] that happened to you that's huge because if
you can't let a thing go then you're gonna want
revenge you're gonna want justice and so forth speaking of
letting go another point here is letting go of control
and manipulation we all have the desire to control and
manipulate reality so much and spirituality teaches you to let
that go the less you try to control and manipulate
reality the more you flow with it the more organic
your life becomes the less conflict there is in your
life a lot of conflict comes from like over manipulation
you try to manipulate your spouse you try to manipulate
your children you have to manipulate your family try to
manipulate your boss your co-workers you try to manipulate some
other country in the world like it's just like so
much manipulation and then it all backfires on you another
huge point for reducing conflict is look look at this
respect for other simply respecting the person or party that
you're dealing with is in a certain sense a prerequisite
for any sort of piece or conflict de-escalation because if
you don't respect another country if you don't respect another
company if you don't respect another religion if you don't
respect other person how can you possibly um you know
try to understand their perspective and care about them and
be empathetic like you can't do these things so a
lot of con conflict comes with disrespect a disrespectful attitude
and that's actually something that i want to personally work
on a lot more in the future is just um
i've been noticing myself not being respectful enough of others
sort of um too arrogant and i've been noticing the
the bad karma this brings and i've been noticing how
untenable it is so in the future i'm going to
work on correcting that i'll probably have a whole episode
in the future about respect because it's a pretty important
topic another point here is to reduce conflict you need
to have concern for fairness equality and the suffering of
others that's huge fixing systemic inequalities within society is huge
if you don't care about the fair and equal distribution
of resources then you're going to create a lot of
conflict it's sort of like imagine if you go to
a birthday party and there's a cake and they cut
the cake into 20 pieces and you take 19 of
the pieces and eat them leaving only one piece for
everybody else at the party and while you're doing that
at the same time you have no concern whatev whatsoever
about the fact that you ate the majority of the
cake like you just don't care for from your point
of view you just want as many pieces as you
can get into your stomach right like you see how
this will create a lot of conflict yet this is
the attitude that a lot of business people take in
the world a lot of nations take this sort of
attitude does that mean fundamentally it's just selfishness and an
obsession with material acquisition so this needs to stop in
order for us to reduce conflict there needs to be
a much fair distribution of resources across the whole world
to reduce conflict and war and you have to care
about reducing income inequality that's one of the biggest sources
of conflict in american politics for example is that we
have uh uh really terrible income inequality in america uh
a bad gene it's called there's actually a measure of
income inequality for countries it's called the genie coefficient you
can look it up for different countries um the worse
the genie coefficient is the more problems that cause for
for a society there's been studies done on this you
can look those up but basically we need to improve
the genie coefficient in in america but also really around
the whole world and see you have to have a
holistic concern you can't just care about america only or
your own country because the problem is that okay if
you only like if you're an american you only care
about america fine you're going to reduce conflict within america
but you're not going to solve the conflict outside of
america and then america will go to war with other
countries you see so if you want america is not
going to work out a country you got to start
having a holistic view of the whole world and not
just care about reducing the conflicts or the like the
income inequality within america a lot of people sort of
care about reducing income inequality within america but not around
the world which of course a lot of the reduction
of income inequality within america can be done at the
expense of third world countries that would be a problem
because even though america will equalize and everybody in america
let's say we'll be driving a fancy car and living
in a fancy house but then the rest of the
world will be living in poverty and that itself will
create new conflict a new war america will rightly be
hated by those third world countries another way to reduce
conflict is through unification but a very specific kind of
unification right the problem with unification is that it can
be oppressive this is sort of like what china is
doing with hong kong or what what russia is doing
with ukraine is that they're trying to unify and that
in itself is a is proper and noble to want
to unify people however as we've talked about in my
episode about whole lawns and uh holism and hosting thinking
is that remember when you're unifying these hold hollands you
can't just do balls to the wall unification with a
disrespect of the autonomy of the sub-hole ons in the
holarchy right you have to have a concern for maintaining
the autonomy of the subholons and this is what fundamentally
you know uh the china taiwan and hong kong situation
is getting wrong and the russia ukraine thing is getting
wrong is that like russia is trying to dominate ukraine
through physical force and with no respect to its autonomy
and so in this sense fundamentally is a failure right
it's not going to hold for something to hold and
to be at peace and to be in harmony there
needs to be respect for autonomy at the lower levels
of the hierarchy as well uh you can't just it
can't just be a top down domination there has to
be a a flow of balance between um orders coming
from the top down but then all but then the
top has to be also sensitive to or to the
needs coming up from the grassroots so to speak so
like a tyrant trying to dominate his people is not
sustainable because he needs to be sensitive a leader needs
to be sensitive to the needs of the people and
then to modify his actions to accommodate their needs and
then it's a sustainable situation because then the leader is
served it's not just dominating the people but it's serving
their needs and the people love the leader so this
is what's you know there are two different types of
unification they're sort of like a uh the benevolent unification
that i'm just talking about here that respects the sub-holons
and then there's a domineering unification which is that you
just try to like bash somebody into becoming your slave
or your vassal and that doesn't work so well that
backfires that creates bad karma so strong arming people and
extorting and blackmailing people into unifying with you this doesn't
work right you can't create a good marriage by telling
a girl to sleep with you and to marry you
at the point of a gun that's not going to
be a good marriage now you might even be able
to get her to marry you because she's so terrified
she'll marry you she might even have sex with you
for a while at the point of a gun but
it's not gonna last see to get a good marriage
going you have to you have to she has to
want to be part of this dynamic then there's harmony
and then two final ways for reducing conflict which are
kind of like very profound existential one is by experiencing
deep suffering yourself and the second is by experiencing deep
love yourself as you suffer very deeply and as you
experience love very deeply this is what transforms you into
wanting to be a more loving person being more empathetic
and caring about the suffering of others and in so
doing then you have the motivation to want to reduce
conflict um but it's it's very tricky because it's possible
to experience deep suffering in an unconscious way that actually
leads to the creation of more conflict in fact this
is a lot of what sources conflict around the world
like for example you kill one of my family members
like you kill a child of mine i suffer for
it in unconscious way then i want revenge and i
go kill one of your children and then we have
like a blood feud going back and forth this is
classic uh especially in tribal cultures this is classic uh
cultures where there's not a legal system this is how
they resolve their disputes just by you know killing family
members for generations um to get revenge on each other
to the point where they don't even remember who started
the blood feud so so this this kind of suffering
actually increases conflict does not decrease conflict the kind of
suffering that decreases conflict is when you suffer mindfully within
a sort of a spiritual context where you you put
the suffering into a proper context you don't blame somebody
else for it you don't demonize somebody else you don't
lash out at somebody else but you you really feel
the conflict you suffer through it and you put it
into a larger context you understand where the suffering is
coming from in that case there that will reduce conflict
and then of course just experiencing deep love for yourself
i like to say that [Music] the second greatest teacher
in the world is suffering and the greatest teacher is
love nothing will teach you deeper than suffering other than
love but it needs to be a very deep love
and also a conscious love because you can love unconsciously
and that also doesn't work so i mean it all
hinges on consciousness of course as you should expect but
now so that's the list of ways to reduce conflict
feel free to add to that list it's a pretty
solid list if you can do all those things you're
going to be a very peaceful person i guarantee you
but the problem of course as you can see is
that all those things are so difficult to do this
is the last thing that anybody wants to do is
work on all this this whole list it's so difficult
but also remember that even if you do all that
and you execute on this list perfectly there'll still be
conflict first of all because most other people will not
do it because it's so difficult to do but also
even even in your own life there will be conflicts
still even if you're an awakened person if even if
you're the buddha you're still going to have conflict again
first of all because the most people you're going to
be dealing with are not going to be buddhist yourself
but even if all the people you dealt with were
buddhas like you let's say uh there would still be
conflict why because you're you're a you're a finite you're
in a finite body you're in a finite world as
long as there's forms there's going to be conflict we
talked about this if you want complete peace then what
you're talking about is uh ending all form you have
to exist as the godhead that's the only place where
there will be no conflict whatsoever and then at that
point life is over the universe is over the universe
doesn't exist reality doesn't nothing exists except just infinity pure
infinity as emptiness and nothingness that exists and that is
completely peaceful but there's nothing there and uh i mean
you would call that death um here's an another little
wrinkle to all this is that if you want to
reduce conflict it's important that you stop hating conflict because
the hating of conflict creates more conflict so there's a
counterintuitive move here is that you got to start to
love conflict accept it as part of the infinite self
that you are stop thinking that conflict should never happen
this is a mistake this is too naive is conflict
bad no conflict is existentially inevitable it is a part
of absolute unity it is a part of infinity as
a part of god as a part of love but
at the same time even though i say this you
know love conflict that doesn't mean that you should that
this is a justification or a license for selfishness i'm
not giving you license to go start a bunch of
conflicts here because the ego would love that you know
some dictator would love to say that you know i'm
conquering you because i love you of course that's what
a dictator thinks so you need to drop the idea
that conflict is bad and yet at the same time
you want to um not engage in conflict where you
can avoid it a lot of conflict is avoidable so
you sort of make a distinction between conflicts which are
just absolutely unavoidable and then most conflicts which are avoidable
most human conflicts are avoidable so that's what you want
to take care of and the conflicts which are not
avoidable well then you can't do anything about that you
know like for example a conflict that is not avoidable
as a human is that you got to eat so
you're going to be killing something to eat whether it's
going to be a plant or an animal you've got
to kill something to eat you can't avoid that now
but you can reduce conflict over what you eat and
how you eat for example you know if you were
a cannibal that would create a lot of conflict for
you um you know there's quite a bit of conflict
that also comes with eating animals there's less conflict with
eating plants so in that sense you know make yourself
a vegan if you can handle that diet then that
will reduce conflict that won't eliminate conflict it'll just reduce
it and hey reducing conflict is still good we don't
need to be perfectionistic here you're not again you're not
going to eliminate all conflict you want to limit out
conflict then you gotta die so that's not gonna work
uh i mean it'll work but you don't want that
um and i'm not recommending that but um you know
short of short of death uh is good to to
move towards reducing conflict now i want to make some
points about um spiral dynamic stage green here because spider-dynamic
stage green go see my episode called spider-dynamic stage green
if you don't know what that means uh tends to
be kind of naive about conflict in the following ways
green tends to value peace at all costs green tends
to see war and violence as evil which is not
correct green tends to believe that a state of peace
can be reached and green basically tends to be too
idealist and utopian uh green tends to uh uh to
under appreciate how brutal life can be green tends to
not see that love doesn't just include hugs and kisses
but war rape exploitation slavery racism and so on and
so in general green tends to swing its pendulum more
towards pacifism and pacifism is just too naive of a
way of of thinking about how how the world really
works and how to navigate survival in the world so
another set of action steps for you is i want
you to start to study how conflict arises in your
own life at the micro level for example you have
disputes on a regular basis with your spouse girlfriend or
boyfriend disputes with with family members disputes with your children
disputes on online forums um disputes over which restaurant to
go to even disputes within your own mind with yourself
so observe all these and study these carefully notice why
these conflicts occur contemplate how you can reduce these conflicts
in your life and as you actually try to reduce
those conflicts in your own personal life you're also going
to learn principles many of the principles i mentioned above
you're going to learn those as universal principles for reducing
conflict everywhere not just individually but collectively and then you'll
be able to teach and help others to do the
same thing and if you can't do it in your
own life you're not going to be able to really
help others do it as well so in conclusion as
we wrap up here why does understanding war and conflict
matter why is this more than just philosophy because how
can you be at peace when you haven't made peace
with war war and conflict is an integral part of
reality and of humanity and yet most people don't understand
it they're flummoxed by it they have misconceptions about it
and in so doing they add to the conflict you
see so fundamentally if you don't understand conflict you're going
to create more conflict that's the point that's why it's
important that's why it's practical and not just mental masturbation
everything starts with proper understanding and you'd be surprised at
how rare proper understanding is all right so we're done
with part one stay tuned for part two part two
is actually going to be more practical here we covered
sort of the philosophy and a lot of like metaphysical
spiritual mumbo jumbo in part two it's going to be
very more practical it's going to be more of a
historical more of a human look at how conflict and
war between societies evolved and why and sort of the
trickeries of how it really works we're going to look
at arms races we're going to look at social evolution
um from a historical perspective i'm going to give you
a lot of quotes and from from a great book
that i've read on this topic and also in the
future i'll probably have a separate episode about game a
versus game b stay tuned for that and the final
idea i'll leave you with is that i started off
this episode with a quote from a native american chief
seattle after whom the city of seattle was named the
quote was that day and night cannot dwell together right
makes sense on a certain level but also what i
want you to see is the paradox here is that
of course on the one hand day and night cannot
dwell together but they do you see day and night
do dwell together they dwell together within reality so there's
that overarching unity that i want you to always keep
in mind everything that's on at conflict everything that's at
war with itself everything that seems like it can't coexist
ultimately it does co-exist and it's unified by a higher
order and that higher order is reality or god or
infinity or consciousness so never forget that you
