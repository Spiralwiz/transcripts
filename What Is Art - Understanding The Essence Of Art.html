hey leo here for actualised org and in this episode
I'm going to talk about what is art [Music] you
I don't know about you but I'm a pretty big
fan of art after all what is everything in our
culture from entertainment and books and movies and all videogames
and all this sort of stuff what is all that
but art so it's interesting to look at this question
of what art is both from the perspective of someone
who consumes art and also from someone who creates art
because one of the greatest enjoyment filled out of life
is to create something beautiful but especially over the last
year or so as my understanding of reality has deepened
as I've been doing consciousness work as I've had various
mystical experiences that has changed my perspective about what art
is and I want to share that with you here
so it's a much more profound way of looking at
art what is the essence of art where does art
come from why does art exist what makes for really
good art these are all good questions to ask whether
you're an artist or just a consumer the first thing
we need to realize is that art is completely relative
a lot of people get into these debates about well
is this thing here art or what about this thing
here that's this is a better higher form of art
than this form of art quite obviously from an existential
perspective this is nonsense all arts are completely relative there
are no hard and fast categories for what is beautiful
or what is ugly this depends on many factors from
your physiology to your psychology to your environment to your
education level to your culture to how you were brought
up and even to the species that you are a
part of because think about this art really exists only
for human beings on this planet art does not exist
for ants art does not exist for birds and it
doesn't even exist for most higher mammals that we know
of so it's a relative thing it's very much dependent
on your physiology and how your brain works so for
humans because we're very social species and we've developed the
ability to conceptualize and to symbolize reality that opens up
this domain called art but what really is art and
where does it really come from well the first thing
we have to see is we have to see that
art has a lot to do with meaning and significance
and attaching that to reality so some parts of reality
we find beautiful and meaningful other parts of course relatively
speaking are not as beautiful or is not as meaningful
and therefore we tend to cherry-pick the beautiful and the
most meaningful ones and then to display those as art
but of course that whole process really is the process
of projection you don't actually find meaning or significance in
reality itself you project that onto it using your complicated
sophisticated brain machinery that's what you do now what it
means to say that art is completely relative is that
ultimately no two beings have to agree on what is
beautiful or what constitutes art so another way to put
it is we could say that everything is art or
we could say that nothing is art and then you
can make finer distinctions for yourself based upon your personal
preferences and your biology and your physiology and your psychology
and all your environment and your culture all of that
is going to strongly influence what you consider as art
or not example of this would be if you take
some some guy who's a very avant-garde artist maybe his
idea of art would be walking down the sidewalk seeing
a dead bird and then getting that dead bird scooping
it up gluing it to a poster board and then
displaying that in a museum or in his art gallery
and of course most of us would look at that
and we would say well that guy's clearly just being
a douche he's just trying to be some edgy avant-garde
artist he's not really doing art and the way we
would back that up as we would say well the
reason he's not doing art is because hey take a
thousand people off the street let's put them in a
survey room let's pull them and ask them some questions
let's show them a painting of the Mona Lisa and
ask them is this art is this good art and
of course 99% of them will say yes of course
that's art and yeah that's pretty good art but if
we take this poster board of a dead bird that
this guy made and we show that to them not
only will they not say that it's good art they
won't even say that it's art in 99% of cases
so that's a counter-argument to what I'm saying and people
could cite that counter-argument as evidence that art is actually
not relative but that there are objective standards for good
art now how do we deal with this well of
course this doesn't tell us really anything it doesn't it
doesn't remove the relativity of art because like I said
art is relative to your species your culture and your
era so a lot of people ignore these when they
think about objective standards to them they call something an
objective and absolute standard even though it's completely relative to
their species which they completely ignore they don't even think
about possibilities of other species like maybe some alien race
might have a completely different notion of art and beauty
than the human race does and that for many own
creatures for most creatures on this planet art doesn't even
exist so clearly it has to be created it has
to be constructed by the mind but then of course
they also discount culture and anything that well all cultures
basically consider the same stuff beautiful no it varies it
can vary quite a bit there are some similarities because
our species is the same so the species is the
bigger factor but then cultures are still very important big
factor that sets these standards and then of course the
time you're living in is also a huge factor so
even though your culture might still be the same let's
say you're living in Greece or you're living in Europe
you know Europe has many thousands of years of history
but their culture has changed a lot and what they
consider beautiful today is varied from what they considered beautiful
500 years ago or 2,000 years ago or before that
or what they will consider beautiful in 10,000 years should
have this planet survived that long just try to imagine
how different our standards of art will be ten thousand
years from now it's virtually unimaginable given how technology is
playing into it and how that's shaping our culture and
everything is always changing everything is always evolving so you
might say well Lea but this example with the dead
bird it's a very silly example clearly that's not art
but see what I'm saying here is that there's a
deeper level at which you can look at art don't
look at art just as something at human being constructs
look at art as becoming conscious of the innate creativity
and beauty of all of reality so with this example
of a dead bird you might say of course it's
not art but on another level you can see how
it could be art because one person walking down a
sidewalk sees a dead bird and there are reactions just
discussed and they say you a dead bird and they
try to run away from it as quickly as they
can for another person they walk down the street for
a more conscious person he sees that bird but to
him that bird has some kind of meaning or significance
which of course he's projecting onto it but he sees
in that bird maybe the cycle of life and maybe
it reminds him of his own death and when he
sees the little bugs and ants eating the carcass of
that dead bird it's rotting away he thinks about the
interconnectedness of all life and how those ants are now
going to go take that food back to their colony
and they're all going to create more baby ants and
so the cycle perpetuates and that dead bird might elicit
various emotions in him sadness or compassion or a feeling
of love or a feeling of fear of maybe his
own death or maybe it'll remind him of something he
did when he was younger maybe he used to hunt
birds when he was a kid and that made him
feel sad for killing these birds and now that memory
is triggered in him and so it stirs up some
emotion him and really that dead bird on the sidewalk
could make this guy cry and for him it can
be a very beautiful experience so see it all depends
on the context that you're putting it into and what
kind of meeting and significance you're projecting on to the
situation now of course it's true that most people just
walk by and they will just ignore this bird and
they would never call it a work of art but
that's where consciousness comes in see most people aren't very
conscious so for them what they find beautiful or artistic
is very very limited probably less than 1% of all
of reality to them is beautiful and meaningful and they
can see the artistry in it and the rest of
it they just dismiss as mundane ordinary reality nothing too
remarkable but the more your consciousness Rises the more you're
able to see the beauty of everything all around you
not just the beauty in a painting on a wall
in a museum but on your drive over to the
museum you see the beauty of the trees you see
the beauty of the construction of the road of the
buildings of your car of the design of your phone
of the people you're interacting with as you're walking into
the museum you're seeing the infinite beauty of all of
that and that can have a deeply moving effect on
you but that requires high levels of consciousness which few
people develop so what is the purpose of art really
if you want to get to the to the rock
bottom of it in its essence the purpose of art
is to delight in infinite creation this right here that
you're experiencing all around you right now is infinite creation
creation by I mean creation with a capital C I
mean reality as a whole infinite creation that's what this
is and this thing is infinitely beautiful it's so beautiful
and so awesome that your mind actually has to block
that off in order to maintain going through and just
living ordinary life if you actually saw the infinite beauty
of all of creation all at once you could not
live your ordinary life you couldn't go take a crap
you couldn't go eat your dinner you couldn't go to
work because you would be in tears on your knees
crying at the beauty of all of reality so what
consciousness has to do what your brain had to evolve
is it had to evolve a very pragmatic sort of
mind state the ordinary level of consciousness that you're at
it's so constricted it's really designed to just make you
a little slave robot who wakes up on time goes
to work and just fulfills the duties of life and
reproduction and self survival so the purpose of art then
is to actually widen your scope and to see the
beauty of infinite creation and there's two ways in which
this happens one is art highlights various facets of reality
that people find beautiful and even though all of reality
is equally beautiful there's no facet of reality which is
more beautiful than the other from from God's perspective so
to speak objectively speaking but of course from our own
individual perspectives we all have preferences about what strikes an
emotional chord within us and art is very much an
emotional type of game it's all about what moves you
emotionally so for one person he's moved by a certain
type of movie a drama another person is moved by
a comedy another person is not moved by movies at
all they're moved by poetry and somebody else is moved
by a performance art or ballet or whatever and so
there you have the proliferation of all the different media's
through which facets of reality can be highlighted so see
I can take some facet of reality that just strikes
me with awe whatever that is maybe it's a leaf
a tree or a certain color that I could paint
with a paintbrush or a certain animal that I can
go photograph or shoot a video documentary of and make
some sort of Discovery Channel National Geographic type of beautiful
documentary whatever it is I can I can find some
aspect of reality that really moves me and then I
can try to capture it and then highlight it sort
of put it on a pedestal glorify it for other
human beings to see and also for myself to just
kind of like have it on my display case so
that's one way in which art functions is this this
highlighting of facets of reality of course to do that
you first have to see those facets yourself if you
can't see it then how are you going to highlight
it and then of course the process of highlighting that
could be a quite involved process it could be something
as simple as just plucking a flower from a flower
bed and then putting it into a vaz and then
just displaying it on a table it could be as
simple as that or it could be very involved where
you see some beautiful animal but then you want to
actually paint it to paint this beautiful animal to really
highlight its beauty now you don't want to depict it
in a photorealistic way you want to depict those aspects
of the animal that are really interesting to you so
maybe you like the ferocity of the lie and that's
something that you're fascinated by the fur ah the ferocity
of lions as they hunt and so you wanted to
pick that in your painting and so now you have
to go study learn technical skills and then you have
to make some new connections about how do I abstract
that ferocity and depict it on this canvas and it
might not look like a line at all that ferocity
it might be completely abstract work of art most people
look at it they don't even see a lion there
but still they get a certain kind of residue the
essence you've captured the essence of it and they get
that sort of Farhat ferocity in the splashes of paint
on the canvas and in that way what you did
is you highlighted these facets of reality the second element
is playing God yourself that's what art is really about
if you're creating art and by God I mean infinite
creation I mean reality itself reality itself all around us
is constantly in a process of creation it never stops
creating creation not something that happened 5,000 years ago like
they say in the Bible creation is happening right this
second right now everything is being constantly created and this
has been going on for eternity and it will keep
going on for eternity and it's infinite so we've got
this infinite fractal expanding and and producing more forms out
of formlessness form arises and this just is a constant
process and this process though is not a random process
the way that scientists like to think and in fact
it really is the process of evolution see inside so
we got the third limited notion of evolution we have
the notion of evolution as happening through genes and genetics
that is not really what evolution is about evolution is
a much broader force which is something I'll talk about
in a future episode but really at the heart of
evolution is a creative force a very subtle and we
still haven't figured out what it is exactly a subtle
creative force is there it's not randomness and this evolution
is not just happening at the level of genes it's
happening at the level of everything everything is involving have
you noticed this not only creatures as Darwin said but
planets star systems reality as a whole human societies different
works of art and mediums of art evolved culture evolves
belief systems of all religions evolve economies evolve technology evolves
you evolve personally throughout your life so this is the
process that just doesn't stop because fundamentally what it is
is it's a creative process new insights and combinations are
happening which lead to new forms being created and that's
fundamentally what all creation is all of existence is this
is just constant process of form coming out of formlessness
through spontaneous and sight not through randomness not through blind
luck it's hard to articulate exactly what's there you need
to have some mystical experiences to really appreciate this but
what you see when you have mystical experiences you start
to see that the fabric of reality itself namely nothingness
is highly intelligent there's a deep intelligence there and that
in fact it's not you as a human individual being
who is intelligent that intelligence that you ascribe to yourself
or that we as a species ascribe to ourselves actually
that's just a tiny tiny tiny little hair a little
filament of universal intelligence that's at work and it's not
distinct or separate from that it is part of that
it's just that your universal intelligence is just happening on
an infinitely more massive scale because it involves all species
all ecological systems entire planets and other solar since it's
all happening simultaneously together so there's a very sort of
holistic perspective that you're not really going to find in
the sciences because this requires a lot of consciousness work
to really grasp you can't have this perspective just by
doing a bunch of analysis you need to actually zoom
out and see what's going on at the bigger picture
so the purpose of our innocence is for you to
tap into that and to participate in this process of
Maya Maya is the Hindu term which means the dream
state that all of reality is this infinite Colusa nation
this infinite dream this matrix that were in and it's
constantly happening it's just one giant illusion so that's true
that's the case but this illusion is also infinitely creative
and so the illusion spawns more illusion and more illusions
and illusions within allusions within delusions within illusions its dreams
within dreams within dreams to infinity so this of course
is happening at the at all levels and of course
as a whole if we look at reality non-dualistic Li
as a whole of course this is what God is
this is consecration process but of course we as little
individual egos think that we're separate from that and usually
we act as though we are we just go about
our lives doing it ordinary stuff but some people and
these are the artists they wake up a little bit
and they realize that hey I have that creative impulse
within me that exact same impulse that exists within your
genes within every organism within ecosystems within planets within societies
that moves them forward that involves them that force exists
within me and it's very enjoyable for me to participate
and to add my little element to this process of
Maya that's very enjoyable and when you realize that in
yourself and then you become a vehicle for serving this
evolutionary process of Maya you start to play God and
you feel a little bit like God and that produces
a sort of spiritual connection within you now for many
artists they don't realize any of this they just follow
their instincts and they just do their art and they
probably don't understand anything I'm talking about right here unless
they've really studied this stuff but it's I think it
can be very valuable to start to see reality from
this perspective to see your art from this perspective because
it really takes a tool to a whole new level
that maybe you hadn't realized was there and it also
shows you the way for how to deepen your art
and make it much more meaningful and much more enjoyable
for you to do which I'll talk about a little
bit later this episode so the more conscious you are
the more beautiful reality gets until if your consciousness becomes
very very high you actually start to see every piece
of reality is beautiful arts job though is to put
things on pedestals it's to glorify the beauty and then
to also add to it so one of the most
enjoyable experiences as an artist is to have that new
creative insight where you take some element you saw over
there and some element you saw over here that both
struck a chord in you and then sort of combined
them together and then to have some new epiphany of
how you can combine these things in even more beautiful
way and then produce something even newer and even more
awesome through that process and that of course is not
a rational logical process that's a highly intuitive process because
this intelligence that pervades all of a reality it's not
a cold rational sort of intelligence it's not like God
is sitting up there in the clouds thinking of like
oh yeah I think I'd like to create a new
type of animal or I would like to invent a
new type of technology like the internet or the smartphone
it doesn't work that way it's a it's a much
more subtle process it's almost like the force of gravity
you know the force of gravity seems like a very
simple force all it is is it's just two particles
that are attracted to each other at infinite distances and
the closer they are the more they're attracted that's all
that force is but then you look at the entire
cosmos and you see what that force has created it's
created giant stars and beautiful planets and meteors and gas
clouds and nebulas and and black holes - all this
beautiful stuff and ultimately created everything on earth so just
a simple process of gravity well likewise I want you
to think that there's a simple force just like that
which is what we might call the creative force which
operates within you and within everything else which which is
responsible for this sort of snowballing effect of Maya Maya
starts little particle of illusion and the dream sort of
builds on itself and builds on itself and builds on
itself until eventually you start to get these very remarkable
things you get human beings you get technologies you get
societies and and all that stuff so art puts things
on a pedestal so that the beauty is more easily
seen to people who are not very conscious and this
is actually a very important thing because most people in
our society are not very conscious and this also points
to another important purpose of art which is to help
wake people up and to raise their consciousness you see
what art tries to do is it tries to pluck
emotional strings in you because human beings are very emotional
creatures even the most rational of us and so the
best way to transform us and to move us into
action is through our emotions in fact that's the purpose
of emotions is to create motion emotion is used to
manipulate human beings into moving into raising their consciousness so
if you want to wake someone up you don't do
it by presenting a rational argument that virtually never works
what you do is you pluck their emotions until they
can tap into their own humanity and they can broaden
their perspective and they can see the cosmological perspective and
then through that process they wake up because like I
was saying most people they walk around life living it
in this pragmatic days not da YS but da ze
they're dazed they're like zombies and the reason we're like
zombies most of the time is because we are very
much attached to self survival so we're going through life
and our mind our consciousness is mostly geared towards how
do I survive how do I earn money how do
I keep my job how do I not get fired
how do I maintain my relationship how do I have
sex and reproduce how do I take care of my
kids how do I fix up my house so that
have a nice place to live this is all the
process of self survival but the problem with self survival
is that it's a very robotic mechanical process it's sort
of lacks heart and as you engage in self survival
you lose contact with the infinite beauty of creation because
the thing with Beauty is that it's sort of a
luxury it's not practical you don't particularly use or yeah
you don't use beauty or the emotions that it serves
up in you like joy happiness aww reverence love these
emotions you can't really take these to the bank you
can't go make a killing on Wall Street with this
you can't build yourself a giant mansion or buy yourself
a fancy new car with this stuff it's just for
you it's for your enjoyment which is why I said
originally that the purpose of art is the delight and
infinite beauty in infant aggression but of course most people
they don't delight in life when I talk about seeing
the beauty everywhere and being joyful all the time and
delighting in life to most people this is a pipe
dream because they're so stuck in self survival mode and
their consciousness reflects that so ja the job of art
is then to to fix that problem because without our
humanity would basically just be a giant ant colony it
would be a big factory or collection of robots and
what art tries to do is it tries to slap
you awake by putting the beauty of infinite creation a
little piece of it up on display for you on
a pedestal so you can look at and say oh
yeah of course look there it is it's so beautiful
it's so amazing and then that opens your eyes a
little bit and you can say oh yeah look that
thing's beautiful too and that's beautiful and that's beautiful in
that person's beautiful and I'm beautiful oh my god it's
all so beautiful and then that takes you to a
whole new level of human being and then you can
delight in reality and you can enjoy everything as one
giant work of art cosmic work of art from every
scale from the highest scale to the very lowest scales
this is the case if you go with the magnifying
glass or microscope right now and you look at your
at your kitchen floor at the tiles and you take
one of the cracks and the tiles you just look
inside there with a microscope you're going to find an
infinite collection of beautiful things at every scale 10x magnification
100x a thousand X 10,000 X 100,000 X a million
X just keep zooming in you're going to find more
and more amazing stuff there you see but how conscious
of you are you of that on a minute-by-minute basis
virtually not at all not unless someone reminds you of
it and that's where art comes into play art tries
to slap you awake and to say hey look dummy
look at this thing right here isn't as beautiful wake
up and look at this isn't this amazing look at
this creation that we're in it's amazing what are you
doing sleepwalking through life like a zombie wake up that's
the purpose of art now this purpose is served really
in two ways in the making of art and in
the viewing of art so the making of art is
you as an artist trying to make it and what
that involves is you have to first of all look
around you and yourself you have to get in touch
with the beauty something has to appear beautiful to you
to inspire you otherwise you can't move beyond that you
see if you're just a pragmatic zombie you're no artist
so you have to be very observant but as you're
observing you also have to collect a lot of that
data have it inspires you move you emotionally then what
you have to do is you have to start to
make new connections you see that thing there and this
thing here and you combine them together into some original
creation and that involves having an insight and the process
that generates these artistic insights is really no different from
the process that generates enlightenment insights it's the same sort
of spontaneous process which is completely outside of your control
you can't consciously produce it on will but of course
you can set your environment and you can train yourself
in other ways that help to increase the odds of
these connections occurring and one of the ways to really
increase those odds is by by being emotionally moved by
lots of stuff and also studying lots of stuff the
more stuff you study the more stuff you observe the
more new connections you can create and then of course
an important component that is enjoying this whole process of
observing and making these connections such that it becomes a
spiritual process for you like going to church you don't
just do art mechanically waking up at 9:00 and then
going to work and then going to home at 5:00
that's usually not how artists work artists usually are more
spontaneous and for them inspiration is important sometimes they have
periods where they're very inspired they produce a lot of
beautiful stuff and other periods where they go dormant and
they're not inspired or something's not clicking with her with
their art or their creatively blocked you see that shows
us that this creative process is is whimsical and difficult
to control and it's not something that the rational mind
can grapple with very easily which is why a lot
of very rational people tend to be out of touch
artistically and also spiritually art is a very holistic right
hemisphere sort of mentality or process whereas irrational thinking is
more of a left brain thing and so you have
your spiritual experiences you're putting all these things together and
then of course what you want to ultimately do is
the artist in making your art is you want to
then share this with the world because one of the
things you'll realize is when you have a really deep
spiritual experience a mystical experience is one of the first
thing that will cross your mind is that you'll want
to share this with the whole world because it's such
an amazing thing it's so awesome in exactly the same
way that people love to share photos on Facebook what
photos do they love to share the most the most
awesome ones they could possibly find or take so if
you were let's say here's a simple example which is
not a mystical experience but I think people can relate
to this let's say you're on Safari and you're just
driving there and you see some crazy thing happening there's
some lions attacking some zebra and they're tearing it apart
just this ridiculous scene that you would probably not not
even see in a Discovery Channel documentary and here you
are tapping right in front of you it's so amazing
your jaw drops you're just floored by this you take
out your phone of course right and you start recording
the thing and then as soon as you're done recording
it you don't even give yourself time to really appreciate
it already you're trying to post that thing on Facebook
you're trying to set it to your mom you're trying
to tell all your friends about this awesome thing that
you saw why is that because human beings are very
social creatures and one of our strengths is that we
share a creativity and insights with each other we cross
pollinate that's what makes a culture and that's what makes
for new discoveries and scientific inventions we sort of build
on top of itself like that sort of snowball effect
so that's where sharing comes into place and we are
programmed to really enjoy sharing the things that are most
beautiful and meaningful to us with our people and this
of course goes for artists and for mystics and for
for for really for anything that you find meaningful in
life that's why one of the best things you can
do in your life is make your career about sharing
the things that you love the most about life with
other people and that's what life purpose is about if
you want to know more about that check out my
life purpose course where we talk about that in a
lot of detail so that's the process of creating the
art and then there's also the process of viewing the
art the viewing of the art is important because first
of all it gives purpose to the artist making the
art for sharing to having two people at least but
it what it does for the viewer is that it
gives the viewer an easy spiritual connection because most of
us were in this pragmatic zombified days we're just walking
around doing our business we're not seeing the beauty of
reality we're not spiritual things at all our consciousness spirit
level is very low and so if someone can offer
us a quick easy and cheap spiritual connection we'll take
it which is exactly why at the end of the
day you come home you want to watch a good
movie you want to read a good novel you want
to be emotionally titillated you want to be spiritually uplifted
because your work was so draining for most people right
and that's where viewing art comes in whether it's a
movie or whatever now of course most mainstream art is
quite lowbrow and it might not raise your conscious that
much in fact it might sort of get you stuck
at a low level of consciousness if you're just addicted
to watching TV sitcoms all the time you're sort of
misusing the medium if you really wanted to you could
use that medium of television to watch some very beautiful
stuff stuff that really moves you and inspires you to
to go out there and become an artist yourself which
is ultimately one of the best things that an artist
can do is to inspire you to become an artist
yourself in your own way and that's what happens when
someone puts Beauty on a pedestal for you like this
and it's so beautiful you see it like oh my
god I have to change my life to be doing
that to be also putting Beauty on a pedestal my
beauty will be different than other people's beauties and and
that's fine that's actually the best part of this whole
process is that I'm providing my own little personal spin
on things and contributing in my own personal way to
this infinite process of Maya so the viewers of art
get infected with higher consciousness if it's happening correctly and
this ultimately elevates all of society this makes us more
humane this makes us more loving and more compassionate this
makes us see different perspectives so a lot of movies
function in this way if a movie has ever moved
you emotionally made you cry or made you think very
deeply what did it usually do it it showed you
a new perspective on life a perspective that otherwise would
be difficult for you to get like if you're watching
some sort of World War 2 Holocaust movie and it
really it moves you towards the end well that's because
you saw something that otherwise you couldn't experience yourself and
then of course you were able to empathize and and
have those emotions and feelings that the characters were having
you were able to step into their shoes and then
that ultimately ends up elevating you and elevating all of
society and that becomes important in a way art is
like a lubrication for the engine of humanity without art
the engine would just run and it would quickly burn
itself out because you might think like well an engine
is very is very mechanical it's got these hard edges
and it just kind of works very mechanically and very
robotically yes that's true but also without that organic component
of oil lubricating all the parts how quickly will your
engine break almost instantly you see you need that lubrication
you need that sort of soft touch that's what art
provides of course for artists making an impact in the
world is a very important thing and many of them
actually get caught in this trap of seeking approval where
they start to lose sight of their art and the
reason they got into the art for the first place
which is to have their spiritual connections and just to
share it freely in a detached way they become attached
to the results of their art and they get very
neurotic about it they seek approval and they they they
start to get depressed they start to worry that all
these creative anxieties and that becomes a huge obstacle for
artists now art can be any medium there's no limits
to the medium that art could work through that should
be obvious by this point just by the fact that
all art is completely relative and while this means fundamentally
that art is free to be any way it wants
to be on a practical level if you're an artist
right now try to succeed in the real world then
you don't find that to be true you find that
practically speaking art is limited very much by culture and
marketplace to become a successful artist what you really have
to do is you must convince millions of people that
your art is beautiful and that can be challenging to
do successful artists are the ones that actually shape culture
and culture is difficult to change because it's dogmatic that's
its function its function is to be this this sort
of network that combines many elements together and it has
a certain kind of inertia and it creates a sort
of commonality between many different diverse elements or different people
so this can be difficult to do for artists and
one of the challenges of being a great artist is
to figure out how to shape culture and not to
let it shape you because see of course you can
let culture shape you that's important but also mainstream culture
tends to have a very lowbrow low consciousness quality to
it and you don't want to get shaped too much
by that because if you do what that culture will
do is that it'll actually beat you down your job
as an artist is to rise above culture then come
back and bring and elevate the rest of culture up
to your level rather than the other way around a
lot of neurotic artists they fall into trouble because they
don't understand that yes they rise up but then they
need approval so much that then they drop themselves back
down and they let culture work on them too much
and then sometimes culture is just very resistant to whatever
kind of art or change you're trying to make in
it because it is so low consciousness sometimes this culture
will end up rejecting you abusing you demonizing you even
killing you if your art is that radical enough because
low consciousness is always threatened by higher consciousness see the
ego is always threatened by the dissolution of ego and
the challenging of ego and dogma is always threatened by
open mindedness on new perspectives which is why cutting edge
artists often times get criticized and rejected and lost to
obscurity there are probably thousands of artists all around the
world right now who are great very cutting edge genius
level artists but who go completely unrecognized I don't know
about them you don't know about them our culture at
large doesn't know about them because they just don't fit
into what our culture is willing to accept at this
point their time has not come or they simply haven't
figured out how to present their art in a manner
which will appeal to our culture our era and our
marketplace how well your art does will depend on how
well it aligns with economics and the culture of your
time the goal for an artist should really be to
find a way to stay true as true as possible
to what you find most beautiful in life while at
the same time finding a way to pay your bills
and that can be a challenge a lot of people
who do our struggle with figuring out a way how
to monetize the art how to market the art how
to make a big impact with their art and yet
there's also a danger on the other side where even
if you do become very successful and you earn millions
of dollars and you have tens of millions of people
sharing your work and talking about it that can also
be a problem because the success will seduce you to
just chase more success and to forget about your spiritual
connection and so some artists they become very successful but
then they're more miserable than ever because when they weren't
successful at least what they had was a spiritual connection
and that's actually what makes you fulfilled in life is
the spiritual connection success does not make you fulfilled but
because they get caught in this trap of success which
is of course fed into their minds by mainstream culture
so they get tricked by mainstream culture into sacrificing their
art and they try to make their art more and
more successful more and more mainstream right to make your
art very successfully need to make it more mainstream but
the more you do that the more you sacrifice the
spiritual connection not necessarily but in many cases that's the
case okay so your job as a artist who wants
to be really good at his or her work is
to keep deepening your spiritual connection so that your art
is constantly evolving it's never staying still you're always becoming
more creative you're seeing more and more beauty around you
you're integrating more and more of the beauty inside of
you you're connecting those in more interesting and more complex
ways and then you're able to actualize that into the
world your job is to become masterful at this process
of putting Beauty on a pedestal and of course that
requires technical skills but also personal development work many artists
have the right technical skills but they lack the personal
development work and the higher levels of consciousness which are
possible to really take their art to the next level
which is where spiritual purification comes in your job as
an artist is to become every single day of more
pure vehicle for that innate creative force sets within all
of life and within all of reality and of course
within yourself and what does that mean that means reducing
your ego because there's an inverse an inverse relationship between
ego and art the higher your ego the more your
ego will want to infect your artwork and the lower
quality your artwork will be whereas the lower your ego
the less it gets in the way of the innate
creative process within you the more that creative process is
able to make some very spontaneous insights that lead to
amazing art so I think that the most important thing
that an artist can do is number one learn business
and marketing and study psychology so you understand how math
psychology works so do that but also secondly is make
a serious commitment to your own personal development and consciousness
work a lot of artists even though they're great artists
they're neurotic artists you don't want to be a neurotic
artist this is a very bad way to go many
artists trick themselves and say well but if I wasn't
neurotic I couldn't produce the good art that I produce
no that's nonsense what that just means is that you
have so much talent and you have so much potential
within you that despite the fact that you're neurotic you're
able to succeed if you were able to churn your
neuroticism cure your fears your anxieties your depression your nihilism
cure all your chemical addictions cure your negative thinking cure
your need for approval cure your own attachment to your
art all those are huge obstacles to producing good art
if you do that you can become a really powerful
vehicle and then your art will get supercharged and not
only will your art results be amazing they will be
genius level results but also you're going to enjoy the
process more because a lot of artists even though they're
able to put out a piece of work then they
go home depressed or they take pills they take antidepressants
or ultimately they have killing themselves why is that because
they're not able to actually enjoy the process you see
it becomes a sort of twisted process where Maya uses
you as a tool or as a puppet to do
its work but then it's sort of just like grinds
you up and spits you out in the end you
don't want that to be you you don't want your
art to kill you you don't want your art to
cost you your health or to make you burn out
or to make you suicidal enjoying the process is what's
key the more you're able to enjoy the process the
more spiritual the whole process becomes then you'll see that
you're going to be much more prolific you're going to
be able to get a lot of more stuff out
there into the world and then that's going to just
take your art to a whole new level that's a
pretty rare thing why is it a rare thing because
it's pretty rare I think for artists to actually do
serious personal development work or consciousness work and one of
the reasons I think that is is because actually many
people use art as a form of therapy or like
self medication so it's because they're so neurotic that then
they don't know what to do so as kids or
whatever at some point in their life they just picked
up some kind of art they started playing the guitar
painting or taking photographs or doing whatever and then they
just sort of went with it and they get caught
in the cycle of creating art and it became just
to have it for them and in a sense it's
important because it helps them to kind of get their
frustrations out but also they become attached to it where
they can't stop because they know as soon as they
stop then they're just kind of like going to go
depressed they have no sense of purpose anymore so the
whole thing is kind of built on the wrong foundation
what you want to do is you want to go
in there fix up the foundation take personal development very
seriously start to implement all the non artistic stuff that
I talked about with actualized org and you're going to
see how much that could open you up to be
an amazing artist if you're an artist and you have
a sort of any process then here's something I want
you to imagine imagine that five or ten years from
now you have done so much personal development and consciousness
work that you have let go of all these neuroses
and you've had multiple spiritual experiences from meditation self inquiring
and doing various retreats and maybe taking psychedelics combining all
those together and really purifying all your neuroses so that
you're liberated you're free and now imagine how effortless your
processes you're just waking up every morning and you're just
going into your work you're not attached to it you're
not worrying about it you're just working at it and
you're constantly enjoying it and you're drawing new connections and
you're just learning and you're processing more beauty all around
you and then you're putting that on pedestals and you're
sharing it with the world and how amazing that is
and that whole process is so effortless and joyful for
you that might seem like a pipe dream but imagine
it just for a moment as a vision for what
you could do with all the stuff that I talked
about visualize that for yourself try to set that for
yourself as a vision of what you can work towards
and then of course stick with me and let's work
towards that because that's a big goal if it seems
like a pipe dream it's probably because it means you
have a lot of work to do and that's okay
we all have that much work to do but the
benefits here are really going to be twofold your art
is going to become amazing the process of doing your
art is going to feel amazing and then thirdly and
lastly is you really should be doing this for yourself
anyways because just on a personal level even if you're
not doing art you want to be able to enjoy
and to be conscious enough to see the beauty of
reality no matter where you go and you want to
be as as closely connected to that as possible even
if you're not an artist that's what you want so
really it's like you're killing multiple birds with one stone
here so this is exactly what you need all right
that's it I hope I've given you a new perspective
a deeper perspective on art I'm out of here please
