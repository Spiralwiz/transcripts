            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/z4YkMoysymY' target='_blank'>30 Ways Society Fucks You In The Ass</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding Western Society</b>: This part explains that society exploits our 'lower selves', with the main culprits being businesses and marketers. They create systems that fuel and benefit off lower consciousness patterns driven by money, power, greed, and progress.
</li><li><b>Primed by Marketing</b>: Businesses are in a constant war for 'eyeballs', a euphemism for the consumers' attention. The fight for attention is a fight for power and money since businesses need to sell in order to survive. 
</li><li><b>Exploitation of 'Chimp Parts'</b>: The term 'Chimp Parts' refers to the primitive parts of our brains, such as our desire for salt, sugar, fat, sex, power, status, fun, play, and validation. Businesses and marketers create traps to manipulate these primitive instincts, leading to ego-driven decisions.
</li><li><b>Examples of Exploitation</b>: The food industry taps into our desire for salt, sugar, and fat; power and status are exploited by marketing efforts; fun and entertainment are a huge industry playing on our need for stimulation; and desire for validation and approval fuels social media platforms.
</li><li><b>Security and Comfort</b>: Modern capitalism also exploits the 'Chimp Parts' that desire security and comfort. This, combined with our need for love (lower self form), vanity, and gossip, are all manipulated for profit by businesses and marketers.
</li><li><b>The Ignorance of Entrepreneurs</b>: Successful entrepreneurs, despite being savvy and hardworking, remain ignorant of their own low consciousness patterns. They are driven by the same desires and lower instincts they are exploiting in their customers and are unaware of their own role in the cycle. 
</li><li><b>Manipulating Societal Constructs</b>: Leo provides examples of societal constructs used to appeal to our lower instincts. These include the financial market, credit cards, cars, holidays, politics, religion, marriage, romance, family, and careers. These societal constructs are criticized as superficial and disconnected from personal growth and fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Avoiding the Traps</b>: There is potential for individuals to avoid societal traps through consciousness, discipline, and focusing on discovering your true self. However, this path could lead to being viewed as 'weird' by mainstream society. 
</li><li><b>Consequences of Mainstream Culture</b>: Everything in mainstream culture from food to entertainment is viewed as unhealthy on physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual levels. The manipulation and traps set by mainstream culture are argued not to be the result of an evil scheme, but rather a product of ignorance, ego, and distraction. 
</li><li><b>Encouragement to Live Authentically</b>: Leo encourages acknowledging dependency on society and committing to an authentic lifestyle. He suggests taking a break away from common distractions and using the time to reflect on life and its worth.
</li><li><b>Making Conscious Changes</b>: Changes in habits, relationships, and careers are stressed as important steps towards discovering one's true self and living a fulfilling life. Leo encourages not just learning this theory, but implementing it for authentic living.
</li><li><b>Potential Impact</b>: If the ideas presented are applied, Leo posits that one's life could transform drastically over five to ten years. The personal development achieved would lead to a more profound and satisfying life.
</li><li><b>Exploitation of Lower Self through Education and Schooling</b>: The current college and education system, particularly in the US, is challenge-driven. Prospective students aim for prestigious Ivy League schools, study for advanced placement tests, and invest in books and manuals. This entire system appeals to one's lower self.
</li><li><b>Pop Culture and Celebrity Influence</b>: The fascination for following celebrities, reading about them or gossiping about their lives is another example of exploiting the lower self. Also includes low-quality literature, romance, sci-fi, and fantasy novels that serve to distract and entertain rather than educate.
</li><li><b>Impact of Entertainment</b>: Television shows, video games, and the news industry are all aimed at entertaining and distracting audiences. These industries design shows to appeal to our lower, primitive instincts, resulting in passive consumption.
</li><li><b>Promotion of Status, Fashion and Technology</b>: Social media platforms, the internet, the emphasis on status through material possessions, fascination with fashion trends and technological gadgets, all operate on the idea of appealing to an individual's lower self to gain attention and participation.
</li><li><b>Marketing Techniques in Financial Markets</b>: Credit loans, mortgages, and credit card companies often resort to appealing to the consumers' lower self of wanting something for nothing. The role of actors and celebrities in endorsing these services is also geared towards attracting consumers.
</li><li><b>Influence of Cars, Holidays and Politics</b>: The obsession with owning sports cars and the marketing rhetoric during holidays are additional examples of how society appeals to our lower selves. Politics is described as engaging in dogfights with opponents, further appealing to lower, more primal instincts.
</li><li><b>Highlighting the Illusions created by Religion, Marriage and Family</b>: Religion, marriage, and family are depicted as constructs designed to distract individuals from their personal growth journey and truth-seeking. They can create a sense of false security, further deterring individuals from their authentic selves.
</li><li><b>Traditional Career Paths and Stock Market</b>: Traditional careers and the stock market appeal to the lower self by providing income that supports consumerist tendencies. Wall Street culture is used as an example of an environment that values appearance and superficiality over true growth and self-discovery.
</li><li><b>Sports Industry Critique</b>: Professional sports are criticized for encouraging tribalism and loyalty to teams, diverting attention from personal development and encouraging identification with external entities.
</li><li><b>People's unconscious tendencies are exploited by external influences</b>: Leo suggests that aspects of daily life, such as sports teams, the cities we live in, or entertainment, lead individuals into a vicious cycle of low consciousness. This exploitation targets inherent, primitive parts of our cognition, keeping us distracted and moving us away from self-awareness and personal growth. 
</li><li><b>Society distracts individuals from looking inward</b>: According to Leo, society creates an environment that distracts us from self-understanding and authenticity, keeping us oblivious to the nature of our own existence, the lies we tell ourselves, and our perceived reality. Society's primary objectives include achievement, progress, power, efficiency, and maintaining the status quo, which do not align with discovering one's true self.
</li><li><b>Being vs Doing conflict</b>: Leo contrasts 'being', i.e., finding your true, authentic self, and 'doing', i.e., being constantly busy with activities that distract from introspection. He argues that society and business are all about 'doing', creating constant noise and distraction that prevents us from achieving a state of self-awareness and authenticity.
</li><li><b>The good news is that individuals can avoid societal traps</b>: Leo highlights that it is fully within an individual's power to dodge societal pitfalls such as excessive consumerism, addiction, and obsession, by exercising consciousness, awareness, and discipline. This leads to a healthier, conscious lifestyle that centers on self-discovery and authenticity. However, this path might lead to social stigma, as conscious living in modern society can be viewed as 'weird' or abnormal.
</li><li><b>The value of emotional labor and independent thinking</b>: To live authentically, individuals need to invest in emotional labor and exhibit bravery and independent thinking. Achieving a conscious lifestyle and self-awareness requires swimming against the current and deviating from the path of least resistance where societal traps lie.
</li><li><b>Mainstream culture and its unhealthiness</b>: Leo expresses his critique of mainstream culture, including food, entertainment, media, news, and shopping, labeling them as unhealthy in multiple aspectsÂ—physically, emotionally, financially, and spiritually. He acknowledges that even businesses with good intentions have to engage in the game of attracting attention. 
</li><li><b>Critique of societal norms isn't an indictment of society as evil</b>: Leo emphasizes that his critique of societal norms and institutions doesn't suggest an evil conspiracy. Instead, he views them as traps borne out of ignorance, ego, and the desire for distraction. Despite the traps set by society, he sees them as opportunities to utilize the resources provided by society to find authenticity and make progress.
</li><li><b>Ignorance, ego, and distraction in society</b>: Leo Gura explains that societal leaders, such as CEOs and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, are often ignorant and neurotic despite their wealth and power. He stresses that many remain in their neurotic states, working excessively until they face serious health issues. However, he also acknowledges that businesses can provide beneficial services and that the current era offers individuals many opportunities and freedoms. He urges individuals to be aware of societal traps and to use the tools and resources provided to them to find their true, authentic selves.
</li><li><b>Life commitment to authenticity</b>: Gura encourages individuals to make a commitment to live an authentic lifestyle by renouncing distractions, such as pornography, video games, drugs, and politics. He underlines the importance of creating space for personal and psychological growth. He proposes taking a week-long break from all external influences to reflect on life and contemplate its fleeting nature. During this isolated period, individuals can meditate, detox from their regular routines, and consider significant life changes that may help discover their authentic selves.
</li><li><b>Changes in habits to discover true self</b>: Gura suggests implementing changes in habits and lifestyle that would lead to self-discovery and contentment. It involves time for reflection, dealing with withdrawal symptoms from addictive behaviors, and potentially making crucial life choices that will impact the trajectory of one's life. He acknowledges that there are multiple ways to implement these changes and emphasizes the importance of taking action rather than simply consuming theoretical knowledge.
</li><li><b>Promise of personal transformation</b>: According to Gura, applying the principles and concepts discussed can drastically transform individuals' lives within five to ten years. He promises a profound and satisfying life with achieved levels of personal development thought to be impossible. Gura further emphasizes the importance of staying on track and refrains from sliding back into old patterns. He concludes by encouraging viewers to continue watching his series as he intends to share more insights and advice.
