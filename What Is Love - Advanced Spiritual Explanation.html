[Music] what is love this is a foundational topic a
life-changing topic the material in this episode will transform your
whole life if you are able to hear it but
also the explanations here will be rather advanced requiring that
you keep a very open mind and that is because
our society does a very poor job of explaining what
love is our notions of love are very unsophisticated and
juvenile and so therefore when you hear a very deep
explanation of what love is a metaphysical explanation uh well
you might bulk at it because it's gonna sound so
different from what you thought and of course what you
thought was based upon what you got from our culture
if you're at spiral dynamic stage orange if you're a
materialist a scientifically minded person a skeptic a rationalist an
atheist a cynic then again you might balk at some
of the things i'm going to say here because fundamentally
spiral dynamic stage orange refuses to admit that the universe
can have any human qualities and of course love from
that paradigm seems like it's a human quality it seems
like a flaky airy fairy sort of thing which has
nothing to do with the truth nothing to do with
objective reality these are just romantic sentimental emotions that's how
it looks from that materialist paradigm and that's what we're
going to be challenging that's what makes this topic here
advanced because love is not that actually love is more
fundamental than mathematics and physics but that can be difficult
to stomach and accept if you're coming from the materialist
paradigm how is that possible leo how is it possible
that this human emotion can be more fundamental than mathematics
and physics well it's possible because the universe is actually
a giant mind it's not a mechanical system it's not
a box with atoms bouncing around in it it's much
more sophisticated and nuanced than that what's going on here
with life and reality is a much much much much
more tricky thing than that life is a giant mind
it is organic it's alive it's intelligent it's conscious and
it has the capacity to love now how do you
reconcile that with modern science and modern physics it doesn't
compute so you have to kind of set that aside
for now set your objections and and worries aside about
that and just go with this because what i'm talking
about here is i'm not talking about some belief system
or some ideology that you have to believe from me
what i'm talking about is stuff that you can become
directly conscious of stuff that i've become directly conscious in
my life which has had a huge impact in how
i relate to people how i think about the world
and most importantly the quality of my life how happy
i can be because of course your happiness depends on
your capacity to love love is not just another emotion
love is not just some airy fairy touchy-feely girly thing
love is not sexual attraction and romance love is not
needing other people to love you or getting love from
other people as though you're getting approval or praise from
them that's not love and really love is not a
human quality stop thinking of it that way what love
is is love is a universal property it's a property
of the universe it's fundamental it's absolutely fundamental it's metaphysical
in my episode where i talk about what is intelligence
i also frame intelligence this way i say that intelligence
is fundamental to the universe and that it's not just
a human brain phenomena well just like i said that
intelligence is a facet of the absolute love is also
a facet of the absolute and in hinduism they actually
have this this notion called satchit ananda which is the
three-part sort of the trinity description of the absolute truth
is consciousness chit is or actually sought is truth is
consciousness and ananda is love satchit ananda truth consciousness love
it's really all one thing the absolute but it does
have these facets and this is what enlightenment is about
is become conscious of these facets you can become conscious
of these facets individually and then you can also become
conscious of these facets all collectively together at various degrees
and levels of depth so when a human being is
experiencing love whatever kind of love you've experienced for your
family members for your friends for mankind for your cat
for your dog this is a little sliver of universal
love this giant mind which is conscious in this giant
mind which is the entire universe is held every single
human being is held every single living creature is cut
held all of physical reality what we think of as
physical reality this is all contained inside this mind that's
what this is that's what's happening right here consciousness right
consciousness consciousness is the substance of all this stuff but
a facet of consciousness is love love is not an
emotion that consciousness feels that's really not the right way
to think of it as a human being who is
conscious of course you can have these various kinds of
emotions which are love-based but there's a more metaphysical aspect
to love which is very difficult to describe this requires
uh a non-dual mystical experience to get a good strong
sense of it and it's very powerful it's life transforming
we're going to be exploring and explaining love from many
perspectives here so again we're gonna be hitting it from
different angles with different sorts of definitions so you get
a big overall picture a compound perspective truth is love
which is very counterintuitive because you think like well why
would the truth have anything to do with love wouldn't
the truth be just like this sort of stale dry
neutral thing you would think right because you would think
like leo the universe doesn't really care about us why
would the universe care i mean why wouldn't the universe
like be hateful versus loving right why wouldn't you why
are you saying the universe is good why not bad
i mean what what's going on there and it's a
little difficult to understand because um from the materialist perspective
it certainly seems like the truth would just be this
neutral thing this dry neutral thing which has no human
qualities but actually what you discover is that all of
the qualities that you had as a human being including
consciousness intelligence and love that these were not just accidental
byproducts of some evolutionary process these were actually qualities of
the universe itself you understand right that you are the
universe you're not just in the universe you are the
universe try to get that like right now feel this
connection you are the universe not just a creature within
the universe that means whatever you're feeling the universe is
capable of feeling literally so when you feel sad that
means the universe is able to feel sad when you
feel happy that means the universe can feel happy when
you feel love that's the universe feeling love when you're
being intelligent that's the capacity of the universe is intelligence
how do we know that's true because you are the
universe by definition you see if the universe couldn't be
intelligent or loving you couldn't be either i mean this
is just it's like so obvious it's super obvious but
people overlook it because they think like oh no but
these are just human things and then like the universe
is just like some cold heartless atoms bouncing around somewhere
behind the scenes or some sort of it's a it's
some sort of uh mathematical computation that's happening we're inside
of a giant simulation computer sort of thing and that's
what the universe is and it doesn't care about love
no you're just wrong that's just the wrong assumption stop
thinking of it that way what you can discover is
that the love that you've ever felt in your life
that's a little sliver of infinite love love in its
purest form just like intelligence whatever intelligence you have that's
a little sliver of absolute infinite intelligence it's literally infinitely
intelligent and it's literally infinitely loving and this is the
most shocking thing that you will ever discover in your
life is infinite love it's heart wretching it's beautiful it's
incredible it's it's beyond words divine love and then you
see that your love little human love has always been
uh just like a little a little um stream that
ran off from this cosmic source of love that is
always there the very being of consciousness is love you
just need to be very conscious in order to recognize
it love is infinite and unlimited but of course it
doesn't usually feel that way to you because you've got
this big old fat ego in the way which we'll
talk about in a minute the obstacles to love but
let me give you some other perspectives on what love
love is absolute acceptance of everything you see the reason
that the universe you could say has love is because
the universe accepts itself completely it's not resisting any part
of itself it loves every piece of itself you could
say it's to love all of reality without exception it's
to love so deeply that evil is an impossibility a
love so deep that you can't even imagine what evil
is because you love everything so much that there's no
more room left for evil to exist because you have
loved the evil to death love can also be thought
of as being conscious of the beauty of creation are
you conscious of the beauty of creation right now as
it's happening before you if you are then you're going
to be falling in love head over heels in love
with every moment of creation the beauty of it the
intelligence of it how amazing it is but of course
most people are so numb and mesmerized by by everyday
survival needs that they completely lose sight of this love
is tolerance of the intolerable love is surrender of the
self love is selflessness you see the universe is selfless
and therefore it can be infinitely loving because it is
itself in its very being is its self-acceptance and its
love for itself love is the deuce the dissolution of
all boundaries total non-duality when everything breaks down and everything
just becomes one unity one oneness and you become conscious
of that that is love death is love the moment
when you die you will dissolve into infinity from which
you came and that will be one of the most
beautiful experiences that you have ever had i've had this
experience multiple times and it just constantly blows my mind
every time it blows my mind the greatest beauty i've
had is dying it's this feeling of dissolving into infinity
and at that moment you surrender yourself so completely that
you don't care anymore about whether you live or die
you accept your death because you have no choice and
you just surrender and your entire body sort of just
dematerializes and scatters into every direction across the entire universe
forever to infinity and it's the greatest peace the greatest
feeling of peace and surrender and bliss that you could
possibly imagine and this is something you can experience and
then you can come back and you can talk about
it god is love don't be scared by this word
god all it really means is the universe or reality
that's god and love is a quintessential facet of god
the purpose of life is to love to become as
loving as you can possibly be in fact a really
good way to think about life is that it's a
love simulator that's what all this is you're born you've
got about 80 years to live and in these 80
years you're trying to make yourself the most loving human
being and you're trying to become conscious of the beauty
of all this creation and you're trying to love it
as much as you possibly can and this is the
most difficult thing to do you would think it would
be easy and you might think like well leo but
if life is the love simulator how come there's all
this awful stuff how come there's death and slavery and
disease and cancer and genocide and war and torture and
rape and all this sorts of nasty stuff shouldn't it
be rainbows and butterflies and rivers flowing with honey and
and heavenly stuff like that but of course the answer
is no because the true test of your love is
your ability to love everything not just the things that
please your ego but everything including of course war and
famine and cancer and all this sorts of stuff that's
the real test so to really put you into this
simulator in the same way that like if we wanted
to to train a fighter pilot in a flight simulator
would we put him in a flight simulation where the
plane was like under perfect conditions all the time the
plane flew itself for him and he would just sit
there and just push one button and it would all
do everything for him automatically with no difficulties no that
doesn't train anything the whole point of training is that
you train the toughest situations so like you deliberately program
into the simulator that the engine one of the engines
is out or there's a fire in the cockpit or
something like that and then he has to deal with
that stuff where it's like running low on fuel and
now he has to land or he has to land
under extreme weather conditions and wind and all this sorts
of stuff right that's how you become a good pilot
so your job here is to learn how to navigate
all these obstacles and still love despite all of that
and that's the most difficult thing that means you have
to get over yourself that means you have to develop
yourself and grow yourself and so that's really what you're
doing as a human being is you're growing yourself you're
trying to develop yourself to the highest capacity you're trying
to turn yourself from this little uh thing that you
were born that doesn't know anything about life and then
you're trying to actualize yourself into literally god to become
as loving as god which means you have to surrender
yourself you have to die to the truth to reality
get completely over yourself all of your fears and all
of your inhibitions get over all of that and then
you can say that you've accomplished the mission of life
and then you can die happy and peaceful see that's
the game here that's what we're doing everything else is
just obstacles in this simulator towards that end but of
course how many people understand that how helpful is it
if you actually understood what the point of all this
was pretty helpful notice that there cannot be true fulfillment
in your life without love there cannot be this so
the quote-unquote so-called good life without love whatever you might
imagine the good life is what money sex houses cars
yachts vacations travel partying all this sorts of stuff if
you have all that but you don't have the capacity
to love what have you got you've got a loveless
life and then your life actually still sucks which is
exactly the trap that many successful people fall into they
don't realize that love cannot be purchased that means love
has to be developed and that's exactly right when you're
in a simulator you can't purchase your way out of
it right because that would be that would defeat the
whole simulator so there's no quick magic pill solution to
really love you have to develop your capacity to love
and that's a really difficult thing to do because you
got to love the hard stuff not just the easy
stuff most people sure they love to love the easy
stuff they love sex they love food they love people
who love them they love their family they love the
stuff that helps them but that's the easy stuff how
about loving the really hard stuff that's a real test
of your love that's what really grows you that's what
really fulfills you is to be able to love the
hard stuff and that's not a capacity you can buy
that's a capacity that you got to work your ass
off for so let's pause all the theory here for
a moment and let's get you a real uh in
the body feeling of what love is so let's do
a quick little five minute exercise here get comfortable in
your seat and close your eyes and i'll guide you
through a little bit of a guided visualization here all
right so i'd like you to relax and get comfortable
and with your eyes closed think of a time remember
a time when you felt very loved or where you
loved something very much it could be anything could be
a pet a dog a cat a horse that you
had that you loved could be a child that you
have or spouse could be a video game could be
a piece of music that you listen to could be
a movie that you love to watch locate a specific
time in your life where you really felt the love
this feeling of fondness and affection for something and feel
it in your heart bring that memory back to life
feel what it feels like to love and now magnify
that sensation in your body and in your chest and
start expanding it out start to really feel into it
really magnify it and now expand that feeling beyond just
an affection for that particular thing but for all of
reality expand that transmute that little narrow love into a
universal love for all of existence for the beauty of
existence for the privilege of being able to be here
and be conscious and alive and develop that magnify that
feeling even more in your chest and expand it out
beyond your chest really feel it and visualize it as
something palpable something so thick you can cut it with
a knife and push that love out like you're a
fountain of love push it out through your chest and
out into the surrounding space around you to fill the
entire room and beyond the room into the entire universe
such that there's no boundaries between what's going on in
your chest and your entire consciousness permeate your entire consciousness
with this love and just bask in that for a
moment and now open your eyes that's what love feels
like the really important thing to realize is that you
don't want to be waiting for love to come looking
for you knocking on your door love is something you
need to create you are meant to be a fountain
of love a walking talking breathing fountain of love that's
what you're trying to become this is done proactively deliberately
consciously not accidentally and randomly when good stuff happens to
you you put the love into everything if you struggle
with this exercise and you weren't able to feel anything
or maybe you think like leo i've never loved anything
in my life that just shows you how much work
you have to do don't worry that doesn't mean you're
dysfunctional it doesn't mean that you're a lost cause it
just means you need a lot more practice you need
to develop that within yourself and there's many different techniques
and methods for developing that which we will discuss uh
towards the end of this episode right but you need
to start to develop that ability and to get good
at it and to be able to trigger it on
command not just something that happens to you right the
whole the biggest problem with people is that they expect
love from external sources and they they refuse to take
personal ownership and responsibility over the fact that they're create
they are creators of love they can create it the
true test of your love is your ability to love
evil criminals war violence foreigners all the stuff that is
against you your true test of love is how much
you're able to realize that all of this around you
right here is god and that all of it is
love that's the true test of your love so that
your love is unconditional and indiscriminate so that you don't
make exceptions for like well i love this but i
hate that guy who called me a bad name or
i hate that politician or i hate that group of
foreigners or i hate those immigrants or i hate those
guys who are stealing stuff you see that's discriminate love
a true test of your love is non-judgment how non-judgmental
can you be the realization that all judgment is delusion
it's all partial the universe at its highest level doesn't
judge itself doesn't hate itself doesn't discriminate against itself from
the universal perspective everything within the universe is perfect it's
all good the universe loves itself unconditionally you on the
other hand that's another matter that takes work you might
say that one definition of spirituality is that spirituality is
the art of love spirituality is a set of practices
and concepts which help you to increase your capacity to
love with the ultimate aim to get to an infinite
capacity for love that's true spirituality if you're doing it
properly but of course the problem is that you're not
really capable of love are you because you're too damn
selfish and this is where it's really useful to create
the distinction between conditional versus unconditional love conditional love is
what normally people think of as love it's love the
things that are good love of the things that serve
the ego's agenda the ego only knows how to love
conditionally the ego simply loves the things that help it
and it hates those things which don't help it it's
really that simple the ego is a creating of a
boundary within reality and saying that everything within this boundary
is extra special and important that's me everything outside this
boundary is not me and i don't really care about
that stuff because i care so much about me but
see that's the very definition of partial discriminate love you
love this but you hate other stuff around you so
what prevents love it's the ego's fear of dissolution because
the ego is so attached to maintaining this boundary that
it's created around itself which it now identifies with that
is what ego is it's this boundary so the ego
now is in this predicament where has to spend its
whole life protecting and defending this boundary and so the
ego gets so attached to this process of defending this
boundary that it's constantly afraid of this boundary dissolving because
if this boundary dissolves then i die and death is
the worst possible thing the ego thinks from the ego's
perspective that's the case and so the ego is not
able to love everything because if the ego loved everything
then this boundary would dissolve and that's the biggest thing
that the ego fears so when i tell you to
love evil you say leo i don't want to love
evil that's bad for me that's right it's very threatening
and now you understand why love is so difficult and
now you understand that why we need this whole thing
called life this love simulator is to train you that
actually it's okay to go beyond yourself to let yourself
go it's okay to accept the full magnitude of what
you are what you are is so big and so
magnificent so infinite that actually it's scary to accept what
you really are everything that exists it's too much it's
too big you don't feel comfortable that way you feel
comfortable being small and defending your smallness but of course
this smallness is fundamentally false so actually contrary to what
many materialists think which is that they think that love
is somehow a feeling which is not a fact it's
not objective in that leo love is just some romantic
sentimental notion has nothing to do with truth actually it's
the exact opposite love has everything to do with truth
and your notion uh of separation that's what's is what's
false you loving your little ego that's what is false
what is the opposite of love it's egotism narcissism fear
hate judgment unconsciousness violence intolerance manipulation tribalism exploitation power games
ignorance closed-mindedness and division you cannot love so long as
you're preoccupied with food sex survival status success money addiction
drugs ideology politics religion or logic so all of these
things need to be dropped but of course the ego
is so attached to all these things who wants to
give up their ideology does the christian want to give
up his ideology does the muslim want to give up
his ideology to truly be loving does the materialist does
the atheist want to give up his ideology to be
truly loving no because he thinks he's right and this
arrogance is exactly what stands in the way of being
all loving because the atheist loves to hate the religious
person and the religious person loves to hate the atheist
and the muslim loves to hate the christian and the
christian loves to hate the muslim and the republican loves
to hate the democrat and the democrat loves to hate
the republican and on and on it goes the rich
people love to hate the poor people and the poor
people love to hate the rich people the white people
hate the black people and the black people hate the
white people this creating of division is what the ego
does that's its modus operandi and it's such a is
such a powerful force you understand this is your whole
life we're talking about your whole life hinges on this
fundamentally the reason you can't just love everything all the
time is because it's too threatening to your life your
very life is at stake see and what this simulator
is trying to teach you is that you need to
let go let go of attachment to life and that's
the scariest thing that there is to do that's why
the simulator is needed what is hate if hate is
the opposite of love well actually in a sense hate
is not the opposite of love because like i said
love really is everything all being is love all consciousness
is love but then you might wonder well if everything
is love leo how do you account for hate and
evil very easily what hate is is excessive love of
the self which then results in hate of the other
so actually hate is a form of love it's just
a very dense and crude form of love it's a
distorted misdirected love so think of it like an ice
cube which starts at a solid and then it melts
and it turns into a liquid and then it can
evaporate and turn into a into a gas so this
cube is always water likewise everything is always love no
matter what phase it's in whether it's liquid gaseous or
um solid it's it's all love right but when it's
in this condensed form this block of ice that's what
it looks like when it's called hate conventionally speaking then
when it becomes liquid then it becomes a little bit
more like conventional love and then finally when it becomes
a gas and it embraces everything then it becomes this
sort of divine infinite unconditional love which very few people
experience most people only experience the solid state of love
and the liquid state of love but never the gaseous
state of love so the solid state of love is
what you feel for your enemies who you hate it's
dense it's rigid see it's very stubborn it refuses to
yield with your family members for example you love them
in the conventional sense of the word love you buy
them valentine's day cards and holiday cards with hearts on
them and stuff like that and you kiss them and
you tell them that i love you so that's a
more you might say that that's the pinnacle of love
but no it's not that's a very shallow form of
love it's still highly conditional you only love your your
family just because they they they basically play and suit
your ego uh in certain ways uh you don't really
love your family unconditionally and so that's a we would
say that's the sort of the liquid form and then
if you really work on yourself for the next 10
20 years then you'll get to the gaseous form and
then you can really start to experience the unconditional forms
so what i'm saying here is that every evil person
actually acts out of love so hitler acts out of
love he created world war ii out of love now
this is very counterintuitive to people because you would think
like no no that's that's completely wrong that's the you
got it backwards that's the opposite of love that's hate
but that's just love let me see because what's really
going on there is that it's hitler's ego and the
national ego of germany and the nazi party which created
this division between itself and the rest of the world
and then it lashed out because it was not capable
of being fearless into surrendering itself to everybody else it
wanted a purified version of its race and its people
and its ideology you see and it was scared it
was paranoid how did hitler rally all his supporters through
paranoia and fear fear of others fear of foreign or
sphere of people taking over germany and fear of being
treated unfairly and threat existential threats see this is how
fascism works this is how all hatred works is by
a sense of existential threat from foreigners or from bad
economic conditions or whatever else the ego feels threatened and
it loves itself but then it doesn't have enough love
to love everything so it only limits its love to
itself but of course there's a very interesting twist to
this you would think like well yeah someone who's a
total narcissist just loves himself completely and yeah this person
can go out there and hate people and do all
sorts of evil but it's really interesting because actually because
the ego is fragmented and it's so twisted and distorted
that it's not even capable of loving itself fully so
a person who hates is actually incapable of loving himself
he loves only those parts of himself which are easy
to love and he denies and suppresses other parts of
himself and then projects those out into the world so
a person might for example uh love his appearance and
maybe love many aspects of his personality but not all
aspects of his personality some aspects of his personality he's
gonna deny maybe he has some homosexual tendencies but he
doesn't love those because those go against his ideology and
what he was taught in the culture so he's gonna
suppress and deny those he's gonna hate that part of
himself but of course he can't admit to himself that
he hates himself so what he has to do is
to suppress that be unconscious of it and then project
it out into the world and then hate other people
out there same thing with a racist uh a racist
doesn't want to admit that all people are fundamentally one
part of a giant system all of it alive and
conscious a racist wants to feel like my race is
special my race is better than that race over there
because that's how he defines himself is against somebody else
out there and so by rejecting the truth of the
absolute unity of existence he has to deny that and
then he has to project and he has to demonize
those people out there and he has to hate them
but of course secretly he also hates himself think about
what you hate about yourself what parts of yourself are
you denying maybe you hate your nose your hair the
freckles on your body maybe you hate how tall you
are how short you are how fat you are how
skinny you are how ugly you think you are maybe
you hate some facet of your personality that you've repressed
see imagine what it would be like to fully love
yourself in an undivided way to accept yourself for exactly
who you are and to accept all other people for
exactly who they are and to see no wrong to
see it all as part of creation all of it
is good that's really difficult for the ego to do
the ego can't handle it the ego denies it the
okay it creates all sorts of excuses and defense mechanisms
against this that's all that a racist is that's all
that a terrorist is it's someone who's trying to love
it's an ego that's that's struggling to love but it
but it doesn't know how to love properly it doesn't
realize that love is counterintuitive and love requires letting go
and because you know not all of us had good
upbringing some of us had very traumatic childhoods with few
resources and we had to fight to survive we have
gotten programmed into that orientation life where we're always fighting
others for scraps of food or for scraps of power
or whatever to get our success to get our needs
met and then we get we get stuck in that
orientation and then we think that it's a competitive world
we have to out-compete other people otherwise we're going to
die and we're afraid to die and so then that's
what our life becomes is this survival game without realizing
that actually we need to rise above that be magnanimous
and be willing to die if necessary and that takes
a big person that's very counter too most people live
through their whole life and don't realize anything that i'm
saying here none of this strikes them at all as
a possibility because it's so counter-intuitive it's exactly the opposite
of what they think and that's exactly how the devil
works the devil is the ego and the the devil
his whole modus operandi is that he flips everything inside
out 180 degrees black is white white is black up
is down the left is right north is south and
uh love is hate and hate is love the ego
gets everything backwards because or well the devil i mean
um because fundamentally what the devil needs to do in
order to survive is to deny the truth truth needs
to be turned into falsehood and falsehood needs to be
turned into truth that's why the ego reverses love and
hate the devil actually convinces himself that by hating others
out there like foreigners or bad people nazis and whoever
else that by doing that he's actually doing good that's
what the devil has convinced himself of without realizing that
actually no he needs to embrace all that and love
all that and that's the biggest problem with with traditional
religion is that traditional religion doesn't teach this it's supposed
to teach this but it doesn't teach this because it's
so radical and because religion has been co-opted over the
years as a tool for maintaining power and of course
maintaining powers is the the game of the devil the
game of the ego so the devil has infiltrated all
major religions converted them to his own purposes such that
most people who learn major religious teachings actually think that
hating people is good and that loving their tribe is
the point of religion which exactly is exactly the opposite
closed-minded people cannot love opinionated people cannot love judgmental people
cannot love needy people cannot love superficial people cannot love
ideological people cannot love success-oriented people cannot love money and
power hungry people cannot love addicted people cannot love hypological
people cannot love arrogant people cannot love and fearful people
cannot love all right let's see a quick intermission here
i'm gonna catch a break and i'll be right back
all right let's take a look now at love from
the perspective of spiral dynamics so if you're not familiar
with spiral dynamics i'll refer you to my six part
mini series which will change your life if you watch
that whole thing it takes a while but it's worth
it but for those of you who are let me
just point out some interesting things about how you can
use spiral dynamics to look at love so every stage
of the spiral of course as the ego is developing
and evolving and as the circle of concern is growing
as one is identifying with more and more in one's
environment then love transforms basically from a very dense solid
into a more liquid and then gaseous form so at
stage purple which is this the tribal magic stage you
have a tribal forms of love where people are working
in this tight-knit community and of course they're loving their
tribe but of course these tribes are very uh well
known for warring with other neighboring tribes one tribe will
steal a pig from another tribe and then they go
to war for 20 years over that pig killing each
other right and then you've got tribal warfare um so
this is like old-school tribal warfare this is the tribes
that live in the amazon still tribes that you can
find in africa like this right these tribes like they
literally have not been outside their little circle in the
amazon like they don't know that there exists a larger
world so of course their sense of identification is very
very narrow and all their love goes towards serving their
tribe but they're not able to love uh universally then
when that expands and develops a little bit more then
you go into stage red and stage red is a
very sort of twisted solid form of love which is
very narcissistic it's a sort of a tough love love
in the form of violence in the form of conquest
love of building empires love of building dictatorships tyranny punishment
retribution vengeance and power and you might save a leo
that's the opposite of love no it's not the opposite
of love it's just a very very crude form of
love a very gross form of love very twisted form
of love and then of course once the limits of
that become obvious then you evolve to the next level
which is a bit more classically loving and that's stage
blue this is the orthodox religious stage this is where
many orthodox christians muslims and jews and hindus are at
around the world a large chunk of the world is
that stage blue and this is sort of a love
uh that is a it's a it's sort of a
masculine compassion form of love it also has an element
of tough love in it a love for country a
love for one's ethnicity a love for those who are
like you a love for your community uh sacrificing on
behalf of your community which is not just your tribe
but it's actually your entire nation now your entire civilization
it's really a love for civilization there's a love to
hate evil evil doers a love of loyalty a love
of self-sacrifice to defend your civilization a love of self-denial
you're actually denying yourself in the name of love a
love of law and order a love of following rules
a love of um upholding institutions a love of idol
worship which is worshiping god in the orthodox religious sense
all of that is idol worship traditional christians and and
muslims and jews they're engaged in idol worship that's what
that is they don't actually know what god is they've
never personally experienced god they have no idea that the
entire universe is god all of these are foreign concepts
they just have an image of what god is the
bearded man in this in the sky the heavenly father
with the pearly gates and so that's what they worship
and a love of religion but specifically their religion so
a stage blue person doesn't love all religions only my
religion and a stage blue person doesn't love all nations
all civilizations only my civilization because mine is the best
and not all ethnicities only my ethnicity only my culture
only my country so in that sense it's a very
limited form of love then you grow out beyond that
and you move to stage orange and stage orange is
a love of rationality logic science iq very left brained
love of analysis love of materialism love of liberty and
individuality and freedom love achievement and success love of money
fame sex fun and orange is not willing to sacrifice
itself because it's very individualistic a love of libertarianism that's
orange then once the limits of that become obvious your
love grows even further and now you're moving into sage
green and these are the hippies you might say it's
a love for now all people and all animals all
races all cultures a love of femininity where before femininity
was repressed a love for the environment a love for
community as opposed to just individuality a love for social
justice and defending the weak a love for equality a
love for defeating oppressors sensitivity to cruelty willingness to sacrifice
the self for the community and now more of a
self-love it's more accepting whereas the other stages were self-denying
green is is starting to actually understand the importance of
loving oneself where before that was seen as somehow you
know too self-indulgent or it was seen as too fruity
and too girly too feminine then you move on beyond
that to stage yellow and stage yellow the love at
stage is a little bit difficult to characterize it's sort
of a love for knowledge a love for diversity of
knowledge a love for different perspectives a love for integration
a love for systems thinking a love for understanding reality
a love for open-mindedness and then you go beyond that
to the highest level which we'll be talking about which
is turquoise and that's now the really deepest forms of
love that i was talking about earlier the unconditional divine
forms of love at stage turquoise you really start to
tap into divine love love of all being love of
gaia love of the ecosystem love of the entire universe
love of god because now you have direct consciousness of
what a god is and you understand that you are
god and now this gives you the power of true
unconditional love of infinite love because you've actually contacted infinite
love at this level and now your love is so
powerful they're actually able to love evil you're able to
love suffering you're able to love ego you're able to
love ignorance and delusion and maya and of course you
have a love for truth because now you have you've
experienced the absolute truth and you have a love for
global community and so that's how love evolves so you
can kind of peg yourself where you're at you can
see and then you can see what the next level
is for you now many people are stuck in stage
orange especially many men these days and the thing that's
holding them back from moving up to stage green is
an awakening to love many stage orange people have not
awoken to love they don't see leo i don't understand
what green is about it seems so weird those social
justice warriors and hippies and all this it seems like
it's a regression no because you don't understand what you're
missing is an awakening of love that's the first awakening
then there's going to be a second awakening which is
the awakening from yellow to turquoise that's going to be
an even deeper awakening to love and also an awakening
to community so one of the things that orange people
get stuck on is they get this very rigid ideological
libertarian stance of individuality and they think like oh it's
just me i gotta go out there and conquer the
world all by myself i'm an individual we shouldn't have
any sort of collective action community is bad and evil
is socialism and all this what's your misunderstanding though is
that you as an individual are part of a community
mankind is a community there is no such thing as
individual human beings you can only exist as a human
being as part of a community and that's what the
libertarians and these individuals don't understand and so to embrace
that in a healthy way uh is a very important
move in order to move up from orange to green
and then from yellow even deeper into turquoise and it's
at turquoise where you get some really um powerful potential
for community you get it at green two but green
communities can still be quite dysfunctional but it's at turquoise
where really human communities start to shine and become remarkable
it's very rare to find examples of it though most
people don't understand what a turquoise community looks like how
do you develop love well in the biggest sense what
you got to do is you got to dissolve your
ego and go for enlightenment only with enlightenment will you
really be able to truly love in the way that
i've been describing but that'll take you some time and
so there are other ancillary practices you can do to
start to get improvement in your capacity to love long
before you actually attain enlightenment so another thing you can
do is you can develop yourself up the spiral stages
so if you're at blue move up to orange if
you're at orange move up to green if you're a
green move up to yellow and so forth and that's
going to help you to love more um especially that
transition from orange to green that's going to be huge
for for many of you guys opening up the heart
chakra is huge for love but i'm not going to
go into that here i'll i'll shoot a separate episode
about that in the future if you want you can
go do some research on that it's really all that
it really means is that um that exercise that i
had you do where you were feeling from your heart
that love you just keep practicing that more and more
and more until it really opens up your heart really
opens up and it's it's a radical transformation of your
your psyche and also your physiology too your body your
entire body changes and then you're a much more loving
and compassionate person all the time it's not just something
you visualize once or twice but it's just it becomes
the norm that's what opening the heart chakra is about
also visualizing yourself being more loving is a really powerful
technique even if you don't open your heart chakra just
visualizing on a daily basis even you just spend five
minutes in the morning visualize yourself being more loving that's
a very simple straightforward practice that you can start doing
right now and also just feeling more love creating the
the body state proactively throughout your day you can practice
it in the same way that i i released that
video about body awareness what i told you just to
relax your body by the way relax your body right
now feel that tension in there relax it away um
well in the same way you can just like be
walking down the street and just tell yourself hey let
me just fill my body with love and just fill
yourself up or you're driving in your car you just
fill yourself up or you're sitting at work at a
meeting and you just fill yourself up right you're taking
proactive control over this this is called creating feeling states
with your body which is something we will also have
a future episode on that's an important and deep topic
uh another really powerful way to develop love which has
been actually uh one of the ways that i've become
a lot more loving in the last two years is
by experiencing deep suffering consciously and mindfully especially when you
deliberately create that suffering yourself like i've said before suffering
is a very powerful spiritual growth technology which is why
every spiritual tradition has all sorts of techniques that use
suffering to create spiritual purification and states of consciousness like
for example strong determination sitting or as i've been doing
over the last couple years is doing the solo meditation
retreats where you isolate yourself for 10 days and you
sit there and just meditate 24 7. and in that
you experience deep deep deep suffering and during these sorts
of retreats i've grown the most i develop the most
compassion for the suffering of mankind when i realize how
much i suffer during these retreats and also when i
become really conscious of my own inadequacies and my own
ignorance and how unconscious i am and how much more
work i still have to do and how difficult this
all is that makes me much more compassionate and loving
for all of the struggles in the world that mankind
faces because then i know that the reason all this
evil and suffering exists is precisely because not everyone is
willing to go through the sort of ringer that i'm
putting myself through with these retreats and also with psychedelics
psychedelics are a super powerful tool for developing your love
almost like a magic pill and with psychedelics there's there's
sort of two two ways in which they help you
to be more loving one is that they can just
thrust you into infinite divine love instantly and you're just
there and it's amazing and it's palpable and it's the
realest thing you've ever experienced and there it is and
now you understand everything that i was talking about earlier
now it all starts to make sense the entire materialist
paradigm is melted away before your eyes and there you
are feeling the love of god and now you know
that it's real and not just some fantasy or some
belief system that's a really powerful experience and i've had
a few of those i've had some experience of love
on psychedelics that were so deep and so profound that
they utterly transformed my entire physiology and body super significant
like impossible to explain to ordinary materialistic people what that
is actually like you have to actually go through it
it's utterly shocking uh but also and very very importantly
with psychedelics the second way that you can become much
more loving with them is by going through bad trips
the stuff that people are afraid of and they avoid
well you know by facing your fear and going through
the worst trips horrific trips trips that would uh uh
give most people an existential crisis or a mental breakdown
you know you go through one of those mushroom trips
or lsd trips man that level of suffering makes you
so much more compassionate and understanding of of people and
all their nonsense and all their ignorance and all their
evil and also on psychedelics you you can use them
to help to love yourself to love your own body
to accept yourself very fully so there are there that's
like a third facet of how psychedelics can help you
psychedelics are a really powerful tool highly recommend them for
this work also various kinds of yoga kundalini yoga kriya
yoga various kinds of meditation and contemplation practices anything basically
that gets you closer to the truth helps you to
be more loving and in fact the practice of being
more truthful and being more honest in your everyday activities
is critical to being able to be more loving because
love is just like the flip side of truth and
um and if you're in falsehood if you're lying and
manipulating and scheming all the time then there's no possibility
for love there you can only be truly loving when
you are able to open yourself up and surrender to
the truth because otherwise you're always forcing to you're always
forced to be crafting various kinds of lies and being
dishonest in various kinds of ways to meet your egoic
agenda and from that position there's no possibility for love
facing your fears is a super important practice for becoming
more loving because your fears are what holds you back
the most every fear you have is one roadblock to
you being infinitely loving and ultimately the ultimate fear you
have to give up is your fear of death unless
you give up your fear of death there cannot be
truly unconditional love in you because you will always in
the end if you're afraid of death you will always
choose your own life and your own ass over truth
and love and that's a huge obstacle that you need
to overcome and psychedelics can help you a lot there
with that with that um point practicing acceptance non-judgment and
surrender is a great technique being more kind more giving
more caring and more vulnerable is a really good practice
especially being more vulnerable too many of us are afraid
to be vulnerable and to be maximally loving you have
to become very comfortable being vulnerable because that's what love
makes you it makes you vulnerable it it does hinder
your ability to survive and you might say william why
would i want that why would i want to hinder
my ability to survive right it doesn't make sense to
you because you're thinking about it from the point of
view of the ego and for the point of the
eu of the ego what you want to do is
you want to erect giant walls and emote around you
create a castle an impregnable castle but in doing so
you separate yourself out from the world and so counterintuitively
you gotta break down those walls and be comfortable being
vulnerable and if it kills you that's right you gotta
accept that it'll kill you that's why it's difficult that's
why you gotta give up your fear of death there's
no guarantee that in being loving that everything will go
your way and you will be showered with money and
women and cars and houses and that you will even
live there's no guarantee of this if it if there
was that guarantee then it would be easy and it
wouldn't be love the whole point is that there are
no guarantees and that by making yourself vulnerable yes you
can get hurt yes you might get um hurt in
a relationship if you get if you let yourself be
vulnerable you might get hurt physically sometimes you know mahatma
gandhi was beaten over the head with sticks and yet
he would still refuse to to fight he would refuse
to to carry a weapon right that's that's real power
is allowing yourself to be vulnerable that takes real courage
and real strength and this is something that a lot
of men don't understand for so for men a really
good technique for becoming more loving is to start to
embrace your vulnerability and your feminine side this is one
of the keys for men and as you do this
you will move from orange to green and for women
also you got to train yourself to be more feminine
stop trying to out compete men in this stage orange
environment their entire books and courses written about how to
embrace your feminine side for women and you should go
watch those and maybe you men should also go watch
those you'll learn a lot about yourself by trying to
act macho this sort of um juvenile form of masculinity
that's popular these days um what you're actually doing is
you're trying to erect a facade a false facade of
invulnerability so you're trying to steal yourself and be stoic
and not be emotional and not be girly and and
all this and um actually this is preventing you from
loving and it's actually preventing you from being able to
attract women because what women want is they want a
vulnerable man not a stoic man not a robot women
don't like having sex with robots if they uh if
they want that they can just use a vibrator the
best way to attract women is to be very emotional
and this is so counterintuitive for many guys because uh
they think that they gotta act all macho and be
all cool and stoic and that's how they get the
hot girl no just the opposite it's true another great
practice is to allow yourself to cry and of course
this requires vulnerability the reason you have to allow yourself
to cry is because at some point your love for
the world would become so powerful and so um just
effusive that you'll be radiating all the time to the
point where it'll actually bring you to tears because you'll
be so conscious of the beauty of everything you'll be
just sitting in a room full of people and then
you'll just start crying because of how beautiful it all
is right but you have to be strong enough to
be able to allow yourself to do that when there
are people sitting there watching you and our society doesn't
usually look kindly upon displays of love it actually makes
you sort of cringe and feel awkward when you see
someone being truly loving and yet your capacity for love
is like down here but their capacity to love is
like up here it actually kind of it makes you
uncomfortable in your body that's these stage blue and stage
orange people um they actually they're not capable of it
they're not capable of actually forming a relationship many orange
sage orange men can't form a relationship with a woman
because they don't know how to be intimate they don't
know how to be human they're just like left brain
logical robots and they think that iq solves everything this
sort of mentality this is not going to fly you
can't create a good life this way another really great
practice is practicing unconditional self-love so go check out my
episode called how to love yourself where i guide you
through a pretty lengthy sort of guided visualization and we
go step by step in helping you to to love
all the different parts of yourself that you've disowned you
can practice that um practice loving your body it's very
hard to to love other people when you don't physically
love yourself because you think you're ugly or you think
you're too short or you think you're you got something
weird going on on your body whatever you don't accept
yourself because when you don't accept your body you also
will not accept the bodies of other people and that
will become an obstacle for you another practice is to
practice feeling love especially during difficult and bad times those
times when you have trauma those times when you have
something that goes horribly wrong or someone does something to
you which you perceive as an evil they insult you
they steal something from you they do some violence to
you they hurt you they hurt a family member of
yours something like that during those moments it's when your
ego wants to lash out to defend itself and the
the very counterintuitive move which you need to make is
you need to be conscious enough to remind yourself that
actually it's all okay and that you can still be
loving but see that takes so much power takes so
much consciousness to be able to stop that knee-jerk reaction
of lashing out and hating somebody or judging somebody or
insulting somebody and instead to realize and just to again
to be ground yourself in the beauty of this present
moment that's really difficult to do so if you can
manage to do that that will help you a lot
to grow in this department and study role models role
models of love like mahatma gandhi and christ and various
kinds of saints and sages and zen masters and yogis
who are exemplars who are people who worked really hard
on themselves and reach that highest levels of being able
to embody love and in many cases they died for
it like gandhi or christ or many other saints or
they were demonized for it you know what happens when
you become really really loving and unconditionally accepting of everything
you would think that oh everybody loves you and a
lot of people of course will love you because your
love gets reciprocated but then some people who are at
a very dense level of love which means that they
hate they are going to hate you for your love
all right so this is what happened with gandhi this
is what happened with christ this is what happened with
many saints and sages and it's very sad it's very
tragic that's because people who are very low level of
consciousness can't stand the contrast between themselves and how much
they hate and then how much somebody like a jesus
christ or a gandhi or some yogi is able to
love to them it seems like that love is evil
right because they think that evil needs to be hated
so when a christ figure comes along or a gandhi
figure comes along who doesn't hate anything that's extremely threatening
to this very dense sort of ego who has built
itself up on hatred built an identity out of it
and so what does it do it tends to attack
and do violence to those people that are most loving
that's what happened with martin luther king you could say
to some extent with john f kennedy that was a
factor you know there's there's a there's there's a reason
why a lot of these sort of visionary leaders get
get assassinated or get death threats because it's not it's
not comfortable at all some of these truths that i'm
dropping on you here today if you're a traditionally blue
orthodox religious person these are very uncomfortable truths you don't
want to admit that love and evil are actually the
same thing you don't want to know that god and
the devil are the same thing this goes against everything
that your orthodox religion has taught you but that's because
your orthodox religion has been corrupted by the devil see
and uh you should really have expected that you were
told not to worship idols you were told that the
kingdom of heaven is within you were told to to
love your neighbor as yourself were you not told that
what do you think that means here are some points
about practicing love that are very important a lot of
people misunderstand make sure that when you love you don't
do it because you should or because you have to
or because there's a rule this is what a lot
of traditional religious people misunderstand about love you don't love
because you should you love because you love you love
reality genuine love you have to genuinely love reality you
don't fake it you actually love it so be very
careful about this fake it till you make it approach
to some extent you do have to fake it till
you make it but not too much because remember that
you can only push the ego so far so long
as you have a sense of ego of separate self
you will never be able to love unconditionally if you
want to love at the level that christ or gandhi
loved at you have to surrender yourself entirely and you
have to surrender all of your ideologies all of your
beliefs and even religion and even your belief in god
you have to surrender all of that that's the cost
that's why it's so rare that's why not everybody is
jesus christ or gandhi it's very radical to take this
leap to surrender everything and even to surrender your life
you see so until you do that your ego will
only allow you to go so far so you have
to understand that you have to understand that even though
you can use the sort of fake it till you
make an approach and you can fill yourself with love
at certain times you're never going to really be able
to love everybody because that ego is still in you
and that ego is by definition division and so those
things that you're dividing yourself from uh you're not going
to be able to fully love them and that's okay
that just means you got to keep really working towards
that awakening towards that enlightenment towards the dissolution of the
ego that's a very important component and this is why
most religious people are hypocrites and they're not actually able
to love and that actually most of them are filled
with hate and are so judgmental is because their orthodox
religions don't actually teach them valid powerful techniques that will
actually deliver them to full non-duality it's just beliefs and
ideas and sermons that you hear at church which is
not enough to break down the ego so you're not
going to be able to fake jesus's love by just
aping jesus you have to actually go through what jesus
went through which is the disillusion of of everything give
up your entire life and then you'll be able to
love like jesus but that's not traditional religion and most
people don't have any idea that that's what they're supposed
to be doing nor do they know how to go
about it um really what i recommend if you want
to become very loving is you got to burn the
candle from both ends by which i mean you got
to pursue awakening on the one hand and be working
at dissolving your ego through practices like self-inquiry and yoga
and meditation and contemplation and on the other hand you
also have to be practicing on a daily basis being
more loving understanding that like those two will will meet
together and synergize at some point and that neither one
of them um well you can get to it just
through awakening if you want um but just the approach
where you're just sort of faking happiness but you're not
awakening and dissolving your ego that that approach is never
going to fully work it's sort of like the difference
between a fake smile and a real smile you know
the difference between a fake smile so here's a fake
smile that's a fake smile and here's a real smile
that's a real smile so how do you do that
to get a real smile you actually have to connect
with joy and happiness on the inside that's something you
need to practice that's not something i'm faking i'm not
faking a real smile here like i can actually become
conscious right now of just how amazing this present moment
is because i have been working on developing this metaphysical
connection to reality such that i can actually feel myself
create a state of happiness and joy and that's something
you can learn to do try it right now a
real smile not a fake smile real love not fake
love also very importantly remember that love since it's a
facet of the absolute is a facet of enlightenment and
it really is an enlightenment experience on its own so
enlightenment has different facets and one of the fastest of
enlightenment that's most talked about is the no self the
realization itself is illusory that's of course a very important
insight to have and the way you have that insight
by by contemplating the question who am i what am
i usually that's a good one you can also have
insights into the ultimate nature of reality you can have
insights into what consciousness is what god is and so
forth but one of the insights is you can have
an insight into what love is and that's a discreet
specific insight people who have realized no self have not
necessarily had the insight of infinite love sometimes you get
both of them at once sometimes you only get one
and not the other and i've had it various different
kinds of ways i've had many experiences of no self
but not really felt the infinite love and i've had
other experiences where i felt the infinite love very powerfully
so if you fancy yourself enlightened remember that your realization
is not complete until you've had an experience of infinite
love no self is not enough you need to go
deeper and that's one of the criticisms of neoadvida and
other simplistic formulations of enlightenment where they try to simplify
everything down and boil it all down to some version
of no self without distinguishing between different facets of enlightenment
think that there's just one thing to realize and so
once you realize no self that's it you think you're
done but actually there's so much more deeper and other
and even broader things to realize um but um many
people who like to view enlightenment too simplistically they they
miss out they miss out on infinite intelligence they miss
out on infinite love they miss out on why is
there something rather than nothing they miss out on god
and so forth so there's a there's a lot there
and we'll be talking about more of those facets in
the future also understand that it's going to be impossible
for you to love fully until you accept the ignorance
of mankind there needs to be a very deep acceptance
of ignorance there needs to be an understanding and a
reconciliation of how evil is created by ignorance always and
an understanding of how hatred is really a form of
love because until you realize that hatred is a form
of love and that it's all fueled by ignorance you're
going to take it too personally and you're going to
think that people are bad for doing bad stuff in
the world when when you have a really mature understanding
of all this then you realize that actually it's all
part of the entire unfolding you realize the devil is
god and that's how you learn to love the devil
you can't love the devil so long as you think
the devil is some separate thing from god so spend
a lot of time contemplating what is ignorance and why
does it arise and also what is evil and why
does it arise you're gonna have to drop your moralizations
and that's a huge huge limitation of orthodox religion is
that it's so moralistic it's so judgmental that once that's
programmed into you it's really even difficult to hear what
i'm saying here because the things i'm saying here go
completely against all the things that you've been moralized and
that you've moralized others about your whole life and so
it doesn't doesn't compute for the ego understand that love
can be manifested in many different ways it's not just
about feeling stuff in your heart of course that's an
important component but it can be manifested as life purpose
career business it can manifest as your relationships it can
manifest in the way that you carry yourself in the
way that you think about yourself in the way that
you think about the world in your politics in um
the way that you exercise compassion masculine compassion versus feminine
compassion i have an episode about the difference between those
two you can go search for that it's an interesting
difference um so there's a lot of ways that love
gets manifest in the world because love is sort of
an abstract thing in the same way that intelligence is
a very abstract thing and intelligence has to get manifested
in some sort of material ways for you to really
connect with it a lot of times it's hard for
most people to connect to pure abstract essential intelligence and
same thing with love for example actualize.org is a material
manifestation of my love for reality so what i did
is i spent a good 10 to 20 years cultivating
my love for reality for philosophy for psychology for personal
development for understanding for insight for consciousness i've cultivated that
over thousands of hours with deliberate planning and strategy and
hard work putting all of this together such that then
it gets materialized as these videos and this channel and
this website and most people when they see it they
don't see the love they just see a website and
some videos and a youtube channel and some talking head
up here and maybe some of them say oh this
is some interesting cool stuff oh there's something special about
some of these teachings maybe they think but they don't
realize that all of this is my love for the
universe that i've channeled deliberately not accidentally very very deliberately
against all sorts of fears and personal weaknesses and limitations
and my own ego and my own narcissism against all
of those obstacles i had to work through to be
able to put this out here and share this with
the world and why do i do that because i
love it because that's what i found i love the
most about reality is the insights that i have i
love exploring the way the mind works i love exploring
human psychology i love exploring consciousness i love teaching it
i love explaining it i love coming up with little
metaphors and examples and and all of this i love
that now you might not love that which means you
don't need to do the same thing i do you
got to find what that is for you your career
needs to be in a um an expression of your
love for the world otherwise why are you doing it
you're wasting your time your relationships need to be an
expression of your love for the world otherwise why are
you wasting your time imagine what it would be like
if you spent the next 20 years aligning every domain
of your life from your work to your finances to
your relationships to your health to your fitness to everything
to the way that you think the way that you
feel the way you speak all of it was aligned
to maximize love a genuine expression of your love in
every one of those categories think about how your life
would be then right now if you're like the typical
person you're only tapping into maybe five percent of your
potential as far as love goes the other 95 of
your heart is closed you're not manifesting and expressing love
in all these different domains and so what you have
is a weak uh loveless sort of life that's what
you've got you're not tapped into the power of love
love is the greatest power you want to transform the
quality of your life tap into love but you can't
do it why not because you're too weak you're too
selfish you're too narcissistic you're too scared you're too left
brained you're too wrapped up in all sorts of ideologies
and judgments and opinions your libertarianism your your fight against
the social justice warriors you're this you're that you're fighting
for your religion you're fighting against that race you're fighting
against those people you have enemies and because of that
you have a weak life what do you really want
from your life do you want to love your life
well how are you going to love your life if
you don't have the capacity to love you're only going
to be able to love your life as high as
your capacity to love and most people's capacity is so
low the glass ceiling is so low that's where growth
comes in that's what you're growing yourself for is to
be a more loving human being a more loving leader
you know to be a great leader you gotta be
a powerful lover leaders who can't love they become tyrants
and they become hated and they go down as disgrace
as in human history and those leaders that can love
powerly powerfully they become idolized and they become memorialized and
entire religions get started around them that's how powerful love
is that's how rare it is it's so rare that
when a person comes along that can love unconditionally indiscriminately
and surrender his entire life this is such a powerful
and motivating force that uh an army rallies around him
and he gets deified as a god like literally that's
what happens but it happens so rarely that there's there's
handfuls of these kinds of people throughout human history you
can count them on a couple of hands that's how
powerful love is and you can see that because it's
so rare that there must be a great cost that's
paid because otherwise everyone would do it everyone would be
jesus but everyone is not jesus why not because they're
just too damn selfish because it's just so counterintuitive all
of this growth stuff is so counterintuitive it requires enormous
intelligence and consciousness to bust through all the self-deceptions within
you all the fears and all the rationalizations and all
the ideologies to bust through that to escape the labyrinth
of your own mind requires incredible intelligence luckily you have
a connection to infinite intelligence which you can develop luckily
you are made out of consciousness all you got to
do is just develop it to create a great life
you need to summon the courage to tap into love
cowards do not have great lives because cowards cannot love
and love requires the greatest courage love is something you
have to work for years of work laying the groundwork
it's not just an emotion that comes and goes like
i said like with actualize.org it's it's years of of
sometimes grindy work to put this stuff out there being
strategic being pragmatic it's not just about being airy fairy
and always believing that everything will just happen for me
no it's also being very pragmatic and practical and doing
the things you got to do love is having a
vision for your life a vision of what you can
offer to mankind and then waking up every morning on
time and going through the motions going to work and
working 10 12 hours a day sometimes for weeks at
a time figuring out how do i train myself what
do i teach myself what books do i read who
do i listen to what countries do i go to
what teachers do i find out there you know what
what workshops what seminars what gurus are out there i
go there and i study all that stuff how many
thousands of dollars do i invest to do all this
that's all hard tangible and that's necessary to be able
to actualize it that's what it takes the rubber has
to meet the road it's not enough to talk about
this stuff it's not about just sitting there on your
couch and say oh yeah i'm a loving person i'm
gonna be more loving and then the next day just
kind of going back to your old habits it's that's
not going to cut it a real commitment to to
love means you're transforming your entire life that means you're
willing to surrender everything about yourself to transform yourself into
a more loving person your entire life is on the
line you're not holding back of course you're also not
being foolish and stupid being loving does not mean you
got to be a a foolish person who takes unnecessary
risks or let themselves get abused or walked over no
no no no no that's a complete misunderstanding and distortion
of what it means to be loving loving people have
a clear and powerful intent and sense of direction purpose
in their life so they don't let themselves get walked
over or abused they have strong boundaries in the sense
that they don't they don't allow the nonsense and egotism
of others to drag them down you see to be
loving you have to be uplifting of everybody around you
and also of yourself that's what leaders do is they
lift themselves up and then they have so much of
that energy and love to lift themselves up and then
they're able to lift everybody else up around them as
well they have an abundance of it and over abundance
this is something that you commit your whole life to
because you can see how powerful this is you can
see that this determines the whole quality of your life
hinges on this and so it's worth it but you
got to see that it takes a visionary to be
this loving which is why it's so rare all right
so to wrap this up very practically an overarching goal
for you is to have your first mystical experience of
absolute love this is essential you need to have this
so that this conversation about love is not just a
belief or a cute idea or just some emotion that
you visualized but it you got to get to the
absolute love insight that's a real mystical experience of bliss
and ecstasy and nirvana you got to get that so
how do you do it well through various kinds of
spiritual practices which i've already mentioned uh or the best
way and quickest way is through psychedelics that's what i
recommend some mushrooms some lsd some five meo that's the
way to do it but you don't have to do
psychedelics they're also non-psychedelic ways but it'll take longer it'll
take more work and as a homework assignment here for
you over the next week what i'd like you to
do is i would like you to notice and monitor
yourself carefully look at how your love is conditional and
why it's conditional look at how you cherry-pick throughout your
day you're cherry-picking the things that you love because there's
all this stuff that you hate and look at the
stuff that you hate that you don't love about your
life or that you see in the world that that
you're not pleased by look at that stuff and ask
yourself why am i hating that thing what am i
really fearing and then make a list of all your
fears the fears that are holding you back from being
more loving with this person with that situation with this
political matter that you're seeing on the news or or
whatever's going on there you got to start to get
real serious and honest about the things that are holding
you back within yourself your own inner weaknesses why aren't
you able to love more what are you really afraid
of are you afraid of losing your job are you
afraid that you will get out competed by somebody in
business are you afraid that people with will think you're
too feminine are you afraid to think that people will
think that you're weak or um are you afraid to
cry in front of others what are you afraid of
make that list and monitor yourself you need a very
stark assessment of how conditional your love is such that
then you can say to yourself okay yeah i can
see my love is so limited so crippled so conditional
and um [Music] that will be a little difficult to
stomach at first but then also it's important because you
know you got to start with the truth by admitting
that stuff to yourself um you're going to start to
see opportunities for turning that around and those are the
areas you got to work on with your self-actualization all
right i'm done here please remember to click that like
button for me and come check out actualize.org that's my
website you will find my blog where i'm posting insights
pretty consistently uh the forum where you can discuss this
stuff the life purpose course which helps you to well
really the life purpose course is all about how to
develop a career which is aligned with your deepest love
that's a rare thing few people teach you how to
do that i share sort of the tricks and tips
and strategies that i've used the principles that i used
to do that with my work and how you can
do that with any kind of career you don't have
to become a self-help teacher to to do this any
kind of career it works for musicians for filmmakers for
authors for coaches for engineers for programmers for scientists for
mathematicians for inventors for um entrepreneurs it doesn't matter the
principles are universal so maybe check out the course and
check out my book list i do have some books
about love on my book list and uh that's basically
it i just want to point out one thing and
that is that it's very important that as you're watching
my content that you get don't get too seduced by
it and too mesmerized by it remember that you don't
really know me through these videos the more you watch
the more you think you know me you don't really
know me so be careful about not idolizing me too
much or getting too personal with this relationship that you
think we have in the end these are just videos
in the end i'm just a talking head who's delivering
information to you take the information use the information learn
to think for yourself don't believe anything i say don't
just take it on blind faith don't just trust me
do the research read the books you need to actually
investigate this stuff for yourself this is not a belief-based
process that we're doing with actualized effort this is a
first-hand experience process no matter what truths i give you
it doesn't matter they don't transform your life the only
way the truth can transform your life is if you
follow up with them and you derive them for yourself
in the same way that if we're doing math and
i'm teaching you math it doesn't help you to look
at me proving something on the chalkboard you need to
go through the proof yourself to see why it works
the way that it works right so i'm not special
here this is not about me you don't need to
praise me or idolize me or think highly of me
this is all distraction very very common trap and as
you watch more about my videos you're gonna more likely
fall into this trap so just want to point that
out to you so watch out other than that though
stay tuned do watch more videos um and we've got
a lot more juicy topics to cover to come you
