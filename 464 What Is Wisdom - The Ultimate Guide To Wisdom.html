            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/FgS4l1heQTc' target='_blank'>What Is Wisdom - The Ultimate Guide To Wisdom</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Concept of Wisdom</b>: Wisdom is characterized by keen discernment, good judgment, and having proper priorities. People who prioritize higher values over lower ones and live accordingly are considered wise. Wisdom is a nebulous concept that takes time, experience, and self-reflection to develop.
</li><li><b>Not All Educational Achievement Equals Wisdom</b>: Wisdom is different from information, knowledge, or academic achievements like a university degree or high IQ. A person can possess these attributes without necessarily being wise.
</li><li><b>Existential Orientation and Open-Mindedness</b>: Wise people are existentially oriented, focusing on more than just personal survival and pleasure. They value the existential dimension of life and place it above lower values. They are open-minded, being aware of the potential to deceive themselves and take epistemology seriously.
</li><li><b>Wisdom Comes with Experience</b>: Experience plays a crucial role in the development of wisdom. Wise people draw lessons from their life experiences and use them to make informed decisions, be they related to politics, sexuality, business, or health.
</li><li><b>Being Holistic and Valuing Truth</b>: Wisdom involves having a holistic understanding of life, big picture thinking, and valuing the truth. Most people do not appreciate the significance of truth due to a lack of wisdom.
</li><li><b>Non-judgmental and Understanding LifeÂ’s Counter-Intuitiveness</b>: Wise individuals are non-judgmental and understand life's counter-intuitive nature, foreseeing how certain actions could backfire. They are patient, long-term thinkers capable of recognizing the complexities and nuances of different situations.
</li><li><b>Learning from Errors and Independence of Thought</b>: Wisdom does not mean being perfect. Rather, the wise learn deeply from their mistakes to avoid repetitions. They are independent thinkers who strive to derive their own answers through contemplation.
</li><li><b>Mental Flexibility and Intuition</b>: Wise people are mentally flexible and highly intuitive. They are able to change their minds, reflecting a deep sense of self-awareness and adaptability to different situations. 
</li><li><b>Initiating the Quest for Wisdom</b>: To become wise, one must actively engage in deep questioning, self-reflection, and introspection. The path to wisdom begins not when answers are provided, but when one starts asking powerful questions of their own accord.
</li><li><b>Wisdom and Correction of Mental Errors</b>: Wise individuals have the ability to detect and correct errors in their own worldview, rather than staying fixed in flawed perspectives.
</li><li><b>Wisdom and Paradox</b>: Wise people understand and embrace the inherent paradoxes and contradictions in life, while many people may get confused or stalled by these complexities.
</li><li><b>Objectivity in Wisdom</b>: Wisdom is unbiased and objective, with wise individuals consciously identifying and rejecting their own biases to perceive reality with clarity.
</li><li><b>Healthy Skepticism in Wisdom</b>: Wisdom fosters a healthy skepticism, where the individual first doubts themselves, differentiating from toxic skepticism which can lead to paranoia.
</li><li><b>Integrity and Principles in Wisdom</b>: Wise individuals live by self-developed principles and demonstrate integrity, not mimicking societal or religious dogmas but living by lessons derived from personal experience.
</li><li><b>Self-Discipline and Wisdom</b>: Wisdom entails self-discipline, in which individuals maintain an internal locus of control, taking responsibility for their own issues, actions and circumstances, rather than blaming others.
</li><li><b>Moderation and Balance in Wisdom</b>: An aspect of wisdom is balance and moderation in all aspects of life - be it nutrition, relationships, politics or money. They understand delicate balance point and its dynamic nature, not resorting to extreme views.
</li><li><b>Openness to Admit Lack of Knowledge</b>: Wisdom involves the bravery to admit ignorance and self-awareness to accept mistakes and wrongdoings; tied to this is the ability to apologize genuinely and offer forgiveness.
</li><li><b>Wisdom and Emotional Labor</b>: Wise individuals do not shy away from emotional labor but face it confidently, controlling their cravings and prioritizing self-discipline.
</li><li><b>Education and Wisdom</b>: Wisdom values education highly and learns from the mistakes of others and history, preventing the individual from repeating age-old errors.
</li><li><b>Constant Adaptation in Wisdom</b>: Wisdom involves continually adjusting to new situations, recognizing when the situation is out of balance and acting accordingly to restore it.
</li><li><b>Homogeneity and Wisdom</b>: Wisdom requires diversity in thoughts and experiences, it is not about taking a single extreme position but finding balance points in life.
</li><li><b>Foolishness vs Wisdom</b>: Leo highlights that the opposite of wisdom is foolishness. A fool is characterized by poor judgement, lack of discernment, and a tendency to consistently make poor choices. Fools put basic survival and materialistic needs like sex, money, and fame above higher values such as truth and existential questioning. They lack self-reflection and tend to exhibit strong arrogance, often thinking they already know everything and need no further education or self-improvement. They tend to not see any value in truth and confuse it with whatever serves their personal interests. Foolish people often externalize problems and deception, blaming others instead of looking at their own potential for self-deception. They apply skepticism to external issues, failing to question their own worldviews, beliefs, and ideologies. This makes them gullible and easily manipulated.
</li><li><b>Foolishness and Unsolicited Advice</b>: Leo notes that giving advice is a significant responsibility. Often, people tend to give advice based on what worked for them, without considering that the circumstance or situation of the person being advised could be different. True wisdom guides individuals to discover the answers for themselves. This self-guided path is often more beneficial than simply following a set of instructions such as ten commandments. Fools, however, are marked by their tendency to push their advice onto others, to give unsolicited advice. This usually happens because they consider their experiences and viewpoint as universally applicable.
</li><li><b>Solitude, Silence, and Wisdom</b>: Leo attests that wisdom values solitude and silence. He refers to the concept of Spiral Dynamics, a psychological model of human development. He states that wisdom aligns with tier two cognition in this model, where individuals transcend mere survival values and needs to operate from higher-level being values and needs. This leads individuals towards existential priorities, which is the territory of wisdom.
</li><li><b>Explicit vs Implicit Understanding</b>: Leo introduces the concept of explicit vs implicit understanding. By making something implicit explicit, the understanding can become more powerful. However, Leo recognizes that some things can't be made fully explicit and that there is power in keeping some elements implicit as well. The act of knowing when to use which approach is an aspect of wisdom.
</li><li><b>The Fool's Defining Characteristics</b>: Leo Gura defines the foolish person as being self-assured and thinking they have life all figured out, thus making them an easy target for manipulation. He asserts that fools usually have strong opinions on subjects they have no experience in and are usually closed-minded and resistant to adjustment. 
</li><li><b>Foolishness and its Manifestations</b>: Gura states that those who are considered fools are typically very judgmental, impatient, and easily manipulated. They seek fast results and cannot project themselves into the future, unable to delay immediate gratification for future gains. Furthermore, they are typically egotistic, selfish, and conformist, quickly accepting societal norms without questioning them.
</li><li><b>Foolishness and Conspiracy Theories</b>: Gura claims that the majority of individuals who believe in conspiracy theories are fools, mistakenly seeing themselves as intelligent due to their non-conformist beliefs. These conspiracy theories, however, are seen as more of a misuse of skepticism and are often grounded in emotional reactivity and paranoia. 
</li><li><b>Belief Systems and Foolishness</b>: Leo characterizes fools as being stubborn believers, prone to accepting unproven beliefs and hearsay ideas without question, thereby cementing their reality and identity in these convictions.
</li><li><b>Observation of Fools and Their Actions</b>: The fool seeks immediate gratification and quick solutions, resulting in a pursuit of shortcuts in all areas of life- ranging from business and relationships, to health and wealth. This susceptibility to shortcuts opens them up for exploitation by industries such as advertising and politics, as these industries manage to control and manipulate fools for their benefit. Fools often lack discipline, shirk responsibility, and possess a strong self-bias, blaming problems on external factors instead of self-reflective introspection. They tend to take things for granted, unable to appreciate the efforts required to build and maintain societal systems such as good governance. The fool lacks balance, holding onto outdated rules and beliefs, and does not learn from their mistakes. 
</li><li><b>Characteristics of Fools' Perspectives and Behaviors</b>: Fools are often partial, relying on their self-biases and ignoring the need for personal introspection. This causes them to externalize problems, blaming others instead of acknowledging their own shortcomings. Furthermore, they often avoid responsibility for their actions and decisions, often resorting to justifications and rationalizations which are self-biased narratives. This inability to critically analyze and update their perspectives leads them to stubbornly hold onto outdated ideologies and rules. 
</li><li><b>Impact of Foolishness on Society</b>: The promotion and attraction of foolish perspectives can be attributed to several sectors of society, such as certain media outlets and political organizations. Following these perspectives often leads to the exploitation of fools, aiding in the commercial success of the propagating organizations. Fools engaged in chasing immediate pleasure, moving away from the responsibility and long-term strategies required in dealing with life's challenges. This results in recurring problems for the foolish individuals, often disregarding the need to adapt and instead adhering stubbornly to their ingrained beliefs.
</li><li><b>Effects of Fools' Ignorance and Biases</b>: The inability of fools to self-reflect and update their beliefs leads them to situations where they chase frivolous pleasures and evade emotional labor. Their ignorance and self-bias result in them refusing to take responsibility for their actions, causing recurring problems that they consequently blame on external factors. Their partiality and lack of responsibility lead them to cast blame outwardly, failing to acknowledge their role in the generation of personal and societal issues.
</li><li><b>Trumpism as a movement of fools</b>: Leo Gura categorizes Trump supporters as fools who couldn't discern the negative aspects of his leadership. Despite events like the insurrection on January 6, staunch supporters continue to overlook the damage done during his presidency.
</li><li><b>Religious dogma distorting wisdom</b>: Gura argues that deeper wisdom is present in religious teachings like Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Judaism, but believers often distort these teachings into rigid dogmas. This transformation results from a lack of self-reflection, contemplation, and personal implementation of wisdom.
</li><li><b>Examples of 'fools'</b>: According to Gura, various groups fool themselves by rigidly adhering to dogmas. These include drug addicts, criminals, conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones followers, and even the audience of Donald Trump. Major political groups, like the progressive left, are not exempt from this form of foolishness.
</li><li><b>Sports fanaticism as foolishness</b>: Gura expresses that the sports industry capitalizes on tribalism, extracting money from its fanatical audience. However, appreciation for sports does not automatically make one a fool.
</li><li><b>Types of fools</b>: There are two types of fools according to Gura - the uneducated and the educated. Uneducated fools lack exposure to knowledge, while educated fools, despite their prowess in areas like business or technology, lack existential perspective and prioritize materialism over higher values.
</li><li><b>Developing Wisdom</b>: Wisdom cannot be taught by rote memorization, rather it needs to be cultivated as a living, dynamic force within oneself that can adapt to ever-changing realities. It requires self-reflection, contemplation, and the courage to face new challenges and derive fresh answers.
</li><li><b>Existential Disconnection</b>: Regardless of material or academic success, educated individuals like Silicon Valley CEOs can still be classified as 'fools' if they are disconnected from existential realities, and prioritize lower values such as wealth, success, and fame over higher virtues like wisdom. 
</li><li><b>Danger of Technological Advancement Without Concurrent Wisdom</b>: A current danger is the rapid advancement in technology coupled with a stagnation or even decrease in wisdom. This imbalance poses a significant risk and may lead society off a cliff.
</li><li><b>Confusing Success and Wisdom</b>: According to Leo, there is a prevalent trend of confusing academic intelligence and success with wisdom in the current societal context. He stresses that being wise is not about having impressive credentials or degrees. Even high-profile scientists, professors, and public intellectuals can be seen as "fools" if they lack essence of wisdom.
</li><li><b>The Scale of Wisdom</b>: Wisdom and foolishness are not binary, but exist on a scale. The wisdom of an individual can be based on their actions and decisions, as compared to others. For example, a well-educated scientist is wise when compared to a high school dropout but not when compared to some of the greatest minds in history.
</li><li><b>Historical Examples of Wise Individuals</b>: Leo regards Greek philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, spiritual leaders like Buddha, Christ, Lao Tzu, Confucius, Rumi, and political figures like some US founding fathers and Gandhi as paragons of wisdom.
</li><li><b>The Highest Wisdom</b>: The highest wisdom, in LeoÂ’s perspective, is a state of selflessness and infinite love. This profound wisdom perceives everything in the universe as an expression of infinite love, intelligence, and consciousness, essentially God. Once individuals become infinitely conscious, they see every judgement as an ignorance and foolishness as reality is infinitely perfect.
</li><li><b>Developing Wisdom</b>: Leo proposes various methods to develop wisdom like consciousness work, self-reflection, introspection, deep questioning, deriving individual answers, consciously engaging with failure, mistakes, suffering, gathering diverse experiences, practicing selflessness, valuing wisdom, studying wisdom and foolishness, self-education, lifelong learning, reading high-quality books, studying history, learning lessons from history, exploring diverse perspectives, observing without judgement, solitude, solo retreats and avoiding the chase for pleasure.
</li><li><b>The Reward of Wisdom</b>: The ability to live a good life, peace, fulfillment, and right decisions are the rewards of wisdom. A life without wisdom is plagued by constant turmoil, agitation and lack of fulfillment.
</li><li><b>Wisdom vs Foolishness</b>: In this context, fools are described as those who lack the existential component and are merely mimicking survival without understanding the higher, more foundational aspects of life.
</li><li><b>Promoting Wisdom</b>: Leo ends this segment by advocating for the development of wisdom through self-education and practice of actions that are in line with wisdom. He particularly encourages viewers to watch videos on his website to learn more about various topics.
</li><li><b>Application of Wisdom</b>: Wisdom must be implemented and embodied, not just studied. Philosophy is about deeply contemplating reality and deriving personal answers. 
</li><li><b>Self-Deriving Wisdom</b>: While guidance may be provided, ultimately, the individual must contemplate and understand wisdom on their own. This personal understanding of wisdom can then be used to ask powerful questions about situations, advice received, or life decisions.
</li><li><b>Wisdom as a Self-Bootstrapping Process</b>: Gaining wisdom can be a self-contained process that makes individuals self-reliant. Although learning from others can help, the most profound answers are often found within oneself.
</li><li><b>Living Wisdom</b>: Once wisdom is understood, individuals should strive to follow the wisest course of action in every situation. This requires constant intention and pursuit of wisdom.
</li><li><b>Contemplation and Wisdom</b>: Spending time contemplating the meaning and application of wisdom is highly necessary. Tools like introspection, journaling, reading, and studying from multiple sources can aid the process.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org as a Wisdom School</b>: The resource actualized.org is presented as a "wisdom school," aiming to teach wisdom and help individuals cultivate wisdom in a broader sense, considering politics, economics, relationships, health, and more.
</li><li><b>Patience and Long-Term Vision</b>: The process of cultivating wisdom requires patience and a long-term vision. Starting immediately and chipping away at the process little by little can gradually build a comprehensive understanding of wisdom. 
</li><li><b>Wisdom as the Best Investment</b>: Cultivating one's wisdom is regarded as the best investment one can make, providing valuable insights across various aspects of life.
