hey leo here for actualised org and in this episode
I'm going to be talking about how to deal with
loneliness especially when you're doing personal development [Music] you this
issue of loneliness is a very common problem especially if
you're doing personal development or any kind of self-actualization work
or spiritual development work so if you identify with that
then this will be a great episode for you and
if you don't identify yourself as some kind of self-help
junkie or being into personal development yet if you're still
kind of new to all this personal development stuff then
maybe you're just here because hey you feel lonely you
feel like you don't have as many friends as your
friends do or maybe you want a relationship or something
like that and this loneliness keeps being a recurring pattern
for you and you want a solution so this will
be perfect for you as well because we're gonna get
to the root to the rock bottom of what loneliness
is and why it's there and what the ultimate solution
is so the reason that this is a very natural
and common problem with self actualize errs is because well
how else could it be I mean what you're doing
when your self actualizing is that you are raising yourself
above the vulgar common masses the people who are not
doing any inner work on themselves so you're growing yourself
you're meditating you're building good habits you're trying to eat
healthier you're trying to be more conscious and and you're
trying to get all these different pieces of your life
into place and you're trying to understand what reality really
is so you're seeking truth and you're becoming more aware
of your surroundings and a lot of the dysfunctions that
exist within society within your family within your social circles
and and so forth right so of course as you're
developing your awareness here as you're growing the people around
you are going to be beneath you in a sense
because they are doing the same work as you're doing
and in fact they're actively trying not to do that
work they're in denial about it so of course they're
not going to understand the new insights are having and
some of the amazing experiences that you're experiencing with your
growth and this is going to create a gap between
you especially with family members with people that are close
to you your old friends your values are gonna start
to change the way you're gonna carry yourself is gonna
start to change your behavior is gonna start to change
because what is growth but change you're changing yourself and
of course people don't feel comfortable when you start to
change yourself for a variety of reasons because they are
comfortable with you staying the way you were and they
don't like being shown that they are lazy and negligent
in their lives by your good example you see so
naturally there's gonna be a disconnect and you're gonna feel
like hey there's a real cost to doing personal development
which is this loneliness that I'm incurring and this is
one of the reasons why a lot of people stay
away from personal development and don't really get very far
is because as soon as they start to do a
little bit of personal development they see that this is
now taking them into the loneliness territory and they are
afraid of this they don't want to go down that
road so they say well I'll just stop and I'll
just do what everybody around me has been doing and
this gets them stuck so what's the solution to this
well I could give you a very easily a big
list of external solutions go do pickup go hit on
hot girls have sex with them that's fun right go
drinking with your friends build a large social circle play
the social circle game you know win friends and influence
people read that book and then do what that book
says or maybe you want to be a workaholic so
immerse yourself in your work start a business go start
to chase money and success or maybe join some volunteer
group or your church community your local community or maybe
some AAA group well maybe start doing online dating or
start a family of your own that's good right your
kids will occupy you and give you company or start
a hobby collect coins there may be joint sports go
play golf or a go play pick-up basketball or whatever
or maybe do Dungeons & Dragons and become a Dungeon
Master do that or throw parties get a nice fancy
house throw parties once a month and then be the
host to play that role of the host and you
get people coming there and befriending everybody do that or
maybe buy yourself a pet a dog or a cat
or some exotic animal and then that'll keep the company
for a good 10 20 years or hey come join
the actualize that work for them and you have a
group of people a support group for personal development right
but look at all this this here although it sounds
nice on paper and it might seem like yeah I
should just pick one of those and do that and
that'll cure me it cure me of my loneliness but
look these are all external solutions what is this really
gonna solve nothing it's not gonna really solve your loneliness
issue all you're doing if you're doing one of these
is you're sweeping the problem under the rug real growth
requires turning inwards I keep repeating that because that's a
huge theme and no matter how much I tell you
this you're still way too much oriented outwards with everything
that you're doing in your life which is why you're
not getting the kind of results from your life that
would really fulfill you and you're always looking for more
see the reality is is that if you are going
to undertake the hero's journey which I've talked about in
the past if you're gonna be a leader which I've
advocated in the past if you're gonna be a visionary
which I've advocated in the past if you're gonna be
a sage which I've advocated in the past then you
must face this issue of loneliness really face it not
ignore it with an external distraction but really face it
on the inside because take a look whether you're gonna
be a hero a leader a visionary a sage what
are you doing fundamentally you're going offroading see most people
in life they stay on the highways they stick to
the Main streets and you as being one of these
heroes leaders visionary sages what you've basically set yourself as
you know what I'm not satisfied with that I need
to go off-road and chart my own path through life
I need to find myself in life this is the
hero's journey and of course there aren't gonna be any
paved roads there may be some gravel roads at best
but mostly it's going to be like hiking through the
mud that's what it's going to be like and then
you know hacking through the forest I like this image
of hacking through the forest with a machete that's really
what it feels like and you know that's hard work
and you're doing it all by yourself this is not
a group effort you cannot raise your consciousness which is
what all personal development boils down to is raising your
consciousness you cannot do this through a group effort which
is why of course all religious endeavors to do that
have failed it doesn't work that way you have to
enter the belly of the whale all by yourself you
have to face all your inner demons all by yourself
not with your best friend not with your Facebook buddies
not even with your spouse see think about this even
you yourself don't really want to look inside and face
your inner demons head-on so how can you expect other
people like your family members and your friends to join
you in that process you yourself don't want to do
it which is why you're looking for all these distractions
and while you're feeling lonely and you're looking for some
sort of quick fix let me tell you why you're
lonely you're lonely because fundamentally you're disconnected from being and
from your true self being is such a beautiful and
an amazing thing when you're actually conscious of it being
being is what's happening right this very second being is
the substance out of which everything is made all of
reality is being but you don't really experience that you're
not connected with that because you're lost in a landscape
of conceptual construction and you're living in the past and
in the future and this is a lot more profound
of a problem than you appreciate at the moment so
what needs to happen here is you need to connect
back with being because as soon as you do that
you will realize that there is there is no need
for friends or anybody else to be here to sweeten
the present moment being is plenty sweet enough by itself
in fact the magical thing about being is that it's
it gets even sweeter in solitude once you're really going
to connect with being once you start to tap into
your true self you're gonna want more and more time
by yourself so that you can really bask in the
being and really appreciate it so what's the solution here
the solution is that you need to get serious about
your growth bite the bullet in this case and face
the solitude head-on you need to expose yourself to the
loneliness go through that initial hump of being lonely tame
the loneliness connect yourself to being and then center yourself
in solitude solitude is your Center it's the thing that
grounds you if like the bedrock of your whole life
it's your compass because you return to it to ground
yourself in being and then you make little forays out
from this Center of Solitude to interact with people and
you know you could be part of society I'm not
telling you that you have to become a hermit for
the rest of your life I'm just saying you need
to face this issue seriously at least once in your
life and for many people they've never done that they've
always been running away and what you don't want to
do is make the mistake of continue to be running
away decade after decade after decade until you're 60 years
old and then you're still dealing with this fear of
loneliness except now it's getting much worse because now it's
connected with your old age and not being good-looking anymore
and it's even harder to find friends it's harder to
found find spot spouses and girlfriends and boyfriends and of
course death is nipping at your heels and this issue
now becomes much more challenging to deal with better to
deal with it now while you're still young this issue
of loneliness is a lot deeper than it seems it's
not just that oh yeah you want some friends in
your life to keep you company because you enjoy their
company at the very level at the ultimate absolute truth
level what you can discover is that you are alone
in this universe it's all just you that's what non-duality
means is that there's nothing here but you you have
always been interacting with yourself the whole time just not
fully conscious of that now that's a very deep insight
that I don't expect you to just understand from hearing
it in fact what I'm saying right now sounds ridiculous
maybe you can take it as a metaphor and make
sense of it that way but what I mean is
actually literally one of the most amazing insights I've had
and this was on my five Meo breakthrough is when
I became conscious of my true nature as absolute infinity
I became conscious that there's nothing but me here it's
me as God playing hide and seek with myself and
that's a very important insight to have because it completely
changes your understanding and attitude about solitude and loneliness you
might seem well that's kind of I mean you might
seem to you like well that's kind of bleakly oh
that's sort of a very solid Cystic view of reality
no not at all when you actually directly experience this
and you you you experience it and you connect with
being at the same time and when you're really connected
with being you're no longer lonely there's sort of beauty
to it so ultimately this is the thing you've been
kind of running away from this is what what's at
the center of the black hole that you've been sort
of orbiting an orbiting orbiting for most of your life
but you've never really looked inside and so what I
want to encourage you to do is to actually look
inside it's not as bad as it seems the hardest
part is the initial hump of just sitting there in
that solitude and really wanting to connect with somebody I've
been there I know how that feels you know you
really want a girlfriend or you really want a husband
or you you just you're alone in a different City
you have no friends you just move there and it's
like well this sucks I'm just sitting here all by
myself this is so depressing this sucks but that is
your biggest opportunity right there is to face that what
I want you to do is I want you to
open yourself up to to just face it sort of
like jumping into a cold pool right just do it
just do it because in the end you got to
realize think about this from the biggest possible perspective your
death is coming and is guaranteed and you will face
your death all alone no matter how many friends you
have no matter how popular you are of a celebrity
no matter how rich you are no matter how close
of a family you build how many kids you have
on that deathbed you will be facing death alone even
if there are a hundred people around you also in
your most difficult times when you're suffering the most when
you're the most scared in life when you're the most
confused you're going to face that all alone you see
you're not going to be able to share that emotional
burden with anybody hell you hesitate to even share it
with yourself see let alone sharing it with the people
you're not gonna be able to it's just beyond the
realm of communication also your deepest inner demons will have
to be faced alone nobody knows what your deepest inner
demons are even you probably don't know unless you've done
some serious personal development work already and that of course
requires loss of solitude so even you probably don't know
what your inner demons are how do you expect other
people to know let alone to be there to support
you it's gonna be all on you that's why you're
the hero of your life that's why we talk about
the hero's journey and also and this is very interesting
is that you you need to learn to face the
beauty and awesomeness of life all alone because the deepest
most profound beauty of life is so beautiful that it
cannot be shared with anybody now you might say well
leo i had some ecstasy or some MDMA and with
my friends and and we all had fun and we
had this beautiful connection or or i was making love
to some woman or to some man and we had
this amazing connection and felt like we shared you know
our souls connected and we shared the beauty of reality
yeah you can have those kinds of moments and those
are great those are wonderful but that is like the
tip of the iceberg of the beauty of reality see
most people have never actually experienced the bottom of the
iceberg it's so incredibly beautiful that it just leaves you
gasping for breath and speechless and struggling to think about
how could I possibly share this with anybody you see
because fundamentally life is a first-person phenomenon it's a phenomenon
of consciousness and awareness which is happening to you it's
not something that happens through words or through symbols it's
happening directly to you and so ultimately the book has
to stop with you you have to face that beauty
yourself that beauty is maddening because it's so beautiful you
want to share it but then you know you can't
and the deeper you go into the beauty the more
you realize that there's no one out of all your
acquaintances or your family that could ever possibly understand this
beauty because they have to be doing this work the
prize of the hero the holy grail is the beauty
of life that's basically what the Holy Grail is but
but it's not as as as nice as it sounds
on paper right because it's not just like by like
you're looking at some beautiful painting in a museum and
then you could take your friends there to look at
it with you it's not like that you take you
can't really take a photograph of it one of my
biggest struggles with with this work with actualised or with
all my videos is how do I communicate the beauty
of what I've experienced it's so profound that as much
time as I spend trying to be a better communicator
and learning how to articulate myself better and using analogies
and metaphors the deepest stuff I will never be able
to communicate with you and I have not even come
close to plumbing the depths of the beauty of being
so if you want to live a good life you
have to this is one of the challenges you just
have to face right this is what life is about
so you might as well face up to it now
rather than putting it off like you have in the
good news is that all the answers to life that
you seek out there somewhere are really all inside you
all it requires is really just turning inward and entering
that solitude and then basking that solitude for a good
long while and not running away that is tracking yourself
with entertainment or other stuff and the more you do
that the more you'll get in touch with the unspeakable
beauty of reality of being and then that will penetrate
through into your everyday actions behaviors and thoughts and the
people around you will wonder you know what's what's up
with this guy or this girl you know something's different
about her but they don't know that what's different about
you is that you've seen the unspeakable beauty of reality
and you've actually taken the time and effort to integrate
it whereas most people are just kind of bumbling through
life and just skimming the surface of life and missing
99% of all the beauty that's there the end goal
for you with personal development is that you want to
be able to be the last man on earth so
to speak and still be happy so that you need
nobody to be happy because you are so thrilled with
the joy of existence itself of some the simplicity of
being but also the profundity of being and you're so
connected with that that everything else is a bonus which
does not mean that I'm telling you that you need
to become the next Unabomber and isolate yourself you can
still interact with people you can still be social but
it's all gonna be icing on the cake and you're
not gonna be sad when that part of your life
is missing and in fact you're gonna crave solitude but
that's gonna take time you got to really do this
you see so the high-level solution here is to develop
a strong relationship with yourself commit to the path of
self-actualization personal development really take this on as your mission
in life this is not just a little hobby or
side tangent to the rest of your life no this
is the the core of your life and everything else
that you think was the main track of your life
that is the real tangent see it's making that shift
also developing a strong relationship with nature there's nothing quite
like being all alone by yourself out in nature to
really connect you to what I'm talking about here in
this episode also part of the high-level solution is find
your life purpose what are you here on earth to
do what is your life about what is your singular
purpose and I have a whole course on that which
I won't get into here another component of the high-level
solution is to start living a contemplative lifestyle I've talked
about that in the past the life of a philosopher
the life of someone who actually thinks about existence and
lives and structures their life in a way that's in
accordance with existence itself and not with all the human
constructs that are so popular with entertainment with family and
friends and various social systems and communities and organizations all
that stuff that's all human constructions you see and human
constructions they're sort of flimsy they come and go they
also have this sort of impure stench of ego about
them because all these constructions are all ego constructions for
the most part and they all involve politics if you
haven't noticed yet they all involve bickering and power struggles
and greed in fear and and all so all the
all the dark elements of the ego come into this
right and so really it's a it's a temporary all
the human constructions are our chip stuff and a good
contrast to that is being out in nature that's why
if you like being out in nature that's probably why
is because you see the the sort of innocence of
nature because nature is free of ego whereas all the
human constructions are full of ego they're full of they're
full of delusion full of nonsense full of double-talk sea
full of manipulation and ultimately that's all the stuff you
want to move from away from in your life that's
all the stuff it's causing you suffering so as you're
developing yourself you're moving further away from ego you're releasing
your own ego and then of course that's gonna be
reflected in your surroundings and what you want your lifestyle
to be so I've talked in the past about developing
a minimalist sort of lifestyle which is the kind of
lifestyle that contemplative people sages philosophers of the past mystics
have all gravitated towards this isn't an accident this is
for a good reason because it's this minimalist contemplative sort
of lifestyle that gets you the most juice out of
life because that's what you need to really connect to
being notice that being alone is simpler than being part
of a herd it's actually more rewarding and more fulfilling
because when you're alone that's when you get the deepest
connection to reality possible and I'm not just saying as
an introvert yes I am a pretty strong introvert and
you might say well Leo this is all you know
might work well for introverts but what about extroverts I'm
sure extroverts need more socialization than introverts do okay fine
and I'm not telling you here that you never socialize
you can socialize I'm just saying that the deepest stuff
in life will be found alone by yourself in solitude
by facing this issue head-on even if you're an extrovert
and actually there's an interesting phenomena that happens which I
want to talk about in more detail in the future
but eventually introversion and extraversion they're like a circle and
they tend to go for a circle and turn into
each other you become a strong enough introvert you actually
become an extrovert and then if you become a strong
enough extrovert you become an introvert you see because what
happens is that there's a sort of like figure-ground reversal
and at some point you become so conscious that you
realize that everything you thought that was inside of you
you know your whole introverted landscape everything conceptual and all
your feelings and emotions that actually they were never separate
from the outside the outside and the inside are really
one and that all these feelings are emotions they're not
taking place deep inside your brain somewhere back there they're
all out here everything is happening inside of one container
you see and so really there's a fusion of the
inner world in the outer world they come together and
that's where introversion and extraversion get transcended really you transcend
those those very limited human distinctions as you go deeper
into this work so that's the high level solution but
how do you actually implement this let me give you
three simple techniques one is the solo ten-day retreat which
I just released a video on recently go check that
out I talked about how to set that up also
go check out my blog Rev videos and various blog
posts about how to set that up basically what this
is is you go all by yourself isolate yourself in
the woods somewhere in nature for 10 days straight without
talking to any people no cell phones no technology just
you sitting alone on a couch for 10 days straight
man that is probably the most direct way that you
can face this issue of loneliness head-on and you will
be amazed at you know for the first few days
it'll be torture for you and you'll feel like my
loneliness is only getting worse this seems to be only
making things worse but then once you get to day
seven day eight day nine day ten there will be
a shift in you you will pass that hump you
will break through and you will connect with the beauty
of being and it will feel like you're alive for
the very first time in your life and then you'll
really understand what I'm talking about here and you'll be
so glad you did this and you'll grow so much
just from sitting alone on a couch you don't have
to read books or do anything you don't even have
to meditate just sit alone on a couch for 12
hours a day for ten days and you will grow
more than you've grown in years it's amazing the trick
is actually going and doing it committing to it and
then sticking through it and then not breaking that 10-day
solitude that's not an easy thing to do so that's
one really powerful technique try that another one is do
a solo psychedelic trip one the reasons I'll talk about
psychedelics a lot is because they're one of the few
technologies that we have that allows me to in sort
of a way to communicate the beauty of being I
can't do it through language I can't do it through
metaphors and talking but one way I can do is
I can just tell you to go do some psychedelic
trips all by yourself in a very serious sort of
spiritual manner not in a recreational manner and face yourself
face that fear face the loneliness face any kind of
pain or sadness that you have leaned into that embrace
it soak it soak into it rather and you will
eventually conquer your loneliness and then when you're out with
friends having fun it'll be all the better because it'll
just be icing on the cake right the foundation will
be there so try that I have many trip reports
so you can go back and I'm and read those
and I'll have more in the future and then the
third method I'll give you is a solo travel what
I found is that society because society is a social
endeavor by its nature our culture tries to tell us
that doing stuff by yourself is somehow wrong or somehow
weird or abnormal so like if I want to go
travel to Disneyland by myself and I tell my friends
about that they'd be like well that's weird why would
you go to distantly I'd all by yourself shouldn't you
like go with your girlfriend with your family with friends
isn't that like the right way to do it no
I mean there's nothing wrong with going with your friends
per se but also just solo travel is a powerful
way to connect with that solitude especially when you're going
out in nature so Disneyland is probably not the best
place to go but you know go to some national
forests or go to some famous monument sites all around
the world or around the u.s. wherever you are you
can find them around Europe you can find them anywhere
you can find them temples monasteries you know whatever go
there just travel through and explore the area by yourself
explore a new city by yourself this is something that
most people I think would be afraid to do because
in the back of your mind you've got that programming
that's telling you let you know don't don't do stuff
by yourself it's just weird you know if you're a
woman you would feel weird going to a bar all
by yourself without your girlfriends and hell even if you're
a guy you probably feel very weird going to a
bar or a club all by yourself without your guy
friends unless maybe you've done a ton of pickup and
now you've acclimated yourself to that but even there you
know going out solo is very challenging but it also
grows you the most you really connect with your emotions
you have to feel your emotions when you're alone you
see you're not distracting yourself and those are some of
the most beautiful memories I in my life is actually
not the these these you know ecstatic highs of enormous
raw pleasure but actually some of the most memorable things
that I can think of in my life were those
moments where I was alone by myself and I was
going through a tough time I had some very strong
emotions and we would say normally that these were negative
and bad emotions a lot of my best memories are
sort of melancholy where I was by myself working through
something whether it was back in middle school or in
high school you know I was never very social and
so most of my time I spent by myself just
thinking about life reflecting contemplating experiencing or when I was
trying to get a girlfriend and I couldn't because I
sucked at attracting women and then I spent you know
many nights going home from a bar from a club
on the brink of tears on the brink of tears
because I was so lonely but then again those were
some of the best moments and what I want to
really drive home to you here is that you gotta
bite the bullet on this one when you're feeling that
melancholy play into it actually play it up the way
that I'll do that is all I'll actually play some
sad music I have a whole playlist of sad songs
it's called sad songs that's what I call it and
I'll just play that whenever I want to sort of
contemplate or kind of go into a melancholic sort of
mood and those are some of the best moments I
have in life but I also had to develop a
sort of taste for that that's an acquired taste culture
tells us that this is wrong that something's wrong with
you when you do this actually no this is this
is what life is all about because in the end
you're all alone here and all the all the other
stuff is distractions and all that other stuff will fall
away it's very flimsy what's rock-solid is your loneliness see
but you can convert that to your advantage let the
solitude massage you when you feel that very bitter cold
biting loneliness don't run away from it don't go turn
on the TV or read some blog or something play
some lonely music and just savour it and think about
life think about existence think about your own death think
about how evil mankind is to each other think about
how people hate each other and why it's so difficult
for people to love each other why people are so
closed-minded rather than open-minded why people are so greedy and
fearful and petty that's the stuff that really grows you
and then after you've done that go cultivate some good
friendships go get yourself a good girlfriend or boyfriend and
contribute something of value to the world when you're contributing
something of value to the world and you're drawing your
inspiration from your solitude the solitude makes you super creative
solitude is what gives you the vision of a genius
that most people can never understand it gives you foresight
it gives you wisdom and then you can draw on
that and then use that as the foundation or the
the spring from which you then contribute value to the
world have your impact with your life purpose and that
becomes a very beautiful and rewarding thing but be careful
not to make this contributing value to the world and
also cultivating good relationships or friendships don't make that the
centerpiece that is secondary to what I've been talking about
here is building this foundation by actually facing your solitude
see make sure you don't make that mistake get your
priorities straight and then your life will be amazing and
then you will have so much more fulfillment than if
you just did the thing that most people do which
has just become more socially active when they're lonely you
see that's easy every fool can do that but that
doesn't really solve the core issue and console yourself on
this journey because you're a here on this journey and
sometimes you're gonna get lonely and sometimes gonna feel like
you're stuck in the middle of the woods all by
yourself and life isn't going your way and maybe you
feel like you're lost and maybe you even feel so
sad you need to cry you feel depressed you feel
hopeless you feel like you'll never find that spouse that
wife that husband that girlfriend or boyfriend or whatever or
that circle of friends that you love to hang out
with you know and you you envy that you see
that in other places you see that on the TVs
that with your friends and you want that for yourself
but what you got to remind yourself is that you're
catching a bigger fish here they are frying small fish
you're after the whale and the whale is finding your
authentic self getting to the holy grail facing all your
inner demons really growing yourself right remember keep reminding yourself
when you're getting discouraged on this path and you have
no one to talk to keep console and reminding yourself
that this is the most important aspect of life is
facing being and personal development what you're doing here is
such a big thing personal development nobody around you is
wise enough it has enough foresight to do this but
you is it gonna be tough and lonely sometimes hell
yeah it is but keep reminding yourself that you're after
the holy grail and that this is the hero's journey
and if there are many threshold Guardians on the hero's
journey you just got to push through them and if
that means talking to yourself talk to yourself if that
means like you're looking a little weird or crazy look
a little weird or crazy huh yeah it's just life
is here for you by you in you of you
it's all you you you you you you and that
might sound like all that's that's very egotistical no actually
the opposite is egotistical is when you separate life into
pieces and everything is fragmented and you don't see that
it's all you and you're disconnected from that and then
you treat other people as though they can give you
something as though sex or approval or a good conversation
is what's gonna really fulfill you in life no those
things are icing on the cake you got to get
the cake right if you don't get the cake down
all those things they will never fulfill you'll be chasing
those for the rest of your life you think one
good girlfriend will be enough for you no it won't
not if you don't fix this foundation problem you think
that you know having a bunch of kids will be
enough for you no it won't because your kids will
run off they'll leave the nest and then what are
you gonna do you're gonna be back right where you
started only now you're gonna be 60 years old and
what are you gonna do then all right and your
husband might leave you and so forth and what are
you gonna do then you're gonna be right back where
you started only worse because you've been avoiding this problem
all right that's it that's all I have to say

share the steps with a friend leave your comments down
below and lastly come check out actualized I run right
here I have resources for you there my book lists
my life purpose course the forum which is basically a
support group for people who are doing self-actualization and who
feel lonely sometimes so that there are support groups out
there that you can join like the forum and speaking
of the book list I actually recently updated my book
list so go check that out I added twenty more
new books and actually one extra tip I'll give you
about combating loneliness specifically for people who are self-help junkies
is surround yourself with good books and good mentors and
by mentors these can be virtual mental they don't have
to be face to face one of the ways that
I get a lot of human contact sort of pseudo
human contact without actually having lots of friends or people
around me in my life I'm a very solitary person
is that I surround myself with audio books videos seminars
lectures regular books I'm reading this all the time so
I do sort of have this pseudo human connection and
this is a great way especially like audiobooks are a
great way to kill and take the edge off you
know if you're just lonely for weeks and weeks and
months and months on end and you have no human
beings around you at least get that into your life
and so if you want some ideas for that check
out the book list about half the books on my
book list about a hundred out of all the 200
of them there are available on audible as audiobooks so
very easy to listen to and turn all those into
your virtual mentors as though you're having conversations with these
people it might sound like well Leo what if I
become crazy like just some crazy old person talking to
myself you don't understand you already are a crazy person
talking to yourself maybe not out loud but in your
head with your monkey mind it's already as bad as
it can possibly be you're just not conscious of that
yet probably so forget all that if you want to
talk to yourself talk to yourself no problem there you
already do anyways so you're not going to go crazy
and actually when you find your deepest foundation and connect
with being you'll find that relating and socializing other people
becomes a lot more authentic a lot more fulfilling and
a lot more enjoyable so check out those resources and
stay tuned for next week for more you
