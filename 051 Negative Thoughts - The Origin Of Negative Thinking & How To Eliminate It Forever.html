            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/mggupbkTmWc' target='_blank'>Negative Thoughts - The Origin Of Negative Thinking & How To Eliminate It Forever</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Origin of Negative Thoughts</b>: Negative thoughts, also called automatic negative thoughts, emerge without conscious input throughout the day. These thoughts may revolve around relationships, work situations, personal failure, and financial worries. Our minds are adept at projecting and amplifying our deepest fears, shaping them into catastrophic scenarios that provoke stress and anxiety.
</li><li><b>Rooting of Fears</b>: The central fears that drive negative thinking often originate from childhood or early adulthood experiences. They shape our perception and filter our day-to-day experiences. Some common fears include fear of failure, fear of poverty and homelessness, fear of loneliness and rejection, and fear of humiliation. 
</li><li><b>Awareness and Identification of Negative Thoughts</b>: The first step toward eliminating negative thoughts is becoming more aware of them and identifying the fears behind them. Leo suggests a self-observation exercise over three days, where one pauses for five minutes at random times to introspect about their feelings and thoughts. This helps in identifying what triggers your feelings of fear, stress, and anxiety.
</li><li><b>Strategy to Eliminate Negative Thoughts</b>: Developing an awareness of negative thoughts and their root causes can take time. It is natural for humans to have negative thoughts due to the workings of our lower brain or reptilian brain, which prioritizes survival. Therefore, eliminating negative thoughts will not happen immediately, but being aware of them is the first step on that path. 
</li><li><b>Tasks for Managing Negative Thoughts</b>: Leo recommends making a list of all negative thoughts that cross your mind over three days and categorizing them to ascertain whether they primarily involve relationships, finances, fears of failure or other aspects. Tracking and categorizing these thoughts is a means to better understand the source of negative thinking and the fear it stems from.
</li><li><b>Reptilian Brain and Its Survival-Based Functions</b>: The 'reptilian brain', or the lower part of our brain, evolved millions of years ago during the reptilian phase of life. Its purpose was primarily survival-based, responsible for fight-or-flight responses. When survival is threatened, this part of the brain takes priority, shutting off other aspects such as higher values, goals, and ideals. These fundamental fears are grounded in our reptilian brain, which has a greater influence than the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for conscious thought. 
</li><li><b>Prefrontal Cortex and Higher Ideals</b>: The prefrontal cortex of the brain is where conscious thoughts, larger ideals, goals, visions, and the desire to bring about a positive change in the world, originate from. However, in order to honour these higher ideals, it is essential to quiet the reptilian brain and ensure it is not overstressed.
</li><li><b>Addressing Negative Thoughts</b>: Negative thoughts are a result of the reptilian brain's hypersensitivity to perceived threats. It requires significant effort to recondition this part of the brain and reshape ingrained negative thought habits formed over a lifetime. Starting with awareness, habits can aid the reshaping of negative thought patterns.
</li><li><b>Strategies to Counter Negative Thoughts</b>: Affirmations, performed for five or ten minutes in the morning, and meditation, which aims to silence the mind and foster contentment in the present moment, are effective ways to eliminate negative thoughts. Involvement in creative pursuits or causes outside oneself, could also help in diverting focus from negative thoughts.
</li><li><b>Contribution to Society</b>: Having an outward focus and contributing positively to society, through means like innovation, running a beneficial business, or supporting a relevant cause, can help counter a downward spiral of negativity. By focusing on what one can do and contribute, the trend of negativity can be reversed.
</li><li><b>The Complexity of Negative Thoughts</b>: Negative thoughts are insidious and complex, and mastering them requires more detailed and advanced techniques beyond the scope of this summary. For additional resources and strategies, Leo Gura recommends visiting actualized.org, where comprehensive personal development videos and a range of techniques involving meditation and journaling are available. A free newsletter can provide regular updates on mastering emotions, success, personal development, and negative thoughts.
