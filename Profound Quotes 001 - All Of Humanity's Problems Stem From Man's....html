hey this is Leo for actualised org and welcome to
this profound quotes segment so this kind of segment what
we do is we take a major quote from somebody
great in human history and we dissect it and we
take a look at how it can have a profound
effect in your life if you just think about it
and apply it all of humanity's problems stem from man's
inability to sit quietly in a room alone so this
is one of my favorite quotes because it goes to
the heart of the problem that so many of us
have today especially in this overly stimulated interconnected entertained world
that we're living in where everything is convenient and it's
easy to plug into the matrix so to speak and
get your quick hit of stimulation and then to stay
plugged in and to not do the mental work that
people use to do that we now take for granted
so what does Pascal really saying here when he's talking
about all of humanity's problems stemming from the fact that
men are unable to sit alone in a room and
I might add women as well and maybe even especially
women should be doing more of this that Blaise Pascal
here is advocating so what we're talking about here is
the idea that you need to do more contemplation this
is something that when you say it in our modern
times it sounds a contemplation like what the hell is
this this is something philosophical something abstract something theoretical something
not something that's cool or hip right nobody really tells
you to be doing this stuff in the past actually
this is where great ideas have come from this is
how great people accomplish great things all the greats that
you know of from from history all the people that
have really influenced culture and society and science I'm talking
about philosophers mathematicians scientists humanitarians psychologists even political figures great
leaders in current society and past society if they've contributed
anything meaningful to us they've done it because they've taken
time solitude where they were able to sit down and
come up with something new something original or at least
something that's more honest and more authentic something that is
profound that they can then take back and share with
the rest of us that's how some of these quotes
come about that's how great ideas come about so whether
you think about Aristotle and Plato Marcus Aurelius the Buddha
or moving closer to modern times with Isaac Newton Albert
Einstein great novelists Henry David Thoreau Emerson and then moving
into current modern times people from Gandhi to whis and
Churchill all of these individuals what did they do they
took time to sit down to think there's something very
magical about this period of solitude and contemplation where you
pull yourself completely out of the world and you become
a hermit at least for a little bit maybe for
just thirty minutes maybe for just an hour maybe for
a whole day maybe for a whole weekend you can
decide on the length of time here but the idea
is that you pull yourself out so that you can
let your thoughts and your creative juices kind of percolate
and you just let your brain marinate in your own
creative goodness you think about all the stuff that you
have accumulated throughout your life and throughout your day all
the information all the knowledge and then you let something
just happen with that right that's where creativity comes from
I find that too many of us nowadays are so
overstimulated that we're always going and we're doing the next
thing our schedule is so full we take no time
to ourselves and I don't mean just to even relax
that's a good place to start but I'm taking it
one step further not only should you be taking time
to yourself just to relax and unwind and not be
working all the time or doing crazy crazy activities talking
with friends and all that just pull yourself out of
that but you should also spend time being a student
being a student of yourself being a student of life
being a student of the things that have happened to
you today or the things that have happened to you
this week keeping a journal and actually doing contemplation that
means thinking about things thinking about how stuff comes together
asking yourself questions like what is true what is false
why did I do that today why did he do
this today and there is a big difference between sitting
down and doing this sort of contemplation in a very
conscious methodical way and then sitting down and or not
even sitting down but just doing it as you're running
around throughout your day and being frantic and hectic and
anxious that's not what I'm talking about I'm not talking
about those crazy back-and-forth debates that you have with yourself
on your way to work as to how you're gonna
yell at that person who's not doing what they need
to be doing or how the boss is gonna be
yelling at you and what you're gonna say in defense
of that that's anxious neurotic thought no no I'm talking
about peaceful calm very constructive creative thought this is where
you sit down and you think about what is it
that I want to create and what are some ideas
that I just as a human being having a brain
and having a rational capacity should be thinking through this
is so missed I find that 99% of people do
not do this and this is why they not only
do they not get the kind of results that they
could be getting in their life but it seems really
even worse like Pascale tells us it's really the cause
of humanity's problems so a lot of the problems in
your life and a lot of the problems in political
life a lot of the problems in business life a
lot of the problems in your relationship a lot of
those are simply because you're always doing doing doing doing
and you're not thinking through your actions you're not thinking
through them very clearly when you go back and you
read and you kind of study the biographies and the
stories ancient philosophers and modern era scientists and by modern
era I mean like the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment
era thinkers this was like the 1600s a 1700 to
1800 when you look and you study those people you
immediately see that the people that were great and the
people that you read about the reason you read about
them is because they were deep thinkers and they did
this because they were able to isolate themselves they were
not social butterflies some of them were but then they
were able to pull themselves out somebody for example that
comes to mind is Benjamin Franklin he he's a deeply
contemplative man and when you read his writings and you
read his quotes and you read about him you can
see that he's an amazing powerful genius intellect and he
cultivates that by sitting down by himself in solitude and
theabout that stuff on the other hand he was also
very sociable and very social and so he was able
to make strike a balance between those those two so
I'm not saying that you should become a hermit here
or become a Buddha I'm saying that you should just
take more more time to contemplate more time to think
about stuff when you actually do this and you don't
just sit here and listen to me talking to you
about this but you actually go out and you try
to do this and I would challenge you right now
to do this exercise find 60 minutes where you can
sit down in a quiet room maybe like in your
bedroom just sit down and have absolutely nothing to do
is open and just sit there for 60 minutes straight
and just see what happens see what happens I think
what you'll notice if you do this it's amazing because
you haven't done it for so long that you literally
don't have the willpower to sit there to do it
your mind is gonna go crazy on you it's gonna
be like a stark raving lunatic jumping from wall to
wall inside you're inside your head inside your skull this
is what's gonna be happening is because your mind is
so used to stimulation right now you know you need
that hit of tasty food you need to plug into
that television that internet you need to call your friend
chat with them check your email go to work and
and do whatever you got to do there or then
go and be in your relationship or be immersed in
your family life you're doing all this stuff and you
don't even realize what it feels like just to like
take a breath and to sit I'm not even talking
about meditation I'm just talking about sit and just let
whatever thoughts come to mind and think them through there's
something very powerful about that what you'll notice if you
do this exercise number one is I want you to
notice how much your body not even your mind but
your body resists if you do this you will literally
notice that your body starts to shake you're gonna be
like a heroin addict who's been off of heroin for
a few days or maybe a week and now you're
really feeling it and you're feeling yourself coming off and
you're literally getting your body's gonna start to have withdrawal
symptoms you're gonna start coming up with all sorts of
excuses for why you need to get up why you
need to scratch yourself why you're not being comfortable why
don't you change positions maybe you need to go to
the bathroom maybe you need to go eat because you're
hungry your mind is gonna start coming up with all
these excuses and then your body's actually gonna start to
like tremble and shake a little bit if you just
kind of try to keep it still for 60 minutes
straight because you've been so conditioned to stimulation now it
just feels like your life is empty when you're not
always running all the time it feels like it feels
so slow and so still it just feels very awkward
very weird notice that notice your body resisting notice the
things that are happening in your mind - as a
second point notice what starts coming up what kind of
thoughts negative thoughts positive thoughts creative thoughts neurotic thoughts what
starts happening where your thoughts start to lead you in
what direction and then after you do notice this of
course try to guide them in a more positive direction
and just sit there and think and start thinking maybe
about some topic pick a topic they wanna think about
maybe you want to think about the business that you're
starting or some project that you're working on or a
relationship that you want to improve or your health that
you want to improve or yourself your life the trajectory
of your life start thinking about something like that and
notice what happens throughout that 60 minutes I bet you
that those first 10 20 minutes are gonna be very
hectic chaotic your mind is not gonna be able to
stay still then if you kind of force your mind
and you persist and you keep on the same topic
without straying too far you're going to start to notice
that your mind gears up and it gets on board
and maybe you have some sort of project that you're
interested like you're interested in improving your health let's say
and so now your mind is gonna start thinking about
that well I could start improving my gym routine by
maybe watching some videos maybe there was this book I
wanted to read maybe I'll buy that maybe I'll go
out there and get myself enrolled into some sort of
class I'll take a yoga class or whatever maybe I'll
go and I'll talk to my buddy I know a
buddy who wanted to become a gym partner with me
and so maybe he'll join up you know your mind
will start to think about all these different ideas that
you can now use as a spotter for for generating
a great life here it's gonna be your health if
you start thinking about your business you're gonna start to
come up with ideas for your business these ideas sometimes
they come up throughout your day when you're in your
shower you're doing this and that but I find it's
very different when you do that by sitting down in
a dedicated block of time and actually thinking it through
and giving yourself space to really think about that maybe
even having some paper and a pen handy so you
can jot down some notes and some ideas because what
you'll find is if you do this and you start
developing a habit of doing this every few days or
every week you spend an hour doing this this kind
of alone quiet solitude time and you start thinking about
something like your business you're gonna start to find that
you get new creative ideas and those ideas are gonna
kind of snowball and build on top of each other
and you're gonna really create something something powerful something something
new this is how stuff is created and the reason
may be that you are not living up to your
full potential right now and you feel like you're procrastinating
or that dream project that you wanted to start that
dream career you wanted to go into is not happening
for you it's probably because you're so plugged into everything
that you're so busy and you know what you're busy
doing the wrong things and in fact those things that
you're busy doing are probably causing problems for Humanity as
Pascal said so instead what the takeaway is here is
to do this exercise sit alone in an empty room
without any stimulation and see what comes out I think
you will be shocked surprised and very challenged by this
