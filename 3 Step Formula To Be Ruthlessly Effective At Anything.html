hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to give you a simple three-step formula
for how to be ruthlessly effective at anything this formula
that I'm about to describe will work for anything so
whether you want to be ruthlessly effective at dating in
business in school music art sports meditation relationships sexuality it
doesn't matter it'll work for anything here's the key is
that you're going to basically find one tactic that works
extremely well and then you're going to exploit it and
that's the gist what we're talking about here now let
me give you the three-step formula and I'll summarize it
and I'll go into some details and I'll give you
examples of how to apply it so the first step
is select your domain select your domain this means that
you're going to find and set an intention a deliberate
specific clear intention for what it is you want to
be ruthlessly effective at so it doesn't matter like I
said what it is it can be anything now just
as an example in this episode I'm going to use
becoming a farmer just a throw away example something silly
that we can use that will help us illustrate this
formula so let's say you wanted to be the best
most effective corn farmer okay so if you want that
then make the decision that that's what you want and
be specific about it what do you want exactly why
do you want it right set that intention that's step
number one so the farmer would say okay I'm gonna
be a ruthlessly effective corn farmer and I'm really serious
about it I'm not kidding this is my mission this
is what I set out to do for myself for
whatever reason it's important to me and that's all that
matters that's step number one step number two is the
one that does a lot of the heavy lifting in
this formula so listen close you're going to notice one
exceptionally effective high yield technique a technique that generates a
disproportionate amount of tangible results it's kind of a mouthful
so let's unpack that it's real simple you just need
to find one technique that's what we would call a
high impact or high leverage technique that means it generates
some tangible results and you can see that is generated
some tangible results that means it's kind of a proven
technique for you you've proved it to yourself so if
you're this corn farmer there's a lot of different ways
that you might go about trying to grow corn effectively
maybe what you need to do is you need to
buy some new land and that might be one technique
or maybe another thing you could try is you could
try buying a new type of corn seed maybe there's
a more effective strain of corn that you could be
growing something that grows faster and bigger so that could
be another technique you could try another thing you could
try is maybe changing the fertilizer or fertilizing your corn
more often that might be a third thing you could
try a fourth thing you could try is maybe watering
your plants on a different schedule or putting in a
new sprinkler system to water your crops right so those
are just some ideas random ideas now what you need
to do is you just need to find one really
high yield technique so let's say you're this farmer and
you're doing your farm stuff and then you know over
the course of some several months you're as you're taking
or tinkering around on your farm with your corn you
discover that hey what really makes a big difference is
when I add the right fertilizer often let's say if
I add the right fertilizer every day to my crop
then that's the thing that seems to produce a tangible
result I can see the chrome the the corn actually
growing faster when that happens okay so I found it
I found my high yield technique that's step number two
and the key there is to actual consciously deliberately identify
it right out of all the different techniques that you
know which one is the high-yield one select it and
then the third step is set up a daily habit
to use this technique every single day with that exception
and make a hundred percent commitment to be using this
technique no matter what that's step number three and that's
it and if you do that if you follow through
on all those three steps I guarantee you will be
very very effective in any field of life that you
want to be effective at now the real secret to
this formula is step number two it's finding that high
yield technique now I hear you what you might be
saying use my system like well leo but how the
hell do I find one of these high yield techniques
this seems like it's something hard to do how do
I invent such a technique and here's the beauty of
this is that you don't have to invent the technique
the technique comes about naturally it's a spontaneous discovery that
comes after you've really followed through on step number one
remember step number one is setting that intention and being
very clear about what it is you want to be
effective at and setting a commitment to becoming effective if
you do that and you keep that at the forefront
of your mind for a period of time you not
not just for a day or for a week but
for weeks and months if you do that eventually what
will happen in whatever field you're involved in you know
if you're involved in art or music or sports or
education or business I mean you're doing that stuff on
a regular basis you're involved in that field so what'll
happen is that various techniques will come by you rather
spontaneously just kind of through blind luck or trial and
error right if you're in school and you're trying to
find an effective technique in school I mean you're different
systems of taking notes you're doing different things you're looking
at what your friends are doing and how they are
studying so you've got different ideas kind of coming through
your mind now all you have to do you don't
have to invent some brilliant genius technique that would be
hard all you got to do is you just gotta
keep your mind vigilant enough so that when a technique
does come your way and you see that oh this
actually produces a real tangible result and it produces quite
a bit of result for little work recognize it this
is where people screw up is that they don't recognize
it actually consciously recognize it oh this technique is a
special technique and then immediately write it down when you
find this technique and then plan out your habit your
daily habit how can you apply this technique every single
day even in just a small way maybe it's just
five or ten minutes or maybe it's thirty minutes or
60 minutes usually it doesn't need to be a lot
of time or a lot of effort because the secret
here is just that the multiplicative effect you know the
exponential growth will happen over the months and years that
you apply this technique and once you've planned out your
habit you've decided exactly when in your day you're going
to do it and how it's going to happen then
you just make a hundred percent commitment no exceptions no
excuses that you're going to be using this technique because
you can see the huge yield that it will pay
off for you in the future if you just carry
this through right so that's pretty much it now how
did I discover this formula the way I discovered this
formula is actually just recently I discovered it because for
the last two years I've been working on enlightenment and
if you know me I'm pretty excited about lightning I've
been trying various techniques meditation techniques and self inquiry techniques
I've been reading lots of books and going to lots
of workshops and asking people lots of questions to find
the best of the best right and just recently I
read in a book I just read this one technique
that seemed to work really well for me I sat
down I tried it my mind just locked in on
exactly what I needed it to lock in on and
even though I didn't have any huge epiphany or enlightenment
experience from that one technique I could see that it
was a high yield technique just simply by sitting there
for 60 minutes and using it right you got an
intuitive sense for it and this will happen to you
in your field whatever field that you're interested in you'll
you'll try these different techniques out and then you'll see
that oh this one seems to really have worked really
well maybe just once maybe twice that's your key yeah
you got to lock in on that and don't let
that go most people what happens is that actually they
come across many high yield techniques but they're just not
really conscious and they don't know how to follow through
with this three-step formula they don't really take it very
seriously and so high yield techniques come by you maybe
once every couple of months you see one but then
you just kind of ignore it you slack off and
nothing really happens so if you keep these steps in
mind then it'll go differently for you you got to
see the exponential effect that following through on this can
have for improving the quality of your life that's what
really gets you to buy in and take it seriously
now let me give you some examples of how you
might apply this like not silly examples like with the
farmer but something that's useful for you and addresses your
common day problems so let's say for example that one
issue that you're struggling with is you're lacking a good
sense of humor and you want to be more charming
more humorous maybe you want to attract the opposite sex
better okay cool but you're not really sure how to
do that so how would you apply this formula well
first of all set the intention set the intention that
I'm going to be a really humorous person I'm going
to master this that's step number one then as you
do that and you're just going about your life what
will eventually happen is that you will run across through
fluke luck a high yield technique now you might say
well Leo I don't know any high yield techniques for
how to be humorous right right now you might not
know it but tomorrow or in a week or in
a month you might know it and when you do
I don't want to miss it so actually what I'll
do for you is I'll give you one right now
I actually have of episode that I shot called how
to be funny it's a like an hour long episode
that goes into a lot of depth explaining a specific
technique it's a very simple visualization technique that will only
take you ten or fifteen minutes to do every single
day and I guarantee that if you use that technique
right there then over the period of six to twelve
months you will double triple or even increase by greater
amounts of your sense of humor so you could just
go and use that watch that episode and use it
so that would give you your step number two and
then step number three would simply be to actually set
the the plan for the habit into motion and make
a hundred percent commitment to use this visualization technique every
single day for the next six months or twelve months
or whatever period you're working with there right so that's
how you can apply this to the situation of becoming
more humorous what about business how could you apply this
to business well step number one is what's your intention
pick exactly how you want to be ruthlessly effective in
your business so let's say you decide that you want
to be really effective at marketing in your business okay
good so step number one is done step number two
is what's a high-yield marketing technique that really generates some
tangible results for you now if you're running a business
and you're doing marketing on a regular basis then chances
are you're running across all sorts of different marketing techniques
all you got to do is just pick one that's
high-yield that might take you a little while or maybe
you already know one already just as a random example
maybe you discover that your let's say your your newsletter
if you really work on your newsletter and you use
the right structure on your newsletter that that generates more
sales and attracts more customers for you okay great so
let's say you think that that's your tie yield technique
so that satisfies step number two and then step number
three of the formula is just to make a daily
habit to use that technique now every single day 100%
commitment with no excuses so that might mean that every
morning first thing when you get to work as you
sit down you spend 60 minutes writing a new newsletter
page copy and then you add that to your autoresponder
or whatever so that it's in the hopper it's all
automated and you just do that every single day for
the next six months and then watch what happens see
this high yield technique it doesn't necessarily need to give
you everything in one Big Bang right so it's not
like you're going to find a technique that will just
like make you super humorous or will increase your marketing
by 50 percent or something like that usually you don't
find things like that what you find and what I
mean by high yield technique is that it's relatively high
yield that means actually in absolute terms they might only
give you like let's say a point zero one percent
increase in your marketing or 0.5 percent increase in your
humor but even a point zero one percent increase in
your marketing if you multiply that by a hundred days
two hundred days three hundred days in the year then
that adds up to a lot that adds up to
50% or 100% you do the math it adds up
quickly over time but see most people they're always looking
for like they're really really low-hanging fruit they're looking for
a technique that will just solve their problem really quickly
and those techniques generally don't exist and if they exist
chances are you already know about them in you already
use them and exhausted them right and now the only
thing that exists is these high-yield techniques which give you
incremental increases but are still extremely powerful when multiplied by
200 days 400 days and so forth how about relationships
let's say you want to be effective in your relationships
step number one make the intention what do you want
I want a more loving relationship with my partner okay
great step number two find a high-yield technique now initially
you might say well Leo there are no high-yield techniques
for being more loving with my partner but actually that's
not true at all go read some books go watch
some videos or whatever and you will discover many effective
high yield relationship techniques I'll give you one as an
example you can use this or you can find a
different one here's one every day you're going to find
three things that you appreciate about your partner and then
you're gonna communicate them to your partner that's it very
simple so let's say that that's step number two you've
got that figured out and now step number three is
to use that set a plan for how you're going
to make a habit of it every single day and
make 100% commitment with no excuses and no exceptions so
you got to actually plan out like win in the
day am I going to say do it am I
going to call uh am I going to call my
partner during my lunch break at work or maybe in
the afternoon or in the evening how am I actually
going to do this what am I going to say
what are my reservations for expressing my appreciation maybe I
need to improve my communication skills right you got to
plan some of that stuff out and then commit to
it and do it and you're going to see big
results if you just multiply that out by three or
six or twelve months how about school you want to
be super effective at school this is really easy firstly
step number one set that intention step number two find
a high-yield technique and you know with school high-yield techniques
are usually very simple this isn't rocket science and in
fact what I would suggest not just in school but
in all these different areas most your high yield techniques
are very simple they're deceptively simple they're so simple that
oftentimes we just dismiss them and overlook them for example
here's a simple one for school read your textbook every
day and take notes on what you've read dead simple
but I can guarantee you that if you spend the
next year every single day reading your textbook and taking
notes on what you've read you're going to become a
rockstar student within one to two to three years if
you just keep doing that and doing that and doing
that and doing that for every one of your subjects
right or if you don't like that one find a
different one maybe you find out a new note-taking method
in class that really works well for you and generates
some high yield results great so take that and do
it every day or maybe you find a mnemonic technique
some little technique for how to memorize facts better and
apply that every single day to the different facts that
you're learning in school and see where that takes you
right being effective as school is really pretty simple it's
just that you just got to actually follow through on
what I'm telling you here and step number three again
is plan out your habit and then make a hunter
set commitment no excuses to do it every single day
for a period of like 6 or 12 months what
about confidence let's say you want to get good with
confidence step number one set that intention step number two
find a high-yield technique what might that be there's many
of them but let's say you find a technique such
as holding strong eye contact with people deliberately so maybe
you read that in a book or you hear it
from someone like me or somebody else while you're friends
and then you try it out you notice like hey
you know when I actually hold eye contact with the
way Triss that makes a difference that makes me feel
more confident and when I hold eye contact with my
teacher that makes me feel more confident my hold eye
contact with my with my mom or my dad that
makes me feel more confident you notice that and then
now that tells you okay this is technique is actually
producing some results now what you do is you go
to step number three and you make a commitment every
single day to practice this and you find a way
you know how are you gonna practice it maybe you
practice it on store clerks or you practice it with
waitresses or you practice it with people at your workplace
or at school and then you just do that every
single day and you're going to watch your confidence slowly
build up build up build up incremental e but significantly
if you do it for like three six twelve months
so I could go on with examples but I think
you get the idea right this is how it works
what's the reason that this works the reason this formula
works is a principle called deliberate practice deliberate practice is
a concept that's part of the mastery concept it's a
really important concept actually for becoming a master at any
field in life anyone who's at a world-class level whether
it's an athlete a teacher a business person a world
leader a martial artist or a painter or sculptor these
people have become world-class because they've done deliberate practice and
I'm not going to go into too much detail here
but just basically in a nutshell what deliberate practice is
is it means that you actually sit down and you
spend time doing the thing you want to get good
at correctly so a best example of this is when
you're learning music like a musical instrument you sit down
you have a new song you're not sure how to
play it and you start playing it and the first
five notes you get right but then the sixth note
you screw up so what you do is you have
to stop yourself don't keep playing stop yourself go back
to the beginning and play it through until you can
get it right so let's say on the second time
you play through and you get eight notes deep and
then ix note you screw up you stop you go
back to the beginning and then you start again and
you just keep doing that over and over and over
again and every time you do it you're going to
get a little bit better and a little bit further
until you're to the point where you can play the
you know hundreds of notes of the song with no
mistakes and you just do this over and over again
until you master the song then you move on to
the next song and the next song in the next
song and you can use that process as simple as
that is to become a world-class a musician artist professional
of any kind so that's why this works so this
formula gets you to start doing this kind of practice
right very deliberately um that's it that's pretty much how
it works I want to stress though for you that
I hope that you can grasp the significance of what
you're told here think about what this can do for
your life if you apply this formula in all the
areas in your life where you want to be effective
and especially in your self-actualization efforts you know speaking of
high-yield techniques I go to a lot of lengths to
reveal to you high-yield techniques that I discover for personal
development I really reveal techniques for how to become more
humorous how to be better in your relationships how to
accept yourself more how to develop more confidence how to
meditate better and so forth I've really revealed many of
these techniques throughout the various episodes that I released so
man uh if you feel like you're at a lack
for high-yield techniques uh be careful there because you've been
given a lot of them just make sure that you're
conscious of what I'm telling you here and you're actually
recognizing the significance of these techniques when they come across
to you because these techniques oftentimes are very innocent looking
they look so simple on the surface that you would
never think that I could use this technique to earn
ten million dollars or I could use this technique to
become enlightened or I could use this technique to create
an amazing marriage but the reality is is that you
know success often comes from very simple sources done over
and over again consistently with deliberate intention and 100% commitment
that's really the secret of success if you understand the
significance of what I'm telling you here you can start
to see ah just how big of an impact this
could have on the quality of your life over the
next 5 10 or 20 years it could really mean
the difference between a crappy life or a mediocre average
life and an absolutely extraordinary life that you completely love
that other people couldn't even dream of that's what this
formula can do for you very powerful formula before I
go I want to give you one final warning in
applying this formula which is that the world is hell-bent
on distracting you and knocking you off your path we
live in a very distraction oriented culture where everyone is
vying for your attention and what's going to happen is
that you're going to lack focus and then you're going
to fail at applying this formula if you let yourself
get distracted right notice that focus is required at every
step in this formula so step one to keep your
intention not only you have to set your attention we
have to keep your intention you don't just set your
intention for once and then it's all good from that
know every single day you have to be setting and
recommitting to your intention I want to get good I
want to get really effective at my marketing or at
my relationship or at mices you know school work whatever
so that requires focus ah step number two requires focus
you need to be focused on the fact that hey
high-yield techniques are out there and if I just stay
vigilant if I stay focused and vigilant then I will
notice them as they come across my field of awareness
over time so that requires focus and step number three
requires the most focus which is to actually sit down
create a habit and then follow through on that habit
every single day without fail that requires tons of focus
because you're going to get distracted by video games and
Netflix marathons and good food and good relationships and fun
with your friends and stuff going on at work and
a crisis in your family and some some health concern
all this stuff will try to distract you your job
is to maintain your focus stay grounded keep your original
intention in your mind every single day write it down
on your bathroom mirror or something so it's always with
you alright and that is it if you apply this
you're going to get amazing results I'm done signing off
