            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/FeOIuybpfgc' target='_blank'>Deconstructing The Myth Of Science - Part 3</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Deconstruction of Science must be even-handed and risk-aware</b>: Warns of potential misuse of scientific deconstruction as ammunition for science denial or conspiracy theories. Highlights that intellectual progress requires critical examination of our own worldviews, including the deconstruction of science, but must be applied to all beliefs equally.
</li><li><b>Actualized.org is not a philosophy or ideology, but a process of deconstruction</b>: Unlike established ideologies or philosophies, Actualized.org promotes a process that involves deconstructing every belief and worldview and not being attached to any particular method or standpoint. 
</li><li><b>Existence of exceptional scientists beyond materialism</b>: Recognizes exceptional scientists who are not confined by materialist or realist paradigms, but due to the dominance of mainstream scientific community, these individuals are not broadly recognised. 
</li><li><b>The inseparability of science from language</b>: Highlights how science is deeply tied to language and how the limitations of language, in turn, limit the scope of science in expressing and comprehending reality.
</li><li><b>Language as both descriptive and constructive</b>: States that language not only describes our world, but also constructs it by shaping our perception and creating meanings that are often unconscious. Both words and categories carry implicit metaphysical baggage and can differ in interpretation between individuals.
</li><li><b>Importance of non-linguistic approaches and deep contemplation in science</b>: Challenges scientists to explore non-linguistic ways of understanding reality. Encourages deep questioning and reflection on fundamental concepts like reality, existence, life, human, fact, rationality, physicality, cause/effect, and science, all of which shape our understanding and interaction with reality.
</li><li><b>Recognition of models as representations, not reality</b>: Argues that scientific models are oversimplified representations of nature, not the truth. As these models become more accurate, there is a risk of ignoring deeper philosophical concerns. Also suggests that there are ways to directly experience reality without the reliance on models or symbols.
</li><li><b>Limitations and constraints of science</b>: Notes that scientific models can never fully encapsulate reality and that science avoids addressing the question of what anything essentially is, thus creating a substance problem. Further suggests that by breaking free from the current paradigms and methodologies, we can push the boundaries of scientific progress. 
</li><li><b>Circularity in scientific definition and avoidance of substance</b>: Discusses the circularity in the way fundamental scientific concepts, such as force, matter, and energy, are defined due to the dependency on symbolic representation rather than direct understanding.
</li><li><b>Inadequacy of substituting representations for reality</b>: Criticizes the common practice of science to refer to another matter when faced with questions about substance, leading to a shadow world of symbols rather than providing a concrete understanding of reality. Emphasizes the need to open up to deeper inquiries beyond prevailing methods and models.
</li><li><b>Appropriate method for scientific validation</b>: Stresses the importance of using the correct methods to validate scientific claims. Also mentions that not all methods or instruments are valid in scientific research and encourages independent testing of presented ideas.
</li><li><b>Invitation to test beliefs through personal experience</b>: Challenges listeners to validate their beliefs through personal experience. Notes the struggle of communicating radical discoveries which defy scientific consensus to others, and terms it as a "culture war" between truth seekers and those defending their biases.
</li><li><b>Challenge against reduced definition of science</b>: Contrasts the restrictive definition of science as reducible to physics and emphasizes that soft sciences, like psychology or political science, are as real and objective. Propositions for an open-minded, expansive understanding of science and highlights the changing scope of natural and supernatural with scientific evolution.
</li><li><b>Relativity of science</b>: Science is subjective as it assumes objectivity while ignoring humanity's inherent subjectivity. Besides explaining consciousness, science also tends to dismiss its significance. The video argues that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of reality, and science should pay more attention to it.
</li><li><b>Science as subjective and relative to human neurology</b>: Underlines the relativity of science to human neurology, implying that changes in human neurology would alter what we understand as science. Leo argues for the recognition of science as a study of human neurology rather than only as an exploration of materialistic universe laws. 
</li><li><b>Radical view of science as a projection of mind</b>: Presents the idea that science might be imaginary and dependant on our state of consciousness. It refutes the claim that demystifying reality is the purpose of science, arguing that mystery is inherent to reality and calls for recognition of the numerous mistakes science has made.
</li><li><b>Double standard in science's critique of religion</b>: Accuses science of holding a double standard in critiquing religion as whilst science constantly evolves through mistakes, religion is not given the same leeway. Points out contradictions in both science and religion and argues that science itself is open to the influence of perception and belief, despite its claims of being independent.
</li><li><b>Existence of contradictions within science</b>: Discusses various contradictions within science, such as; dismissing consciousness while occurring within it, demanding for proof while unable to prove its own foundations, and claiming to rely on reason while it's often used to justify false claims.
</li><li><b>Interconnectedness of humans and the universe</b>: Discusses the interconnectedness of humans and the universe and critiques the use of logic in science. Emphasizes scientists' responsibility for the impact of their scientific advancements.
</li><li><b>Science as a multifaceted activity</b>: Describes science as a complex activity involving interconnected elements such as society, culture, and especially language. 
</li><li><b>Extension of science to everyday life</b>: Relates the scientific method to everyday life situations and emphasizes the importance of exploring internal experiences and emotions as part of the scientific process. 
</li><li><b>Summary of areas where science has been wrong</b>: Lists a number of areas where science has perceived inaccuracies. These include science's understanding of consciousness, psychedelics, rationalism, and even fundamental aspects like truth, knowledge, reality, and origin of the universe.
</li><li><b>Science's limitations and future revolutionary changes</b>: Highlights the limitations of current scientific methodologies and models and predicts that in future, science will accept the validity of paranormal and spiritual phenomena. Encourages individuals to facilitate this change by pioneering new ways of scientific understanding and practice.
</li><li><b>Encouragement for personal exploration</b>: Asserts that science is limited and encourages personal exploration as the best way to understand reality. Urges listeners to take life seriously, explore reality, and make groundbreaking discoveries.
</li><li><b>The Role of Language in Science</b>: The section discusses how language inextricably intertwines with science and our understanding of reality. All of science hinges upon language, including labels and categories, which are constantly evolving with progress in science and technology. Yet, language plays more than just a descriptive roleÂ—it is a constructive entity, mediating how people perceive and categorize reality. It carries implicit and subconscious meanings and metaphysical baggage that are not often examined in science but are critical in our interpretation of reality. Hence, our understanding of reality is deeply interwoven with language and mind, in a complex way that poses a conundrum akin to the chicken-and-the-egg problem. 
</li><li><b>Limitations of Language in Science</b>: This section also suggests limitations of language in understanding reality. It argues that there are possible non-linguistic ways of approaching reality; relying solely on language could introduce a methodological bias in scientific analyses. For instance, language inherently imposes a system of dualities onto reality (existence vs nonexistence, matter vs energy, etc.), possibly projecting a dualistic nature onto a nondualistic reality. 
</li><li><b>Questioning Scientific Terms</b>: The section encourages deep contemplation over scientific terms such as "experience," "reality," "existence," "life," and "human," and binary terms like "male" and "female." These words, often unquestioned in scientific dialogues, carry subconscious meanings, and assumptions that could bias our understanding of reality. It implies that scientists should recognize the constructed nature of these terms and not take them for granted. 
</li><li><b>Scientific Exploration Beyond Language</b>: Finally, the section posed the challenge to scientists to explore reality beyond linguistic understanding, such as experiencing reality for a whole minute without any linguistic thoughts. The objective here is to question the presupposition that language Â— or anything we routinely use to perceive and comprehend reality Â— is "the one true right way" to understand reality.
</li><li><b>Importance of Questioning Terminology in Science</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes the importance of questioning and deeply contemplating the meaning of common terms used in science, such as fact, rational, physical, cause, and even science itself. He posits that most people, including academic scholars and scientists, have not seriously questioned these terms and therefore do not fully understand their meanings. He insists that these issues are not just language games or semantic definitions, but have significant practical impact on our perception of reality, motivation, value systems, and behavior. 
</li><li><b>The Trap of Mistaking the Map for the Territory</b>: Gura maintains that scientists often confuse their symbolic representations of reality (the map) with reality itself (the territory). As models of nature become increasingly accurate, scientists may dismiss the importance of the actual territory, leading to a potentially dangerous neglect of reality. Despite the practical uses of scientific models, they can never fully represent the truth that is the territory itself. Gura challenges the assumption that all aspects of reality can be accurately modeled, proposing instead the existence of truths that may not be accessible through modeling.
</li><li><b>Limitations of Modeling and Symbolic Representation in Science</b>: Gura asserts that the pervasive use of models and symbolic representations in science creates a limiting paradigm, where scientists become so wrapped up in their models that they neglect reality itself. This approach is problematic because it assumes that all truths can be accessed through modeling, a notion Gura challenges. While these models are refined and become more accurate over time, they create an illusion that obscures truth as they are never the full representation of reality.
</li><li><b>Bias and Limitations of Current Scientific Methodology</b>: Gura contends that current scientific methodology is heavily biased towards exploring reality through thinking, symbolism, and modeling. This approach neglects the existence of direct methods of investigating reality, separate from thinking, symbolism, and modelling. These direct methods may provide a more comprehensive understanding of reality, but are currently neglected due to the dominance of traditional scientific thinking.
</li><li><b>Need for a Paradigm Shift in Scientific Thinking and Inquiry</b>: Leo Gura urges a paradigm shift in scientific methodologies. He emphasizes the need to critically question and contemplate the use of language and models in scientific exploration and understand their inherent limitations. He further suggests the exploration of direct methods of investigating reality beyond the use of thinking, symbolism, and modeling. He argues that these changes are not just linguistic or intellectual exercises, but have significant implications in our understanding of reality and how we live our lives. This shift, according to Gura, could provide a deeper understanding of reality that transcends current scientific models.
</li><li><b>Limited Scope of Scientific Models</b>: Scientific models, while useful, are always partially limited and constrained and cannot completely encapsulate the true essence of reality. Challenging and breaking apart these models lead to the creation of new, better ones, but every created model is always limited. The issue arises when people treat these models as absolute truth and fail to notice their limitations.
</li><li><b>Substance Problem in Science</b>: A problem in science identified by Leo is that science does not address the question of what anything *is*. Questions about the true nature of the many aspects of reality such as gravity, life, mind, object, etc. are not answered by science. Science often avoids answering questions about the substance or inherent essence of the components of reality and instead focuses on understanding how things behave.
</li><li><b>Circular Definitions in Science</b>: Scientists often provide circular definitions to questions about the nature of reality. This can be evidenced in a physics class where each concept is defined in terms of another which in turn needs further definition. This endless cycle avoids the question of what the 'substance' or inherent properties of these concepts are.
</li><li><b>Potential of Direct Consciousness</b>: Leo suggests that there's potential for individuals to have a direct consciousness of reality, beyond the confines of science's symbolic models or representations. This would supposedly require an expansion of the definition of science to include direct consciousness. This idea proposes to seek an understanding of reality that goes beyond the current paradigm, though it may be deemed unorthodox or not yet considered science.
</li><li><b>Future of Science</b>: Predictions about the future form of science suggest that the acceptance of methods of direct consciousness might become mainstream, but not for at least 100-200 years. The challenge is getting individuals to deeply question their methodologies and be open to this concept. As every model of reality is partial, relative, and limited, this new understanding would continue to be refined and adapted. 
</li><li><b>Flawed Understanding of Perception</b>: In questioning reality, it's essential to acknowledge where science could be misinterpreting. For example, science's understanding of perception needs to be questioned. It's suggested that science's view of perception is fundamentally flawed and that greater awareness is needed for the limitations of our current models, which restrict our view of reality.
</li><li><b>Circular definitions in Physics</b>: Leo Gura criticises the circular definitions often used in physics, arguing that lists of definitions and series of pointers don't provide a substantial understanding of what things are. He claims that physicists are unable to provide a concrete explanation of forces, matter, energy, gravity, particles, time, space, fields, charges or information.
</li><li><b>The problem with symbolic representation</b>: According to Gura, symbolic representation cannot provide a direct understanding of the substance of things. He argues that to answer substance questions, one must understand the substance itself, not through a series of symbolic representations.
</li><li><b>The shadow world of symbols</b>: Gura shares a quote from physicist Arthur Eddington that supports his argument, highlighting the concept that the physical world is a shadow world of symbols that cannot be penetrated by the methods used in physics. 
</li><li><b>The limitations and arrogance of modern science</b>: Gura believes that modern scientists' arrogance and dogmatism limits them to their symbolic understanding of reality, demonising any methods that grant direct access to the substance of things and labelling them as pseudoscience.
</li><li><b>To validate a scientific claim, you must use the claimant's method</b>: Gura asserts that in order to validate any scientific claim, one has to use the method proposed by the person making the claim, no matter how unconventional that method may be. 
</li><li><b>Mistaking the map for the territory</b>: He uses the metaphor of a map and territory to illustrate how science can mistake models and symbols for the actual truth. According to Gura, while current science is mostly based on symbolic models and pointer readings, the real essence of an entity lies in its substance, not in these representations.
</li><li><b>Claim of Ghosts' existence</b>: Leo argues that the valid method to validate any scientific claim comes from the person making the claim and not others. He criticizes scientists who prematurely judge, or refuse to use the method he proposed, terming it unscientific. 
</li><li><b>Telescope and Binoculars analogy</b>: He explains that the person making a claim decides on the method to validate it. Using an analogy of viewing the moons of Jupiter, he argues that using a different tool like binoculars instead of the proposed telescope would lead to inaccurate conclusions. This concept applies to validating empirical claims in science. 
</li><li><b>Contemplation as a Scientific method</b>: Leo emphatically expresses that contemplation is a scientific method that should be used to test the claims he makes. Presenting it as an empirical claim itself, he urges listeners to validate these claims using contemplation and stresses that refusing to do it for being too unconventional is unscientific.
</li><li><b>Highlighting Salvia as an experiment</b>: Leo introduces the use of salvia, a potent psychedelic, as a means to experience a different state of consciousness. He acknowledges the potential dangers but argues that all major scientific progress involves risk. 
</li><li><b>The Black Hole Problem</b>: Leo introduces a concept he calls the "Black Hole Problem", where someone makes a discovery that radically diverges from mainstream scientific understanding and faces difficulty convincing others of their findings. He encourages them to take on his salvia challenge and explore new perspectives on humanity and consciousness.
</li><li><b>The "Black Hole Problem" in Epistemology</b>: Leo Gura introduces the concept of the "black hole problem," likening it to a person having a reality-altering experience such as taking salvia - a psychedelic drug. This experience can radically shift one's understanding and worldview, similar to the exploration of a black hole, which could hold unknown discoveries. However, communicating these profound experiences and findings is difficult because others must also undergo similar experiences to comprehend. This issue appears within the field of science as convincing colleagues about new, radical discoveries often requires them to be open to and undergo the same experiences.
</li><li><b>False Distinction between Hard and Soft Sciences</b>: Gura argues against the prevailing belief that hard sciences, such as physics and chemistry, are superior or more objective compared to soft sciences like sociology, psychology, and political science. He states that this thinking stems from reductionism and bias - the tendency of those proficient in a particular method (such as math or physics) to believe it's the ultimate explainer of reality. In reality, the more challenging nature of soft sciences, due to the need for a more holistic, intuitive approach, can make them more significant.
</li><li><b>Natural vs. Supernatural</b>: Gura suggests that the supposed distinction between natural and supernatural, or normal and paranormal, is a fallacy. These terms are relative, and their definitions change with time and the evolution of scientific understanding. As science expands its understanding and discovers new phenomena (such as ghosts), what was once labeled supernatural or paranormal becomes standard. 
</li><li><b>The Culture War in Science</b>: Convincing colleagues about new experiences or discoveries in science is likened to a "culture war." Getting others to undergo the necessary experiences for understanding these insights often feels like a repeated process, increasing scientific consensus by one person at a time. This struggle to gain acceptance for novel ideas or methods is part of the challenge of scientific progress. 
</li><li><b>The Apparent Superiority of Physics</b>: The idea that all sciences can be reduced to physics, and the belief that physics is superior to other sciences, is criticized as being simply a convenient myth propagated by physicists to elevate their field. Similarly, the assumption that mathematics is the ultimate science simply because it's a method some are good at is also called out as biased thinking. 
</li><li><b>Relevance of Soft Sciences</b>: Gura argues that the so-called soft sciences require a broader, more intuitive mind-set to grasp their complexities, making them more challenging and potentially more insightful than the hard sciences. He emphasizes the equal validity and importance of soft sciences like psychology, sociology, and political science, countering the notion that their findings are less real or objective than those of physics or chemistry.
</li><li><b>Solidity of Atoms and Similar Concepts</b>: Despite the apparent solidity of atoms or other tangible phenomena, these are pointed out as ultimately being as 'fuzzy' or intangible as the softer aspects of reality, undermining the idea that the hard sciences are built on firmer ground than the soft sciences. Even atoms, considered the building blocks of material reality, are deemed a fiction and entirely imaginary based on quantum mechanics.
</li><li><b>Science and Paranormal Phenomena</b>: Highlighting the relative and evolving nature of scientific understanding, Gura suggests that paranormal phenomena such as ghosts could eventually become accepted as part of the natural world. This acceptance would follow a process of rigorous scientific investigation and gradual cultural acceptance, after which these phenomena would no longer be considered supernatural or paranormal, but normal and natural.
</li><li><b>The relativity of scientific consensus and the perception of the paranormal</b>: The video argues that what is paranormal or supernatural is merely what falls outside our current scientific understanding or paradigms. These are derogatory labels erected by the mind to reject certain categories of reality. However, as our scientific paradigm expands, what was once deemed paranormal or supernatural ceases to be, reclassified as scientific. For instance, x-rays, once considered pseudoscience, are now seen as standard, accepted science.
</li><li><b>The science-magic equivalence</b>: Science and magic are interchangeable concepts. What we term 'technology' is merely magic that has been demystified and understood; conversely, Â‘magicÂ’ is a manifestation of reality whose mechanisms we do not comprehend. An artifact from the future, with technology superior to ours, could be viewed as magical due to unfamiliarity with its workings.
</li><li><b>Science's subjective nature and misunderstanding of consciousness</b>: Despite science's claim of objectivity, it is fundamentally a subjective construct occurring within personal consciousness. Furthermore, science misunderstands consciousness, which is, in fact, the most fundamental layer of reality. Science is relative to human neurology Â– all physical laws and scientific understandings stem from a study of human neurology. This realization brings forth the science Â“self-reference problem"; science is being executed within consciousness and is trying to account for itself, an impossibility equivalent to the self-consuming snake or a knife cutting itself.
</li><li><b>Science as a perception</b>: Given that perception is a byproduct of the brain and the brain itself is a perception, all of science is ultimately a perception. This would equate science to a hallucination as reality per the current scientific understanding is composed of perceptions. 
</li><li><b>Science's inability to answer substance questions</b>: The inquirer also suggests that science fails to answer substance questions such as 'what is the substance of science?' or 'what are atoms/quarks/strings/numbers/equations composed of?', illuminating the circularity in science's attempts to investigate the nature of these concepts.
</li><li><b>The interconnectedness of thoughts and science</b>: Leo Gura discusses the interconnectedness of thoughts and science, questioning the foundational elements of concepts such as thoughts, science, and reality. He postulates that our conceptualizations of these elements are themselves determined by thought, and therefore, all aspects of science could be categorized as a form of hallucination or imagination. He challenges the defensive mechanisms one's mind conjures to counteract this radical interrogation.
</li><li><b>The importance of consciousness in science</b>: According to Leo, science is dependent on our state of consciousness. If we change our state of consciousness, every fundamental principle of science could become irrelevant. This could occur through different cognitive states, such as intoxication or dreaming; in these states, physics and logic as we understand them do not exist. He challenges the assumed objectivity of our ordinary state of consciousness. 
</li><li><b>The bias of demystification in science</b>: Leo identifies demystification as a bias within science, with scientists often motivated to remove the mystery from phenomena. However, Leo underscores the assumption and dogma in this methodology. He proposes that the mystery is a fundamental feature of reality and consciousness rather than a bug, and the quest to demystify everything is unscientific, based on a presumption rather than tested empirical reality. 
</li><li><b>Bias in comparison of errors in science and religion</b>: Leo discusses the double standard in critiquing errors made in science and religion. While religious errors are remembered and criticized, scientific errors are often excused and forgotten as part of the process. Thus, according to Leo, science, in fact, historically makes more mistakes than religion but receives a 'pass' on its errors while religion does not. Science and religion both evolve and improve through mistakes, but science is given leeway that religion is not.
</li><li><b>Science's Many Mistakes and the Double Standards of Atheism and Rationalism</b>: Throughout history, science has made numerous grave errors. Examples include the initial dismissal of X-rays as hoaxes, the belief that heavier-than-air flying vehicles were impossible, and the thought that high speeds above 60 mph would cause the human body to explode. However, these mistakes are often forgotten or ignored, unfairly presenting science as a pristine reservoir of flawless knowledge. Modern science, Leo argues, makes more mistakes than religion. Importantly, he notes that these mistakes are part of how science improves and evolves. Leo criticizes the double standard held by atheists and rational people toward religion and science, as religious faiths are not offered the same lenience and are criticized heavily for each outdated belief or error.
</li><li><b>Contradictions Within Science</b>: Science is abundant with contradictions. These range from the denial of subjectivity even though science itself is a subjective phenomenon, the attempt to dismiss consciousness as an illusion when all scientific activity happens within consciousness, to the reliance on authority and consensus building which are inherently political and subjective processes. Science criticizes religious faith while simultaneously holding unprovable belief in its own foundations like quantification, logic, the scientific method, and the existence of an objective external world. These inconsistencies expose the subjective, relative, and contradictory nature of science.
</li><li><b>Science's Dismissal of Unorthodox Claims and Reliance on Authority</b>: Scientific authorities often reject unorthodox claims, especially if they do not come from a reputed source, highlighting a contradiction in its perceived openness. Additionally, scientific institutions prioritize their own survival over truth, casting doubt on the claim of science being objective.
</li><li><b>Science's Inherent Subjectivity and Bias</b>: Despite claiming objectivity, science is performed by biased, subjective individuals prioritizing survival. Also, science demands proof, yet it cannot validate its own foundations or certain concepts, posing another contradiction.
</li><li><b>Science's Reliance on Perception and Reason, Yet Its Fallibility</b>: According to science, all perceptionsÂ—including science itselfÂ—are hallucinations. Furthermore, while science insists on logical reasoning, reason is often employed to justify false claims, illuminating yet another contradiction. Additionally, science asserts that it's fallible and amenable to change, but often denies and demonizes critique pointing out deep-seated errors.
</li><li><b>The Hypocrisy of Scientific Claims, Materialistic Assumptions and Historical Errors</b>: Despite claiming to be pragmatic, science also positions itself as the pinnacle of truth in society. Moreover, it labels God and spirituality as unscientific, while making unproven materialistic and realist assumptions. Lastly, while criticizing religions for historical inaccuracies, science has also been historically wrong but seldom admits its own flaws.
</li><li><b>Double Standards in the Appraisal of Science and Religion</b>: Science is pardoned for its mistakes, whereas religion is not offered the same level of forgiveness. For instance, the Catholic Church has evolved over the years, becoming more progressive and accepting scientific facts. Despite such developments, the Church continues to be heavily criticized for past mistakes while science's historical errors are largely forgotten.
</li><li><b>The hypocrisy of scientific evolution</b>: Science allows itself the privilege of evolving over centuries, making mistakes and using them to strengthen its foundations. But it doesn't grant the same allowance to other worldviews or religions, where any error is seen as grounds for full dismissal. 
</li><li><b>The harm of science</b>: Science and technology, contrary to common belief, cause more harm and death than religion. The use of advanced weapons on warfields, the opioid epidemic, and bad drugs, all resulting from scientific developments, have claimed more lives than those killed in the name of religion.
</li><li><b>The flawed notion of intelligence</b>: Science traditionally assumes the universe cannot be intelligent, despite humans, who are part of the universe, proving to be intelligent. This standpoint comes from a fallacy of separating the human from the universe when, by definition, the latter contains the former.
</li><li><b>The reliability of logic</b>: Science justifies itself with logic. However, logic only functions assuming true premises, and logic itself cannot prove the validity of these premises. This approach cannot serve as ground for science.
</li><li><b>The consequences of scientific progress</b>: The adverse effects of technological advancements, such as mass disruptions caused by the internet, are seldom blamed on science, creating a gross double standard when comparing it to other ideologies like religion. Scientific developments can't be separated from their sociopolitical and cultural context.
</li><li><b>The responsibility of scientists</b>: Scientists often evade responsibility for the dangers their inventions may create or cause, blaming the misuse on politics, business, or society. This denial of accountability contributes to fragmentation and denial of the interconnectedness of all aspects of reality.
</li><li><b>Answering 'What is science?'</b>: The definition of science varies depending on perspective. Science can be an imaginary scheme, a mind projection, a human invention, a web of cultural belief, a survival tool, a linguistic structure, a sense-making narrative activity, and a hallucination within the Universal Mind. In reality, it is an amalgamation of all these perspectives. Recognizing and understanding these differing views can help individuals gain a more robust understanding of science.
</li><li><b>Science as a human invention</b>: Leo argues that science is a creation of human minds, and thus, it is inherent with human subjectivity, limitations, and biases.
</li><li><b>Science as a symbolic representation</b>: Science, according to Leo, is primarily a symbolic representation of reality, acting as a map and not the territory. The symbols and models we use in science are not reality itself, but are merely attempts to capture and describe aspects of reality.
</li><li><b>Science as a cultural web of belief</b>: Science is also seen as a form of collective belief shared within a culture. It serves as an intellectual infrastructure that influences and is influenced by the shared understandings, belief systems, and cultural norms of a society or group.
</li><li><b>Science as one out of many epistemologies</b>: Leo asserts that science is just one way of gaining knowledge about the world, among many other possible modes of understanding including religion, philosophy, and arts. 
</li><li><b>Science as trial and error</b>: Science is also seen as a gradual process of trial and error, where hypotheses are tested, errors are corrected, and successful models or theories are established and added to the body of scientific knowledge.
</li><li><b>Science as a collection of values, principles, norms, standards, and methods</b>: Leo sees science as encompassing more than just theories and facts, but also including values, principles, norms, standards, and methods that guide scientific research and professional behavior.
</li><li><b>Science as an ideology</b>: Leo Gura argues that science is an ideology that denies its status as an ideology. This involves the assumption that scientific methods and conclusions are universally applicable and superior to other forms of knowledge, causing biases and limitations in scientific investigation.
</li><li><b>Science as a state of consciousness</b>: The idea of science as a state of consciousness refers to the conceptual and perceptual frameworks that scientists bring to their interpretations of data and phenomena. Leo suggests that how scientists understand and represent the world is strongly influenced by their states of consciousness, and hence, science is a reflection of these subjectivities.
</li><li><b>Science as survival</b>: Science is viewed as a survival mechanism. Through scientific inquiry, humans gain knowledge that helps ensure our survival and adaptation to the environment.
</li><li><b>Science as a linguistic structure</b>: Science is viewed as a linguistic structure because it uses language to describe, explain, and conceptualize phenomena. However, the limitations and imperfections of language can introduce misunderstandings, distortions, and other problems in scientific research and interpretation.
</li><li><b>Science as a hallucination within Universal Mind</b>: This philosophical perspective views science as an imaginary construct that arises within the mind and helps us make sense of the world. Science doesn't capture the ultimate truth, but provides us with a helpful, albeit imperfect, map for navigating reality.
</li><li><b>Inner science</b>: Leo encourages listeners to apply the scientific approach to personal introspection and self-understanding, considering this "inner science" as an integral part of human life worthy of serious scientific exploration. 
</li><li><b>Science's limitations and mistakes</b>:  Leo Gura criticizes modern science for its various conceptual errors and blind spots, arguing that scientific understanding of many areas including consciousness, rationalism, spirituality, and the nature of reality is deeply flawed or limited.
</li><li><b>Modern Science misconceptions</b>: 
</li><li>- Leo Gura emphasizes that modern science has a number of incorrect beliefs and misconceptions. He claims that it falsely promotes materialism, realism, and objectivity, and argues that Western medicine falls in the same category due to its mistakes and corruption.
</li><li>- He also criticizes science's understanding of perception and consciousness, arguing it is deeply wrong about the nature of these subjects.
</li><li>- Other fields where Gura believes science to be mistaken include the use and understanding of psychedelics, rationalism, relativity, paranormal phenomena, mystical experiences, birth, death, and immortality. He asserts that these are all misunderstood or denied by modern science.
</li><li><b>Limitations and misconceptions of fundamental concepts in science</b>:
</li><li>- Gura further suggests that modern science does not understand the existence of God, infinity, and nothingness, and falsely assumes reality can be a simulation. 
</li><li>- Misconceptions extend to nutrition science, knowledge, truth, the origin of the universe, duality versus oneness, and the nature of paradox.
</li><li>- He particularly criticizes all theories of everything proposed by science as highly finite and not really accounting for everything.
</li><li><b>Modern Science's methodological errors</b>: 
</li><li>- Gura highlights numerous errors and limitations in the methodologies employed by modern science. 
</li><li>- He states that science has a restricted understanding of religion, mysticism, witchcraft, Voodoo, astral projection, meditation, and channeling, failing to truly understand these spiritual technologies and methods.
</li><li><b>Core questions for contemplation about science</b>: 
</li><li>- Gura poses ten key questions to contemplate concerning the nature, limitations, assumptions, and function of science, the origins and truth of science, its historical mistakes, avenues for corruption, and alternatives to it.
</li><li><b>The limitations of human understanding through science</b>: 
</li><li>- Through an awakening experience, Gura came to realize the scale of how little science understands about reality. He uses a metaphor of a carpet full of countless fibers, with every fiber signifying knowledge the universe holds about itself, and highlights that all human scientific understanding, even projected a million years ahead, would only equate to one fiber.
</li><li>- Gura finishes off by highlighting the necessity of breaking free from the limited understanding of the default state of consciousness, embracing the mystical and paranormal, and evolving beyond current paradigms of materialism and scientific orthodoxy. He suggests the future of science, if it evolves in the right direction, could involve realization of reality as infinite love.
</li><li><b>Analogy of Sea of Infinite Carpet</b>: Leo Gura uses the metaphor of a house's finite carpet to illustrate the magnitude of the universe as an infinite sea of carpet, where all of human science ever done amounts to only one fiber on this sea. The nature of infinity is such that any finite method, like science, leaves us infinitely distanced from comprehending infinity. 
</li><li><b>Shortcomings of Scientists</b>: Scientists are likened to fishermen who believe they have hooked a large fish (a small aspect of the universe), while in reality, they have hooked the entirety of the ocean (the entire universe). As such, these fishermen/scientists are unintentionally reeling in their own selves, showing their lack of understanding about the enormity of their task.
</li><li><b>Future Revolutions in Science</b>: Leo asserts that in the next century, our current understanding of science will seem archaic, similar to how we view medieval methods today. As younger, more open-minded people replace the current generation, the very foundations of the scientific method will expand. Pseudoscience will become mainstream, the validity of paranormal, spiritual and mystical aspects will be acknowledged and the true nature of reality as infinite love will be realized. This progress heavily depends on our collective open-mindedness.
</li><li><b>Introspective Science</b>: Leo emphasizes "studying oneself" as the greatest science, urging listeners to consider their own lives as science experiments. The contents of this science include the understanding of consciousness, non-duality, God, immortality, and absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Seriousness about Exploring Reality</b>: Leo encourages the audience to take life more seriously, to delve deeper into the mystery and infinity reality holds, as it is the only way to infuse profundity into one's life&mdash;which is otherwise perceived as depressing and mundane by those who take it for granted. Leo highlights the importance of questioning, experimenting, investigating and being open to making errorsÂ—urging them to set their lives on a path that makes groundbreaking discoveries concerning reality. 
</li><li><b>Actualized.org as a Guide, not Enlightenment</b>: Leo clarifies that while he introduces listeners to ideas, possibilities, and alternative perspectives, each individual has to make the ultimate choice to explore and confirm these possibilities themselves. Actualize.org aims to make its audience aware of possibilities neglected by society and inspire them to choose a path of exploration and discovery.
