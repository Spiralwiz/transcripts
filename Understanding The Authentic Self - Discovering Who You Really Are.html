hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video I'm going to talk about understanding the authentic self
no man ever steps into the same river twice for
it is not the same river and he is not
the same man that is a quote from Heraclitus in
this video I want to address a really important foundational
concept in personal development and that's the concept of the
authentic self one of the things that I hear from
people as I interact and coach them and read all
my youtube comments is that I see people coming up
with this excuse you can also call it an ego
defense mechanism you could also call it a way of
thinking or a model of the self which goes something
along these lines they'll hear some suggestion that I make
that they should enact in their life and then they'll
come back with this kind of thinking but Leo what
you're suggesting that isn't me not me talking to girls
that's not me being passionate about life that's not me
thinking positive that's not me meditation that's not me being
fit and caring about my nutrition that's not me going
out partying clubbing going to bars that's not me socializing
schmoozing with people small talk that's not me studying hard
be a good student that's not me focusing on one
thing at a time instead of multitasking That's not me
leading others being a leader That's not me learning a
little new language That's not me doing art being creative
That's not me being a millionaire That's not me talking
dirty in bed That's not me working hard having a
strong work ethic being disciplined That's not me pushing my
comfort zone That's not me and the list goes on
on and on and on and I'm sure you've got
your one or two things that you think maybe you
should be doing in your life but then again your
mind says but maybe that's not me maybe that's not
like my real personality maybe that's not like my authentic
self what would my authentic self do in this situation
would my aesthetic self try to be more funny or
would my intent itself want to to have the kind
of dry personality that I have right now maybe that's
authentic me maybe the authentic me is the fat me
the unhealthy me not the healthy me maybe the authentic
me is the one who thinks negatively who has all
these angry thoughts and depressive thoughts maybe the authentic me
is the shy me who doesn't want to go and
socialize and isn't very extroverted maybe the authentic me is
the follower the passive me not the leader not that
bold individual who goes and commands and dominates other people
maybe the authentic me is just living the simple kind
of life that I live right now not living some
sort of grand extraordinary ambitious kind of life maybe the
authentic me isn't good with women or isn't good with
men or isn't good in a marriage or isn't good
in a relationship or isn't good with kids maybe the
authentic me isn't very artistic is not talented and art
is not talented with languages it's not talented with math
is not talented with science is not with personal development
or some other area of life is a very dangerous
thing this game of is it me or is it
not me and I want to go and dispel at
various levels we're going to dispel this this idea of
authentic self actually at three different levels alright there's three
layers of depth here and each layer goes deeper and
deeper and deeper the third one is incredibly deep you
might not even be ready for it right now but
I'm going to give you a hint of it and
you're going to need to get over this isn't me
idea in order to grow yourself because this is one
of the most tricky and kind of like just stop
you dead in your tracks methods that your brain has
for preventing you from growing because take a note as
soon as you say that something isn't you something isn't
authentic to who you are that immediately cuts off that
possibility forever from your life forever you're never going to
ever master that area of your life just because you
said or you believe in your mind that this thing
isn't really you why because there is this incongruity now
between what maybe you feel you could be but then
what your subconscious mind thinks that you actually are this
is getting into the concept of self image which I
have a whole video on you can check that out
I'll link it below it's called self image but we're
going to go even deeper here right even further than
self image and really take a look at what it
really means to be your authentic self because I see
a lot of people getting it confused here and I
use this label authentic self and sometimes I use it
in different ways so it does get a little bit
confusing a little bit tricky let me help you guide
let me help guide you through some of these some
of these weeds here so here are the three levels
that we're going to tackle this at number one is
the following the authentic you isn't your present you and
it's not your past you it's who you will become
after full self-actualization happens which is an ideal you're never
going to be fully self actualized you're always going to
be working towards that ideal but here's the first mistake
that most people make is they think that their past
is somehow giving them a sense of who they are
and that that's kind of their authentic self that's not
your authentic self that's like your weakest version of your
possible self right when I talk about authentic self I'm
talking about your most evolved ultimate highest possible potential life
this means that if you do everything perfectly in your
life then you would be moving towards this ideal if
for the next 30 or 40 years in your life
you worked your ass off every single day working and
expanding yourself at every single part of your life that
you could think of that would get you towards your
authentic self that's how I use this concept when I
talk about in my videos this is very different than
the way that most of you think about it because
a lot of people will use this idea of authentic
self to stay in social - comfort zone right and
say oh but that's not you know that that requires
work that requires labor and and discipline and effort and
you know that's not that's not really me that's not
what I'm talking about that's not really your authentic self
so that's the first level and I'm going to go
into more details on this but I want to give
you a preview of the next two levels so the
second level is really the going back to the original
quote from Heraclitus the beginning this video and it's this
interesting idea that who you are is constantly changing we
like to speak about a self myself yourself authentic self
he's being authentic she's being authentic she's this way he's
that way but we really talking about this is this
is a conceptualization a theoretical notion if we take a
look at real life who are you if we say
that U is the common-sense notion that we have kind
of the unenlightened notion that you are your body you
are your brain in your mind if we say that
ok let's say that's you then even if we take
that idea which we're going to expand on later but
let's take that for now what is that that's a
system right that's a system comprised of billions of neurons
trillions of cells all working in coordination together molecules and
chemicals and proteins and fluids and organs all this stuff
interacting really you can think of your body almost like
a like a country right what is a country a
country is just an abstract label for actually what for
a of the globe the physical geography of the globe
it's also the ocean and the water that's there surrounding
the territory you might say but it's also all the
people in it it's the ideas that people have so
it's this very very abstract high-level idea country right but
we speak about countries as though they are real entities
really that's kind of a simplification that we have in
our mind well it's the same thing when we when
we talk about you who you are is constantly changing
every second every minute every hour every day every year
your body is changing it's not staying the same your
mind and your brain is changing so in a very
real sense we can say that there is no you
you is always evolving always shifting you could be growing
you could be declining you could be thriving you could
be dying you can be aging all of us are
aging right so this is the second level and I'll
talk about more about that in a minute but then
we have the third the most advanced the deepest level
and this is the level that says that really there's
no such thing as you at all even the scientific
model that says that you are your body and you
are your brain in your mind and your thoughts that
then that is illusory not only is it that all
the molecules and chemicals in your your body and your
brain are changing but this idea goes so deep it
it says that your even more than that right you
literally are the whole of experience in the whole of
reality not just your body and your thoughts so on
this level this idea of self authentic self is just
a total fiction and it's completely a ridiculous concept in
fact this is a concept that creates a lot of
suffering in your life but this is a very advanced
level so I'm not going to go into too much
detail on it here check out my videos on enlightenment
which I'll be shooting a lot of which will help
you to understand this idea if you're curious about it
and it's a very fascinating and a very important idea
for you to start to understand and just to actually
practice in living your life but let's go back for
a second to some of these initial levels that we
talked about so this initial level the first one which
is this idea that the authentic you is the self
actualized you who you will become if you expand yourself
in all the different areas of your life really this
is this is the idea of this distinction that I
have between the lazy self and the best self see
all of us if we just kind of leave ourselves
on the natural trajectory of our own life what is
that that is really us being our lazy self that's
kind of us running on the same track and doing
the easy stuff in life the stuff that's convenient and
comfortable the stuff we know we can do the stuff
we're very confident in we're very sure about and a
lot of people frankly they live their whole life this
way after they go through their teens and their 20s
they experience all the natural growth that they're going to
experience once they get past twenty-one they pretty much start
to flat line and Plateau and their life just kind
of keeps going like this and it's just more of
the same and the same and the same and the
same because really what was happening is that inner teens
and in their 20s they were experiencing lots of natural
growth because your body's growing your brain is growing new
new ideas are coming in there you're getting a lot
of education and schooling so you're just kind of getting
acclimated to the world once you're acclimated as an adult
then you're pretty self-sufficient and you can maintain yourself on
this consistent even level if you want to and that's
the easiest thing to do that's the most natural thing
to do right requires no additional education no additional labor
no additional development of skills no pushing of any comfort
zones so that is kind of the status quo that's
the default position now of course natural this idea of
natural a lot of people also use this as an
ego defense mechanism and say stuff like Balea that's not
natural to me it's not natural to me to go
talk dirty to my girl insect when I'm having sex
with her it's not natural to me to go chat
up a girl in a bar or club it's not
natural for me to work on this marriage it's not
natural for me to go work hard on my career
it's not natural for me to learn any language you
know it's not natural for me to earn lots of
money it's not natural for me to be fit and
healthy and have a six-pack so all these kinds of
ideas but see this idea of natural what you're really
saying there is that you don't want to take the
challenge you don't want to take on the challenge it's
too much struggle and what you really want to do
is you want to stay comfortable do you want to
stay in your comfort zone and of course who can
blame you who doesn't like being comfortable who doesn't like
staying in a comfort zone all the time in modern
society it's very easy to be comfortable you get a
job that pays your bills and you're pretty much set
at that point you can get a comfortable apartment and
get comfortable car get a comfortable bed furnish everything you
like you can find a comfortable guy or girl to
be with and then you can just coast you just
coast through life and you eat comfortable foods that make
you fatter and fatter and fatter slowly over time destroy
your health and you just do kind of the comfortable
stuff that's easy to do at work and that makes
you mediocre and average at your work nothing's really advanced
you're just kind of mediocre and average and you keep
going and going and going but it pays the bills
so you know you're happy you sit at home you
watch a little television you play a little video games
you go out to the movies once in a while
do some fun stuff with your friends and that's a
comfortable life it's not too hard to get that these
days it's not but what happens there because of this
idea of self-actualization and Abraham Maslow's idea that self-actualization is
actually not a luxury but it's a requirement of your
psyche once you get the basics in your life down
you're not going to just sit there what's going to
happen is that your mind is going to slowly start
to rot and your soul is going to rot from
the inside out because you know that you're destined for
something much greater in life you know that you have
so much more potential you know that you could be
doing something amazing for society you know that you could
have an amazing impact you know that you have these
strengths and natural talents whatever they are whether they're artistic
talents business talents interpersonal skills logical skills mathematical skills you
know whatever you're really good at you know that you
owe it to yourself to develop those and to work
really hard on those so that you can really turn
and turn those talents to something that really shines so
this idea of being natural watch out for that what's
natural is usually and I don't know about you but
I don't want a life I don't want a natural
life I want the best possible life the self actualized
life and for that you have to have this expectation
that you're going to be working really hard growing yourself
for some people this seems scary and it seems like
well why would I want to work so hard leo
like what's the point well I can't just I just
be like accepting of myself as I am just live
this comfortable kind of life well like I said it
starts to produce problems down the road for you you
start to rot from the inside out and also the
greatest fulfillment and pleasure that you get from life is
not these low-level pleasures of satisfying some your basic with
food and sex and shelter but it's the high-level pleasures
of self-actualization work growing yourself pushing yourself in conquering obstacles
being on that hero's journey in your life living a
life with passion helping other people in whatever way you
want to help them by creating some amazing art or
creating an amazing company in a business or doing some
sort of charitable work you know whatever lights you up
that's where you get the deepest sense of fulfillment in
life is when you're doing that when you're sharing and
greatest gifts so I think you sense that and I
think you know that you want that in your life
right if you do you have to change this expectation
of your authentic self being who you were in the
past or who you are presently that's not your authentic
self your authentic self is what your to be growing
to every single day when you're pushing yourself let me
give you a sense of what your authentic self looks
like because it's still kind of abstract I wanna make
it very concrete and don't think that this doesn't apply
to you this description that I'm about to give you
applies to you even if right now you feel like
this is totally not you this can be you and
this must be you if you want to be self
actualized here it is your authentic self if you were
that right now he or she would be confident completely
confident assertive disciplined internally grounded in his or her own
values emotionally stable on purpose in life passionate deeply passionate
about everything that you're doing in life having zero limiting
beliefs of any kind believing not in a idealistic quixotic
kind of way but in a in a pragmatic kind
of way believing that you can accomplish whatever you want
to accomplish in life having that sense of strength and
power having a high self-esteem knowing that you deserve it
knowing that you deserve enormous success knowing that you deserve
enormous happiness in life having a desire to explore all
of life not judging it but just wanting to explore
and partake in it being fully self expressive not holding
back at all for anyone not being hemmed in by
anyone's opinions of you having zero fears complete fearlessness being
able to go in and tackle any kind of challenge
in life any kind of obstacle any kind of project
that you want without your fears holding you back it
also means being 100 cent positive no negative thoughts of
any kind seeing the world as a beautiful amazing positive
place and wanting to make it even better it also
means being social and outgoing even if right now you're
shy or introverted it also means being generous being generous
with yourself being generous with your time and really being
generous with the work that you're doing doing work that
is promoting the good of other people and is making
you fulfilled inside just by looking and seeing at the
impact that you're having on the world it's being selfless
it's not caring so much about a lot of petty
little problems in life but being more idealistic being more
values driven being driven by higher consciousness it's also having
high consciousness it's being a high consciousness state rather than
a low consciousness state which is the difference for example
when you're meditating high consciousness state when you're fulfilling your
goals and your dreams and you're working really hard that
puts you in a high consciousness state low consciousness state
is when you're watching television or when you're doing drugs
or when you're stuffing yourself full of junk food being
authentic also means that you're healthy fat is not authentic
there's nothing authentic about being fat there's nothing about being
overweight there's nothing authentic about doing drugs or other kind
of chemical dependencies or addictions so being completely clean completely
sober and completely healthy and fit lean the way your
body was designed to be your body was designed to
be lean whether you're a man or a woman who's
going to be lean energetic muscular full of vitality that's
authentic that's your authentic self authentic self also means that
your sexual highly sexual open about your sexuality comfortable with
your sexuality whether you're a man or a woman speaking
of man or woman authentic self means that you're comfortable
being either very masculine or very feminine or if you're
in between somewhere you're comfortable with whatever position your hormones
have kind of placed you in in life but you're
comfortable with that so if you're very feminine you're comfortable
being very feminine if you're very masculine you're comfortable with
that and you expand into it and you grow into
it and you delight in it authentic self also means
that you're you're accepting of the other opposite pole of
you as far as gender goes it means that you
understand the opposite sex you don't hold resentment towards the
opposite sex and it means that you can even partake
in the opposite sex as energy yourself sometimes if you're
masculine you can be feminine if you're feminine you can
be masculine and you're okay with that you're comfortable with
that you're secure with that being your authentic self also
means that you're completely open-minded no idea offends you no
matter how positive or how negative it is you're so
open mind that you're willing to consider any kind of
idea you're willing to consider that you're wrong you're willing
to readjust any beliefs or models that you have about
the world and it just also means that you have
this sense of nobility about how you approach life you
always take the high road rather than the low road
in whatever you're doing in your relationships and your interactions
with people strangers family members the way you run your
business the way you approach your career even the flats
that you have there noble thoughts they're not petty thoughts
so that's the picture right that's that's all the detail
that fills in this abstract notion of authentic self now
notice how different this is from what you might think
your authentic self is it's very different and even right
now as you hear all this you might be saying
Billy oh how can you be saying this you don't
know me I'm a very unique person I have my
own strengths and and personality quirks and everyone's different you
might say how can you say that everyone's going to
be this way how can you say that everyone's going
to be fearless and everyone's going to be masculine or
feminine and everyone's gonna be open-minded I say this because
on a fundamental level we're all human beings and although
there are lots of differences between us we have our
little quirks and strengths and talents and and values and
all this kind of stuff in the end a human
being is is pretty easy to define once you've study
human beings for a long time you do a lot
of research and on psychology and you study this stuff
you see that pretty much there's like this baseline level
of what a really proper example of a human being
is kind of like an exemplar of a true human
being and this is what it is this is kind
of what it all boils down to if you're deficient
in any one of these areas and it's hard for
you to even imagine that you could be extremely confident
and assertive and have zero fears and be sexual and
be healthy and all this other kind of stuff well
that's because you've got a lot of bad social conditioning
past traumatic events bad psychology negative thinking limiting beliefs poor
self-image poor self-esteem low self confidence all this stuff for
you to work on this is all stuff that is
kind of like you might think about it this way
like I think I've made this analogy before imagine like
you're the Sun this bright shining Sun this like fireball
of energy and you're just bursting with energy right with
energy in every direction just like rays of light shooting
out but when you're born as the Sun and as
you're growing up in your in your early years through
your early 20s what happens is that it really gets
gets like caked with lots of grime and dust and
smudge and for some people there's so much grime and
smudge on the Sun that maybe there's like one little
ray shooting out in this direction maybe there's like a
little ray shooting out in that direction just like a
couple and you think that that's the authentic you that's
not the authentic you the authentic you is who you
are when all that grime is removed and that's what
I'm telling you with all these little characteristics that I
just mentioned all these details that's who you will be
now don't get me wrong you're going to have your
own individuality right your own character strengths are going to
be in there your own usually gonna have weaknesses in
there in certain places you shouldn't have your own preferences
you're gonna have your own values so you're still going
to be very different and very unique from everybody else
that's out there but stuff like confidence this is a
very general characteristic you can be confident about doing your
art somebody else can be confident doing their business somebody
else can be confident about the marriage they're in or
something else like that so confidence is like a very
broad characteristic as is assertiveness as is fearlessness as is
passion as is being social and outgoing all of these
things are just kind of like almost like tools in
your tool belt and when you're a fully authentic human
being you have like a full tool belt of all
these tools that you can literally manipulate anything you want
in any way that you want and then it's up
to you to choose which tools you use maybe certain
tools you'll never really need other tools you'll use a
lot that's where the customization comes in but overall you
want to have this you know this freedom to do
whatever you want with your life okay so really right
there everything we just talked about that is covering that
first point about the fact that your authentic self is
the fully self actualized self now let's go into the
second point about your authentic self really not even existing
because you're constantly changing all the time see a lot
of people they'll say that the self is a thing
as though it was a noun right I am a
now I'm a thing I'm a person but actually you're
not a noun what you are on this second level
that we're talking about is you're a verb you're not
you you're being you and being is a process this
is a dangerous thing to do is is something called
nominalization this idea where you take something that's actually a
an active process and then you transform it with language
and concepts into like this static thing which doesn't actually
exist in reality right now I'm talking to you and
my brain is rewiring itself as I'm talking to you
I'm literally changing as I'm talking to you as I'm
hearing what I'm saying that's creating more insights within me
that's giving me even deeper understanding of myself all in
the span of this this video that's happening right now
so who I was when I started shooting this video
is not who I am right now in the middle
of the video and when I finish this video I
want to be a little bit different it's a subtle
difference it's not a life-transforming difference but you know what
over the years these little differences add up and they
can produce enormous changes which is how you can have
someone who is fat their whole life then get skinny
be shy their whole life then get really confident be
horrible with money then start earning millions of dollars be
horrible in business then create a billion-dollar business be horrible
in relationships or marriages and then find his perfect dream
girlfriend or boyfriend and partner for life this is how
this stuff could happen and although it's rare it's not
the norm you can have this happen in your life
it's just a matter of being conscious about wanting it
and going out there pursuing it and also knowing how
to do it having the right tools strategies mindsets so
be careful about this don't don't put yourself in this
little box and tell yourself that you're this noun this
thing actually you're a process it's always evolving sohow faith
that changes are happening within you all the time you
just need to direct them in the in the right
direction a little bit your brain is literally changing itself
every minute good the next point I want to talk
about is that you have to realize that this self-image
that you have which is a bunch of beliefs about
yourself you have a self-image that tells you how beautiful
you think you are how attractive you think you are
to the opposite sex how good you think you'll be
in business how good and talented you think you are
at art or at math or science or learning or
any other kind of skill in life you have a
self-image that tells you how good you think you are
as a human being how much value you feel you
have in society relative to other people your self-image tells
you how how often you think you'll succeed versus how
often you think you'll fail and all of this is
beliefs and these beliefs they've all been installed simply through
your upbringing a lot of people they get very attached
to these beliefs and they say well this self-image just
is really me this is who I am no you
got a you got to be a little bit less
serious about it the fact is that your self-image has
been shaped largely by influences outside of your control literally
by a random fluke look you haven't to be born
in a certain country at a certain time instance in
in modern society you happen to be raised in a
certain type of family go to a certain type of
school hang out with certain types of friends watch certain
types of TV engage in other certain types of media
movies and magazines and books and all these things a
lot of them were just random someone gave you a
book you read it it changed some part of your
self-image you watch the random show on the television that
change your self-image somebody called you a bad name at
school when you're grown up that affected your self-image your
parents maybe they neglected you that affected your self-image but
all these things are very random they might have been
totally different just complete fluke random it's kind of like
noise in the system and a lot of people what
I see them doing is they take this noise and
they get attached to it they say oh this is
me this is me this is who I am don't
tell me to change this I'm proud of Who I
am there's nothing really to be proud of in this
noise don't take it too seriously sure I mean be
proud of your accomplishments and be proud of the challenges
you went through life but don't be so attached to
is so clinging to it that you're so closed-minded now
that you can't expand yourself more don't don't don't use
this idea to to limit you all your ideas in
your self-image should be enabling you to expand even further
that's what I want so don't turn your past behaviors
your past successes and your past failures into a definition
of who you are because you're an undefinable thing you're
a limitless thing literally your potential life is so amazing
so vast you could take your life in any direction
you want right now literally any direction you want you
don't even imagine all the directions you could take it
in because it would it would overwhelm your brain probably
give you a headache but it's all there for you
some of it might seem a little more natural than
others some of some of those options might seem a
lot more challenging or easy than others but you know
what that that's fine that doesn't necessarily mean much so
here we're going to wrap up with this with this
level number two and I want to talk a little
bit about level number three because this is a much
deeper level and this level really starts to boggle your
mind really starts to mess with your concept of identity
because we think about this identity we're so attached to
our identities but actually what you can come to realize
through lots of mindfulness work looking into enlightenment this idea
that I'm talking about now is going to it's going
to start to bleed into enlightenment and really what we're
technically speaking is is this idea is that simply your
identity is literally a concept and a concept is a
figment of your imagination everything that is a thought that
you have in your brain is a conceptualization of reality
it's like a fiction of the real thing that's out
there and this is the say this is the case
with who you think you are and which you can
actually discover this is kind of a freaky thing to
discover this is the most freaky also the most threatening
thing that you can discover is that you literally who
you think you are including this body in this mind
and this brain in your your past history that that
is a fiction it's a very elaborate fiction created by
your brain by your ego and which you'll really learn
is that there is no authentic self because there's no
self period what there is is there is just life
living itself and what you are is you are just
pure awareness pure awareness of life is what you are
of course I'm saying this kind of like as a
as a story to you so whether you believe it
or don't believe it it won't get you far this
is something you can only you can only encounter directly
to lots and lots of introspection hard work which I'll
help you do I'm going to create more videos about
how to go in there do that kind of work
but I just want to give you a bit of
a preview of where all this stuff is going because
it's exciting to think about this stuff at least domain
this is kind of where all of personal development ultimately
leads to is this kind of idea of no self
is a very very powerful idea so whether you think
that your pot your this positive person or this negative
person whether you think all you have all these strengths
and all these advantages to you or you think that
you don't and the other what I'm telling you is
that none of that stuff is actually real these are
just like stories in your mind now what's nice about
this is that you no longer need to be like
stuck in life because of this you don't longer need
to cling to stuff you no longer need to cling
to yourself and you need this like sense of relief
right because all of your tensions in life where they
come from they come from having to preserve this self
image which you've got costly preserving it constantly fighting for
it constantly being this kind of survival do-or-die type of
mode and this makes you very frantic it also makes
you very selfish it makes you very petty and it
really kind of like blocks you up when you can
let go of that when you can let go of
your ego when you let go of your selfish and
pain desires then like you expand out right you expand
you start to see yourself as being more connected with
everything and when that happens then you're not held up
by fears so much by limiting beliefs so much by
all the stuff and all the kind of monkey chatter
going on in your brain you let that stuff go
and then what you find is you find that you
get your best performance in life you find that you
just flow smoother that you're like a you're like a
superconductor right you're a superconductor of life like it's just
electricity just like flows through you life force just flows
through you become very creative you become very disciplined very
organized very caring about others you really start to move
towards this first level idea that I talked about which
is all the details of the self actualized fully authentic
self you really start to naturally just gravitate and kind
of like flow towards that without having to work very
hard which is really cool and watch is why I'm
I'm so kind of excited about doing in light Network
for me and showing you how to do it so
that's pretty much it that's a very deep deep deep
deep understanding of authentic self hopefully this gets you a
lot more clarity when I talk about authentic self from
now on I want you to to understand what I'm
really talking about this higher level self not the petty
self that you think you are and really what this
just shows you is that you've got a lot of
growth to do and there's so much potential for you
there's so much you can have in life it's really
a positive positive message this isn't the most positive message
you could want is that you are this Sun and
you don't need to worry about working too hard all
you got to do is like wipe off that grime
every day wipe off a little bit of that grime
a little bit of that grime and like a new
little ray of light will shine through and another one
and another one and another one in all directions and
then soon enough if you can you know do this
personal development journey for a while and really work hard
at it then you wipe away a lot of that
grime then you can really shine you could turn into
an amazing inspirational human being the kind of human being
that you read about in a book or you watch
a movie about where you hear a story about why
do we have stories why do we have myths about
these type of people because they inspire us they show
us our highest potential they bring us to tears they
make us emotional they inspire us to live life to
the fullest because you've only got one life and it
only lasts for so long and that length of time
