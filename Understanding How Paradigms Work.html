Hey, this is Leo for actualised.org. And in this episode,
I'm going to be talking about understanding how paradigms work.
And this very sneaky phenomenon of paradigm lock. If you
want to experience massive growth quickly, and you want to
get to the root of most of your issues in
life, and you really need to study and understand how
paradigms work, and this phenomenon that I call paradigm lock.
This is a very in depth episode, a very foundational
episode we're going to cover, one of the most important
topics that you can possibly understand for understanding all of
life is this notion of paradigms and paradigm lock. So
stay with me, it's going to be a little bit
abstract at first, but by the end of it, you'll
see a lot of practical applications. And this is some
very mind blowing stuff. So first, let's talk about what
a paradigm is, in the second half of the episode,
we'll get to paradigm lock and what that phenomenon is.
So what is a paradigm, the definition of it would
be something like a philosophical or theoretical framework of any
kind, including all of the assumptions and ways of thinking
and ways of interpretation that one might have. So think
of a paradigm as a self contained view of reality,
like a lens, a colored lens that you look through,
except the trick with paradigms is that they don't feel
like they're just a view of reality, they don't feel
like they're a lens. So most of the time, you're
not aware that you're in this view, and you're not
aware that you're using a lens, it just feels like
reality, we call it reality, we don't call it a
view. We don't call it a model. We don't call
it a framework. We don't think of it that way,
our mind just sees it as reality. And you can
see how this leads to a lot of self deception
possibilities, which is why it's very important to study the
mechanics of paradigms, which is what we should explore right
now. So it's interesting because this word paradigm has become
quite popular in common vernacular. But this only happened recently.
In 1962, Thomas Kuhn, who's a historian of science, and
a philosopher, he published the book, a revolutionary book, one
of the most important works of philosophy in the last
100 years, called The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. And this
was groundbreaking stuff. And it was based on a very
simple investigation, the investigation, you would have thought that we
did this hundreds of years ago, but apparently no one
did this until Thomas Kuhn came around. What Commons Kuhn
did is he just said, Hey, you know what? I'm
interested in understanding how science works. The process of science,
what is science? How is it that it works? And
rather than doing what most philosophers and scientists have been
doing for hundreds and 1000s of years now, which is
that they were speculating and theorizing about how science works.
What he did is say, You know what, let me
take a historical perspective. Let me actually take a look
at how science has evolved over the last 1000 to
500 years, and see what the history actually tells us.
Maybe the history of science tells us something other than
what we assumed science is maybe can reveal some interesting
stuff. And he found some very interesting stuff, which has
revolutionized how we think about the theoretical foundations of science.
Some of the stuff he found was rather shocking. It
shocked the philosophical community and the scientific community. And from
that, we got the word paradigm in our common vernacular.
He popularized the term because his work was so groundbreaking.
So what did he do? Well, he studied various scientific
revolutions, for example, the Copernican revolution in science, the Einsteinian
revolution, he studied Newton, he studied various scientific, more minor
revolution that you probably heard, haven't heard of, in chemistry,
and in other aspects of science. And he looked at
just basically, how does science evolve? And what do scientists
actually do on a day to day basis? And then
what kind of changes lead to big breakthroughs in science?
So he studied all that. And what he discovered is
that science is a lot more conservative than people usually
think. And that in practice, science work very differently than
we think of it in theory. In theory, we like
to put signs up on a pedestal. And we like
to say, Well, science is the sort of ideal. It's
this ideal process of investigation, this empirical, fact based, very
objective investigation to the nature of reality, which yields certain
inevitable truths. And sure there's fallibility in it. But generally,
science operates on this kind of higher level, which transcends
petty human biases and culture, and all that sort of
stuff. But when Thomas Kuhn went through the history books,
and he actually studied this stuff, what he discovered is
actually no, science is highly subject to dogma, to cultural
biases, and to clinging to old frameworks. And this notion
shocked the scientific establishment, because scientists like to view the
their work. And the whole process of science is very
objective. They like to view it as a universal process,
not a human process, not a cultural process, but universal,
so that it's not even the human species engaged in
this work, but something even higher, we're tapping into really
universal truths with the scientific method. But what Thomas Kuhn
discovered is that that's not how it works at all.
In reality, most scientists are very closed minded, very dogmatic
and very traditional. And he found four basic ways in
which paradigms influence and inquiry. One is that they influence
what is studied and what is researched. So depending on
your paradigm, whatever your paradigm is, in whatever field you're
working in, that will influence what things you study and
research seems kind of obvious. Secondly, it influences the type
of questions that get asked at all. Thirdly, it influences
the exact structure and nature of the questions that are
being asked in that field. And fourthly, it influences the
paradigm influences how results are interpreted. So when you go
on, or you run a science experiment, you get some
data back. And usually we're just seem like, well, data
is data, right? Everyone agrees on the data? Not so
fast. What Thomas Kuhn discovered is that actually, the data
the interpretation of data, this is a much trickier affair
than we normally assume. And here's where your paradigm, your
entire framework of the world, or your field, will heavily
influence how you interpret the data, which data do you
think is relevant, and which is irrelevant? You see, I'm
going to add two additional points to how paradigms influence
inquiry. One of my points is that the paradigm shapes
what is allowed to be possible. And what is imagined
as possible, is the very big point. So depending on
what your paradigm is of biology, chemistry, physics, reality, or
whatever field you're working in. Your paradigm tells you what
is and isn't possible in that field. And it also
determines how your imagination is going to work. And thinking
about various possibilities, there are certain possibilities that you won't
even imagine from within your paradigm. And this is where
the paradigm becomes very constrictive. Because you can see how
if your imagination is crippled, and your ability to think
about the possibilities is crippled within your field, how much
that will limit your possibility to make new discoveries. And
that's exactly what Thomas Kuhn found, is that most scientists
aren't outside the box thinkers, they're very traditional. And what
they do is they just go through a very routine
process of collecting data within the established paradigm of their
time and of their culture. And only rarely do we
have scientific revolutions where somebody like Newton, or Einstein, or
Galileo comes along and flips the paradigm upside down on
its head. That's very rare. Most scientists are not working
like that. And the reason that these revolutions happen is
because most of the time 90% of the time, the
regular sciences, the majority of them are just working to
collect data to validate the existing paradigm. And this leads
to certain A phenomenon that I call paradigm lock. I'll
talk more about that as we go on. Another bonus
point that I want to give you here about how
paradigms influence inquiry into the nature of reality is the
assumptions that are made by the paradigm. And the things
that the paradigm takes as self evident. What's interesting about
paradigms, whether they be scientific ones, or religious ones, or
spiritual ones, or secular ones, or economic ones, and I'll
give you lots of examples of paradigms coming up here
in a minute, is that each paradigm takes things for
granted, and makes assumptions about what is self evident to
that paradigm. There are certain things within mathematics, for example,
the paradigm of mathematics that have taken us self evident.
Certain things within science, certain things within religion, certain thing
within within economics, and so forth. And this notion of
stuff being self evident, man, this ends up being something
that comes back to bite you really in the ass.
This notion of self evidence, this is something you can
see how this notion of self evidence allows the mind
to get away with basically anything that it wants to
get away with. This opens the doors for self delusion.
That's a problem when you want to do a inquiry
into the nature of reality. So the way that science
works is we have long periods of them science of
gathering data inside a paradigm and then short, rare periods
of overthrowing the paradigm. The way that a paradigm gets
overthrown, is when enough anomalies get collected, through the ordinary
scientific process, that finally the existing paradigm becomes untenable. And
it has to be rejected and somebody has to come
up with a radical new scheme. And then once someone
comes up with that, he usually gets a Nobel Prize.
He gets a lot of credit, but only after his
work has been subjected to a lot of skepticism, criticism,
denunciation, and even demonization and rejection. So that's the really
interesting thing is that most scientists are extremely closed minded.
And only after the fact, after the entire paradigm has
evolved, and went through that critical period of transition, and
only after the revolution has completed itself, only then do
we look back in retrospect and say, oh, yeah, that
was obvious. You know, Albert Einstein's work in overthrowing the
new Newtonian mechanical paradigm. That's obvious stuff. Now. It wasn't
obvious then. And Galileo overthrowing the old paradigm of the
Sun orbiting the Earth, it's obviously silly. Now, that's so
easy for us to understand. But back then it was
no joke. It was a life and death matter. So
we have to be very careful about not taking history
for granted. Another point that Thomas Kuhn made about paradigms
that paradigms are a real mind bending thing, because he
said that paradigms are incommensurate will. Which means that when
you have two strictly different paradigms, you can't necessarily translate
from one paradigm into the next. These paradigms, you can
think of them almost as isolated bubbles. There's a bubble
here and a bubble here, there's a way to interpret
reality this way. And then a totally different way to
interpret reality this way. And it's not always easy to,
to communicate between these two different bubbles. And of course,
there can be way more than just do bubbles. This
he called it commensurability. Now, he was actually later challenged
on this. Because people went and looked at his work
and say, well, in commencer, is it really the case
that one paradigm can't be translated into another paradigm? Is
it really the case that when you're in a paradigm
that you are in like a totally different reality, in
a sense, that's what Thomas Kuhn wanted to say at
the extreme. But some people have real bad back and
said, No paradigms aren't really like that we can interpenetrate
paradigms. So that's a more complicated issue, which I'll leave
for another day. Maybe if I do an episode on
the philosophy of science, that's where you would really get
into that stuff very deep. But what I'm interested in
here is taking this notion of paradigms and now showing
you the enormous implications that they can have for personal
development. Because I'm not just interested in coming up here
and give you interesting philosophical theories. that's well and good,
but we're interested in application here. So let me give
you a list of paradigms. So you are clear about
what I'm talking about with this word. And then we're
gonna get into paradigm lock. With paradigm lock. That's where
the application happens for personal development. So stick with me
here, here's the list of paradigms, I want to give
you a big list. So you're really clear about how
significant this stuff is. This really affects all of humanity.
All social systems, all scientific endeavors, philosophical endeavors, and your
personal life. So here are some very traditional examples of
paradigms told me these heavenly spheres model of the universe.
So this is a 2000 year old theory comes from
Tomi, which is the notion that the heavens are made
out of the spheres and everything is rotating on a
sphere that Earth is at the very center. So it's
the sort of Earth centric model of the universe, and
the stars are on these spheres. Sounds silly nowadays, but
back then 2000 years ago, is really considered the best
model, the Platonic forms paradigm. So Plato, if you studied
him and lost the class, then he had this whole
notion of these abstract forms that were like the essence
of reality, and that our sense perceptions are at the
essence of these platonic forms are the essence. So that
was a paradigm, a sort of framework, a lens through
which you saw the whole world, and you interpreted everything
you saw, through that lens of Platonic forms or heavenly
spheres, when you actually looked up into the night sky?
Under Ptolemies model, you would actually imagine and see those
spheres in a sense, they weren't visible, but you, your
mind just kind of filled that in, right? Because our
minds are very conceptual. Also, from the classic era, we
have teleology. teleology is the idea which has really gone
out of favor nowadays. But this idea that objects and
things in the world have a purpose. For example, there
might be examples from ancient Greeks or Romans, like philosophers,
and they would say, well, the purpose of a horse,
what's the purpose of a horse? Well, the purpose of
a horse is to carry man or to carry load.
That was his theological purpose, or the teleological sort of
purpose of an acorn is to become an oak tree.
That was his purpose. And that has kind of been
abandoned. But that was an interesting way of looking at
objects, you looked at them purposefully, like the purpose of
a pencil is for you to write with it. And
this was seen as something very essential, almost like, inherent
to the fabric of reality is that all these different
objects have these baked in purposes. Kind of interesting way
to look at the world. Atheism versus theism is a
paradigm. There's the atheist paradigm. There's the theist paradigm, the
no god paradigm versus the god paradigm. There's the paradigm
of Euclidean geometry and non Euclidean geometry, this is very
interesting. This is actually something that then affected Einstein's work,
in that he had the brilliant idea that maybe space
is curved, which means that space is not Euclidean, but
non Euclidean. And that was made possible by the discoveries
of non Euclidean geometry was up, which was a huge
paradigm shift that happened to just 100 years prior to
Einstein's time, within the field of mathematics, whereas for the,
for the past 2000 years, most people assume that the
only kind of geometry that was possible was straight line,
Euclidean geometry, until we discovered that, hey, there are complex
surfaces beyond just the plane, there's the sphere, there can
be spherical geometry, or hyperbola. geometries, which really opened up
the doors that took a paradigm revolution, paradigm shift. The
paradigm of Newtonian physics versus Einsteinian relativity, we've already alluded
to that. But that was a huge paradigm shift, and
came from two different totally different ways of looking at
the world and seeing space and time in very different
ways. The naive realist paradigm, I've talked about this in
a separate episode about naive realism. The naive realist paradigm
basically, is the notion of reality that people have an
external reality, three dimensional spatial reality, a reality made out
of matter, atoms, molecules, and so forth. That's a paradigm.
But notice that you think that that's how reality is
if you buy into that paradigm, you don't think of
it as a paradigm. You think of it as reality.
The paradigms of rationalism versus in Pyrrhus ism versus idealism.
If you study philosophy even a little bit, then you
should be familiar with at least those three basic paradigms.
Those have been themes throughout philosophy for hundreds, if not
1000s of years. mathematics itself is a paradigm and within
mathematics, different fields of mathematics, from calculus to statistics to
number theory, to topology, they are also containing different paradigms.
karma and rebirth is a paradigm comes from a lot
of Eastern traditions, where they have this whole paradigm they
see life as just this never ending cycle of rebirth,
death and rebirth, death and rebirth, definitely rebirth a soul,
this immutable soul that goes through this infinite process of
rebirth. And karma is playing a big role in that.
That's the whole paradigm in the West here, we generally
don't think of life that way. Two different ways think
about life, and death. Consciousness is brain activity, that's a
paradigm, you probably think that consciousness comes from your brain.
That's a paradigm that's not reality. That's the paradigm you
have the triple paradigms that you're not conscious that you
hold paradigms. That's why they're so sneaky. Quantum mechanics is
a paradigm. The modern cosmology, the notion of the universe
is a big bang that's expanding and inflating. That's a
paradigm, as contrasted with a static universe is how we
thought about the universe. Just 100 years ago, we thought
the universe was static until we discovered that it wasn't.
logic and rationality are paradigms. You better believe that's a
paradigm. That's not a given at all. That's a paradigm
that you're using. In philosophy, logical positivism is a paradigm.
Darwinism versus intelligent design. Those are two different paradigms. Scientology
is a paradigm capitalism versus communism, paradigm, liberalism versus conservative
ism. How about pickup? Are you into pickup? Have you
noticed how much pickup is a paradigm? Huge paradigm? One
that blindsides a lot of people. Because most people who
do pickup get into it, they get into it for
sex. They get into it for ego. They don't usually
know about paradigms, they usually haven't studied epistemology, or philosophy.
So they're not aware of this stuff. And they get
really sucked into that paradigm of pickup. And they see
the whole world through this lens of pickup. And that
becomes quite a trap for them. Success oriented Self Help
is a paradigm, all the self help material that promises
you to attract wealth, and cars, and houses and yachts,
and just this whole notion that you're developing yourself to
improve your life. That's an entire paradigm of personal development.
There are totally different paradigms, you don't have to be
developing yourself for those reasons at all. It's interesting that
once you can see that as a paradigm, you can
literally walk down the aisle at a bookstore, and just
walk through the self help aisle. And you can see
shelf after shelf after shelf of books that are just
all within that one paradigm that are missing a lot
of other elements. Of course, there's spiritual based self help,
which is another different paradigm. And there could be crossover
between those two, but often they're there, they tend to
occupy different shelves in the bookstore. That's interesting, because the
people who are into success oriented self help, oftentimes poopoo
the spiritual or the self help. And the people who
are into the spiritual self help they poopoo the successor
into self help. Because these people occupy different paradigms, different
bubbles, so to speak. Freudian psychoanalysis is a paradigm. It's
gone out of favor nowadays. There's also union psychology, which
is a paradigm. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is another psychological paradigm.
There's a lot of paradigms within psychology, there's Gestalt psychology,
and many, many others. If you study psychology, you can
get into all those. And then you can compare and
contrast which paradigms you'd like better, which are more effective
at solving your problems. Entire cultures like Islam or Hinduism,
becomes a paradigm. Buddhism becomes a paradigm. Of course, all
the religions or paradigms. Eastern versus Western medicine is a
paradigm. A lot of Western doctors are not aware of
the fact even though they have spent years decades studying
the medicine, they're not aware that they are operating within
a western medicine paradigm, and that there are limits to
that paradigm, very real limits. Western history is a paradigm.
A lot of people study here Street for 10 or
15 years all through high school and middle school and
elementary school and in college. And they recognize that that
history is all shaped by paradigms. Modern academia is the
paradigm, the university system and how it works. That's a
paradigm. Conspiracy theories are paradigms. Astrology is a paradigm, vegetarianism,
versus the Paleo diet versus some raw food diet, versus
some sort of food combining diet versus some sort of
like, low acid diet. All the different diets you see
on the bookshelves at stores? Well, those are all coming
from different paradigms to and you can see how paradigms
compete with each other. There's paradigms within the paranormal. There's
a cult paradigms. Shamanism is a paradigm witchcraft is a
paradigm Voodoo is a paradigm. post modernism is a paradigm,
relativism is a paradigm, realist art, versus impressionist art, versus
post impressionist art, versus abstract art, versus post modern art.
Those are all paradigms that evolved within the history of
art. And if you actually study the history of art,
it's very interesting because there's, there's dozens and dozens and
dozens of artistic paradigms. Very interesting. And this whole notion
of being avant garde, being on the leading edge of
the paradigms within art, that in of itself turns into
a paradigm. They're interesting. behaviorism is a paradigm spiral dynamics,
is a paradigm phonology, measuring people's skulls, and then correlating
that with their intelligence, that whole science which has now
been debunked, that was a paradigm. Homeopathy is a paradigm.
Thermodynamics is a paradigm, even within technologies. Within just practical
technology, we have paradigms, we have the PC, desktop and
mouse the graphical user interface, that's the whole paradigm. Someone
had to come up with that touchscreen mobile devices, that
was a paradigm really created by Apple. In fact, both
these paradigms were really pioneered by Apple to a large
degree. And then they were co opted by a lot
of other companies, and push forward. These were very successful
paradigms, which have, you know, had huge social ramifications have
had huge economic ramifications. And the last one I'll give
you is the paradigm of building your career by going
to school, getting educated, going to university, getting a four
year degree, and then going into marketplace, that whole mode
of educating our public. Our kids go through that whole
process, and then they become young adults, and they get
a job, that whole paradigm that's just a paradigm, that's
one way to do it. There's many other possible ways
that we can educate our children to become good and
qualified for their jobs. For example, in the old days,
we had guilds. In the medieval times, we had guilds,
we had apprentice programs, where you would go and you
would live a child who actually live with a master.
Like if you think about Michelangelo, he would go as
a child to live with a master for 1020 years
and learn to be a sculptor, rather than going to
some university. Maybe that was a more effective model. I'll
let you decide about that. But anyway, so these are
all different examples of paradigms. Now let's talk about paradigm
lock. Because this is where the application happens. So this
is just a word that I came up with. And
what it means is, when the mind gets stuck in
a cohesive and circular framework, this sort of bubble until
it's not able to break out, because it's committed to
only using that framework to do all its interpretation, data
collection. Do you see what I'm saying here? So here's
a really, the crux of the matter. Here's my paradigms
are so dangerous, is because once you get stuck into
a paradigm, you get nice and comfy with it. Now
all of a sudden, you're not open to exploring new
perspectives. You're not open to acknowledging that you're inside of
a paradigm. You're not open to the fact that you
are adopting one perspective out of potentially infinite number of
perspectives. You're not opening to questioning the self evident assumptions
that your paradigm makes. And you place the burden of
proof on others to convince you. Demanding that day. explain
everything to you through your paradigm and your paradigm only.
This is a common trap, for example, well, every paradigm
basically falls into this trap. But I especially see it
for example, with rational people, when you have a hyper
rational person, and you want to discuss something like spirituality
with them, and then you come to them to have
a discussion, what they will want you to do. And
they won't even realize that this is what they're asking
you to do is they'll ask you to take all
your spiritual insights, and to reformulate them. So they all
make perfect sense within the rationalist paradigm. They will ask
you for proofs. For logical arguments, they'll ask you for
no paradoxes, no contradictions, they'll want double blind studies and,
and this and this and that. And what that is
why that's dangerous is because to not get locked into
a paradigm, you need to be able to step outside
of your paradigm. But what someone in a paradigm does
is they don't realize that when I'm in this bubble,
for me to really appreciate the next bubble, what I
need to do is I need to step out of
this one, and fully immerse myself into that one. And
the danger that people make in this, what paradigm lock
is, is that they're in this bubble, and they say,
Okay, I'm in this bubble. Now, there's some stuff in
those other bubbles. But I don't recognize my own bubble
as the bubble. My bubble is reality. So those bubbles,
that's like some some stuff I could explore. But it
all has to be interpreted only in my model of
the world. Because my model, the world is not a
model the world its reality. And this is where you
get locked, right, you get locked, because now you're committed
to using those self evident assumptions that you made from
the very beginning that you weren't even conscious of. Now
you're committed to using them to interpret everything else. But
you know what those other bubbles what defines a bubble
is the collection of self evident assumptions and other premises
and attitudes that one has. So to fully appreciate all
the other bubbles, you have to be able to say,
Okay, I'm in a bubble to let me not kid
myself, I'm in a bubble too. And if I really
want to appreciate the other bubbles, I gotta step out
of my bubble, leave behind my frameworks, leave behind all
the old analytical tools that I had. And really dive
into this other bubble. And to see it from its
own position, rather than interpreting it into my old paradigm.
This is where the issue of incommensurability that Thomas Kuhn
talks about becomes significant. It really is the case that
you can't translate across every bubble. Or even if you
are able to, something is lost in the translation, which
is often what happens between rational and spiritually minded people,
is that the rational person will really insist that all
spirituality be boiled down into rational arguments. And even if
we attempt to do that you might get some value
out of that. But the essence of spirituality will be
missing. Because you refuse to take the burden on yourself
to step outside of your bubble, and really go and
explore this totally different domain. It's almost as if you're
sitting in a city, like, let's say, you live in
Los Angeles. And you heard me talking about New York
City. And you say, Yeah, you know, this New York
City sounds very interesting. I would like to experience it.
But please bring it here to Los Angeles, because I
am too lazy to get an on an airplane and
to fly to New York, that would be a huge
inconvenience for me. So Leo, please bring New York City
over to Los Angeles, and then I will enjoy it.
And you can see that that's an absurd position. Right,
you can see that that kind of person isn't really
serious about inquiry into the nature of reality. He doesn't
really want to explore the world. Yeah, he's willing to
entertain certain new experiences, but only on his terms. So
if I take a snapshot of the Statue of Liberty,
and I mail you a postcard of it to Los
Angeles, you can look at that picture and be like,
Oh, this is pretty cool. And you might think that
okay, I got it. I know what New York is
all about just because I looked at this postcard. Statue
of Liberty, or maybe I looked at a postcard of
some other, you know, like Central Park or something, you
might think you got it, but you haven't really got
it until you've gone there and seen it for yourself
because the Statue of Liberty looks very different in person
than it does on a postcard. You see, so you
have to be willing to travel a bit. And when
people are not willing to travel, that's when they're in
paradigm lock. And this is what we mean by closed
mindedness. These are closed minded people. And make no mistake,
that many scientists, many mathematicians, many philosophers, many of the
most intelligent people on Earth, and throughout history, have succumb
to this trap of paradigm lock. And they didn't even
realize it. As simple as it is, right? This isn't
rocket science. But it is tricky stuff. Some of the
simplest stuff can be some of the trickiest. The problem
is that when you do research only within your paradigm,
based on your assumptions, and the stuff you think is
self evident, then of course, it shouldn't be a surprise
that you open yourself up to the bias of confirmation
is called confirmation bias. Why is that? Well, because your
paradigm is a collection of assumptions and frameworks about how
reality is if reality ends up being different than what
you thought it was. And you are always interpreting everything
in a way to accord with your paradigm, then what's
going to happen is that you're going to leave anomalies
on the side, there's going to be all this anomalous
data that you're just going to ignore and say, No,
that's not relevant, that's not important. That's all just, you
know, noise, it's all noise. And you're only going to
confirm what you were looking for. And you're never going
to really take seriously the stuff that you weren't looking
for. This might work if reality was very orderly, and
intuitive. That might work. But as hopefully, you've already seen
through all the different episodes that I release, one of
the most common themes in every episode, almost I tell
you, this is counterintuitive. And that's counterintuitive. And this is
counter to look how counterintuitive all this stuff is. So
if we live in a counterintuitive reality, then adopting a
paradigm in a rigid fashion, that's going to cause problems.
That's big, a big, big potential blind spot. The tricky
paradigms is that they're so all encompassing and wide, that
they tend to block our imagination from imagining alternatives to
the paradigm. It seems like when you're inside a paradigm
that this is how things are, and that they couldn't
possibly be any other way. For example, you might say,
well, Leo, what alternative is there to rationality into Logic,
or what's the alternative paradigm to mathematics or to science,
all the other paradigms, they're just kind of hokey, and
they don't even compare and quality, right? Wrong. That's a
failure of your imagination, and a lack of your experience.
To get the experience though, you first need to have
the imagination. So when your imagination gets crippled by a
paradigm lock, this is a very dangerous thing. Because you
close yourself off from new experiences, radically new experiences, you
are under estimating the degree of radical newness and counter
intuitiveness possible with new experiences. That's because your paradigm is
salt all encompassing, that you can't see it. You're like
a fish in water. Without experiencing the alternatives, you get
stuck in your mind. You get trapped. And without experiencing
alternatives. Here's the real tragedy. You won't even have a
desire to experience alternatives. This is the problem that happens
when someone lives in a village his whole life. And
he's lived in his little little village for 50 years,
then you tell him, Hey, let's go travel to Hong
Kong or to London or to Australia. And the guy's
like, No, I'm staying in my village. This village is
the best thing that there is and you tell them
no. Well, how do you know the village of the
best thing there is? Because I love this village. I've
lived here for 50 years. Of course it's the best
thing there is. And then you tell him well, what
about Australia? Maybe it's better there and he's like Australia.
Don't be silly. Look at this village, this village I
have 50 years of experience with this village Australia. That's
nothing. So he doesn't even desire an alternative. The more
alternative, radical perspectives you experience in life, the more open
your mind becomes, it's the sort of exponential growth effect,
it snowballs. After a certain point, you reach a critical
point where you start to realize that it's all just
a collection of perspectives. And that clinging to any one
perspective is very small minded, very short sighted. The more
certain you feel about a paradigm, the more you set
yourself up for a mindfuck. Because the more certain you
are about your set of assumptions and how the world
is, and the world ends up being very radically different
than that, the more you cling to your little position,
then the bigger the opposite will happen. You see, you're
setting yourself for surprise, you're setting yourself up for pain.
And you're putting yourself into a position where you're going
to have to play the ostrich, you're going to have
to stick your head in the sand. Because otherwise, the
pain of admitting that you've been wrong, is going to
become harder and harder and harder as the years go
by. So you're gonna have to get very good at
denial, and mental gymnastics. And so now you can see
why so many people are so good at denial and
mental gymnastics, and why the world is generally in a
state of deep ignorance. And why spirituality can't penetrate into
mainstream culture. Exactly because of this problem. The funny thing
about paradigms is that you can construct semi self consistent
and self referential bubbles that make sense of the world
or some limited pocket of the world. And you can
construct millions of these. Right? This is how cults happen,
how religions happen, how mainstream cultures happen, how language has
happened, how universities happened, how governments happen, how corporations and
hospitals happen. All of these are like little bubbles. And
who take a cosmopolitan big picture perspective, you see, hey,
there's 1000s upon 1000s of bubbles that humankind has invented.
Could I be living in one of those bubbles? Or
am I outside the bubble? Or am I just kidding
myself that what I'm in is not a bubble. When
you really take seriously the possibility that you're inside a
bubble, just like most other people are. That's real, real
progress. That is the opening of your mind in a
permanent way. Very few people get there. A lot of
people like to think that they're there, or that they're
getting there. But they're not even close to getting there.
So when you have all these self consistent bubbles, the
problem is, is that they really feel complete. When you're
inside of it. It really feels like you're sad, you're
a little universe. You know, if you were living in
Amish country, and you were Amish, that little bubble of
Amish SNESs, you would feel like that's the whole universe
that would feel to you like the greatest thing ever.
And if you're a Scientologist in that bubble of Scientology,
you would also feel like that whole universe is like,
that's it. That's the truth. That's the ultimate thing. That's
the most meaningful thing in life. And same thing for
everything else, including science, including mathematics, including your government type,
including your economic preferences, whether you're a liberal or a
conservative or any of that kind of stuff. And the
problem is, when you've explored a lot of these bubbles,
you have to ask yourself, well, which bubble is right
which bubble is best? It's very easy to say that
your bubble is right and best when you've only been
in one or two bubbles. It's a lot harder when
you've been in 100. Bubbles, you start to really scratch
your head and wonder hmm, I don't know. I don't
know which of these bubbles is best. Is it possible
for me not to have any bubbles at all? And
then that when you reach that point, now you're really
getting into true spirituality? That's tricky. That's very tricky. Because
as soon as you think you're out of a bubble,
usually you're just right back into a new bubble. A
little bit bigger bubble, right? Because you could have bubbles
within bubbles within bubbles within bubbles. How do you break
all the bubbles? Is that possible? Well, if you want
to answer that question, you got to get really serious.
A lot more serious than you are right now about
epistemology, about metaphysics about non duality. That's a topic for
another time. What I want to just point out for
right now is that all bubbles have blind spots. And
the reason that is is because they make assumptions about
reality. And all assumptions you make about reality ends up
being wrong they end up being wrong and limiting in
some fashion. So here's a, here's the thing I want
to point out, this is really interesting. I was thinking
about this the other day. And you see the reasons,
it's interesting, because you see this all across culture, anything
that's outside of your paradigm or your cultures paradigm. It's
always dismissed. And it's dismissed in very classical predictable ways.
So here are all the ways I'm gonna list them
out to you. This is like a complete list of
every excuse making mechanism that a paradigm uses against other
paradigms, because he to maintain a little isolated bubble of
your reality or your view of the world, you have
to exclude all the other ones, right? Because it's like
this bubble is in a giant room with a bunch
of other bouncing bubbles, and all these bubbles will collide
and interpenetrate unless you have something that pushes on the
outsides, and maintains the rigidity of this bubble. And so
of course, every paradigm has methods. These are egoic methods
that are used to dismiss the validity of exiting the
paradigm and trying out other ones. So let's say I'm
occupying the paradigm of atheism, or the paradigm of rationality,
or the paradigm of materialistic science, or the paradigm of
Scientology. What I'm going to do, because I'm sneaky, my
mind is sneaky, is I'm gonna demonize in one form
or another, all the other possible paradigms that are in
competition with my own. Right. And here's how I will
do it. I will label I'll use labels to label
the other paradigms. So I'll say that paradigm there's impossible
or contradictory. It's logically impossible. It's contradictory. It's paradoxical. See,
once I attach those labels to a new paradigm, that
means I no longer have to take on the burden
of visiting that paradigm and exploring it. I no longer
have to take that one seriously, because obviously, it's contradictory.
And that was obviously impossible. So that's a waste of
my time. Here's another tactical use all say that one
over there is insane. That one That one's irrational. That
one that was diluted, that one is foolish. And that
one there is naive. Here's another set of labels I'll
use, I'll say that one there is criminal. That one
is treasonous. That one up there is heretical. That one
down there is dangerous and harmful to our children. And
that one over there. That one is antisocial. Another set
of labels all these I'll say that one is weird,
just downright weird. That one is comical. That one is
ridiculous. That one over there is a fantasy. It's fantastical.
That one over there's it's too abstract and philosophical. It's
not grounded. It's not a realist. Another set of labels
I'll use is that one over there is useless is
just totally useless. I wouldn't have any use for that
in my life. Even if it was true. That one
there is just unimportant. It's not important. That one there
is a waste of time. waste of my time. Why
should I travel to New York Leo, when that would
just be a waste of my time. Why? There's something
I could possibly learn from that. I already know, because
I'm already very familiar with Los Angeles. I'm so familiar
with Los Angeles that I know that I'll never find
anything of value in New York. So I just won't
even go there. Just a waste of my money wasting
my time. Why would I spend six hours flying across
the country all the way to go to New York?
Why? And here's the here's the most devilish of the
excuses. That paradigm over there, I'll call it demonic. That
one I'll call it site tannic. That one is a
cult. That one is evil. Now what is just downright
offensive, and that one over there is outrageous. I'm sure
your mind has come up with even more labels and
ways that you dismiss other paradigms. But this is a
pretty comprehensive list. Now what I want you to do
is I want you to think about what paradigms you
occupy, what are your favorite paradigms, whether it be scientific
ones, rational ones, theistic ones, religious ones, economic ones. And
I want you to notice how you and your friends,
all the people who occupy your little bubble, how you
like to demonize and dismiss in all these different ways.
All the other perspectives and what this practically accomplishes is
that when you make these judgments These are really prejudices,
right? This is the definition textbook definition of prejudice is
when you judge something without having actually experienced it. So
you judge Christianity without actually having been a Christian. You
judge Buddhism without actually having become a Buddhist, you judge
Scientology without having been a Scientologist. You see? Now, of
course, you're gonna come up with an excuse to say,
well, Leo, you know, why should I become a Scientologist?
That's a bunch of bullshit. You want me to waste
my whole life, exploring all these bullshit ideas and all
these bullshit paradigms? But if you don't, you're prejudiced. You
see. So one option there would be to reserve judgment
and say, Well, I don't know. I've never been a
Scientologist. So I truly can't judge Scientology. Because the only
way I could really judge Scientology would be to step
inside that bubble. Have I been in that bubble? No,
I have only heard stuff about Scientology, which seems kind
of negative the way it's portrayed a lot of times
from within my bubble, to be honest, right? I've never
become a Scientologist or Christian or Buddhist, for that matter.
But nevertheless, I judged them. But how do I judge
them, I judge them for my bubble, I don't actually
step into their bubble. What you'll find, though, and you
feel free to test me on this one, you don't
need to just believe me, go enter the bubble, of
any one of these paradigms that I'm talking about. And
you will see that it looks a lot more appetizing.
And a lot more reasonable. And a lot more sane
than you thought it was when you were judging it
from outside from your paradigm. Right. This applies to Islam,
Christianity, Buddhism, science, and all the other stuff that I
mentioning. So let me now give you an set of
examples of paradigm lock. Because that's what we're talking about
here. Christianity has a big component of paradigm lock. And
you'll notice that every paradigm has a mechanism that ensures
that it locks you into it. Usually, very rarely, is
there a paradigm that says, hey, go explore all the
diverse paradigms that exist. That's extremely rare. That is actually
antithetical to the point of being a paradigm, the point
of being a paradigm is to lock you in to
its scheme. And of course, to effectively lock you in,
it has to blindfold you, so you don't see anything
outside of it. So Christianity, you know, you argue with
a Christian, and you start to make rational arguments for
a Christian, the Christian will then say, Oh, well, but
then you know, the Bible contradicts that. And then you
say, Well, how do you know the Bible is correct?
Well, because the Bible is the Word of God. But
how do you know that's true? Well, because it's written
by God. But how do you know? Because God wrote
it, see, it becomes circular argument. And then you can't
really argue with these people. Because they take that as
a self evident assumption, that's part of the Christian paradigm
is that the Bible is indisputable. Right, that's taken on
faith. Now, you might say, well, Leo, I'm above that
I'm an atheist, or watch out, because here's the atheist
paradigm lock. Right? You should argue with the atheist. And
the atheist will presume that there is no God. And
they can't know this, of course, and they'll say that
they can't know this. But what they'll do is they'll
they'll use some sneaky maneuvers, which are just as sneaky
as the Christians tactics, will use mental gymnastics to bake
it basically tell you that the default position is that
there is no God, Celia, that's the default position. I
don't need to be like a Christian because a Christian
has to concoct gods, but atheist and atheism, it's just
nothing. It's just the default position. I'm not concocting anything,
when I'm an atheist. But actually, atheism is a belief.
And most atheists, of course, don't realize this and recognize
this because they're not conscious of it, that it's a
belief. It is a position. They like to tell themselves,
it's not a position, but it actually is. And that
creates a paradigm lock for them. And then, of course,
when you tell them some spiritual truth to talk to,
to them about post rationalism, for example, you talk about
the pre rational post rational fallacy that atheists commit with
spiritual truths, and they'll deny that they will be closed
off to it. Because part of the atheist paradigm is
constructed in opposition to theism. So it's a sort of
reactive thing, right? So they immediately have a sort of
sore spot, they get triggered by anything that even smacks
of the metaphysical, or of the, of the spiritual. And
of course, that closes them in in their little bubble,
and they're really not better off than the Christian is
at all. Many philosophies that you find in The philosophy
textbooks are like this. For example, de cartes philosophy of
dualism is paradigm locked. The cart is paradigm locked. logical
positivism is paradigm locked. empiricism is paradigm locked. Almost every
ism is paradigm locked by almost by definition, that's sort
of its point. That's his hidden point. Another paradigm lock
is naive realism. And I addressed that in a previous
episode. scientific materialism is a paradigm lock. The way that
science is done in academia these days is very paradigm
locked. naive realism is the idea that there is an
external world. Like you actually believe there's an external world,
which is not true at all. But that's part of
your paradigm, and you interpret everything through that paradigm. And
even when I tell you about it, you still can't
shake it, because it takes an enormous effort to shake
any one of these paradigms. Really, really serious amount of
effort. reductionism, as a theme in science is a paradigm
lock. skepticism, the way most people abuse skepticism these days,
that's a paradigm lock. The skeptic locks himself into his
skepticism. See, the skeptic is so opposed to absolutism, that
he becomes absolute, with his skepticism. It's really funny. All
these things are just comical when you really look at
it from a big picture perspective, with some awareness. All
this becomes a game, all these things that I'm talking
about are just a game. It's such a silly game,
and it's so easy to it's so easy to see
through the sham of it. Once you have become good
at recognizing paradigms, and paradigm lock, and then you free
yourself to jump between perspective and perspective without being loyal
to any one of them. Man, you're you. You can
run circles around all these guys, right? And all these
all these fields, all these paradigms generally have very intelligent
people in them. There's intelligent Christians, intelligent atheists, intelligence, duelist,
intelligent, naive, realist, intelligent, reductionist, intelligent skeptics, but their intelligence
is really crippled by their lack of awareness. So it
doesn't matter how intelligent you are. When you don't have
awareness of what I'm talking about here. Your intelligence becomes
a tool of evil, to serve your ignorance, your lack
of awareness. Because awareness is much, much more important than
any degree of intelligence, you have. Rationality and formal logic.
These create big paradigm locks. Just take a look at
all the academic logicians and mathematicians that you find in
universities, they're paradigm locked. They can't think outside of formal
logic and rationality. It's not possible to communicate with these
guys. I've tried. It's funny. It's just funny. It's kind
of sad, too, because they're so locked into it. thought
itself is a paradigm. And it really locks you in.
Because Have you noticed yet, that when you're thinking, you
lock yourself into this whole paradigm of thinking, everything needs
to be thought about? It's sort of like you're running
around with a hammer, and everything looks like a nail
to you that old adage. That's how thoughts work. That's
how academics and intellectuals and philosophers really trapped themselves, the
fly in the bottle. What is that? It's thought, thought
is the bottle. Because you're trying to think your way
out of thought. And you can only get so far,
because thought has serious limits. You can't get to truth
through thought. But that idea is lost on most people
who are deep thinkers, of course, because the reason they
became big thinkers because they were good at thinking and
thinking serve them. And so now they want to solve
everything through thinking, but they think they can't do anything
other than think. Of course, that's false. But because they're
in their paradigm, and they're using their framework to interpret
everything, then they will take any evidence or suggestion you
give them about anything outside of thought. And they'll convert
it into thought, because that's what a paradigm does is
it converts everything into its own language. And then they'll
just say, Lea, look, it's just thought, you're just sharing
your thoughts with me. Everything's a thought to someone who's
addicted to thoughts. Everything is a thought even stuff that's
not thought. That's the whole tragedy of it. That's what
locks you in languages. And the whole modality of using
language to describe reality, that's a huge paradigm lock. The
self as a mother of a paradigm lock right there,
yourself, the self, you as a human being are a
paradigm. You're not a physical being you're a paradigm that's
what you are your paradigm, at least what you think
you are right Now, that is a paradigm, and you're
locked into it. And you can't imagine anything outside of
you until you actually break out of you. And you
discover that there's something bigger than you, which is not
a paradigm. But that's a topic for another time. Reality.
That's a paradigm. And boy, does that one lock you
in. What I'm saying, literally, is that reality, what you
call reality, physical, the very fabric of reality itself, all
of it, the notion that there is a reality at
all, and that reality is real, is a paradigm lock,
and you are so fucking locked into it. That he
would take a sledgehammer to your head to knock you
out of it. Maybe not even that. How could that
be? How can reality be a paradigm? reality itself, the
notion of a reality that it exists, is a paradigm.
But see this, this doesn't compute in your mind, because
from within the paradigm of reality is real. This makes
absolutely no sense. And that's right, because you really have
to think outside the well, you have to more than
just think outside the box, you have to exit the
box to discover that reality isn't real. And that it's
a paradigm it was a paradigm the whole time. But
how could you know that? See, so one thing I
want you to do is I want you to start
to notice, notice all the people around you are locked
into paradigms. There's paradigm lock skeptics, and atheists and theists
and academics and scientists and capitalists and communists and economists
and politicians and shamans and occultists, and a whole list
but the list is endless. Most people are paradigm locked
in into many, many different paradigms. So start to notice
that although don't judge them too harshly, because remember that
you too, are paradigm locked. So the point of this
is not for me to give you weapons to go
and now make fun of all your friends. The point
is to notice that the deep ignorance around you and
within you, especially within you, the point of seeing the
ignorance around you is to only deepen the appreciation of
the ignorance within you. So how do we break out
of these paradigms? Well, it's very difficult. Breaking out is
very difficult, very difficult. Because the mind is tricky and
self deceptive. Because of homeostasis. Because you're literally addicted to
the paradigm, your entire identity is entangled with it. So
to break out of a paradigm requires that you actually
give up portions of yourself. You have to bleed your
own blood. In a sense. It's difficult because of pride.
The pride you have in your paradigm is difficult because
of fear, because of uncertainty because of confusion because of
the humility. Now not the humility, the humiliation, the humiliation
that you will experience by having to admit that your
paradigm has been wrong. See, that's scary. And then what
does that leave you open to a new paradigm going
to a new paradigm, it's like going to a new
country, you don't know what's there. You don't know if
someone's going to kill you rape, you murder you steal
from you what's going to happen to you, you don't
know. So of course, you want to stay comfortable in
the paradigm you already are familiar with. It's also difficult
because of the loneliness factor. See, when you try to
exit one of your paradigms, everything in your environment is
going to work to keep you where you're at all
the people in your life your family members, your schoolmates,
your co workers and your spouse so forth. They will
not support you in breaking out of your paradigm. In
fact, what they'll do is they'll pull you back in,
they'll still they'll use all those labels and tricks that
I told you about earlier. They'll say no, that thing
you're doing Leo, you're pursuing alignment now that's, that's, that's
evil, that's dangerous, that's harmful. That's anti social. That's insane.
That's whatever right? All these words will be used or
like you've talked about psychedelics with people, and what do
they do? They of course, they immediately try to reject
you and knock you down and pull you back in
their paradigm. So they're living in a non psychedelic paradigm.
When you try to open them up to the paradigm
of psychedelics. What do they do? They say, Oh, it's
just it's just drosha becoming a drug addict and this
and that, you've lost it. You've gone crazy. You've gone
down the deep end, you've lost it and Boo, right.
So all this happens. Isn't that interesting? And then of
course, that makes you feel lonely. It If you're actually
trying to break out, it's going to take you some
while to break out maybe months, maybe years to break
out of your paradigm, but then everyone in your life
is going to be pulling you back in, that makes
it extra hard. And then of course, there's going to
be disapproval, they're going to disapprove of you, they're going
to reject you, they're going to criticize you, they're going
to demonize you, they're gonna leave you, they're gonna threaten
you. And all of that will go straight to your
ego. And we'll go straight to the core of your
deep psychological needs, and you will feel so hurt that
you will fall right back into place. This is how
you get disciplined into staying in your paradigm, you have
to really want to break out to break out. And
it's going to come with emotional labor and pain, some
pain, some suffering, it's gonna come with it. And at
the ultimate level, the thing that stops you from breaking
out of your paradigms is death and insanity. If you
want to break out of the paradigm of self, and
reality, these are the two biggest paradigms that you're stuck
in. You're going to literally have to face your own
death and insanity. To do that. How many people want
to do that comfortable, easy thing to do? Not for
most people. Not ever, ever, ever, are they going to
be open to that? Never, never, never never. So see
now you're starting to see why growth is so challenging,
because how can you grow when you're stuck in this
bubble? Now let me give you a list of the
most important paradigms to break for personal development. This is
the sheet you got to break out of, to really
transform yourself. And what I will say is that if
you don't break out of these paradigms, you're not even
going to tap into 5% of your full potential in
life. You can forget about personal development, personal development, while
staying within these paradigms is just window dressing. You heard
not even touching the root of the issues. So here
they are naive realism, which includes the belief in the
external world, atoms, matter and space, all of this has
to go. It's a paradigm and it's false rationality and
logic, you have to throw that out the window, atheism
or theism, throw that one out the window, science, throw
it out the window, persistent objects as existing. So when
you close your eyes and you believe that the lamp
still exists, the tree still exists, whatever, you have to
throw that paradigm out. It's false. The self, you as
a separate self, a self that is separate from the
rest of reality. That's a huge paradigm you have throw
that up under the bus. The Life and Death itself
have to be transcended, and seen to be the paradigms
that they have always been. So we have to stop
believing in life and death. Language, the entire mechanism of
language has to be seen as a paradigm and done
away with thought, the entire mode of thinking about all
of life, and philosophizing about it, and making abstract conceptual
distinctions about it, that has to be put to an
end and stopped. The paradigm of Western psychology has to
be thrown under the bus because it's very limiting mainstream
culture, all the entertainment, all the stuff you love about
mainstream culture, whatever culture you're from, whether it's American culture,
Islamic culture, Hindu culture, or anything like that has to
be discarded. Consciousness is brain activity. This is a paradigm
you have you actually believe that your consciousness comes from
your from your brain. This has to be discarded. psychedelics
as chemicals, thinking of psychedelics as just chemical activity as
just hallucinations, this needs to be discarded. Fear thinking that
fear is something that's real. This needs to be discarded.
Thinking of problems as real. This is a paradox. You
actually believe that life has real problems in it. That's
a paradigm you have needs to be dropped. The good
and evil paradigm needs to be dropped. You actually believe
that there's good and evil in the world. This needs
to come to an end. It's a horribly limiting paradigm.
The time paradigm needs to be really seen through which
means that you have to stop believing in the future.
And you have to stop believing in the past. And
these have to be seen as conceptualizations for what they
really are. So the time paradigm has to fly out
the window. The success paradigm. Holding your entire life is
this process of achieving success, material success, buying a house
putting stuff together, building a great business how Being a
wife and kids and go through that whole success cycle
that needs to be stopped, you need to see that
as a paradigm of Western medicine, you need to see
that as the paradigm, the paradigm that emotions are happening
to you, and that you have no control over them.
That's a paradigm you have, which is false that needs
to be dropped. You In fact, create your emotions, suffering
and pain, as given things, that's a paradigm you have,
you actually believe that your pain and that your suffering
are real, that they are physical, and that they are
inescapable, and that they are a core facet of life.
That's a paradigm you have which needs to be dropped.
It's not true at all. But because you think is
true, it ends up being true for you. And it
limits us severely. And finally, the paradigm that reality is
real, the ultimate ultimate paradigm of paradigms, probably the most
difficult thing to drop, you need to stop believing that
this thing that you're occupying here, this reality that is
has any reality whatsoever, you need to recognize that that
is a paradigm. So to make the sort of breaks,
to break paradigm blog, what this requires is a discontinuous
jump. You have to jump from one bubble to the
next, it's like entering a new universe. And you have
to make sure that when you do jump from one
bubble to the next, you don't drag your old remnants
of the old bubble into your new bubble that's gonna
fuck you up. That's the mistake people make is that
they jump to the new bubble, but they drag all
other stuff, other assumptions they want to take with them,
they cling to it, that needs to stop. So what's
really critical for you the two key skills you need
to develop from this episode. These are your takeaways. Firstly,
is the ability to spot when you are stuck in
paradigm lock yourself. Of course, it's nice to recognize other
people too, but that's easy yourself. As most importantly, stats
ability to number one, develop that ability. ability. Number two
you need is to make discontinuous jumps. Because once you
recognize you're stuck, now you need to make a discontinuous
jump. Right? What are some examples of discontinuous jumps? Well,
here's a few. When you think and reason so much,
that you finally come to a point in your reasoning,
where you realize that reasoning, and thoughts will never lead
you to ultimate truth. When you hit that point, you're
ready to make the discontinuous jump into post rationalism. Another
one is, is that when you realize that reality is
non physical, that all all of this is a non
physical thing. There's not a single physical thing about reality,
when you realize that, that puts you in a totally
different paradigm. Now everything you interact with every human being
and every object you interact with, is no longer a
physical entity. That's a huge, radically new way to see
the whole world. Another discontinuous jump would be to realize
that your emotions are something that you are doing and
actively creating, rather than something that's just happening to you
like a helpless victim. So that when you start to
feel angry, or pissed off or jealous, or frustrated or
depressed, or any other emotion, we're happy, for that matter.
You're conscious in this new paradigm you're conscious that you're
creating that you're creating that you might not know how
yet but you at least you know that you're creating
it. That's a totally different paradigm than most the way
most people relate to emotions. Most people's paradigm of emotions
is that emotions happen to them, and that they need
to escape from these emotions or repress these emotions that
they're good and bad emotions. This This gotta exit that
paradigm as quickly as you can. That's a that's that
paradigm is called hell. That's the whole paradigm. Another paradigm
jump you can make is when you when you finally
recognize that paranormal phenomenon are real. So you will exit
the regular scientific paradigm that there are no paranormal phenomenon
into a new paradigm where there are paranormal phenomenon. And
they're not even called paranormal anymore. They're just normal paranormal
becomes the new normal. That's a jump you can make.
So how do you make these jumps? Well, that's, you
know, there's only so much we can talk about is
a really deep topic. So I have to just gloss
over some of this stuff. So yeah, let me give
you some tips for how to actually break out of
paradigms. So here are some different ways. Question assumptions very
deeply Get to the bottom of what your assumptions are
about anything in life. Meditation, great technique for breaking paradigms,
self inquiry and contemplation. Also very powerful techniques, psychedelics, the
reason I'm so excited about psychedelics, because they will absolutely
destroy all your cherished paradigms, very quickly, very effectively, very
rudely. That's why you don't like them. That's why you
don't like it, though, since the only reason is because
they are so goddamn effective at breaking all your paradigms.
That's why the government hates psychedelics, too, is because they
will fucking break the entire social matrix. Alright, so we
got to keep those away from the kids. reading and
research are important ways for how to break paradigms. Because
as you read and you research, you open yourself to
new perspectives. Traveling, going to different countries, interacting with different
cultures is a great way to break paradigms, especially a
lot of your cultural and social paradigms. Philosophy is a
good way to break paradigms, although you got to be
careful because philosophy as you do it, you can jostle
some paradigms, but also often you get stuck in bigger
paradigms. So that's dangerous. This is challenging stuff. Really breaking
down your paradigms takes a lot of work. It's not
easy to do. It's mostly laborious, but it does produce
some of the biggest leaps in your own growth that
are possible. This is going at the root of things.
Rather than just doing window dressing the way that most
self help, advice wants you to do, I have a
worksheet for you, that will help you to ground some
of the stuff I've been talking about here and relate
it to your specific life. So go, click down below,
download the free worksheet and fill it out, make sure
you do the worksheets. Those are very important. And I'm
done here. In future videos, I will help you to
tackle some of these very important specific paradigms that I
just glossed over here. I will help you to break
those down and show you all the hidden assumptions that
come in those paradigms with those paradigms, and all the
danger that these paradigms pose to you and how they
limit you. But for now, just stick with the worksheet.
And that's it. I'm done here. Post your comments down
below. Please remember to click the like button for me
if you liked this video, share it with a friend.
And lastly, come sign up to actualize that org right
here, it's my website, check it out. There's a newsletter
there. So you can stay tuned with future stuff that
I released. There's a forum, there's a life purpose course
there's a book list. So there's a good resources there,
too. Take you into this process deeper. It's not enough
just to watch one of my videos, or 10 or
100 of my videos, right? You got to be more
serious with this work. Because the reason I love this
work is because of the profundity and depth that there
is here. The tragedy of it, though, is that the
more deep and profound something is, the more abstract it
is, the more work it takes to get to it,
the more it can revolutionize your life, but also the
less likely you are to do the work to get
there to get the results. So one of my biggest
challenges is how to convince you to get on board
with this process, so that you go deeper and deeper
down the rabbit hole until you get to some really
profound stuff, the most profound stuff you can't just get
to by watching a few of my videos. But at
the very least, what you can do is you can
sign up and just stay tuned. Make a commitment to
this process of self actualization. self actualization is not just
a video you watch here or there, you know, when
you're bored at work or something. This is you recognizing
that this is the whole fucking point of life. This
is what life is about is you self actualizing that's
why you're alive at all. That's what you're here for.
But most people don't recognize that most people think of
life is just I don't know what they don't really
think about it at all. They think of it as
some sort of like, I'm gonna grow up and have
kids and then I'm gonna retire and die. That's where
I'm going to work and then retire and die. That's
their, that's sort of their their model of reality. The
whole point of your life is to self actualize. And
then ultimately, to self transcend. But you got to get
sorted somewhere. So I present content that's sometimes very deep.
For those of you who are down with that, but
then a lot of you aren't down with us, we
have to present some more shallower content to get you
interested. So that at some point, eventually, maybe a year
from now, two years from now you can get into
the really deep stuff. And then you will be so
glad that you did. But for that you need to
sort of make a commitment to this whole process. One
of the most important things that I did in my
entire life is that when I stumbled upon self help,
and I only stumbled upon self help when I was
like 25 years old. Hold wasn't that long ago, less
than 10 years ago. Until then, I didn't even know
self help existed as a field. But as soon as
I read my first or second self help book, I
realized that this shit is the thing that is really
important in life. This is what's really worth putting my
time and energy and money into. And so I did,
and I made a commitment that I'm, I'm not just
gonna dabble, I'm not just gonna read a couple of
self help books, I'm gonna fucking master the shit out
of this whole thing. And I'm still writing that decision.
That decision I made probably close to 10 years ago,
less eight years ago, I made that decision. And I've
been just working on that and chipping away on that.
And the results I've been getting in my life have
been phenomenal. And they just keep astounding, me more and
more and more every year, my growth is exponentially just
like snowballing. And it's gotten to the point where it's
just ridiculous. It's gotten to the point where I can't
even relate it to you in words anymore. I want
you to get there. But you're not going to get
there in just one or two years, that's going to
require a little more of a commitment. So you got
to hold that vision, that there's something bigger, something deeper,
something very profound there that you will find for yourself.
And it doesn't matter who you are, doesn't matter how
old you are, doesn't matter what kind of work you
do, or whatever. This these are the the core bedrock
principles of all of life. And this stuff, nobody taught
this stuff to you in school, or at work or
in your family, you didn't learn this stuff. Your preacher
didn't tell you this stuff. Why not? Because all of
this is threatening to the very paradigms that those people
were a part of, and that you were a part
of right? Their mission was to maintain those paradigms. And
your mission as someone who's self actualizing is to break
the mold of all the paradigms and to discover reality
as an absolute. And that is something that is not
a pipe dream, that's actually possible. I've had glimpses of
it and let me tell you that it's extraordinary. So
stick with me on this journey. Watch me grow and
grow along with me. And I'll see you soon with
more.
