[Music] you all right welcome to spiral dynamics stage yellow
if you hadn't seen the other parts of this multi-part
series make sure you go back and you watch spiral
dynamic stage blue orange and green so that you have
some context for some of the deep stuff we're gonna
be talking about today I'm excited about this one because
stage yellow is one that I'm really passionate about if
you resonate with actualize that oral content and you like
the stuff that I talked about chances are it's because
you resonate with yellow there's something special about yellow something
magical yellow is rare it's rare to find yellow thinkers
in our society it's very rare to find them in
the media on TV etc yellow tends to be very
deep stage so the way that spiral dynamics works is
of course let me just remind you the stages first
we have beige purple red blue then orange then green
and finally yellow now yellow is special because yellow is
now called tier 2 there are two tiers the first
tier is all the stuff underneath yellow all the stuff
we've talked about up to now and that sort of
conventional thinking that's how 99% of all of mankind thinks
so most of mankind doesn't know that there is such
a thing as tier 2 so what is tier 2
tier 2 Claire Graves described as a quantum leap in
one's awareness of reality it's an awakening to systems thinking
and holism seeing how everything within reality is deeply interconnected
in ways that Tier one couldn't even imagine tier two
is opening up to awareness of the spiral itself now
you don't have to know spiral dynamics to be in
tier two but it sure helps and tier two thinkers
look back upon human development they start to see these
these natural levels emerging which is what spiral dynamics talks
about tier two is a shift from survival into being
have you know that most of mankind is not really
interested in being they are interested in survival and of
course this notion of survival means a lot more than
just keeping your ass alive it means all the stuff
that normally people do which is have families and have
children and go earn money and buy house buy a
car and hang out with their friends and all the
entertainment all of that comes under the label of survival
that's what that is that's not being being is something
else which we'll talk about there's a shift in tier
2 from needy perception into being perception I have an
older video that talks about this difference between these two
different modes of perceiving being perception is looking at a
thing for what it is whereas needy perception is when
you look at a thing as to how it can
serve you so literally your entire perceptual system is corrupted
and distorted by your self survival agenda so if you're
afraid of having violence done to you getting abused being
manipulated being exploited being cheated being left broke and unable
to pay your bills you know these are survival level
fears and anxieties and concerns if you get angry about
this sort of stuff and you have trouble just basically
managing your survival within life then that colors how you're
able to perceive the world and basically you're not able
to perceive the world as it is you perceive the
world as it relates to you so what you need
is how you perceive the world and it turns out
the stuff that you don't need you don't even see
you don't even realize it's there you overlook it that's
how your ego distorts your entire perceptual system so with
tier two you're moving beyond that and finally you can
look at the world in what we might say is
an objective manner tier 2 derives its values from the
magnificence of existence itself rather than from selfish interests or
group interests with tier two there's a much wider and
deeper perspective of life you are no longer just concerned
about your own petty little problems or how to be
successful in life but you're concerned about the problems of
mankind and even beyond mankind you're concerned with the problems
of existence ideas become multi-dimensional interior - there's a lot
of layer and complexity to things there is now an
awareness of one's own perspective so you see that you're
looking at the world from a perspective just like everybody
else and that every perspective is partial including your own
so you no longer give yourself special excuses and justifications
that everyone in tier one was giving see the problem
with Tier one fundamentally is that everyone is looking at
the world from their perspective and they think that that
is the truth and daddys reality so whether you're blue
or orange or green that's basically how you look at
the world and then you believe that people who aren't
looking at the world from that same perspective as you
that there's somehow deluded or wrong or crazy or insane
or criminal or whatever other label you give to them
in Tier two you realize now that's an illusion we
all have a perspective to be alive is to have
a perspective and there's really no stepping out of one's
perspective there's no such thing as objectivity per se the
way that Tier two develops objectivity is by realizing that
there really isn't such a thing as objectivity that religion
you thought was the absolute truth is no longer the
app so there's just one perspective and that scientific model
you thought was the absolute truth that's also no longer
the absolute truth in tier two there's a lot more
relativity and subjectivity and perceptions and perspectives become the entire
name of the game in tier two there's a following
a way of judgment criticism blaming and scapegoating which is
very common in tier 1 fundamentally that's the biggest problem
with tier 1 because everyone has their own perspective but
they don't realize it it's just a perspective they end
up judging and criticizing and blaming and scapegoating everybody else
and then you have this giant food fight between all
the different tier 1 colors fighting over each other trying
to gain dominance and tier 2 is going meta and
seeing that whole dynamic and noticing like oh I don't
have to play that game I can rise above that
at tier 2 demonization becomes untenable nobody looks like a
demon to you anymore evil ceases to exist and it's
recognized just to be a a selfish illusion tier 2
is non moralistic in tier 2 fear is replaced by
curiosity and care and tier 2 is really what Abraham
Maslow talked about as the self actualizing individual I have
a fairly old episode called self-actualization where I give you
a long laundry list of characteristics that I took notes
on from from Abraham Maslow's work and it's a really
powerful list and what I'm describing there and what Maslow
is describing is the self actualizing individual and what is
that well you can go and look at that video
and it'll tell you all about that you can also
read Maslow's work and and study that in depth but
if that concept of self-actualization and all those qualities of
a self actualizing individual if that resonates with you and
it probably does because that's what actualize that org is
about then that's tier two see there's something different there's
something a little bit more elevated more transcendent about the
self actualizing individual he's not like your typical guy who's
just worried about work and sex and money and these
sorts of things so that's what we're talking about so
now we're gonna get into the the juicy stuff of
explaining yellow now what I described just now that wasn't
yellow I was describing tier two so tier two includes
yellow and it also includes turquoise which we'll be covering
next that was a general description of the difference between
Tier one tier two so again I want to give
credits to Clara graves dawn Beck and Christopher Cohen for
developing the bulk of this model and many of the
examples and information I'm providing to you in these episodes
come directly from them so what is the essence of
yellow then yellow we could call systemic integrative and multi
perspectival yellow takes many perspectives upon reality that's one of
its most defining characteristics and I was thinking about this
in preparing for this talk and the image that came
to mind for explaining this is well several images one
is it's the difference between looking at the world through
a spyglass the way that a pirate looks through the
world or through a telescope that's looking at the world
through one perspective one lens that's Tier one yellow is
now looking at the world through the eye of an
insect one of those compound eyes or through a camera
that uses multiple lenses there's a camera that came out
recently a few years ago that has like 15 lenses
in the camera and each of these lenses is a
different lenses positioned in a different place and it's a
different size and it's a different aperture in different different
settings and all of them you take this camera is
a digital camera of course so it's going to interpolate
using some kind of digital process can interpolate all the
different 15 or so lenses that are there and it's
going to produce one really high-resolution image to me that's
the perfect metaphor for what yellow is doing that's what
multi-perspective evil means and also you might be familiar with
this phenomenon with telescopes there are radio telescope arrays which
use multiple dishes and combine the the data for multiple
dishes to create one image and that actually gives you
a large it's as though you had a lens that
was much larger than the sum of all the individual
parts so that's what yellow is really about and you
can tell when an individual is coming at the world
from that kind of multi perspectival approach that's a different
type of thinker than you normally see yellow once again
shifts its pendulum from the green which was collective back
to individualistic so every stage alternates orange was individualistic blue
was collective green is collective and now we're swinging back
from green into individualistic but it's a different kind of
individualistic whereas orange was all about personal success damn the
costs damn the collateral damage is too damn the environmental
damage yellow is about expressing the self but not at
the cost of others there is now a sensitivity and
awareness to excessive self-interest and yellow strives to to limit
that and yellow is now aware of its own footprint
aware of its carbon footprint aware of its footprint within
relationships yellow is is careful not to hurt people's emotions
too much that it learned from green but also Green
was a little bit too much of a bleeding-heart so
yellow softens that and tempers it and brings it back
down to a sort of a nice balance between orange
and green because orange was too excessively selfish and green
was perhaps too excessive excessively self-sacrificing so yellow finds a
nice balance between those two yellow is about understanding the
magnificence of existence so yellow is all about exploring reality
using your mind every perspective is partially true to yellow
there's a kernel of truth to be found in what
everybody thinks even if they think something crazy and in
more and wrong you can still find a kernel of
truth there this of course makes yellow extremely open-minded yellow
is able to consider all sorts of radical perspectives that
normally stage blue or orange or green would just shut
down and dismiss yellow is about designing integrated and open
systems yellow is seeing life as a kaleidoscope of natural
hierarchies systems and flows yellow people are the information elites
and they are caring yet at the same time realistic
not overly emotional like green so that's the essence of
yellow when does yellow emerge yellow emerges from the limitations
of green green becomes very communal istic and green goes
into the excesses of mob mentality into the excesses of
emotionality and so yellow brings that back yellow comes when
green develops an increased discernment so not all perspectives are
equal some are better than others and there's a recognition
now after you've done the whole green thing of breaking
down hierarchies now you start to realize wait a minute
maybe there are such things as natural hierarchies sure they're
artificial ones that man has constructed which are problematic and
need to be broken down and maybe they're inefficient or
they're oppressive but then there's also natural hierarchies what about
those and then that moves you from green to yellow
green ultimately becomes frustrated with fruitless activism there's a frustration
with criticizing and protesting and joining movements and sitting down
and talking and sharing our feelings yeah you can do
that all day long you can do that but what
does it get you does it actually solves the problems
of mankind you might find that it doesn't and then
that starts to get you to thinking like well what
about the actual solutions let's actually come up with the
actual solutions rather than just talking about it and sharing
our feelings and that moves into yellow at the tail
end of green you start to see the wreckage of
the entire spiral it starts to become apparent to you
that every stage is fighting with itself and with other
stages above it or below it and so tier 1
is basically contributing to the indane well it's basically endangering
and jeopardizing all of mankind and so as you see
this you realize that you're not going to solve mankind's
problems at Tier one you need to move to tier
two you need to figure out how to get all
of these different perspectives to work together in a healthy
manner which then becomes the obsession of yellow ideas become
more interesting to yellow than community which is what green
was interested in yellow becomes really interested in how the
other side thinks rather than just criticizing and judging and
yellow now has an awareness of its own perspective so
you could say that yellow emerges when Green becomes self-aware
of itself as a perspective and green realizes oh yeah
I'm just one out of many perspectives and no perspective
is complete and even though Green was about exploring different
perspectives to a certain degree Green was multicultural and green
value diversity and Green was a bit relativistic still yes
Green was doing that but it was still doing it
from its own perspective and if someone wasn't agreeing with
green then Green would get pissy about and get triggered
about it and try to exclude that one yellow now
starts to see oh my own perspective is not special
Green held the position that greens perspective was somehow special
and superior to all the other perspectives let me give
you now a list of yellow values you're going to
resonate with all these if you are in yellow values
nuance and complexity open-mindedness perspectives of course novel concepts and
points of view yellow values generating fresh insights understanding systems
thinking nonlinear dynamics sustainability and long time horizons yellow values
going meta yellow values big picture understanding versus technical analysis
so orange tends to be very technical with its science
whereas yellow still relies on science but now it's a
more holistic approach and it's not so much about analysis
but it's also about synthesis bringing things together you're not
just dissecting everything you're bringing things together you're connecting the
dots which yellow loves to do yellow is an expert
a master at connecting the dots between things that normally
people would think were not related yellow values penetrating to
the core of an issue identifying and solving root problems
one of the problems with the lower stages like orange
and green is that they they didn't get to the
root of the problems yes Green has a problem with
excessive capitalism and yes orange has a problem with with
whatever and usually though though their solutions are short-term and
they're surface level which is why these problems keep recurring
and nothing really gets solved but yellow now cares about
getting to the root yellow doesn't want surface level solutions
yellow values taking a multidisciplinary approach which often means mixing
perspectives from the hard sciences with the soft sciences the
physical science with the social sciences there's not some clear-cut
line between those two and for yellow a lot of
the most interesting research is happening at those intersections between
the hard and the soft sciences in between different disciplines
yellow values creativity and outside of the box solutions now
orange would use the word thinking outside the box but
still orange mostly thought inside the box because oranges box
was usually like the corporate box so in a corporate
boardroom you'll hear them talking about let's think of it
outside the box guys but still they're thinking inside of
the corporate box yellow now is truly able to think
outside the box and find it unique and creative solutions
to two problems yellow values ecology responsible ways of being
studying models and modeling things yellow values spiral dynamics because
of course ball dynamics is a model one out of
many yellow values natural hierarchies yellow values education knowledge research
and reading and when it comes to reading and knowledge
yellow values diversity so like really diverse perspectives looking at
how a problem might might be solved by some indigenous
culture in Australia or in Africa or whatever you know
that perspective and then combining that with some hard-nosed scientific
perspective from quantum mechanics or from from chemistry or from
some insight from mathematics so it's merging all these things
together yellow values clean content and concentrated information yellow is
like an information absorber any piece of knowledge any nugget
of wisdom yellow just absorbs it puts it into his
giant database into his commonplace book yellow values lifelong learning
and yellow is proactive about learning so yellow will teach
himself yellow is not gonna sit around and wait for
somebody to explain something to him and he's not just
gonna be learning in university when he's inside of a
classroom yellow is learning all the time it's a dedication
to lifelong learning because there's so much to learn yellow
knows that if he spends the rest of his life
learning every single day he's not going to even 1%
of all there is to learn about reality that's how
complex reality is yellow values expertise competence and experience yellow
values complexity yellow values context and learning from history yellow
values developing skills to become an instrument for the greater
whole yellow values independent thinking neutrality being objective and impartial
designing solutions for the entire spiral rather than just for
one's own color the way that Tier one does yellow
values meeting people where they're at building bridges social engineering
ecological designs reducing the suffering of living systems pulling ideas
from many different sources combining different ideas models and theories
yellow is left brained where Green was sort of a
shift to the right brain yellow is now a shift
back to the left brain yellow values vision purpose and
being a visionary oftentimes yellow people are great visionaries they
can they can see all sorts of things far into
the future yellow values requisite variety and mental flexibility yellow
values self-actualization paradox uncertainty responsibility independence and autonomy and being
a lone wolf because yellow is moving away from the
sort of group hive mind that was characteristic of green
now let me warn you that it's easy to confuse
yellow with orange so let's help you to distinguish between
why yellow is different from orange these are actually two
radically different stages of or - two different attitudes really
of understanding life first of all yellow is beyond concerns
for self survival like we talked about whereas orange is
wrapped up in them orange is often driven by personal
success the need for money and achievement and recognition and
earning prizes and awards yellow doesn't care about these things
anymore yellow is beyond that sometimes I hear people say
Oh leo you criticize Trump for being an orange and
even red type of person but what if he's really
stage yellow because after all Trump is great at manipulating
systems and you Leo you say yellow is all about
systems thinking so what if Trump is actually yellow but
he's pretending to be orange and he's pretending to be
green to manipulate the system that's yellow right no that's
not yellow that's that's orange and red make sure that
you don't confuse manipulation of systems with systems thinking these
are two totally different things red and orange is brilliant
at manipulating systems to manipulate a system you don't need
to understand how the system really works all you care
about is selfishly exploiting it for your own purposes and
agenda to put yourself at the center or at the
top of the system that's what orange and and red
is about that's not what yellow is about systems thinking
is not about how to manipulate the system to your
advantage Systems thinking is about understanding the system seeing life
in reality as a set of complex system interacting with
each other and it's about caring about the health of
the entire system it has nothing to do with you
it's not about how you're related to the system it's
just about maintaining the system you see like if you're
a park ranger or you're some ecologist that's looking at
some eco system you care about preserving the eco system
you don't care about exploiting the eco system for your
own you know benefits to line your own pockets so
this is very different Trump is the opposite of yellow
he's an anti systems thinker he doesn't think in terms
of systems he's impulsive and he doesn't study anything the
way that a yellow systems thinker would if you really
want to understand systems thinking then I recommend you check
out my video intro to systems thinking which is a
long and juicy video that talks about all the intricacies
of that and also check out my book list I
have an entire category my book list called systems-thinking with
several books that just talk about systems thinking it's good
to read those because then you'll understand what a yellow
person thinks like yellows attitude is non manipulative that's the
key distinction between yellow and orange yellow cares about ecology
and yellow cares about collateral damage unlike orange yellow has
a long time horizon and orange has a short time
horizon if an orange Wall Street broker or an orange
CEO can manipulate next quarters profits to be as high
as possible even though that's gonna cost the company down
the road ten years down the road it's gonna destroy
the company's infrastructures but hey if it gets me higher
profits this quarter that's all that I care about because
I'm only gonna be CEO of this company for the
next three years and if I can just get a
consecutive twelve quarters of constantly rising profits I'm gonna earn
a hundred million dollars in stock options and everyone's gonna
love me the the boardroom is gonna love me and
and then I'm gonna be out and then what happens
in ten years with the company who cares it's not
my problem that's how orange things yellow doesn't think like
that yellow is also non-judgmental and neutral in a way
that orange isn't yellow is aware of the entire spiral
in a way that orange isn't and yellow is aware
of itself orange is not aware of itself yellow designs
creates designs that accommodate for the entire spiral whereas orange
schemes and manipulates to put himself at the top of
the spiral at the top of a hierarchy to gain
maximum benefit and profit for himself even if it hurts
the spiral orange is not gonna care whereas yellow will
care and yellow will try to avoid actions that will
hurt the entire spiral so there you go now let
me give you some more in-depth characteristics of yellow yellow
is non-ideological yet highly principled yellow acts from an inter
directed core yellow has a strong ethical core but this
ethical core doesn't derive from some religion or some some
set of Commandments or some book but just his his
own inner wisdom and his own understanding of life that
he has developed by assembling a big picture from many
different perspectives yellow feels that understanding other worldviews is critical
to navigating life there's some kernel of truth in every
worldview for yellow and so sometimes yellow will study some
obscure or arcane or otherwise distasteful worldview that normally a
tier one individual wouldn't care about because he's gonna pick
out that one diamond that's there and added to his
repository of understanding for yellow few ideas are sacred all
ideas are subject to revision and upgrade so yellow is
about being inside of an evolving universe and being a
reflection of that so if the universe in the world
around you is evolving if society is evolving if culture
is evolving then our mind needs to be evolving all
the time to reflect that and so yellow becomes highly
flexible whereas the lower stages are more rigid for yellow
the world has come is a complex self-organizing natural system
that requires integral solutions yellow sees the complexity of life
yellow appreciates just how complex social issues are political issues
like poverty and health care and the economy all of
these are very complex nuanced issues there are no simple
black-and-white answers to solve these which is why you require
making lots of fine nuanced distinctions in yellows opinion and
you require lots of knowledge because you need to do
lots of research on every single topic which you wish
to to somehow redesign so that it works better yellow
introduces lots of ideas and connections and complexity so if
you bring a yellow person into your team in your
business or in your company or whatever they're gonna bring
in all sorts of these complicated ideas they're gonna complicate
your situation yellow has an overarching view of system of
living systems yellow takes effective action to support the whole
yellow integrates science religion and personal development yellow doesn't really
care what others think about him what others think about
you is not critical it's only interesting - yellow -
yellow nothing is evil or purely negative there's a higher
wisdom - even the bad stuff in life the yellow
will look out for - yellow every system has value
but that doesn't mean that every system is equal or
every perspective is equal in the sort of sense of
false equivalency which was a problem for green certain perspectives
are just downright wrong and and very unhealthy and yellow
will recognize that but even so there might be some
little kernel of truth there that he'll still pluck out
lessons to be learned you know from mankind's greatest atrocities
there are lessons to be learned for yellow everything is
constantly evolving and changing and yellow has given up clinging
to tradition or the old status quo ways that we
use to do things yellow believes in being adaptable adapting
to your environment that's how you survive otherwise you destroy
yourself or you go extinct yellow seas deep common threads
everywhere yellow is able to hold two contradictory perspectives at
the same time which most of the other stages are
not able to do that just doesn't compute for them
for yellow it's not a problem yellow has a greater
degree of behavioral freedom than other stages yellow is very
adaptable yellow believes in flexibly flowing with change in condition
conditions yellow sees a need to develop natural living environments
to support human evolution yellow has an overarching vision about
a system and then determines what the system needs to
grow into blossom so if you think of systems as
plants then yellow is the gardener and a system what
is a system a system could be something like an
education system a university or some eco system like a
natural park National Park or it could be some political
party could be the government it could be a religious
organization you know there's all sorts of these systems basically
every every social institution as a system and many natural
biological things our systems as well yellow moves freely between
different value systems yellow can kind of jump in and
out yellow believes in acupuncture interventions which means taking a
small action to make a big impact yellow is all
about finding those high leverage points yellow is aware of
self bias and self-deception in a way that the lower
stages were not yellow looks beyond merely human oriented interests
there are larger concerns there global concerns universal concerns yellow
has a large vision about the future for Humanity and
yellow can have a lot of revolution and visionary ideas
to actualize those ideas yellow tends to have an enormous
drive and focus yellow recognizes the importance of consciousness and
spirituality although yellow is not yet fully immersed in true
spirituality yellow is still operating on the level of mind
and intellect and analysis so true spirituality will begin to
flourish at the tail end of yellow and into turquoise
yellow sees the limitations of reductionism pragmatism behaviorism logical positivism
rationalism materialism and libertarianism all of these sorts of isms
these these rational scientific isms which orange was really hot
on because orange was was developing these as an antidote
to blue to blue fundamentalist religion yellow sees that these
isms of science and a secularist of secularism that these
isms are also limited and they're also not completely true
yellow is able to be curious without judging and keeps
asking questions for yellow there's a constant flow of new
ideas and ways of thinking yellow understands how everything is
connected and works together yellow is good at distinguishing between
the essential and the ancillary and yellow is always keeping
an eye on the big picture because that's what matters
not the technical minutiae yellow loves learning and is a
quick learner yellow is able to get in there study
research a thing and then learn how it works yellow
is open to learning from any source yellow has an
attitude of open questioning and discovery for yellow every experience
is a learning opportunity yellow has strongly humanistic and inclusive
values yellow enjoys paradox and uncertainty and is adept at
resolving paradoxes yellow is really good at that yellow can
enter the point of view of all the lower spar
stages and yellow sees all the lower stages as legitimate
they have a right to exist they serve some kind
of function so of course they don't need to be
demonized yellow is able to facilitate the movement of people
up and down the spiral yellow is able to dialogue
with every stage of the spiral below it and yellow
is here to help build systems for Tier one to
evolve upward at its own pace one of the biggest
differences between green and yellow is that Green try to
get everyone below it to jump up to green so
green might go to Africa or to the Middle East
to cultures where the majority of the people there are
still at stage purple or red or early blue and
green tries to convert those people to becoming green hippies
and that's just not going to work for them because
they still need to go through a full blue cycle
through a full orange cycle before they can get to
green yellow is now aware of this problem and so
yellow is not going to try to get everybody up
to yellow immediately but to go through the right process
to get there at their own pace yellow sees each
system as the next step but not the best or
the final yellow is nonreactive yellow is able to listen
deeply yellow recognizes layered dynamics yellow is able to entertain
an idea without believing in it yellow has a knack
for gathering information from diverse sources yellow is continuously changing
it's a conceptual world that it lives in yellow prefers
elegant simplicity and functionality versus opulence and displays of power
or status red and orange and blue to some extent
they like these sort of displays ritualistic displays of power
of hierarchy yellow is beyond all this yellow has no
need for status or exhibitionism yellow is not concerned with
comparisons rather than comparing itself to others yellow compares itself
to itself which is unlike orange because orange was all
about besting the competition being better than everybody else the
gym that sort of mentality being strongest the buffest the
richest the sexiest whatever yellow cannot be coerced bribed or
intimidated now of course this is a generalization here this
doesn't mean that all yellow people are completely immune to
coercion or bribery or intimidation but generally speaking yellow is
beyond that because to intimidate or to bribe somebody that
person has to be at a level of self survival
right because that's where you have fears and that's where
you have personal needs whereas when you transcend out into
the being level then you transcend the ability to be
intimidated and coerced yellow doesn't get involved with criticism or
controlling behavior yellow doesn't desire to control or to be
controlled yellow doesn't create enemies and doesn't scapegoat yellow is
immune to radicalization you can't brainwash yellow because yellow thinks
from so many different perspectives that you can't trap him
into a into one paradigm or into one way of
thinking you can't trap them into a cult yellow is
drawn to hot spots where the evolving crisis demands new
insights so what is that area maybe within politics maybe
within some discipline of science maybe within some environmental movement
there's a hot spot or something new is happening there's
a crisis going on people are bickering back and forth
they're not able to resolve the problem because they're there
looking at it from the wrong perspectives that's where yellow
can come in he can see that and figure that
out yellow has a meta understanding of human nature and
conflict yellow is aware of backfiring mechanisms that's a lot
of what systems thinking is about is looking forward at
how a system is going to move such that the
system is gonna cycle back in and feed into itself
systems are all about various kinds of feedback loops so
this is very important for example for Public Policy and
for for running a good government because a lot of
times you create some sort of law or you you
make some sort of change in public policy but then
that ends up actually worsening the problem in ways that
weren't expected so yellow is good at anticipating those mechanisms
yellow has a non candidate uncanny skill at resolving complex
issues yellow has a sense of awe and playful delight
with the new and the novel I can relate to
that one for yellow Authority is contextual which means that
the leader is gonna be the best equipped and the
most capable so if you get a small group of
let's say ten yellow people all together who's gonna turn
out to be the leader well they're all gonna talk
amongst each other and they're gonna decide okay what's the
problem we're working on let's say these ten people are
working on mmm green energy okay green energy which one
of us has the most knowledge who has a PhD
in green energy here who's read the most books on
green energy oh you did okay so now you're gonna
be in charge that's how yellow determines the leader whereas
at the other stages it's not about that like for
orange for example or for or for blue the leader
is gonna be the one who is in next in
line in the hierarchy in the chain or what that's
for blue for orange the leader is gonna be the
one who is the most ambitious and probably the most
ruthless and the most manipulative so every stage is a
different leadership structure hello favors minimal consumption yellow enjoys human
appetites but doesn't become a slave to them yellow can
be gentle or ruthless conformist or non conformist it's hard
to pin yellow down because yellow is kind of slippery
and a bit of a chameleon yellow is good at
finding win-win-win solutions what is a win-win-win solutions a triple
win solution what's the triple win so the first two
wins is like if we're dealing together let's say we're
doing a an oil deal the oil company the government
or doing some kind of oil deal with environmental regulations
or something like that right so of course one party
could win the other party could lose or both parties
could find a solution that's winning for both parties that's
good but at that's usually what orange looks for if
it can but then there's the third level which is
finding the third win the third win is that the
entire spiral wins it's looking out for the entire spiral
so can we find a solution that's good for you
and for me and for the entire ecological system as
a whole see that's an extra dimension of thinking 3d
thinking rather than 2d thinking yellow doesn't join wholeheartedly and
group experiences does not join so yellow tends to be
a bit of a lone wolf yellow prefers to keep
a low profile and to stay on the edges of
an organization yellow doesn't usually like a lot of attention
yellow tends to work in the background yellow will not
sacrifice himself for the commune the way that green would
and yellow has a softened masculinity in orange masculinity was
all about being alpha and being macho and demonstrating your
macho nests with various kinds of gross material displays so
you would display your your muscles or how much you
could benchpress at the gym or how expensive your sports
car or how hot your girlfriend was that was sort
of what masculinity was about at orange but once you
pass through green green softens you up makes you more
compassionate more empathetic puts your you as a man if
you're a man puts you in touch with your feminine
side a bit more so your masculinity becomes more integrated
and at yellow you can be masculine still have a
feminine side and that only heightens your masculinity women of
course love this because women actually don't like jerks who
are just flaunting their masculinity around that only they only
like that in the short term they don't like that
long term and so really this is the best of
both worlds orange you might say is a sort of
juvenile immature masculinity whereas yellow is a is a is
a more mature softened masculinity and that that's just the
right balance they you should be looking for as a
man so let's go into some examples of yellow people
and various domains and things that are yellow so first
what I have for you is Abraham Maslow he's a
really good example of a stage yellow thinker another great
example that I love is Epping pagan heaven pagan he's
not a very well-known self-help guru and person of almond
guru and sort of business marketing guru but he has
some amazing courses and he has he does some amazing
workshops I don't know if he still does them but
he used to and he's just like the perfect perfect
example of what a stage yellow person is like he's
very neutral he's very balanced and fair he's able to
to think at the wart and look at the world
from multiple perspectives from a scientific perspective from the business
perspective from the emotional artistic perspective kind of blended all
together and is just perfect mix Noam Chomsky I mentioned
him in the green episode about how he's an example
of green and he is because he has a lot
of liberal progressive sort of ideas but also he's beyond
green because also what I noticed in Noam Chomsky which
I find so remarkable and and beautiful is that he's
able to be very neutral now of course if you're
a right-wing or you're conservative you say to yourself Leo
what are you smoking how can noam chomsky be neutral
when he's so progressive and he has all these radical
socialist ideas well you have to understand what neutrality really
is neutrality doesn't mean that you take the middle ground
between all perspectives so if you have one person in
a debate arguing against slavery and one person arguing for
slavery neutrality doesn't mean that you just say oh okay
yeah we'll just we'll just go with something in the
middle that's not true neutrality true neutrality is about being
very careful to step outside of your own self biases
your own egoic agenda and looking at the situation and
deciding what the real facts are based on a sort
of a unbiased look and sometimes what that means that
you'll side with one side doesn't mean that you'll go
down the middle on every issue so what Noam Chomsky
is good at he's looking he's good at looking for
example at American foreign policy and seeing how selfish it
is which of course disturbs a lot of stay Georgia
sage blue people who are Americans because you tend to
be blind to the selfish policies foreign policy of your
own country but Noam Chomsky is good it's kind of
stepping outside of that so he's a real good thinker
to model in terms of that whether you agree with
his political ideas or not that's a separate issue what
I'm talking about here is he's a sort of attitude
it's an attitude of looking at the world from outside
of your own perspective and gathering information from lots and
lots of diverse sources this is something that stage blue-and-orange
just cannot really do other examples Fritjof Capra is a
really great example of a systems thinker he has a
lot of books that he's written specifically about systems thinking
Carl Sagan quantum mechanics as a field and the fathers
of quantum mechanics like David Bohm Albert Einstein Niels Bohr
or Schrodinger Arthur Eddington Richard Fineman Freeman Dyson John Archibald
wheeler all of these people and others like them these
tended to be the most cutting-edge scientists and actually many
of these people were even beyond yellow they were at
the at the highest end of yellow starting to peek
into turquoise which is why many of them became mystics
or at least they studied mysticism and they were very
they're very open and ultimately favorable to mysticism and if
you want to know more about that then go check
out my episode about quantum mechanics the two-part series in
part two is where I give you a lot of
quotes from them which shows the evidence of how receptive
they were to the mystical perspective and they were able
to find a really good balance between the science the
cutting-edge science of quantum mechanics a hundred years ago that
was being developed and mysticism and spirituality uh other examples
Paul fire abend Kurt girdle Obama President Obama now again
if you're conservative a right-wing you're gonna have a problem
with this because it seems like I'm putting Obama so
high it's likely oh no Obama wasn't that high and
you might even criticize me from the left here by
saying that no Leo how could you say Obama was
yellow when in fact Obama was he sold out to
the capitalist and the corporate Democrats look I don't want
to make this a political discussion this is this is
we're talking about something way beyond politics we're talking about
attitude if you look at interviews with Obama look at
how he talks look at how he analyzes issues he's
a very complex thinker he turned he thinks in terms
of systems he thinks in terms of ecology not just
I'm not talking about the environment ecology is more than
just saving trees or saving the rainforest ecology everything in
government should really be about ecology is about how do
you create systems that sustain themselves that don't ultimately end
up cannibalizing or backfiring now of course I don't know
Obama personally I don't know the the intricacies and the
details of how he thinks but just the idea I
get by looking at interviews with him is that he's
a yellow type of thinker now you have to understand
though just because you have a yellow thinker doesn't mean
you put this guy in office and all the sudden
he solves all of our problems that's not how it
works at all because when you take a yellow person
and you put him into a giant bureaucracy which is
predominantly blue and orange and is completely corrupted by lobbying
and corporate interests and religious interests and all sorts of
other things then you have almost no chance of success
in that kind of situation which is what Obama ran
into he was obstructed and and really he was ahead
of his time right now America is not ready for
a yellow president America needs a green president first before
it can get a yellow president even a green presidents
gonna be problematic because the right wing is gonna resist
him so much and that's that's that's fine that's just
where we're at that's okay and of course Obama I'm
sure he has a lot of green in him as
well and I'm sure he has still plenty of orange
in him and I'm sure that he he was influenced
by corporate interests and stuff like that so again let's
not get into all the nitty-gritty political debates here because
this is taking our eye off the ball speaking of
which we've got George Soros another example of a yellow
thinker now again you might criticize George Soros because you
disagree with his political views but that's not what I
mean what I mean is think about how he thinks
about the markets think about how he thinks about public
policy and you're gonna start to see that he's a
a long term systems thinker Joseph Campbell is a really
good example of stage yellow the psychologist Erich Fromm Claire
graves of course Don Beck and spiral dynamics these are
the epitome zuv yellow thinking Elia pergamene chaos theory cybernetics
biomimetics NLP Alfred Korzybski the leading edge of academia tends
to skew yellow futurists and an example from Star Trek
is the humans or the Vulcan so what's interesting in
Star Trek is that the humans in Star Trek they
they don't behave like normal 21st century humans there's a
certain elevation with which they talk with each other how
they relate even when they have a dispute or a
problem on the enterprise or whatever ship they're on they're
always resolving their problems in a sort of yellow metal
level way and the Vulcans are also sort of logical
left brained and and kind of sophisticated complex thinkers and
for the humans in Star Trek what do they have
they have the prime directive what is the prime directive
don't interfere with the goings-on of other species and races
that's their most important rule that's a very yellow sort
of rule right because the humans in Star Trek they're
conscious enough to recognize that if hey if we get
involved with all the stuff that's going on in the
in the star systems and all the galaxies that are
out there then we're probably going to create more damage
then then if we just let those people naturally evolve
so even though the humans and Star Trek they they
run across all sorts of primitive races that are fighting
with each other tribal warfare and racism and all these
sorts of problems but they don't get pushy about having
those people change because they know that those people need
to evolve on their own terms so they sort of
they try to help where they can where they see
that a sort of strategic active punctual intervention is available
but if it's not generally they just try to let
this thing run its course that's a very yellow attitude
other examples of yellow sustainable living ecology eco cities and
these modern versions of urban planning that are happening now
in certain cities like in the Middle East in Dubai
and other cities in the United Emirates and Qatar they're
developing and building these sort of like totally new cities
in the desert from scratch and there designing it to
make sure that they're eco-friendly and all the roads and
everything is built in such a way that is perfect
for human life and like it's well organized and design
that's a yellow sort of design conflict resolution Shinzon young's
mindfulness system if you're familiar with that one now Shinzon
yung himself I would place at turquoise actually but also
there's a certain facet of Shenzhen and his teachings which
is very very yellow he's very nerdy he likes to
bring science into it he likes to analyze it to
death and he has this whole complicated matrix of different
meditation techniques and here's what you do this way that
way you know he's turned into this whole system which
strikes me as a very yellow approach to the Poisson
uh Wikipedia is a yellow sort of project Ludwig Wittgenstein
Jacques Derrida Buckminster Fuller Willard Klein Sergey Brin and Larry
Page of Google strike me as very forward-thinking visionary yellow
strategic thinkers and Steve Jobs from Apple Paul Allen from
Microsoft these are similar type of minded people Ella and
musk even though I've mentioned him before when I was
talking about orange for example I think musk is a
is also a systems thinker he's a nuance thinker and
so he definitely has plenty of yellow in him it's
just a question of how much orange how much yellow
how much green he's somewhere somewhere in there Joe Rogan
I think is a pretty good example of someone who's
green and Beyond it's interesting because Joe Rogan has a
lot of fans who follow him who are in the
blue slash orange because Rogan has the sort of macho
appearance and also sort of talks about macho topics sometimes
he's a comedian so he he's very easy to relate
to and just people find him interesting and kind of
charismatic but um but well I think a lot of
viewers misses how evolved Rogan is you know Rogan is
into psychedelics ro to spirituality Rogen is into looking at
reality from all sorts of perspectives that's why he's very
open-minded he's able to listen to people talking about this
politics and that politics and this technology in this science
and that history and this archaeology and it's like everything
you know just like this Mortgage Board of stuff and
he's able to to maintain his sort of neutrality on
all that stuff which is which is really remarkable that's
not easy to do not easy to do in in
in a position like he has he could easily just
be have become an ideologue like Alex Jones but he's
not because he's more evolved than that whether that's because
he's takes in so much psychedelics and weed and all
this sort of stuff edibles five Meo I don't know
what it's from but um but it's great and you
know sometimes people people think all but he's so macho
and all this yeah he's macho but at the same
time look like he hunts his own meat so even
though he's not a vegan he himself has said that
he's so disgusted for example with factory farming of animals
that if he didn't hunt his own meat he would
be a vegan so he made like a decision should
I should I go hunt my own meat the way
like our ancestors did he find that to be integral
with with his philosophy and way of living life and
that's fine that's exactly the kind of yellow move that
you would make you would say well I don't like
factory farming so either I'm gonna become a vegan or
hey maybe I'm just gonna go like hunt my own
deer with a bow and arrow and then that makes
a little bit more challenging and it's both fun for
me and it also maybe actually helps helps overcrowded populations
in certain areas where there's too many deer and they're
just shooting them and they're you know they're they're going
to waste so maybe I can go hunt there you
know so it's it's a very kind of systems systems
thinking approach I should also mention Sam Harrison Jordan Jordan
Peterson again I've talked about them in the past has
exhibiting stages of orange maybe even stages and shades of
blue but really if you want to give the most
charitable charitable evaluation of these two thinkers then I think
you have to say that they have quite a bit
of yellow in them now are they 100% solid yellow
I would say no and the reason I would say
that for example for Sam Harris because I feel like
he doesn't quite for example know how to integrate Islam
properly I feel like he demonizes it and judges it
I feel like he's also kind of moralistic and he
still I feel like he's not seeing the entire spiral
I feel like he's still reacting against certain lower stages
in the spiral and not fully integrating and not really
finding a way to bridge those those different gaps he
still stuck on some sort of ideology there's still some
sort of rationalism in him that he's kind of like
pushing and trying to get get in there he's not
truly able to be neutral so that's holding him back
so maybe he's like 50% yellow and also got plenty
of green and orange and him and as far as
Jordan Peterson also I think Jordan Peterson he is a
sophisticated and nuanced thinker he does pull from many different
sources he does read a lot he does study a
lot he brings in a lot of information into his
lectures and so forth which is great so in that
sense he's yellow so maybe he's 50% yellow maybe he's
80% yellow I don't know I ultimately don't know these
people well enough to make a fully accurate evaluation of
them only they can know where they're really at but
again I think Peterson is stuck in certain regressive elements
of orange and blue because he's he sort of stuck
on this pushing the sort of masculinity agenda I don't
I don't know what that is about that seems very
regressive to me he's also stuck on this sort of
moralization in the same way that that same hair Sam
Harris is not willing to admit that morality is an
invention of the human mind and and there's still a
sort of ideology there just like there's not a recognition
of of the entire spiral there's not a recognition of
really like trying to to truly see the world from
from different perspectives it's still kind of a pushing of
his perspective on the world which you see him doing
so that's holding him back now again I'm I'm giving
you lots of examples of people in every one of
these spiral episodes that I do and the reason I
do that is because I think that it helps you
to see how practical spiral dynamics is and how you
can actually apply it in your own life because if
I just came up here and just gave you a
bunch of abstract principles and values you wouldn't see how
it connects that's why I give you all these political
examples and controversial examples and all the sort of stuff
a lot of these people I don't know them personally
and I haven't read and studied all of their work
in depth so my evaluations of them could be misguided
or maybe I'm only seeing a certain facet of their
personality but not the full thing that's because I'm just
kind of throwing this out there loosely for you you
should take this model and apply for yourself and you
might have different evaluations you might look at some of
these people that I've categorized as yellow or orange or
green or blue and you might say no leo they're
really something else they're higher they're lower okay fine that's
what I want you to do don't just take these
examples blindly from me think through them for yourself and
ultimately remember that it's not about evaluating other people it's
mostly using this as a tool for growing yourself so
the person you should be most concerned about evaluating is
yourself and that's why I'm giving you all these examples
and of course the last example is actualized org actualize
that org is I think a really good example of
what yellow looks like I try to present to you
many many different perspectives if you haven't noticed yet a
very multi perspectival approach I can talk to you about
insights from Christianity from Zen from Buddhism from yoga from
Tantra from from Judaism from Islam from science from quantum
mechanics from evolutionary theory from for mathematics from logic from
you know like from psychology from business from stuff I
learned from pickup and stuff I learned from online marketing
and and video game just like all of it all
of it all of it comes together into this giant
melting pot and from that you get the most rich
and diverse perspective that's really my whole secret to getting
a deep understanding of reality is that I recognized a
long time ago back when I was about 16 or
18 years old when I first started to really think
deeply about the metaphysics and epistemology of reality is I
noticed that the biggest problem that I see people all
around me making and people throughout history is that they
get stuck in one perspective in one paradigm and then
they're not able to break out of it so my
solution to that was very very simple and very pragmatic
what I decided is that I'm going to scour hundreds
of different sources very diverse sources which challenge my opinions
and that's why I was able to grow so much
over the last five or ten years because when I
started out ten years ago I was a materialist an
atheist I didn't believe in God I just blindly accepted
evolution I dismissed intelligent design I dismissed psyckadeli there's so
much stuff I dismissed but the one thing I had
going for me which allowed me to correct all that
stuff when other people are not able to correct it
I see them getting stuck all the time in this
stuff is because fundamentally I didn't lock myself into any
one perspective and so I just kept reading and researching
and staying very open-minded and trying different stuff exploring psychedelics
exploring different religions call your different retreats talking different people
interviewing you know flying around the country flying around the
world doing yoga and doing this and doing that I
watching a lot of diverse videos reading tons of books
having my own insights doing a lot of contemplation and
through that entire process just like a whole new world
opened up to me stuff that would would be completely
unimaginable ten years ago for me and the one thing
that made it happen is simply my open-mindedness and my
my yellow attitude of looking for more and more diverse
perspectives you have to love looking at the world from
alternative points of view let me give you a couple
of final examples that will really help you to understand
yellow so let's take the example of vegetarianism what does
vegetarianism look like at green versus yellow a green vegetarian
is usually sort of an obnoxious proselytizing vegetarian so the
green vegetarian she has her epiphany that eating animals is
wrong and factory farming is horrible and disgusting and so
now she's very empathetic and sympathetic to so she joins
the vegetarian movement and and now she goes out there
and she protests and she's an animal rights activist and
all this and any time she sees someone eating meat
this triggers her this makes her emotional she says how
could you and she judges them and she tries to
convert them and she tries to tell them about all
but the benefits of vegetarianism right and she's a little
bit over the top with it whereas a yellow vegetarian
still basically understands all that same stuff but is more
mellow and tempered and has an additional higher level understanding
a meta understanding that you can't just take a meat-eater
who is hooked and addicted to eating meat and just
moralize to them and proselytize and convert them into a
vegetarian that's not an effective strategy yellow understands that yes
we can discuss all these issues but I'm not going
to go out of my way to force anybody to
become a vegetarian and so yellow is more laid-back and
chill about the whole process so yellow cares but yellow
is not a bleeding heart and yellow understands that product
that that that person who is a meat-eater he has
to go through his own process see he's not gonna
learn from my experiences he has to learn from his
own experiences so maybe I can I can float that
balloon out there and I can bring bring up this
possibility to one of my meat-eater friends or something if
I'm yellow if I'm a yellow vegetarian I can kind
of put that idea out there for them but I'm
not gonna push them too much and I'm gonna kind
of let them to come to their own conclusions right
because I'm sensitive to the fact that they need to
move up the spiral in the same way that you
have a small child you can't just proselytize or browbeat
that child into learning calculus the child will learn calculus
once he goes through arithmetic and he learns his multiplication
tables and he learns geometry and trigonometry he goes to
to high school and maybe at the very end of
high school he can start to learn calculus he has
to grow into it he can't learn at first grade
and there's nothing wrong with him for not being able
to learn it in first grade let me give you
a few more examples of yellow specifically let's focus on
yellow political solutions public policy solutions in the Middle East
with the economy with the education system and with the
health care system so here's how a yellow person would
look at problems in the Middle East and there are
lots of different problems in the Middle East there are
problems with the Israelis and Palestinians there are problems with
in Iraq their religious problems and human rights problems so
there's so there's a lot of stuff to tackle there
but let's take the israeli-palestinian problem so an orange or
blue person would look at that problem and he would
take a side you would say oh the Israelis are
right or the pastilla Palestinians are right and then he
would support one of those causes whereas the yellow person
will look at the entire situation and first before jumping
in with any kind of policy prescriptions yellow is say
let's actually get down on the ground let's go into
you some Israelis and Palestinians and lest let's see where
they're at where are they in the spiral what percentage
of Israel and what percentage of Palestine is at stage
red blue orange green and so forth so let's first
do that let's have interviews with these people let's really
understand their perspective let's understand the Israeli perspective and the
Palestinian perspective let's see where there's common ground and let's
see where the differences are let's see where there are
common values so yellow will try to take all the
stakeholders into account making sure not to exclude anybody yellow
is not going to come in there and act opinionated
and push his own political agenda because yellows highest agenda
is just to have a healthy system how do we
get a healthy system working in Israel and in Palestine
that works for both of them so after yellow assesses
all the values then yellow will try to establish a
super ordinate goal that both sides can agree to and
some common shared values that they cannot both work on
and yellow will try to teach both sides about spiral
dynamics and how this model can help them avoid the
various traps and one of the things that yellow is
going to be very careful about is making sure to
defuse ideological polarization which is so common in the Middle
East especially with Israelis and Palestinians and if you think
that what I'm describing here is some pipe dream that
only works in a textbook you're very wrong because actually
dawn Beck the developer spiral dynamics and people that he's
worked with and students that have studied under him they
have actually done this exact process that I'm describing with
the Israelis and the Palestinians they they worked there for
10 years in the early and middle 2000s doing exactly
this process and they were having some great results but
of course some you know the situation there is very
political and it's much difficult more difficult than it seems
and they ran into some obstacles with funding because they
need funding to run this project they ran into a
problem because they they had funding for a while they
were doing this whole scheme there and they were getting
good results and they were actually able to teach spiral
dynamics to stage purple and red and blue Israelis and
Palestinians which the majority of them are but they ran
out of funding in 2008 when the the the stock
market collapsed and the global recession happened and so that
that derailed their plans but spiral dynamics is one of
the best tools we've got for example if you really
care about solving via israeli-palestinian conflict and many other conflicts
in the Middle East so it's a very powerful system
I'm actually gonna add a book to my book list
in the future that describes how spiral dynamics for example
applies specifically to Middle East problems and also add a
book about how spiral dynamics applies to economic problems here
in the United States speaking of which let's talk a
little bit about how a yellow person would look at
the economy the problem with economy is that most economists
and politicians have strong opinions about how the economy should
be and so basically they're ideologues they're either staunch capitalists
the milton friedman's of the world or staunch libertarians or
the sort of I and Randi ins or they are
like the socialists and the Communists and whatever else the
progressives right so people take sides and the difference between
doing all that and a tear to approach a stage
yellow approach is that a stage yellow person again would
come in there and say okay what are the systemic
problems in our economy who are all the stakeholders the
people at Wall Street what are their what's their value
system what level are they at what are their fears
what are their concerns and what about our you know
the religion the religious right in this country what are
their concerns what are their values what are their opinions
on the economy and what's the what's the average person's
opinions in New York or in California about the economy
and what are the different value systems and what is
actually causing these recessions and and and and problems that
we have in the economy or the sort of capitalistic
exploitation cannibalism that we start to see what's causing this
and so he will actually do studies do research not
just take ideological positions but actually do the study do
the science figure that out and then come up with
systemic solutions for that see but in order to do
that notice how neutral and objective you have to be
you have to not be biased and you have to
not be ideological you could imagine a similar type of
approach with the education system again with the education system
people become ideological they say well I'm for public schools
and the other person said no I'm for private schools
and then they'll have somewhere to debate about this this
doesn't solve anything a yellow person would look at the
systemic issues within our education system actually take a look
where are the problems what solutions have we tried in
the past that haven't worked let's go to different corners
of the world and analyze different systems that they have
and find the best system maybe in Europe maybe in
Asia maybe in Australia you know where do they have
the best test scores maybe in Scandinavia let's go find
those let's see what they're doing right let's try to
integrate that into our system and then what would be
the obstacles how do we make sure that all the
stakeholders are satisfied here not just so that we're jamming
our own ideological position down someone's throat and of course
the same thing with the health care system so there
you start to see just how practical spiral dynamics can
be and that if you really care about solving these
problems notice that these problems like in the Middle East
the economy the education problem the health care problem these
are intractable sort of problems these are problems that have
existed for probably fifty or a hundred years or maybe
even more and no matter how much we try whether
Republicans come into power Democrats come into power whatever we're
not able to solve them which tells you there's a
deeper systemic issue we're not getting to the root of
it so yellow would actually focus on doing that now
of course that doesn't mean that yellow would succeed in
every situation yellow isn't flawless but you can see that
this is a much more intelligent approach all right let's
take a quick intermission don't go anywhere because I'll be
right back all right let's talk about how to know
if you are really yellow I think that there can
be quite a few people who are starting to shift
into yellow but they're not quite solid yellow and as
I was studying yellow and a lot of depth in
preparation for this episode I really started to become aware
of certain areas where I still have more growing to
do to really become solid and yellow and so I
came up with just for myself some pointers to test
myself to see am I really solid yellow or am
I still regressing back into the first tier so I
think this is important to cover so here's how you
know this and I cannot stress this enough are you
non-judgmental this I think is perhaps the most important quality
of being solid yellow and this one is really tricky
because it's difficult to give up your judgment ality is
it's just it's just something you've been doing your whole
life it's something that you see in the news it's
something you see all your friends doing all around you
it's been done and your family has been doing it
so this is one of those things that's very counterintuitive
to surrender all of your judgments because your ego is
telling you know I got to keep judging leo if
I stop judging then all of this bad stuff will
happen to me which of course is just a trick
that's not true at all to really get to the
highest levels in life you have to stop judging have
you stopped demonizing people have you stopped debating and arguing
with people this is completely pointless as a distraction have
you stopped moralizing and blaming and scapegoating have you stopped
crusading this point about crusading is very important Tier one
people go on intellectual ideological Crusades I'm not talking about
physical violent Crusades most of us are way beyond that
at least I hope you are but many of us
still get trapped in ideological Crusades where we go on
rants against people and we have our favorite enemy whether
it's the right or the left or it's the progressives
or it's the neo-nazis and the alt writers or whatever
it is you got some sort of ideological bug up
your ass and that's driving you that's preventing you from
becoming solid yellow let it go and that's hard for
some people to do because people build an entire career
out of crusading against something so that's very tricky so
make sure that you don't corner yourself into a career
where you have to do crusading in order to pay
your bills because if you if you paint yourself into
that corner then guess what you're gonna justify your crusading
and you're probably gonna keep doing it because it's paying
your bills and what else are you gonna do watch
out for that also are you able to be impartial
like really impartial really be able to step outside of
your own agenda that's so important for yellow can you
see the world through the lower stages do you see
the validity of the lower stages or do you think
that the lower stages should not exist that's a key
differentiator between tier 1 and tier 2 do you see
that every perspective is partially true there's something you could
learn from every perspective I don't care how vile it
is I don't care how ridiculous it seems there's something
there you can learn if you can just let your
own agenda go actually step into the shoes the other
person see the world from their perspective and there was
something you will learn from that now I'm not saying
that you should go become a Nazi what I'm saying
is that you can look at the world from the
perspective of a Nazi and learn something that doesn't mean
that now you are a Nazi and that now you
will think that that is the only true perspective all
right so be careful about that because it's very easy
for the ego to say aha leo so what you're
saying is that every perspective is partially true that means
all of my ago--at perspectives that other people are criticizing
they're actually true and so you're just justifying what I've
always believed is true no I'm not that's not what
I'm doing I'm actually trying to get you to step
outside of your perspective so whatever you believe let it
go and go explore other perspectives and if you are
having difficulty doing that then you're not really solidly yellow
yet yeah more growing to do and the more you
are able to do that the more yellow you will
become also are you genuinely curious to explore other points
of view this isn't just something that you do because
I'm forcing you to do it it's not like a
bitter pill you have to swallow a yellow person actually
enjoys jumping between different points of view it's actually fun
it's exciting it's interesting you're looking at the world from
different perspectives that means you're always seeing something do you're
learning something new that's exciting that's interesting rather than just
being stuck in your boring Christian perspective or your boring
Muslim perspective or your boring rationalist logical perspective also are
you able to go meta are you able to by
going meta what I mean is stepping outside of whatever
dynamic you're observing seeing the meta mechanism this could be
whether you're in a university or whether you're reading a
book or whether you're exploring religion or something at you
you need to be able to step outside of the
thing that you are participating in to really be able
to observe it impartial II do you see that mankind's
problems are not personal but systemic and they are really
nobody's fault that's huge to be able to see that
until you can see this you're gonna scapegoat and blame
people because you're gonna think oh it's the it's the
Liberals fault or it's the Arabs fault or it's the
Christians fault or is it's the evangelicals oh it's those
ignorant people it's those people it's that that's really not
the issue the issue is systemic we have systemic problems
of ignorance of lack of education we have systemic problems
in the medical industry we have six emic economic problems
we have systemic racial problems and gender problems and cultural
problems and religious and spiritual problems and scientific problems and
they're all systemic so if you want to solve them
we need to first of all acknowledge that stop blaming
people and then we can get serious about understanding the
system studying the system right because when you take an
issue personally when you think that the israeli-palestinian problem is
a personal problem because of those ugly Palestinians or those
ugly Israelis you're not getting anywhere that doesn't that doesn't
lead to any serious solutions and it's not really true
that that problem exists because one or the other side
is ugly or bad or evil there is a systemic
issue there that you haven't recognized yet here are some
common sayings from a stage yellow perspective we cannot are
solve our problems with the same level of thinking that
we use to create them the map is not the
territory every perspective is part true and part false wisdom
is knowing what you don't know perspective is everything the
better the model the bigger the problem new times require
new thinking different strokes for different folks it takes all
kinds that last one is important what that means it
takes all kinds is that when you're a systems thinker
you understand that not everyone in the world can be
nor should be exactly like you and in fact if
the world was that way then it would be a
terrible problem it would be a terrible problem if every
human being was a Christian or a Muslim or an
atheist or a libertarian or a Marxist or whatever else
that would be a terrible problem the world requires specialization
the world is like a giant ant colony and in
an ant colony you have your worker ants you have
your warrior ants you have your breeding ants you have
other kinds of ants and they all work together there
they all specialize in different things different kinds and they
all balance out in the end but there are these
interesting asymmetries which lead to the smooth functioning of this
entire ant colony so you've got to start to see
mankind in that way and when you see human societies
that way then you stop trying to proselytize everybody to
be just like you to think just like you to
believe just like you to have exactly your perspective hmm
so that's um that's a that's a that's a good
little tip there for becoming more yellow what triggers yellow
well what's interesting is that there's a difference now between
tier 1 and tier 2 and how tier 2 gets
triggered tier 2 is not easy to trigger but of
course yellow is not perfect so it does still get
triggered but usually it'll take more to trigger yellow and
yellow will not get triggered in nearly as severe and
emotional ways as the tier 1 colors will so in
a nutshell what triggers yellow is the blindness and the
infighting of tier 1 because yellow has this amazing vision
for how mankind could be if we could just all
get together stop fighting stop scapegoating each other and really
wake up to what's going on wake up to all
the systemic dynamics but of course even though yellow understands
all that yellow also understands that a Tier one hasn't
gotten there yet but sometimes yellow can forget that and
can get frustrated nonetheless so at Tier two maybe it's
not so much about getting triggered it's more about being
frustrated with the lack of progress or the lack of
awareness that exists all around the world has the stage
yellow you're gonna be pretty lonely you're gonna be less
than 1% of the entire population so it's gonna be
hard for you to find like-minded individuals although you can
so don't turn that into a limiting belief but generally
you're not going to be understood by the average person
on the street and your views are not going to
be represented in the media in politics on online forums
in magazines and and so forth so we've got to
be ready for that what else triggers yellow black and
white thinking because yellow is the exact opposite that yellows
a nuanced thinker non systemic thinking people who think to
short term yellow can be triggered by excessive rationalism reductionism
and scientism people who turn signs into a religion or
a dogma and of course yellow is frustrated with all
kinds of dogmatic and ideological people of which there are
plenty of on all sides including in universities and in
churches and in different countries everywhere you find ideological people
yellow is frustrated by conformity and groupthink yellow is frustrated
by polarization demonization and radicals one of the biggest problem
for yellow is radicals because every every group tends to
have its radical elements whether it's the left or the
right or the Muslims or the Israelis or whoever else
there's going to be a small core of radicals these
are the ideologues so usually stage blue maybe stage orange
or so or stage green sometimes these are the radicals
and they will try to radicalize the average members of
the group who are not radicals and turn them radical
such that the radicals now have this crusade because the
radicals are on a crusade and so what this this
antagonizes both sides and nothing can get resolved in this
situation so one of the biggest enemies for for yellow
is these radicals and they can frustrate yellow because these
radicals will spoil yellows plans and in fact what the
radicals will do is the radicals of course will demonize
yellow and call yellow a radical because that's what radicals
do they just project onto everybody else of course yellow
is not a radical but when you're a blue or
orange or green radical you can't see that and in
fact the radicals for criticize yellow yellow is is too
neutral yellow isn't passionate enough yellow is just trying to
take the middle road everywhere and that's not actually true
but from the radicals perspective that's how it can look
what else frustrates yellow is people who don't understand spiral
dynamics that can be very frustrating spiral dynamics is a
pretty complicated system it takes a long time to explain
it a long time to really learn it and so
once you do have spiral dynamics in your tool belt
and you use that as a lens to look at
the world you can see so many problems that are
just so obvious and you can see all the solutions
from within spiral dynamics but of course nobody else out
there knows spiral dynamics the way that you do and
so they are gonna be blind to the obvious things
that you see and actually they're gonna be in denial
about it - because Tier one is generally in denial
about spiral dynamics yellow is triggered by consumerism and profiteering
religion can trigger yellow fixed structures which offer no space
for knowledge development analysis or conceptualizing that can really frustrate
yellow red tape and bureaucracy can frustrate yellow working in
groups can be frustrating for yellow because yellow is a
visionary yellow kind of just like gets down to the
nitty-gritty does the research kind of gets his hands dirty
and figure stuff out whereas in a group usually people
are waffling and they're just talking and wasting time and
that can frustrate yellow yellow is frustrated by myopia the
lack of vision that people have when you're a visionary
it's pretty lonely because most people don't share your vision
and so you have to cultivate that vision within yourself
and that's what my life purpose course is about is
to help you to do that and I feel like
a lot of the content that i release is really
about helping you to kind of cultivate your own vision
for yourself whether it's for your own enlightenment your own
awakening your own development or for some impact you want
to have in the world your life purpose and then
kind of push that through despite the fact that the
world around you is not going to be supportive of
those efforts generally speaking yellow can be frustrated by how
most people are focused on short-term petty human issues rather
than the higher issues of well I would call these
the spiritual issues the metaphysical issues the existential issues the
global issues that face mankind yellow is frustrated by people
who lack an interest in the big picture people who
are overly technical and focused on trivia and yellow can
be triggered by politics and gamesmanship and manipulation because yellow
wants to rise above all that and yellow doesn't like
being sucked back in to politics what are some of
the limitations of yellow in Prior episodes I talked about
the unhealthy excesses of each color with yellow it's not
there's not much in yellow that is unhealthy but there
are limitations to yellow which keep it from growing into
turquoise so here's what they are yellow is still stuck
in duality in most cases and there's no deep mysticism
possible within yellow because yellow is still way too much
in this thinking mind too much thinking too much modeling
and as a result even though yellow could be aware
of the problem of confusing the map for the territory
yellow still will probably fall into the trap of confusing
the map for the territory it's just such a tricky
trap to avoid and really to avoid it you have
to escape the mind but yellow is probably not ready
to do that yet because yellow is still so fascinated
by all these concepts all these models all these systems
that yellow is analyzing and synthesizing and so to move
beyond that you're gonna have to start to let that
go and of course that cielos bread and butter that's
probably how yellow earns a living so that might be
a little tricky for yellow yeah yellow could just be
unwilling to transcend models and concepts I know that's something
that I've wrestled with over the last couple of years
as I've been trying to transition to turquoise it's tricky
it's tricky because you've amassed all these great models and
concepts including of course spiral dynamics and then what you
need to do is you need to let it go
and that's one of those really counterintuitive moves that will
probably take you a few years to figure out yellow
can get bogged down in complex analysis yellow can develop
an intellectual hubris because yellow does know a lot of
stuff yellow does understand much more than your average person
but then that can lead to a form of arrogance
another limitation of yellow is that yellow can invent beautiful
futuristic solutions but that are not pragmatic they might look
great on paper but then he can't actualize them another
problem for yellow is not being able to finish something
because there's always some new great vision that comes to
you the next day to really actualize those visions you
got to work on them for years but yellow has
so many different visions always thinking about new ideas making
new discoveries in the conceptual mind scape that it can
become difficult to actually actualize something tangible and produce the
results that yellow nose are possible yellow usually needs a
team of people to help him to actualize his results
but the problem for yellow is that yellow tends to
be a cold individualist and a loner and yellow becomes
too isolated and this becomes a limitation because then yellow
can't really actualize his vision and also because again yellow
starts to feel a little lonely and disconnected yellow can
be limited in that he can't build a community which
is really what's necessary to solve the world's problems yellow
can forget to connect with people because he is too
focused on models and ideas rather than relationships so what's
necessary for your yellow is again sort of a swinging
of the pendulum back a little bit more towards the
communal side which of course is anticipating turquoise yellow can
be emotionally distant and in the end yellow has to
realize this fundamental limitation of this stage which is that
all this understanding that you are developing and amassing still
does not equal happiness no matter how well you understand
the world no matter how good your models are no
matter how correct you are you're still not happy why
is that well because happiness is not found in the
mind and yellow might hit his head against the wall
for many many years before he finally admits to himself
that he's not gonna find happiness inside his mind with
all of his models another limitation of yellow is a
lack of embodiment yellow can know all this stuff about
the world and about politics and about psychology even even
about spirituality even about mysticism because yellow can read a
bunch of books about mysticism but there's a big difference
between reading a bunch of books about non-duality and actually
being able to embody it which is also something that
I've been wrestling with as I've been trying to transition
to turquoise from yellow the last couple of years is
that embodiment is really a much much much harder than
simply understanding and modeling and conceptualizing and so I've done
a lot of that because I need to to share
this stuff with you but also I need to work
a lot on my embodiment and so that's what I've
been doing lately through yoga and psychedelics and meditation retreats
and so forth and of course the embodiment is the
really hard part and that's what will take you decades
to do and it's frustrating because as yellow you you
you have this vision of who you can be and
how you can awaken and how you can transform the
world but you lack the embodiment to do it you
lack the spiritual purification necessary to do it you lack
the selflessness that's necessary to do it you lack and
maybe the discipline maybe you lack the socialization skills some
of these communal building skills that are necessary to do
it so that that that can be scary because that
shows yellow oh my god there's still so much work
to be done I can't just rest on all my
models and all my concepts and ultimately the limitation of
yellow is that yellow cannot solve the world's problems alone
yellow needs a community to really address all of these
problems and to enact the systemic solutions that yellow came
up with and so that's ultimately what's going to push
you into turquoise some yellow stats for you about one
percent of the adult global population is yellow and yellow
has about five percent of world influence through the media
through books through government programs and through think tanks and
stuff like this the style of government under yellow is
systemic flow its knowledge centered governance the dawn of systems
thinking within government and rule by experts and intellectuals which
of course blue is going to be very opposed to
which is why whenever you see some intellectual who goes
into government what is the common demonization and critique that
blue / orange might have of that it's like oh
he's the elite they're the elites yes they are the
elites they're the information elites that's what yellow is information
elites this is not a bad thing this is actually
what's necessary but of course blue orange may not realize
this may be mine eyes it so how do you
go about transcending yellow well that's basically what I've been
doin over the last couple of years is trying to
transcend yellow the transcendence of yellow is going from self-actualization
into self transcendence what a lot of people don't know
about Abraham Maslow is that towards the end of his
life I mean he developed that pyramid right you should
be familiar with that and in that pyramid of needs
the hierarchy of needs there is the top cornerstone of
the pyramid the pinnacle which is self-actualization and that is
like yellow but then Maslow in his later years he
actually had some self transcendent experiences himself he had some
mystical experiences himself and then he realized that there's another
level beyond self-actualization which is self transcendence so if you
take that triangle and you sort of just intersect those
lines and you you carry them forward extrapolate them forward
what you get is you sort of get this inverted
triangle at the very top like a light shining out
from the pyramid and that that top part that is
the self transcendence that's when you have to release and
let go of developing yourself and start to undo and
deconstruct yourself and this is a big radical transition from
doing and thinking into the being level it's accessing the
absolute through direct consciousness and that's what's gonna move you
beyond yellow that's what yellow is really missing to transcend
yellow you have to deeply realize that understanding and the
mind will never bring you happiness in fact your happiness
in many ways is directly or inversely proportional rather to
how much you think transcending yellow really requires enlightenment Kundalini
awakening psychedelics are a great way to go beyond yellow
as they will give you mystical experiences and profound insights
that shatter all of your models and all of your
concepts and show you that the map really is not
the territory oh I can't I can't tell you enough
how important having a five Meo DMT breakthrough would be
for you if you're at yellow - transitioning you into
turquoise that five Meo DMT breakthrough is gonna show you
the full glory of what turquoise is like and what's
so special about that is that you might not get
to that level naturally just through meditation or through contemplation
for decades so to be able to tap into it
if only just for for 15 minutes if only for
60 minutes that will be enough that would be enough
for you to to actually get at ang taste of
what turquoise is really about and it's a huge shift
like it's a it's a is beyond a quantum leap
other ways of doing that if you don't have access
to five owned you Meo DMT is through Kriya yoga
meditation self inquiry Vipassana all these spiritual mystical practices are
good solo meditation retreats long periods of isolation are really
helpful for going beyond yellow realizing the limits of concepts
and the mind and beliefs it's one thing for me
to just say that it's another thing for you to
really grasp and very deeply what the inherent limitations are
there to transcend yellow you need to go beyond models
into a deep in embodiment of these things you've been
reading about in the books these things that I've been
talking about in my videos be more emotional be less
logical yellow is still a little bit too left brained
he needs to bring that back and merge it with
the right brain again opening up the heart chakra is
very important for transcending yellow loving-kindness meditation can be a
good technique for transcending yellow practicing more compassion yellow cares
but yellow still doesn't have that unconditional deep mystical love
that only comes after ego death yellow still doesn't have
that to transcend yellow be more human be even more
intuitive than you've already been being surrender all control like
a deep surrender of control totally deconstruct your ego break
it down so there's no ego left deconstruct your web
of beliefs and your emotions deconstruct all your models and
all your concepts deconstruct even further materialism and dualism you
need to get to the point where you have deconstructed
reality so much that you actually do not believe in
a physical external reality at all anymore you don't believe
in time you don't believe in space you don't believe
in in life or death like these things become just
fantasies for you that's how much you need to deconstruct
materialism most yellow people are still stuck in the materialist
paradigm this paradigm is very deep and no matter how
much I talk about it and how much you think
you understand what I'm talking about you are still stuck
in the materials paradigm you still have all these assumptions
and fundamentally you still believe in a tangible physical external
reality in brains in neuroscience in atoms and molecules in
the Big Bang you still believe this stuff is real
and what you need to realize is that it's not
real it's just a it's just a hallucination you're inside
of a dream and you will awaken from this dream
and you will realize that all of this stuff that
you thought was real and tangible that it has no
substance to it whatsoever no reality to it whatsoever to
help you transcend Yello start to read a lot of
books about non-duality start contemplating there's lots of stuff to
contemplate see my episode called contemplation where I tell you
how to contemplate in different topics to contemplate you need
to transcend language to transcend yellow start to notice the
limitations of language mindfulness practice is really good mindfulness above
and beyond just sitting down and meditating for 60 minutes
but mindfulness all the time mindfulness in the shower mindfulness
while you're brushing your teeth mindfulness while you're eating mindfulness
while you're doing your work and everything else it can
be really useful for you to transcend yellow to start
to model saints and sages find those turquoise saints and
sages there are plenty of them still alive you don't
need to go to the history books they're still alive
today men Lemar you can find dozens hundreds of them
even and well meet them face to face ideally get
their energy get the vibe off them get the love
off them get the wisdom off of them that stuff
just radiates they use that stuff if they're really good
st. or a really good sage and start to model
that and start to include incorporate that into your visions
of who you're gonna become because that's what you're aiming
for melt into the now you need to become very
very present to go beyond yellow also heal your energetic
system you might have blocked chakras energetic blockages various emotional
kinks and stuff which are still left from tier one
that you need to iron out to really go turquoise
do enlightenment intensives you can get Shakti pot which is
a transmission of energy from a saint a sage or
saint join a spiritual network or a community so now
as yellow you're probably a lone wolf and you do
a lot of stuff by yourself and maybe you think
you're very effective doing it that way but also think
into the future think about what that is gonna evolve
into that's something I definitely face because I like to
be a lone wolf I like to do a lot
of stuff myself but then also I see the limitations
of that and I see that if I want to
really have the full impact that I could have with
my life and my life purpose then I need to
start preparing myself for how to be better at navigating
and dealing with people maybe creating a community or joining
a spiritual community bonding with people having compassion for being
able to develop that sort of patience that is necessary
for dealing with all the social issues because in a
sense it's a lot easier to just be a lone
wolf then you're not dealing with that entire social domain
and in a sense that's nice but also in a
sense is kind of limiting because then you're not growing
you're not developing yourself as a leader sure you can
develop yourself as a leader as a lone wolf you
can do a lot of stuff that will improve your
leadership abilities but to really test your leadership abilities that
will only happen when you're actually live in the field
bonding and relating to people and dealing with all their
shenanigans and all their nonsense and all their ignorance and
all their misunderstandings and all of that kind of messy
stuff and ultimately to transcend yellow you need to enter
a state of no-mind where you can literally sit and
not use your mind for long periods of time that's
sort of the ultimate end goal of course you're not
gonna get there quite yet it'll probably take you years
maybe decades to get there but that's that's a goal
you should kind of keep in mind and start working
towards it with baby steps alright that's yellow basically for
you in a lot of depth now in conclusion what
I want to say is that if you're orange then
your ego will want to claim that you're yellow be
careful about that you're probably not it's very easy to
overestimate yourself on the spiral even if you think that
you are yellow and you're pretty sure about it remember
that there's many degrees to yellow and yeah maybe you
are yellow but how solidly and deeply are you into
it and I already told you earlier what the metrics
are for for gauging that so my suggestion to you
is don't try to skip yellow to jump to turquoise
but rather go deeply into yellow really work on building
your yellow foundation work on your ability to jump between
different perspectives to be non-judgmental to be neutral to be
aware of your self biases and self-deceptions and so forth
really learn the entire spiral go back and revisit tier
1 of the spiral and learn how to communicate with
stage blue with stage orange with stage green and even
go back into those stages and ask your what haven't
I fully integrated what haven't I fully mastered and embodied
from those stages and you might find that there's still
some stuff that you're hung up on from stage blue
maybe you're still moralizing because you had a stage blue
upbringing or maybe you're still hooked on sex or on
chasing money that's a stage orange hang-up or maybe there's
some stage green hang-ups in you where you're still participating
in some of the excesses excessive relativism or excessive breaking
down of hierarchies or maybe you're you're too compassionate too
emotional to pacifistic or whatever else like that really go
beyond the stereotypes and try to understand all of the
stages below you because you're gonna need to design systems
as yellow for those stages which means that you have
to completely let go of of any kind of negative
emotions you have towards any of the stages a deep
understanding and the only way to get that is to
be able to really step inside the shoes of those
people to see the world from their perspective to be
able to empathize well how why that person is stuck
in that perspective and is unable to move up to
the next level and to understand that oh maybe if
I tell him this thing in this way that will
help him to open his mind to the next level
and then the next level and the next level and
then maybe he can become yellow be careful not to
just directly try to teach yellow to blue people or
to orange people because oftentimes they won't get it and
I want to give you some warnings in the end
here firstly don't make the don't don't make the mistake
of thinking that yellow is infallible yellow can make mistakes
yellow can subscribe to one bad perspective too much then
he needs to or then then he should or yellow
can make factual errors all right so yellow is not
perfect also understand that yellow doesn't mean that you can't
hurt people yellow can still hurt people in relationships maybe
yellow can be able to callus little too cold-hearted or
when dealing with a community yellow can can miss read
their emotions or their feelings or whatever that can still
happen also understand that just because you're yellow it doesn't
mean that your policies won't hurt people just because you
understand spiral dynamics doesn't mean you can't come up with
a bad public policy a bad economic policy a bad
education policy or something like that you still can and
you probably in fact will you have to be very
careful it takes experience takes know-how and you're gonna make
mistakes and yellow doesn't mean that you can't still have
human frailties and weaknesses or addictions for example so one
of the problems that I might cite an example of
someone yellow and then someone in the audience says oh
Bollea but that person has an addiction that person is
addicted to alcohol how can he be yellow well there's
nothing that says that yellow can't be addicted to alcohol
and there's nothing that says that yellow can have a
sex addiction or some other kind of addiction now of
course it's less likely because tier 2 people tend to
be a little bit above that stuff they've tended to
work that stuff out those very crude gross addictions you're
probably not gonna find a stage yellow heroin addict probably
not cuz if you're at stage yellow you don't need
heroin at this point you're actually enjoying the beingness of
life you're enjoying the magnificence of existence to the point
where you don't need hard drugs but you can still
succumb to many subtle addictions maybe have a media addiction
cellphone addiction porn addiction whatever else you know so make
sure you don't over idealize any particular stage all right
the next stage is going to be turquoise and that
one's gonna be really interesting because that's gonna be the
the top of the spiral at least for this series
alright that's it I'm done here please click that like
button for me don't forget that helps to improve the
visibility of the videos and come check out actualize that
org that's my website you will find special resources there
unique content that you can't find anywhere else check out
my blog check out my book list check out the
life purpose course check out the forum where you can
discuss all this stuff speaking of which I'm going to
be creating a mega thread for yellow examples we're gonna
have lots and lots of videos of yellow examples so
find that link down below click on it go to
the forum and you'll find it there we also have
mega threads already created for stage blue with tons of
video examples which are interesting and fascinating and funny and
outrageous and also for stage orange and also for stage
green so we'll do that for all the stages that
we talk about that's it the last thing I want
to tell you is this the danger with me talking
so much about spiral dynamics is you sort of just
kind of fall into this hypnotic trance of just like
yes leo yes leo yes they're just spoon-feed me more
wisdom more golden nuggets and that becomes a danger because
you start to first of all you just blindly accept
everything i say after a while you stop really questioning
it and you blindly accept the entire spiral model and
and then you just become this sort of spiral zombie
that's not the objective here you need to start thinking
for yourself think critically start applying this model for yourself
in your own life and you will see that it's
difficult to apply it's not always clear-cut sometimes you see
a situation or a person or a book and you're
not sure how to classify it maybe you miss categorize
it and that's good because as you go through that
struggle you start to learn the limitations of the model
and that's right spiral dynamics is just a model and
it has limitations and it is not the territory so
start thinking for yourself a stage yellow person doesn't just
blindly read and believe models from other places which is
cool but you got to actually think through it yourself
realize the limitations maybe take this model and try to
connect it with some other model that you discovered somewhere
else that's what you got to start doing you got
to start doing that with every single video that you
watch for me it's so easy for you to just
fall into this trap of believing me beliefs are our
enemy nothing within actualized org can be taken as an
ideology or as a system of belief that's going to
limit you that's going to be way too restrictive you
need to be able to be completely fluid with your
mind so that you can jump between perspectives between models
you can throw them out throw them away hold contradictory
ones have paradoxes in your mind and be able to
wrestle with all that and not be confused to not
be lost and you certainly can't take anything I say
on faith because it's not it's not about what you
believe or what kind of model you possess that is
gonna get you the results that you ultimately want in
your life it's your ability to think critically and independently
for yourself that's what it takes so watch out for
that trap and I'll see you in the next one
you
