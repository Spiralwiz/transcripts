hey this is Leo for ash lies dot org and
in this episode I'm going to be talking about mindfulness
meditation the fundamentals of setting up a mindfulness practice mindfulness
is a term that's been used a lot in the
last few decades and you've probably heard it in the
popular culture but what you probably don't really know is
how to actually practice mindfulness effectively and also the profound
effects it can have on your personal development and your
success in happiness levels in life so here what I
want to do is I want to talk a little
bit about what mindfulness actually is I'm going to define
it for you I'm going to talk about the benefits
of mindfulness to your personal development and I'm going to
give you the 20% of the mindfulness theory that's going
to produce 80% of all the results that you want
from this practice all right it's going to be a
very how to kind of guide so let's get started
basically mindfulness from what I've been learning over the last
couple of years all the different personal development research that
I've done I think mindfulness is the number one maybe
the number two most important skill that you can develop
in your entire life to be happy and to be
very effective as a human being and what's really shameful
is that we're not taught this skill at all in
school or in college our parents don't know about it
our friends don't know about it nobody teaches this to
us but it's one of the most important skills of
being a human being so very powerful very important tool
for self actualization work I want to give a credit
here to Shinzon Jung who's done decades of research and
study and theory building putting together a very robust and
complex and technical mindfulness system so some of the ideas
in presenting to you here come directly from him and
I'm using his mindfulness system but I'm just taking the
very basics that I think are the most important so
we're going to whittle it down and I want to
give a credit to him because he's done some amazing
work and stuff that is really worth taking a look
at as you get deeper and deeper into this practice
see the thing with mindfulness is that it's a very
deep tradition it's over 2,000 years old really starts with
the Buddha goes all the way back to the Buddha
and there's a lot of different traditions of how to
practice mindfulness and here I'm going to give you something
that's going to be very very practical and very effective
and also very basic and simple but before we talk
about how to do mindfulness let's talk a little bit
about what mindfulness is what the hell is mindfulness this
word mindful to be mindful what does it really mean
well it might mean something in the kind of common
parlance but here we're using in a very kind of
technical sense what I mean by mindfulness is the following
thing I don't just mean some vague spiritual term I
don't just mean being present and in the moment what
I mean is I mean experiencing reality literally exactly as
it is that's my definition of mindfulness to experience reality
literally exactly as it is I don't know if you've
noticed but you are living in a reality of some
kind it's a mysterious thing really this reality that we
live in but one thing that you should start to
notice about it is that it comes to you through
your senses and basically it doesn't come to you through
any other means all you've really got is you've got
sight you've got sound you've got body sensations and feelings
you've got emotions you've got thoughts all of these are
like sensory channels through which you're receiving stuff you've got
also smell you've got taste just these very basic things
and through these channels you get reality and that's as
real as reality gets for you that's all you really
have of reality is the stuff that you're actually Berrien
Seng right now this very moment right now whatever is
happening to you is what's real and it's changing every
single second now this is very different than the way
that most people live through life we tell ourselves like
oh yeah of course this is obvious Leo so so
obviously doesn't even need to be said it's so stupidly
simple but actually no see you live most of your
life not understanding that these channels are functioning every single
second and stuff is changing that they're feeding you raw
information you don't really live on that raw information what
you live on is you live on your fantasies because
your mind filters out 99.9% of all of this raw
information and you're completely out of touch with it and
instead what you do is you use your prefrontal cortex
to imagine fantasies of the future or you think about
things that happen to you in the past or you
have some sort of emotional reactions that you get caught
up in or do you have some sort of plans
and goals for the future for your business for your
family for your relationships and so on and so forth
and you're basically caught up in a conceptual life and
you're not very grounded in what's actually most real about
reality which is the actual raw data that's being fed
to you so what mindfulness is about is putting you
back in touch with what's really literally they're not what
you're imagining not what you're judging not what you're afraid
of not what happened to you ten years ago or
what's going to happen to you tomorrow but what's really
true right this very second so that's the big picture
definition now there's three components of mindfulness that are very
important and this will help to explain what mindfulness is
in more detail the three components are number one is
focus focus is your ability to put your attention selectively
on certain sensations within your awareness right now you have
probably at least a hundred different sensations bombarding your mind
and body right this very second from the sensations in
your feet to the beating of your your heart to
the pumping of your lungs to maybe a fought to
a sensation of hunger to a discomfort in the way
that you're sitting or standing to the sounds that you're
hearing to the the taste in your mouth to the
smells that are around you all of this stuff is
bombarding your mind the question is what are you focused
on are you able to selectively put your attention on
one thing and keep it there for a long period
of time without getting distracted this is the skill of
focus and this is a very rare skill these days
because we live in a very oversaturated environment where everything
is asking for our attention and we're constantly multitasking and
we're watching TV and texting and emailing and our kids
are calling us and our spouse is calling us and
all this kind of stuff is happening so our information
channels are completely bombarded and we're always distracted it's hard
for us to even sit down and read a book
for 10 minutes straight without diverting our focus elsewhere because
we're just not used to focusing for any long period
of time and here I mean it's like apathetic it's
like we can hardly focus for just a couple of
minutes so that's a very powerful skill to develop because
your ability to focus is directly correlated to how successful
you're going to be in business and in your career
and in your creative pursuits the second component is sensory
clarity sensory clarity is how clear are you about the
raw data that's actually being perceived by your mind like
I said your mind filters out a lot of it
and usually we just assume that we have we understand
we we experience reality exactly kind of how it is
we assume that we know and we're aware of what's
going on but as you practice more mindfulness you learn
that oh no actually I'm not near as aware as
I thought I was sensory clarity imagine if you had
a lens on a really professional-grade digital camera you bought
an expensive multi-thousand dollar lens really beautiful perfect optics well
engineered but then it got some mud and some stains
on the lens and it's like it's really dirty really
muddy and now you're trying to take photographs through this
dirty cloudy lens how good is the picture going to
be it's not going to be very clear right but
imagine you don't really understand that there is dirt on
the lens you're not aware of this you think that
that's the way the lens is supposed to be well
you're going to go through life looking at life and
thinking that you have a clear picture of life but
actually you can have a murky picture a muddy picture
and unclear picture of life so this component here is
also a skill that can be developed called sensory clarity
you can actually clear the lenses of your mind so
to speak so that you can experience what's actually occurring
for you right now in this very moment with orders
of magnitude of more clarity than you presently do and
the third and final component is equanimity equanimity is a
really powerful skill as well it's the ability to experience
an emotion or a sensation or any phenomena basically and
not be affected by it and not react to it
in an emotional way so usually what happens is we
get a piece of bad news like we're fired from
our job or we think that our boyfriend or girlfriend
is going to leave us or something like this and
it disturbs us emotionally that's a phenomenon that we receive
it's actually a sensation we receive we hear it or
we see it but that's not all what happens immediately
after that is that we go into reaction mode we're
not stable and grounded about that sensory experience but we're
all over the place right we get angry you get
frustrated get fearful we get jealous and so on and
so forth so equanimity is your ability to stay founded
and I see no matter what kind of emotions or
sensations are being experienced by you whether they're good what
they're bad it doesn't affect you at all so these
three components if you can develop all of them and
you're practicing all of them simultaneously then basically you're practicing
mindfulness and what's really powerful is that mindfulness imagine mindfulness
as you looking through a microscope now when you look
through a microscope with a very low magnification setting such
as two times magnification it's cool and you might see
some new stuff there in the lens but you don't
see that much cool new stuff but then you increase
the magnification to 10x and now all the sudden you
can see some more stuff you can see little particles
of dust and little hairs and stuff that you didn't
see before but now when you start to increase it
to 100x and a thousand X now you start to
see some really freaky things now you get to see
like bacteria and little organisms with hundred feet swimming around
it's like a whole new world that you're looking at
and if you take a microscope with a hundred thousand
times resolution and you take a look and you you
look at that um that world you go even past
the bacteria you can even go into like looking at
um at the structure of cells and even further down
it like the structure of molecules so the same thing
is basically possible with your mind and most people cannot
believe that such a thing is possible and it really
does become not just you becoming a little bit more
clear about reality it's like you see a whole new
world when you practice mindfulness for a sufficiently long period
of time you start to see a whole new world
out there even though nothing has really changed but because
your senses are now so much more attuned they're not
just five times more attuned or ten times no you
develop a thousand times or ten thousand times or a
hundred thousand times more mindfulness and that's when some really
powerful [ __ ] goes down but to get there
you need to learn how to start with the basics
so let's start you with the basics here's how you
actually practice mindfulness you do it in cycles these are
going to be 10 second cycles roughly here's how it's
going to work there's basically three main modes through which
you experience things we're going to call it seeing hearing
and feeling you can see with your eyes you can
hear with your ears you can feel with your body
so let's actually teach you the technique by actually having
you do it alright so here's what we're going to
do I want you to find an object somewhere around
you in this room that you're sitting in maybe a
lamp or a pen or a chair or maybe you're
looking out the window you can see a tree something
static that's not going to move and run away from
you right so go ahead and select an object a
lamp would be a good example that's what I'm going
to use here so look at that lamp and just
notice the fact that you are looking at some kind
of object it's a lamp in this case so just
the first thing you're going to do is you're going
to note it note note for noticing right you're going
to note and notice just something you do it just
takes a split second to do it in your mind
you just note the fact that oh yeah I'm looking
at an object so that's the first step the second
step is that you're going to label this thing that
you're looking at and the label is going to be
a silent label that you're going to say to yourself
in your internal dialogue and in this case the label
is going to be not lamp it's going to be
the label si si II as in you're seeing it
with your eye right we're going to be labeling based
on the channel that we're looking at it through or
that we're hearing it through so here's going to be
seeing so look at the lamp right now and just
in your internal dialogue give it a label see just
to register the fact that you're seeing it and your
Percy through your vision okay so do that right now
should just take you one second okay good and now
the final step in the cycle is you're going to
look at that lamp and you're going to savor it
you're going to take in the raw perceptions that are
there the colors the shape of the lamp you're going
to take that in exactly as it is right now
in the present moment and you're going to do that
for about five to seven seconds all right so before
I have you do this let me just clarify what
I mean we're not talking about whether you think the
lamp is beautiful or ugly that's a judgment we're not
talking about the story behind the lamp where did you
buy the lamb did you buy the lamp at IKEA
we don't care about that that's not what you're actually
seeing of the lamp right we're here we're only concerned
about what's actually literally right there and we're not concerned
about you know is the lamp working or not working
is it on or off it doesn't matter we just
care about what's actually right there in our vision okay
so when I say go you're going to look at
that lamp and you're just going to savor and take
in for five to seven seconds all the colors and
shapes of the lamp all right ready go okay good
very very basic so what you just did right there
is you completed one mindfulness cycle it's about a ten
second cycle first you note second you label and third
you just savor what's actually there that's it very very
simple now that was seeing we also have the channel
of hearing so let's do this again but now we're
going to do it with the hearing channel when you're
hearing a sound and I'm going to just generate a
sound for us here which is just going to be
a clap sound like this okay so when you hear
a sound you're going to again go through this 3-step
process you're going to note it label it and then
you're going to savor it now where the sounds a
little bit trickier because sounds often are not continuous and
long they don't stay they come and go real quickly
so in the case of this clap it's just a
maybe a quarter of a second that you hear it
so how do you savor a sound well if it's
a short little sound like a clap what you're going
to do is first you're just going to note the
fact that there was something there then you're going to
go and you're going to label it you're going to
say here H EA R that's the label here because
you're hearing it and then what you're going to do
is you're going to savor whatever memory there you have
usually you have a pretty good short-term memory so you'll
be able to remember what the sound sounded like for
a good five to ten seconds pretty easily right and
you just savor as best as you can whatever memory
of it you have ideally you would do this in
real time with a more continuous sound like let's say
you're listening to some birds chirping continuously or you're listening
to an air conditioning system humming and you've got a
continuous sound so you can practice with those those might
be a little easier for you but right now we're
going to do this with a clap alright so I'm
going to do this clap and you're going to do
the whole cycle you're going to note it you're going
to label it here and then you're going to savor
it for five to seven seconds and I'm going to
do this with you all right so ready on go
you can do this go okay good I did that
too so that was the hearing Channel and now let's
do the final third channel which is feeling feeling are
the sensations that are happening in your body there's a
lot of them right now that you're probably not even
conscious of for example let's take the feeling of either
your butt sitting on the seat that you're sitting on
or if you're standing then the pressure on your feet
so either the pressure on your butt or the pressure
on on your feet so let's take that as our
object and what we're going to do is we're going
to again we're going to notice it we're going to
put our attention to notice basically just means to put
your attention on that thing right because your attention could
be wandering all over the place so just put your
attention on the pressure on your feet or your butt
then you're going to label it you're going to label
it feel F EE L right because you're feeling this
so you're going to label it feel and then you're
going to take five to seven seconds to savor it
literally as it is I don't care if you like
the sensation or you don't like the sensation or if
it's painful or if it's beautiful or if it's Pleasant
or if you want to keep it or it you
want to lose it or whatever it doesn't matter your
judgments don't matter literally just what's there so I'm going
to give you five to seven seconds right now to
do this whole cycle and I'm going to do it
myself with my feet because I'm standing and I have
some pressure in my feet it's a little bit uncomfortable
all right ready go okay good so there we did
seeing hearing and feeling and what we also did here
what I want you to notice as I want to
introduce this distinction of outer and inner so what we
did is we focus on all the outer sensations outer
seeing outer hearing and outer feeling now let's contrast this
with the inner sensations you should notice that not only
can you see stuff on the outside in the physical
world so to speak but you can also see stuff
on the inside in your mind's eye or in your
imagination you can also hear stuff out in the physical
world that you can hear birds chirping that would be
an outer hearing or you can hear stuff on the
inside which would be basically the hearing of your internal
dialogue or for example if you have a tune playing
in your mind like some catchy radio song that would
you that would be you hearing internally and then finally
the last distinction is the the feeling right so you
can feel stuff and this is a little bit tricky
here it's a little bit counterintuitive what we're going to
call inner feeling is not what you probably think so
what we mean by outer feeling is basically all the
sensations in your body even the stuff that's like on
the inside like your heartbeat or an itch in your
body somewhere we're going to consider all of that outer
feeling what we mean by inner feeling is going to
be emotions so if you have an emotion coursing through
your body and emotions are quite distinct from something like
an itch or pressure on your feet or a you
know a pain in your back those are not emotions
by emotions what I mean are stuff like fear anger
sadness jealousy loneliness depression frustration it can also be positive
emotions like happiness excitement and so forth so when you
have that that that's what we're going to call inner
feeling and these are somewhat arbitrary distinctions right there's nothing
set in stone here these are not like distinctions handed
down to us from God we just created these distinctions
ourselves just this is like a system this is a
system we created to help our mind become more aware
of what's actually happening in reality so one thing you
should have already started to notice as you were doing
these three cycles with seeing hearing and feeling what you
probably notice that your mind now is getting a little
bit more attuned because you're forcing it to focus on
a specific sensation and then you're forcing yourself to actually
savor the raw data that's there for you independent of
your judgments about it which is very different than the
way that you normally run through life normally the way
you run through life is you are running around judging
stuff and thinking about stuff and you're probably ignoring what's
literally right there under your nose so already you're probably
noticing that your awareness is expanding you're becoming more attune
to the present moment and - what's literally there right
in front of you and this is all that mindfulness
is designed to do it might seem very simple and
basic and innocent and you might wonder like well leo
I mean this is so obvious and you're telling me
that if I do this for long enough period of
time that somehow I'm going to get these really positive
powerful personal development benefits and yes you will and I'm
going to talk a little bit more about that later
but for now just kind of trust me on it
that you will what's going to happen is you're gonna
create a snowball effect as you practice this mindfulness more
and more and more you're going to get better and
better and better at it and then you will have
some extraordinary shifts in awareness and in consciousness so right
now let's have you practice on the inner channels so
let's start with inner seeing what I want you to
do is I want you to imagine a big juicy
red apple in your mind's eye just imagine it now
keep that image in your mind big juicy red apple
and now we're going to run a cycle on it
all right so you're going to note it you're going
to label it see and then you're going to savor
it for five to seven seconds whatever is there don't
worry if you don't have a perfect photographic image of
an apple nobody does the image is going to be
kind of faint and murky whatever you've got of it
is exactly what it is all right so just do
this the best you can I'm going to do it
- ready go okay good so already I was noticing
just even in the middle of that exercise I was
noticing myself becoming more conscious becoming more aware okay good
now let's do a cycle on inner hearing what I
want you to do for this exercise is I want
you to say a short phrase to yourself in your
internal dialogue and your phrase will be let's say I
have to do the laundry that's your phrase I have
to do the laundry so what you're going to do
is you're going to repeat that phrase several times in
your mind as you're doing the psyche one cycle right
so you're just going to say in your mind silently
I have to do the laundry I have to do
the laundry I have to do the laundry and just
notice it label it here har here because you're hearing
it and then just savor that whatever it is however
it sounds in your mind savor it for five to
seven seconds alright I'm going to do it - ready
go okay good so that was inner hearing and finally
let's do inner feeling now inner feelings a little tricky
because remember we're talking about emotions and right now if
you're sitting here just listening to me you're probably relaxed
and you probably don't have a lot of emotions coursing
through your body but nevertheless there's some kind of emotional
baseline that you're at even if you're just in a
rest restful state you might just label that emotion as
a restful so what we're going to have you do
is we're going to have you just look inside your
body in a second here and look for any emotions
that are there fear anger sadness happiness joy exhilaration restful
state any of that you look for whatever is there
emotionally and you just notice it you label it you're
going to label it feel because you're feeling it and
then you're going to savor whatever it is for five
to seven seconds and I'm going to do this too
alright ready go okay good I actually noticed a little
bit of a little bit of kind of nervousness feeling
I guess because I'm shooting this live right now and
I want to make a good recording so probably a
little bit of nervousness in my body and so I
just became more aware of that by stopping and actually
noticing it and I wasn't really aware of it until
I stopped okay good so there you have it that's
basically the whole mindfulness system that you need to know
right now this right here this much theory will get
you 80% of all your results right there's really six
things you need to worry about outer seeing inner seeing
outer hearing inner hearing and outer feeling inner feeling you
might wonder about for example smell and taste what about
those actually we're going to call those outer feelings as
well so just just to make a really simple system
if you're being mindful of something that you're tasting or
smelling we're going to call that feel and we're going
to label it feel and really we're only using three
labels here when you're labeling you're not going to be
concerned about whether it's outer or inner the labels are
just going to be those basic three all right so
that's it now you might wonder how do you actually
use this to practice mindfulness how do you set up
a mindfulness practice so here it is basically what you're
going to do is going to get timer set it
for 20 minutes every single day you're going to sit
down in a quiet place and you're going to calm
your mind down for a minute and then what you're
going to do is you're going to start running these
cycles and you're going to let your mind just kind
of focus on whatever it wants to focus on could
be a sight could be a sound could be a
thought it could be an image could be a feeling
could be an emotion whatever's going on for you whatever's
most salient to you you're going to let your mind
focus on it then you're going to notice it you're
going to note it you're going to label it and
you're going to savor it for five to seven seconds
the whole cycle should take you about ten seconds right
and then you're going to finish that one cycle and
then what will happen is your mind will wander off
on to some other phenomena and then you're going to
do another ten second cycle and then another ten second
cycle and so on and so forth for the entire
20 minutes if your mind starts to wander away and
totally get lost in stories just bring it right back
get back on track and just note label and then
savor for five to seven seconds that's it that's your
entire practice now what you could do if you want
to get little more advanced is you can limit the
range of what you will let your mind focus on
so for example the most basic practice that you allow
the range to be everything it could be sights and
sounds and feelings outside or inside but then as you
get a little bit more advanced you can limit to
for example just sights or just sounds or just feelings
or just the inner or just the outer or both
the inner sounds and the outer sounds or just thoughts
and thoughts are inner sounds plus inner images so you
can kind of play around with the range and you
can limit those on certain days you might just want
to do sounds on other days you might just want
to do some sights and so on but I really
like the one where you just allow everything because then
you can just kind of let your mind loose and
just see where it goes and wherever it takes you
and there's nothing that you can do really wrong so
those are the really fundamental basics now let me give
you a couple of pointers and answer some commonly asked
questions about this so what will happen to you as
you start doing this mindfulness is that two phenomena will
come up simultaneously in fact you could have five phenomena
come up simultaneously right you might be sitting there and
you notice that there's an itch in your foot and
also a sound in your mind like the word itch
in your mind and also in h and your foot
so which phenomena do you focus on which one do
you run the cycle on and the answer is that
basically for the very starter very basic mindfulness practice you
just select any one you want usually what most salient
and drawing the most of your attention just focus on
that so if the itch is really itching focus on
the itch in your foot or if if the word
itch in your mind is the thing that's really prominent
focus on that so you just focus on one the
next question that people might ask is what happens if
I'm observing a phenomenon and I'm trying to run the
cycle within the phenomenon disappears so for example there's a
bird chirping outside and I'm listening to this bird I'm
trying to savor the sound of the bird but then
the bird stops what do I do well you just
notice that it stopped and you can also just savor
the memory of it that you have it's pretty good
to notice this thing's stopped and at the end in
fact you can use a special label for that and
the label for that could be gone so you're listening
to a sound and then Alton poof it's gone okay
cool it's gone note it is being gone actually you
can savor the gone Ness of it the fact that
the chirping stopped you can actually be mindful of it
I like oh it's actually gone I'm aware that is
gone oh that's cool and you just savor that for
five seconds and then you move on to the next
thing pretty simple the next question that people have is
what happens if the phenomena changes so for example let's
say that I'm I'm feeling some emotion in my stomach
and then as I'm trying to savor it and really
focus on I'd be mindful of it it morphs from
a from a sharp kind of a pain to like
kind of a numbness or kind of a warm tingly
sensation what do I do well just stay with it
and notice what happens to it so it's true that
we're not taking static snapshots of life here life is
a fluid dynamic thing and things are always flowing this
especially is obvious when you're focusing on your thoughts or
if you're focusing on sounds or if you're focusing on
body sensations those tend to flow and morph and change
that okay so whatever you focused on to start with
whatever it morphs into just stay with it and just
observe the fact that oh yeah I did change that's
kind of cool I'm aware of the fact that it
morphed and changed no problem another common problem that you'll
run into when you first start is you'll put your
focus on something let's say some kind of vague sensation
your body or maybe an image in your mind or
a thought in your mind and then you'll wonder like
well what is that I don't really know what that
is like I have some kind of weird tingly sensation
in my chest I don't really know is that my
heart or is that fear what is that I don't
really know what it is that's okay a lot of
stuff at first when you start you're not really going
to be sure of so you're allowed to guess and
you don't need to be a hundred percent accurate with
your labeling and it's even okay if you miss categorize
something for example if you have some kind of feeling
in your chest and you're not sure if it's fear
or if it's just a physical pain um just go
with your best guess and what will happen is that
over time as you practice mindfulness for weeks at a
time you will get better and better and then you
will not have these doubts anymore another question is what
happens if the phenomena comes up too fast for example
let's say we're listening to a machine gun firing and
it's just like a rapid fire like right so there's
a lot of little individual sounds of each bullet firing
but they're happening really really fast so what do I
do in this case well one thing you can do
is you can just average them out as they're happening
if they're happening continuously you can just kind of average
them out and just focus on the average what was
happening there the other thing you can do is you
can just take the you can just take the memory
of it that you have so let's say it's firing
and then it stops you can just take that last
shot and just recall that and savor it and be
mindful that another common concern you'll probably have if you
sit there labeling a lot is you'll start to notice
that labeling itself is an inner hearing sensation because you're
using your internal dialogue to say hear see feel and
so on so when you notice this the question is
should you then label the labels themselves and the answer
is no the labeling and the savoring this is a
tool that you're using to become more aware right we
don't want to go all crazy complicated and start analyzing
the tool and start being mindful of the tool and
mindful of the mindful the tool and mindful of the
mindful of the mindful of the tool we don't need
to go there right just keep it very simple put
all your attention on everything but the labels and everything
but the process that you're using so it's okay you're
going to have plenty of stuff to be mindful of
without being mindful of the labels themselves so those are
the most common concerns now what I really encourage you
to do as a tip this is a tip here
really important is to do this practice daily 20 minutes
is recommended every single day and if you want to
get better faster then you can increase to 60 minutes
or maybe 30 minutes 40 minutes then get this up
to 60 minutes per day do it daily without any
excuses without skipping any days ever without skipping weekends without
vacations without holidays because these are all going to be
excuses that will ruin your practice so you'll want to
start very consistently with no excuses it really takes time
and momentum to build up a solid mindfulness practice you're
not going to do it in just one week this
is really a practice that you do over the course
of months and years might sound kind of like a
bore like another thing you have to do but trust
me it's really going to be worth it it's real
gonna be worth it for you and one thing that
I recommend if you really want to supercharge your mindfulness
is take a mindfulness retreat really common ones the really
great ones are called the posture retreats the positive meditation
retreats there's a lot of them you can take them
for free some of them are paid but a lot
of them are free they're basically held all over the
world in every country so you can look them up
online or wherever and take one of these retreats these
retreats are powerful because whatever treat is usually is just
5 or 7 or 10 days of complete silence these
are silent retreats there's no talking and you basically just
spend 12 hours a day practicing mindfulness day after day
after day after day and what this does is this
gets you a lot of progress really really quickly so
the progress that you will make in one year of
20 minutes every day you can probably get that much
progress in a single week at a retreat and the
ideals that you do both you should have a mindfulness
practice outside of retreats daily and then of course you
should take one or two retreats per year to really
supercharge yourself and learn more advanced techniques what I taught
you here is a very basic form of mindfulness it's
very powerful it can take you very very far you
don't need the fancy stuff but there's also more fancy
elements that you can go learn at these retreats and
the last thing I'll say about my tips here is
that you might have an objection or question like well
Leo you've you released a lot of videos about different
meditation techniques you've talked about letting thoughts go you've talked
about the do-nothing technique you've talked about strong determination sitting
right just sit there motionless with all these techniques and
out and now you're talking about this mindfulness technique where
I'm labeling stuff very rigorously so which technique should I
use which is like the best technique and my answer
here is that there is no best technique all of
these techniques are good all these techniques in fact are
great techniques very powerful techniques and I think you should
experiment with them if you are a student of raising
your consciousness and you really want to self-actualize what I
recommend you do for the long run is test out
each of these techniques test it out for a month
test it out for three months just see which ones
you like which ones you don't like you're probably gonna
have favorites but also don't worry too much because even
the ones that are not favorites of yours they're still
very powerful and very effective there's no like best technique
alright so don't get caught in that trap alright so
that's it you know how to do the practice the
hardest thing now is are you actually going to do
it it's so simple is so stupidly simple that most
people fail right here they know now how it works
but then they don't actually set up and discipline themselves
to create the habit they need to do on a
daily basis you need to develop this habit like I
said at the very beginning this is probably the most
important skill you can develop as a human being because
this is how you interface with reality can you understand
this that this is the interface between you and reality
is your senses if you're not mindful of what you're
perceiving you're basically not mindful of reality and you're living
in some fantasy land you're living in story land you're
living in your imagination you need to start to understand
and to see reality for what it literally is not
what your parents told you about it not what your
preacher told you about it not what you read in
a book not what some scientists told you but what's
actually happening right [ __ ] now in your experience
you need to get the skill to see that and
you need to improve and cultivate this skill over your
entire lifetime this is really not an optional thing if
you want to have a powerful life in fact what
I want to end on is I want to tell
you some of the really powerful benefits you'll get if
you discipline yourself to create this habit of mindfulness here
the benefits you can get you're going to build enormous
levels of awareness and focus and consciousness if you build
this a bit of just 20 minutes a day enormous
levels I'm talking about a thousand times or ten thousand
times more awareness than the average person has this is
why people meditate this is why meditation is so powerful
is because it's like going for a microscope that has
a 2x magnification lens to a microscope that has a
hundred thousand times magnification lens it really is that big
of a deal but it's going to take some time
to get to that hundred thousand times magnification so you
need to stay disciplined but the benefit to you of
this kind of awareness and focus is going to be
that for example in your work projects in your creative
endeavors you're going to be able to sit down and
just focus for an hour straight no problems without distractions
imagine how much more powerful more productive you're going to
be if you can do that or if you're listening
to your kids or you're listening to your spouse imagine
being able to fully listen to them be fully present
and not be stuck in your own head it's a
powerful thing you're also going to develop emotional mastery this
is perhaps the most important benefit of mindfulness practice all
those nasty emotions that you suffer from that you don't
know how to control and fix for example anger fear
depression loneliness anxiety frustration annoyance road rage all this stuff
that you experienced all this nasty stuff all of this
will melt away when you develop sufficiently high levels of
mindfulness it'll just naturally and effortlessly melt away because you're
going to see it for what it literally is and
you're not going to get trapped in the emotional vortexes
that are created by the mind very important you can
also use mindfulness to reduce suffering stuff like chronic pain
back pain as you age you had her going to
have all sorts of pains in your body if you
have medical medical conditions if you ever need to go
in for for really severe and serious conditions like a
cancer or a surgery and you have to be recouped
operating from all that or physical injuries right all the
suffering you experience even the most sharp forms of physical
pain that you would think you can't do anything about
because they're just physical right wrong you can dissolve them
all away with sufficient degrees of mindfulness it's a very
powerful thing you can basically take the sting out of
the most excruciating pains with sufficient mindfulness practice mindful is
also powerful for increasing your fulfillment in life so not
only can you reduce suffering but you can increase fulfillment
the more mindful you are the more fulfilment you can
get from your food from your sex from your success
in business from your interactions with people from your holiday
parties from everything that you enjoy about life life is
not just about getting these things and feeling happy there's
degrees of happiness imagine that you could sit down and
eat a meal and experience a hundred times more pleasure
from that meal than you normally would because now your
mind is attuned very finely honed to see and feel
and taste and smell every little morsel of that food
that's what's possible and not just with food but with
every aspect of life even when you're just standing in
line the grocery store waiting to pay your bill you
can experience uh feelings of rapture and joy and bliss
just by being sufficiently mindful and you don't have to
be bored out of your mind like you usually are
also what you can do with mindfulness is you can
do behavior change so all those bad habits you have
like biting your nails and what else smoking drinking /
eating all these neurotic bad behaviors that you have you
want to change all these behaviors well mindfulness will help
you with all of that these behaviors basically happen because
you're running away from reality as soon as you're able
to resolve reality for what it really is a lot
of these behaviors will change effortlessly automatically for you just
by putting your focus and attention on them pretty cool
the other thing you can do is you can experience
enlightenment and you can discover the real existential nature of
who and what you are and what life and what
reality is through mindfulness so what you can do is
if you take your mind from the skills that you've
developed that thousand x magnification lens and if you focus
that lens on the label I as in I or
you the way you call yourself in your mind right
I call myself I I think of myself as I
I think of myself as this being called me leo
but if what I do is I develop enough mindfulness
and I shine that mindfulness that awareness on the label
I what will happens that label will dissolve and I
will see what I really is and you can see
that and don't underestimate how profound of a vision and
an insight that will be if you ever experience I
for what it really is is going to blow you
away it's going to knock your socks off it'll change
your entire perspective on life it's that powerful that's called
enlightenment that's called existential nature that's called who and what
you really are that's called truth and you can access
that after years and years and years of mindfulness practice
so that's kind of like the ultimate level 2 where
you can take this so some really cool stuff I
hope this encourages you and creates the motivation in you
to set up this habit because now you have it
all now you know how to do it go ahead
