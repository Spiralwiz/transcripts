            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/jo_3rvcUpJw' target='_blank'>A Vision For The Self Actualized Life - Get Yo Ass Inspired!</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Self-Actualized Life Vision</b>: Leo shares a vision of a self-actualized life, emphasizing the fulfilling experiences he had in 2015. He details his retreats, work freedom, income, influential work, and immense personal growth, all underlining his fortune at this level of self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Spiritual & Personal Development</b>: Leo tells the story of a transformative journey of a young apprentice he met at the retreat. This individual used to spend extensive time playing video games but started pursuing writing after attending the retreat and being exposed to self-improvement concepts.
</li><li><b>Ignorance Exhibit on Self-Improvement</b>: Leo was astonished at how the apprentice, like many ordinary people, was initially unaware of self-improvement and personal development. The apprentice's reaction highlighted the fact that many people are unaware of, and astounded by, the possibilities of self-improvement.
</li><li><b>Influence of Negative Environment & Pop Culture</b>: Many people lack awareness of self-improvement due to the influence of a negative environment or an unproductive pop culture, which, according to Leo, hinders individuals from living creative and fulfilled lives.
</li><li><b>Self-Actualization</b> - Leading to Radical Changes: Leo lays emphasis on self-improvement. Ranging not just mildly, but exponentially, self-improvement can lead to radical changes, complete life-alterations and total rebuilding of oneself.
</li><li><b>Definition of Self-Actualization Inspired by Abraham Maslow</b>: Leo draws inspiration from Abraham Maslow's concept of self-actualization, defining it as the realization of one's potentials, fulfillment of one's mission, getting in touch with one's authentic self, and becoming a whole human being.
</li><li><b>The Types of Pleasure</b>: Leo outlines two forms of pleasure identified by Abraham Maslow - scarcity pleasure and abundance pleasure. Scarcity pleasure is the relief experienced when tension, fear, anxiety, and pain are lessened. Abundance pleasure, on the other hand, is about the ecstasy of functioning at one's prime and living an excellent virtuous life.
</li><li><b>Living to your Potential</b>: Leo argues that many people settle for comfort and security, and while these are important initial goals, they should not be the vision for one's life. Self-actualization, functioning at the peak of human capability, should be the ultimate goal. He emphasizes that goal-setting should aim for the height of what a human being can be and should be a lifelong commitment to self-actualization.
</li><li><b>Understanding Self-Actualization</b>: Self-actualization involves turning your work into your top passion and becoming creatively driven in all aspects of life, including career, wealth, health, and relationships. It's about making meaningful contributions to the world, becoming a leader, and inspiring others. It involves shedding negative emotions such as guilt, shame, and anger.
</li><li><b>Emotional Mastery</b>: Leo encourages listeners to work on achieving emotional mastery to avoid negative feelings, believing that much of society's negativity is due to toxic, normalized habits. He argues that self-actualization can help individuals develop strong confidence, self-acceptance and overcome these toxic habits.
</li><li><b>Achieving Happiness and Success</b>: Leo urges listeners to commit to lifelong learning and self-improvement to excel in various areas of life such as career, wealth, health, family, and relationships. He highlights that this kind of growth requires effort and commitment, not just the removal of problems but excelling and deriving bliss in all life's major domains.
</li><li><b>Importance of Self-Improvement</b>: Leo suggests that individuals invest in self-improvement, exploring different areas in which they can grow, and encourages taking responsibility for one's happiness and success. He underscores the importance of creating a vision for personal fulfillment and success and committing to the journey of realizing it.
</li><li><b>Influence of systematic effort in mastering life areas</b>: Leo Gura stresses the importance of systematically mastering various facets of life, including career, wealth, health, self-esteem, and intimate relationships. By making use of resources, coaching, and gaining knowledge from experts, individuals can significantly enhance their lives. The success of this commitment isn't uncertain, but a certainty if one gives their all daily.
</li><li><b>Significance of setting kick-ass goals and having a larger life vision</b>: Gura emphasizes the need for more ambitious, high consciousness goals that allow individuals to aim bigger and go beyond the ordinary. Setting such goals can inspire and motivate one to undertake the work of self-actualization and personal development.
</li><li><b>Value of having a life free from money worries and pursuing joy and service</b>: Leo suggests the possibility of creating a life where one does not worry about money and instead focuses on doing work that brings joy and carries a meaningful service. He suggests that work should be more like play, offering satisfaction.
</li><li><b>Emotional control and stoic ideal</b>: Gura points out the possibility of developing full emotional control, thereby overcoming depression, anger, fear, and other negative emotional states. This development can lead to becoming a grounded, emotionally imperturbable human being, similar to the stoic ideal of Marcus Aurelius.
</li><li><b>Understanding the world deeply and successful intimate relationships</b>: It is possible to have a profound understanding of the world, bringing a sense of belonging and satisfaction. Gura also mentions that achieving a successful, fulfilling intimate relationship, although rare, is a potent goal.
</li><li><b>Potential of sex for enlightenment and self-improvement</b>: Leo points out the potential of sex, which if treated maturely and studied, can be a high consciousness value. Sex could be used for enlightenment and lead to multiple orgasms, deep intimacy, dominant sex, and more.
</li><li><b>The value of self-love, physical vitality, and rich friendships</b>: The importance of accepting oneself, flaws included, and cultivating self-love is highlighted by Leo. Physical vitality and high energy levels are also proposed as key life goals, which can lead to energetic days and better sexual experiences. Having rich and inspiring friendships that support and challenge one's personal growth is another crucial life goal.
</li><li><b>Impactful leadership and creative contribution to humanity</b>: Becoming a leader and role model for others, inspiring them through one's lifestyle and achievements, is a meaningful goal. Creative contributions to humanity through inventions, art, or scientific discoveries can also bring fulfillment to life.
</li><li><b>Breaking free from the rat race and living a life of integrity</b>: Breaking free from the rat race, limiting screen time, and living a life focused on principles and integrity is advocated. Such a way of life could lead to deep gratitude and pride, acknowledging the privileges and opportunities one has had.
</li><li><b>Achieving enlightenment and understanding existential reality</b>: Leo points out that attaining enlightenment and understanding existential reality can be a transformative goal. This would involve understanding life's and death's nature.
</li><li><b>Offering time for contemplation and a regret-free death</b>: Setting aside time to appreciate the beauty of life and simply reflect is suggested as a crucial life goal. On a larger scale, the ultimate goal is to face death without fear or regrets, knowing that one has lived their life to the fullest.
</li><li><b>Self-actualization and its practicality</b>: Leo delves into the concept of self-actualization, pointing out its practicality and achievability, contrary to being just wishful thinking or a pipe dream. He stresses that self-actualization is more than mere success or wealth; it involves the transformation of oneÂ’s core being accompanied by fulfillment and gratitude. 
</li><li><b>Importance of personal and emotional growth</b>: Emphasis is put on personal and emotional growth with respect to self-actualization. Leo acknowledges that richness and success, without personal growth and emotional maturity, do not necessarily contribute to the self-actualization process.  
</li><li><b>Experience of fulfillment</b>: Although happiness is transient, Leo highlights the experience of fulfillment, especially when embarked on a self-actualized journey. This fulfillment generates a sense of having life handled and appreciating the beauty of life, even during times of unhappiness. 
</li><li><b>Effects of self-actualization</b>: Upon reflecting on his quality of life and its trajectory, the sense of accomplishment and impact on others, Leo acknowledges feeling profound gratitude. He sees being human as a unique privilege and potential, capable of transcending the limitations and dysfunctions inherent in humanity to reach a state of higher consciousness.
</li><li><b>Importance of knowledge on the self-actualization journey</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of acquiring accurate, high-quality information, which necessitates a commitment to lifelong learning. He recommends reading, engaging in thoughtful discussions, attending seminars, note-taking, and journaling as part of this process.
</li><li><b>Investing in Learning</b>: Leo Gura recommends investing 10% of your income annually towards self-improvement and learning resources such as books, seminars, self-help products, therapy, and coaching.
</li><li><b>Making Small Changes in Life</b>: He advises listeners to start making small changes in their lives right away, instead of waiting for major life transitions. This includes eliminating toxic habits and establishing good, healthy habits. For instance building a strong, positive morning routine and incorporating practices like meditation.
</li><li><b>Mastering Emotions</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of addressing emotional issues, particularly negative emotions like low self-esteem, anger, fear and negativity. Finding solutions through reading books or attending seminars can help manage these issues.
</li><li><b>Finding Your Life Purpose</b>: According to Leo, discovering one's authentic self and identifying a core life purpose is a crucial step towards self-actualization. His Ultimate Life Purpose Course is specifically designed to help individuals articulate their life mission.
</li><li><b>Financial Independence</b>: The last step he discusses involves achieving financial independence. By liberating oneself from financial insecurity and the constraints of a 9-to-5 job, one can gain confidence, freedom, and the capacity to engage deeply in self-actualization work and fully enjoy life.
</li><li><b>Planning for Self Actualization</b>: Leo provides an outline of these steps emphasizing that planning and thinking ahead regarding life purpose and financial independence is essential. He also emphasizes that these goals will take time to accomplish and encourages listeners to start regardless of their current age.
</li><li><b>Role of Actualized.org</b>: He wraps up by highlighting the role of his organization, Actualized.org, as a resource for motivation, inspiration, and guidance to stay on track towards self-actualization. A weekly commitment to watching one video offered by the organization can assist in maintaining focus on the journey of self-actualization.
