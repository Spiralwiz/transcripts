[Music] you I want to bring to your awareness this
profound theme that I stumbled upon over the last year
and this is a theme that I see all across
personal development and really all across life many different domains
of life will fall under this theme some of the
most interesting questions and topics in life will tend to
go full circle now what exactly I mean by full
circle I'll explain here in a minute but what I
don't mean is I don't mean a strange loop so
don't confuse this topic with the strange loop topic which
I talked about recently in my mind these are two
separate things although maybe there's sometimes a little bit of
overlap here and there but generally I consider them different
so there's two meanings really in my mind for going
full circle the first meaning is the more conventional one
and the one that we're really not interested in here
and then there's a second meaning so the first meaning
is something like the hero's journey where a hero starts
off at an origin point like his little village then
he goes off into the woods he goes off to
a new town a new territory he fights monsters and
guardians and and Dragons and he conquers the dragon in
a faraway land and then eventually he makes his way
back to his original little village and sort of comes
full circle and there's a lot of examples like this
many people's lives like that can go full circle like
maybe you grew up in little town rural area of
the country and then you become a big-shot businessman and
you travel all around the world and you do all
this big stuff and then eventually you come back to
the same little town and that's where you retire and
ultimately die that's a nice little neat way to wrap
up your life puts a bow on things that's why
it's a it's a common trope in in movies and
in stories and books but that's not what I mean
by going full circle what I mean is something a
little bit more interesting and paradoxical the second meaning of
full circle is if you imagine a spectrum and on
this spectrum you have two polar opposites let's just use
black and white the colors and then you have all
the shades of gray in between usually what we assume
is that the way the spectrum works said it's kind
of linear like you can go from black to gray
to white and get to pure white and then there's
like a a wall that you hit there at pure
white you can't get whiter than pure white and you're
certainly not gonna get black by going further down that
road and the same thing by going in this direction
towards the black you're not gonna get blacker than pure
black and what I mean by going full circle is
that actually you can so imagine if we take this
spectrum and we connect the ends such that gray is
the top white is down here and black is down
here right next to each other basically at the exact
same point and then everything in between here is is
a gradient such that if you start at pure black
you go all the way around to the top of
gray and then you come back down towards pure white
and you go further you're gonna go full circle from
pure white to pure black and that's a really interesting
dynamic because if that's possible and I'm not saying this
is possible everywhere I'm saying there are instances where in
life you tend to find this that's a big shift
you see there's an inflection point there it's almost this
gigantic discontinuous jump because here you are you're just moving
through shades of gray on both sides but going from
pure black to pure white Wow that tends to be
a mindfuck that tends to be unexpected and that tends
to be a big gear shift in your life so
it's worth thinking about where these kinds of situation my
situations might lurk in life so let me give you
some frivolous examples of this some cute ones that I
thought of so what I mean when I say going
full circle is the following for example a work of
art that is so bad it's good a joke that's
so unfunny it becomes funny a life that's so easy
it's hard allies so bold everyone believes it a plan
so crazy it just might work a pain so great
it actually becomes enjoyable a war so devastating that it
brings lasting peace a truth so strange it's easier to
tell a lie than that truth a person so well
educated he's stupid getting so much rest that it actually
makes you sick a fact that's so obvious it goes
unnoticed a strategy so crafty it looks foolish an insight
so simple only a genius could have it a letter
so concise it took days to write a guy who's
such a jerk you can't help but love him that
one's for the ladies you know what I'm talking about
or how about this one someone you disagree with so
much that you can't stop listening to him that might
be true of some crazy right-wing radio show host how
about a prohibition that's so strict it makes you want
to break it like if you tell a child whatever
you do never look inside that box never look in
there of course he's gonna want to look in there
how about this example a man so masculine he's not
afraid to look feminine a motivation so strong it's paralyzing
or this one if you've ever been in the in
a serious car accident you have so little time to
think that time stands still and you have all the
time in the world a situation so tragic it's comical
an incidents so unremarkable it's remarkable a plant so soft
it never breaks a man acting so ordinary he arouses
suspicion a star so massive it collapses into a black
hole a loss so significant you stop caring so those
would be some cute cheeky examples that I thought of
these aren't the the real bulk of the examples that
I want to share with you which I've been collecting
over the last year at first it started off with
just a few examples but then I was using this
sort of lens this filter to look at this theme
of going full circle and out I was looking at
all the stuff I was studying in different fields and
I just started to see it popping up again and
again and again all this stuff keeps coming full circle
and some of the most profound stuff works this way
it's quite amazing it's rather paradoxical it seems like reality
is able to invert itself to flip itself inside out
in counterintuitive ways and of course as you've heard me
talking about a lot in Prior episodes this theme of
counterintuitive nough salsa tends to be a very significant theme
within all of personal development and a lot of people
get themselves cornered in life because they do the intuitive
thing and not the counterintuitive thing and a lot of
success in business in dating in spirituality in personal development
in all this sort of stuff depends upon you seeing
the counterintuitive move and being able to make it so
what I hope is that by pointing out these themes
to you you then develop the filter to see and
find your own examples and then make the interconnections and
then you become much better at predicting how life really
works and then of course you can more easily design
the kind of life that you want so that's the
ultimate goal with talking about this stuff so let's move
on to my list of examples I have a lot
of them I have dozens of them but perhaps the
most prototypical of all the one that epitomizes this entire
theme of going full circle in atheism versus theism and
a long time ago maybe a year ago or so
on my blog actually posted a post about this I
drew a diagram and it was a circle and what
it showed it showed atheism and theism as two poles
on the spectrum but then it loops back around and
what the atheist and the theists do not understand is
that really one flips into the other and that they
are not as opposite as it would seem see the
atheist thinks that there is no God the theist thinks
there is a God and they think that nothing could
be more opposite than that but actually they're both half
right and they're both half wrong and both of them
end up getting mind [ __ ] because of this
um coming a full circle that happens so the atheist
believes there is no God mmm but what the atheist
doesn't understand is if you take atheism all the way
past past that inflection point then what you discover is
that there is a God but that God is nothingness
now the atheists will say well Leo that's already what
I believe in thought I what's the difference between believing
there is no God versus saying God is nothing this
isn't that the same thing no not at all they're
actually almost opposite now the theist will say wait a
minute leo but what are you saying here so there
is a God so then I'm right as the theist
no actually as a theist you're wrong because see the
theist believes that there is a God but the theist
has silly notions of what the God is believes the
God is some kind of form thing well the theist
doesn't want to accept is that God is nothing because
to the theist to accept that God is nothing well
that would be no different than atheism and of course
the theist is not an atheist he doesn't like a
theism he's opposed to that so of course there must
be a God and God could be anything but he
can't be nothing see but the to actually go full
circle when you become Sophia sztyc that you they have
direct experience of God you will realize God is nothing
and that will be a huge mindfuck for you on
the other hand if you're atheist and you become even
more atheistic and you have a direct experience of nothingness
true nothingness not your ideas of nothingness not your beliefs
and no god that's not nothingness actual nothingness you will
discover that that's actually God and that there's a good
reason why it's called God and not nothingness although both
names are appropriate they highlight different facets of the same
thing and this has actually been a real problem for
both atheists and theists for theists it's a problem because
actually there's a there's examples of Christian mystics who lived
in monasteries and they were just monks before they were
mystics before they became enlightened before they experienced God and
so they just had a bunch of Catholic beliefs let's
say about God and then they go pray and they
do all their meditation and prayer like practices there they
live an ascetic lifestyle they're very hardcore about how they
live they closer themselves and eventually through this practice because
it's almost like they're meditating so much that they break
through to a direct experience of God but they discover
that there's nothing there it's completely nothing it's completely blank
is completely empty reality's groundless God is completely groundless that's
what God is but to them this is such a
horror a shock because what Christianity has taught them is
that God is the opposite of that see so this
doesn't make sense to them they don't see how God
could flip back around into nothingness and likewise for the
atheist if the atheist ever has a direct experience of
what we're calling God here not a man in the
sky but God the real deal which is possible to
have for example if you take 30 milligrams of 5
Meo DMT you'll have this experience and if you're an
atheist what'll happen to you is a very similar thing
that happened to me is that you will flip back
around and go past the inflection point but from the
other end that the Christian mystics do see so you
will experience the nothingness but the nothingness will be so
full and so infinite and so godlike not as a
man in the sky with a beard but so godlike
in other qualities like in the quality of infinite love
and the quality of consciousness and infinite intelligence in the
quality of being eternal of being sentient and all these
other interesting qualities that you would not think consciousness or
nothingness or could have and then you realize that all
your atheism was just nonsense so you can have this
experience so this would be the perfect example of what
I mean by things going full circle another really good
example is hedonism versus asceticism so the hedonist thinks of
himself as on the opposite end of the spectrum from
the ascetic I mean after all what two people could
be more further apart the hedonist is chasing sex food
travel fast cars and and and hot girls and strip
clubs and parties and drugs and alcohol and and all
this sort of stuff and the ascetic is the exact
opposite the ascetic locks himself into a cave for a
decade or more and just lives by himself doesn't have
any friends doesn't do anything isn't doesn't shop doesn't buy
anything doesn't have sex takes these strict vows doesn't eat
any fancy food and it would seem like to the
hedonist that's terrible way to live life because after all
you've only got this moment we should live up this
moment and make the most of it to be as
happy as possible cuz that's the ultimate end of life
is to be happy right there's no afterlife knowing that
Nelson it's just let's live for the moment and be
as happy as possible but what is the hedonist discover
if he does that he actually discovers that if he
follows through on that strategy he ends up being the
most miserable person in the world he gets depressed he
gets lonely he's never satisfied every single thing that he
does never satisfies him the best food the hottest sex
the the most expensive cars they all just feel empty
in the end and so eventually he he goes through
a lot of suffering and he ends up being one
of the most miserable people in the world what happens
to the aesthetic it would seem like the aesthetic maybe
he is even in a worse situation because he's locked
himself in a cave actually meanwhile what happens with the
aesthetic is that he becomes so introverted and so self-conscious
of his true nature and of the nature of reality
that he passes the inflection point and actually he experiences
the greatest joy humanly possible in fact the joy that
the ascetic experiences just by sitting and doing nothing is
greater than the joy that a hedonist experiences if he
is shooting up heroin or having the hottest sex or
eating the bestest food or driving the coolest car those
speak experiences for the hedonist are little blips on the
radar screen of happiness for the aesthetic the aesthetic nose
peaks of happiness that the hedonist couldn't dream of in
a million years but he has to go through that
inflection point of course he has to work for it
it doesn't happen automatically and so this is another example
of things going full circle it's very counterintuitive you see
because you might say that the hedonist strategy is actually
to pursue happiness no no no no no the hedonist
strategy really is to pursue misery he just calls it
happiness the ascetic strategy is to pursue happiness he will
actually get it but the problem is is that to
most people the ascetics strategy to pursue happiness even though
it's a real strategy and it will really actually work
to them it looks like a recipe for suffering and
so they never even bother to consider it for themselves
or take it seriously interesting how that works it's pretty
powerful to understand that it isn't it it certainly puts
a lot of stuff into perspective it shows you how
wrong people can be people could just have a strategy
that's a hundred percent the opposite of what they think
it is and they could waste years decades pursuing that
strategy and be wondering how come this isn't working well
of course because you don't understand this nonlinear dynamic within
reality how about this other example selfishness versus selflessness it's
rather similar to the previous example so selfish people assume
that the way that they become the happiest in life
the most secure is by being very selfish by being
very greedy so in their company they will acquire all
the resources they will make schemes they will manipulate to
get the best position to rise to the top to
become the CEO and one sort of CEO they try
to get as much money as they can the most
stock options all that sort of stuff or if they
get a position in government then they're gonna be corrupt
they're gonna take bribes you're gonna take as much money
as possible they're gonna line their own pockets as much
as they can after all who cares about selflessness I
mean by being selfless that's like a recipe for a
bad life if I'm selfless people gonna walk all over
me people are gonna abuse me there's no real joy
in that that's how the selfish person thinks but actually
turns out to be the exact opposite to be selfless
really truly selfless is the greatest joy that you can
experience in life and that's something that is very difficult
to appreciate for a selfish person almost impossible you have
to really experience it for yourself to see that your
life is so much more rewarding when you're not living
it for your own personal gain or for money or
for saktia for anything like that but that you're living
it to contribute to the world to just do good
for for goods sake to help people to love to
be creative to whatever in in the purposes of something
larger than yourself and also a lot of people get
this wrong is they think that oh well Leo if
if I'm gonna be selfless then that means people get
to walk all over me but see what they don't
realize is that the selflessness it can be that way
but then eventually the inflection point is that actually when
you get past that inflection point you're so selfless that
actually you acquire some selfish tendencies which is like you
don't let people walk all over you you actually have
boundaries because your boundaries are there precisely so that you
can be effective in being selfless see because if you
were selfless with no boundaries you actually couldn't be effective
it at contributing to other people because they would walk
over you and if they walk over you then you're
not effective at being selfless and then of course selfishness
can also loop back around for some people they need
to go through this entire process of being extremely selfish
in life and only later in life after years of
selfishness and greed and corruption all the sort of stuff
finally they hit this inflection point where they realize it
oh my god I've been so extremely God to have
selfish that now one day you just wake up and
like that's it I surrender I'm gonna be truly selfless
from now on and from that point on their life
becomes beautiful their life becomes about contributions no longer about
themselves and this is a reformed person this is a
born-again person but see most people don't realize that that
inflection point is there to be crossed from both sides
now not always is the inflection point crossable from both
sides in some of these examples it is in some
of these examples it only kind of works one way
it's asymmetrical let's take a look at the next example
freedom versus discipline this is a really interesting one of
course everyone loves freedom freedom is so easy to love
you want to be free you want to have your
own time to do whatever you want to do you
don't want to work for your boss you just want
to sit at home and do anything you want you
want the freedom to travel anywhere think anything do anything
say anything buy anything but that's not true freedom people
who like that kind of freedom are usually very opposed
to discipline and they think of it as being a
linear spectrum with freedom here and discipline here and there
the polar opposites but is that really how it works
what if by being disciplined you actually develop more freedom
see when I tell you to do stuff like set
up a daily meditation habit read books eat healthy food
self inquire contemplate you know do all this other kind
of stuff it sounds like oh man Leo that's discipline
you're telling me to discipline myself pursue my life purpose
wake up every morning and do the mastery process and
do the deliberate practice and all this other kind of
stuff you talked about but what about being free leo
that stuff is all like so grindy and it seems
like so force I just want to be free that's
how life is meant to be but see when you
go straight for freedom it's the same problems with the
hedonist actually that strategy fails you become lazy and soft
and and ultimately your entire life collapses and you find
yourself just having to like struggle and stress to even
get the basic aspects of your life to work whereas
if you're disciplined and you put in all these practices
meditate habit and your life working on your life purpose
and eating healthy going to the gym and da da
da da doing all this stuff working hard following through
on things you got to follow through on what you
find is that you actually find a paradoxical freedom in
that not at first but the more you go down
the circle and then you get closer to that inflection
point eventually didn't come to the point where you become
so disciplined that in that you get a ridiculous level
of freedom that the person who is chasing freedom cannot
even imagine let alone realize they're interesting how that works
how about empiricism versus mysticism a lot of scientifically and
rationally minded people would like to think that empiricism and
mysticism are two ends of a spectrum and that we
have like hardcore science on this end and we have
fluffy airy-fairy mysticism on this end and then something in-between
but what the empiricist doesn't realize is that actually all
that mysticism is is empiricism take in full circle when
you become so empirical when you become so hyper scientific
that you question every single assumption and you become so
conscious and so aware of every single experience that you're
having right now that all concepts start to dissolve and
break down the past no longer exists the future no
longer exists atoms no longer exist an external world no
longer exists a brain no longer exists because you realize
these things are all just concepts all of it breaks
down because you're becoming so hyper conscious and so hyper
empirical that eventually hit the inflection point and there's this
moment of inversion where you go from empirical to mystical
and everything that you thought was material and physical it
just in an instant becomes magical divine and mystical and
spiritual and that's all the spirituality is is just hyper
empiricism but the scientific and rational mind doesn't understand that
because it thinks in terms of this linear spectrum it
doesn't anticipate the paradoxical curving back around coming full circle
that is actually possible now this would be an example
where it doesn't work in both ways it works on
this end of the circle but not really on the
other end you don't become so mystical that then you
become empirical I don't know if that makes any sense
so it's definitely sort of asymmetrical in this example the
next example have for you is nihilism verses meaning so
again these are set up on a spectrum and people
think that there's nihilism on this end which is dark
and brooding and depressing and it's like existential angst and
and like philosophers like Nietzsche and stuff like that who
believe that there is no meaning to the world and
nothing matters and everything is the same you could kill
people and rape people and it's all it is none
of it matters and then you have on the upper
opposite end you have the the people who are really
into meaning and and purpose and these might be like
the the stereotypical religious people like maybe your church pastor
or something like that and this guy's all about meaning
he finds meaning in his family he finds meaning in
religion he finds meaning in God he finds meaning in
in his government he finds meaning in his nation in
his patriotism he finds meaning and rooting for his sports
team and you know he finds meaning in all this
sort of stuff and it seems like they're totally opposite
but what if you take nihilism all the way all
the way past the inflection point what will happen you
become so conscious that there is no such thing as
meaning that everything in one moment flips upside down and
all the sudden everything becomes extraordinarily meaningful how can that
be well because see the problem with nihilism is that
it's really just a half-assed enlightenment the nihilist thinks that
nothing has meaning but that's just a thought that's just
a belief he has and then he interprets that negatively
he gives it a negative meaning without realizing that he's
doing it so he gets depressed and he gets lazy
and he thinks there's no there's nothing to do and
life isn't really interesting and it's not beautiful because he
just had this stupid belief that everything is meaningless and
then he interprets it as being negative which is what
that's a meaning so actually he's not realizing that he's
not taking meaninglessness to his ultimate conclusion if he did
he would eventually circle back around past the inflection point
coming full circle to realize that actually you know what
being has way more meaning than meaning could ever have
and then he derives all of his meaning from just
being and that becomes so much more powerful and amazing
that it appears from the outside to other people that
he finds so much meaning in everything in life but
really what happened is that he truly became conscious that
nothing matters and that there is no meaning at all
and to the person who was really into meaning this
doesn't compute because to them you know they find meaning
in all these material and physical and spiritual ideas and
concepts and things but what they don't realize that all
of that is just a fiction all the meaning you
derive from your religion from your country from rooting for
your sports team from rooting for your political party from
from tribalism from all your ideologies from your family all
that meaning all of that will get wiped away and
it's very easy to wipe it away and you can
do that very easily just by destroying the guy's family
destroy his business destroy his political party destroy his nation
he is gonna become hopeless and dejected more than the
nihilist because really all his meaning was just a mental
fiction and he didn't realize that what he need to
do is to let go of all that actually move
around towards nihilism complete the nihilism don't just half-ass it
and then eventually you break through and then everything becomes
being which is million times more meaningful than meaning ever
was that's a really interesting example that a lot of
people don't understand how about a morality versus morality I've
alluded to this before my morality videos so again they're
put on opposite end of the spectrum you have the
really moral people which is usually the more religiously inclined
people and then you have the sort of a moralistic
people which are more of like the rational scientifically minded
atheistic Allah minded people the really moral religious people they
believe in a strong sense of good and evil that
good and evil are objectively true and the amoral people
the atheistic people to them they recognize that yeah good
and evil these are subjective notions human notions culturally dependent
notions it's more relative for them whereas for the more
or less it's more absolute but actually what both these
people don't realize is that this goes full circle so
if you take your a morality completely full circle and
you realize that actually truly there is no good and
evil everything will become good for you now the atheists
will say well Leo I do recognize that I don't
believe in a absolute good and evil but see that's
just lip service you're just paying lip service to a
morality that's not true a morality because if I steal
your car if I abused your son and daughter if
I do something nasty to you if I piss in
your soup what's gonna happen you're gonna call me evil
very very quickly you're gonna think of me as evil
that's why you're gonna get angry and upset and offended
and hurt and sad and all this sort of stuff
that's why you lashed out at mean that's why you'll
call me names of course you will because even though
in theory you don't believe in good and evil in
practice of course you do because you taking your immorality
full-circle if you did what you would discover is that
actually evil is literally impossible and that everything that you
think is evil is actually good and this notion is
so difficult to understand for most people that they think
I'm just kidding here or they think this is impossible
they think that's insane no it's just you have to
cross that inflection point that's a big hurdle to cross
but when you do cross it you know what you
become you don't become Hitler you don't become a terrorist
you become a saint people don't get this what do
you think a saint is do you think a saint
is someone who subscribes traditional morality who is behaving saintly
because the Bible told him so because God told him
so because it was passed down from above no a
true Saint the only way you can be a true
Saint is if you realize that everything is absolutely amoral
and that you are free to be any which way
you want and then what you do is you decide
I'm gonna be good just from the goodness of my
own heart for the sake of being good just because
everything is good there is no such thing as evil
in the st. sighs that's why he can be so
good precisely to the most evil people to whom you
could not be good otherwise because if you think someone
is evil you can't be good to them which is
why you can't be a saint which is why ordinary
people are not Saints because they're not conscious enough to
be Saints to be a saint is not just to
be a nice person to be a saint is to
be conscious that literally nothing can possibly ever be evil
or bad that's what it means to be a saint
now the moralistic person doesn't get this to them this
sounds absurd they think they can get to sainthood by
just putting layer upon layer of rules and should statements
and morality upon themselves because they think that morality is
something that you have to obey in order to get
it to heaven in order to get treats and prizes
and or not to be punished but that's not true
morality that's actually a morality masquerading as morality all of
that is a fiction so what the moralist needs to
do is actually he needs to surrender his morality go
towards a morality complete the full circle come back around
go past the inflection point and then he has a
chance of discovering what true morality is true morality is
what I was describing with the saint it's when you
realize that actually everything is good there is no evil
no matter how you behave and from that realization then
you will tend to behave in a very saintly manner
although you're not gonna be bound by it you're not
gonna have to you're gonna want to which is the
whole difference between someone like Jesus who was a true
Saint who had true transcendent morality and your typical priest
or preacher or Pope who doesn't have this because that
guy did not go through the same inflection point he
didn't come full circle the way that Jesus did so
they're they're emulating Jesus but the way they're doing it
is completely backwards and they don't understand this and they
don't know why it's not working and of course then
you look at the Catholic Church and why why Catholic
priests abuse and molest children that sort of stuff why
aren't they moral because they're going about it the opposite
way they're telling themselves I should not have sex know
what they should do is to say I can have
sex all I want and nothing's wrong with sex and
then they'll come full circle then they need to go
even further past the inflection point and then they could
actually really be the kind of Saints that they strive
to be but there's no way they can do it
now it's really not a matter of will it's a
matter of consciousness which they do not have the next
example no purpose versus strong purpose I talked about life
purpose a lot and some people criticize me and say
olio but there's no such thing as purpose so why
are you talking about life purpose in fact you made
this whole course of life purpose but is your whole
course delusional because there actually is no such thing as
purpose again what you don't realize is that before I
even created the course I knew that there's no such
thing as purpose it's not a mistake I didn't make
a mistake what we're doing here is we're going past
the inflection point when you realize that there is no
purpose in life you would think that all that means
I'm so lazy I got nothing to do I'm just
gonna sit and watch TV all day I mean you
could that is an option but generally what happens when
you fully realize that then it flips back around and
you suddenly realize hey I can design my own purpose
oh that's way more powerful than going out there and
finding a purpose written down in some book people think
of it as though like because I created a life
purpose course people think that the way the life purpose
works is like this it's like there's a god somewhere
and he has a database and in this database God
has two tables one has your name a name of
every human being that ever lived and the other has
a column there with with the life purpose matching up
to the name and that what you're gonna do is
you're gonna go like take the course and then match
up your name to to the database column and row
with the with the life purpose and then you've found
it but of course that's not what I'm saying that's
not how it works at all life purpose begins with
the recognition that there is no such thing as purpose
that all pads are pointless they all ultimately lead to
nothingness and that's not a problem that's not a bug
that's a feature that means you get to choose your
own path you choose the path you love the most
the one you're most passionate about and then you commit
your whole life to mastering that path and counter-intuitively by
realizing you have no purpose you develop a very strong
sense of purpose people say so if I thought olio
but enlightened people they don't have a purpose are you
kidding enlightened people have the strongest purpose who are the
strongest visionaries and the strongest leaders throughout history that have
been remembered for thousands of years who are they Jesus
Buddha Mahavira Gandhi various kinds of Saints and mystics throughout
time they've had the strongest purposes which is no accident
do you think those people realize that their purpose is
completely pointless of course they did of course that's precisely
why their purpose was so strong next example weakness versus
power a lot of power hungry people out there in
politics and business in the military and they assume that
they can get power over their people and that to
get powerful what you need to do is you need
to acquire more force more capital more money more more
military arms more weapons that sort of stuff more technology
but what they don't realize is that that's not true
power because they think of power as being here on
this end of the spectrum they think of a weakness
being over here but actually the way that it works
is that you know how you become the most powerful
human being in the world you relinquish all desire for
power that's the trick because as you become more powerful
actually you find yourself being quite weak think of it
a dictator who has total and absolute control over his
country he's he powerful is a weak can he sleep
well at night or not he can't because he's worried
he's gonna get assassinated he can't even eat his own
food he needs someone to taste his food for him
first because he's afraid he's gonna get poisoned that's what
power gets you counterintuitive isn't it on the other hand
when you relinquish all your power what happens you surrender
everything so much that you have nothing to lose when
you have nothing to lose you are the strongest position
of power that you can possibly have the more you
have to lose oddly enough the more can be taken
away from you but when you have nothing to lose
what can be taken away from you nothing a couple
of stories from history come up to in mine here
to illustrate this point well first of all you've got
Gandhi and the incredible movement that he started with his
non aggressive nonviolent protests and how powerful that was he
brought down the entire British government through just sitting around
going on hunger strikes and that's it he just sat
around and went on hunger strikes that was his whole
power he was sitting around in a loincloth and just
a white a white sari or something like that ate
basically nothing had no weapons had nothing yet he was
able to mobilize hundreds of millions of citizens of pandu
citizens to ultimately overpower the British rule there and the
British had weapons and guns and power and all this
sort of stuff and eventually it all crumbled there's also
the story of Diogenes and Alexander the Great and one
day die and Diogenes which just was basically a philosopher
who lived out in the streets in a bathtub in
Greece and then Alexander the Great who is this great
emperor and great king he strides through town Diogenes is
just sitting outside of town and Alexander the Great stands
before him and and he asks him like something like
so are you the the famous philosopher Diogenes who lives
in a bathtub and he's like and he tells Alexander
the Great he says you're blocking my Sun because he's
sitting there under the Sun he's trying to some some
Sun raise some suntan I guess and and now examiner's
like how dare you it'll speak to a king or
to an emperor in this way and I oh geez
just doesn't care he doesn't care cuz he's a he
lives in a [ __ ] bathtub with dogs surrounded
with donkey lives in filth he doesn't care he has
nothing to lose at all reminds me of a similar
story from from Japan or I guess it might be
China probably more like China Zen a Zen parable where
there's a this Chinese emperor who's who's a warlord and
he's ransacking and conquering all the territory and then he
conquers one territory adds it to his Empire and he's
the the race and everybody is submitting to him all
the lesser warlords are submitting to him and he conquers
this one territory with this little of Zen temple and
he asks all the priests there to submit to him
and to pledge loyalty and one of them refuses the
Zen master and so the messengers come back to the
Emperor and they say well this guy he's being an
idiot he he's not submitting to you and the Emperor
says what this fool I'm gonna go there with my
sword and cut off his head myself and so he
goes he goes to the temple and he finds the
design master sitting there in meditation and he tell us
this in Messick you fool you dare to to defy
the emperor I could cut off your head without blinking
an eye and the Zen master replies I could die
without blinking an eye and at that point the emperor
gets it he realizes that the true power lies with
being able to die not with being able to kill
that's what takes real courage and so he relinquishes his
whole kingdom and he becomes a disciple of this and
master say so power and weakness work in very counterintuitive
ways the next example is introversion versus extraversion this is
an interesting one people tend to think these are opposite
and that they don't connect but actually what's possible is
that you become so introverted that it circles back around
and actually you become completely extroverted how does that work
well you contemplate and you self reflects so much that
you actually become conscious that there is no mind or
no interior T at all to human beings see as
an introvert you think you're stuck in your head all
the time you think you're self-conscious you think you're stuck
in the mind whereas for extroverts they're out there they're
in the physical tangible world but there actually is no
interior T to the mind the thoughts and emotions that
you're having they're part of the external world so when
you realize that when you realize that there's nothing on
the inside it's all outside then you actually become literally
an extrovert because you live completely out here your thoughts
if you have them your emotions that you have them
you don't consider them interior things you're not hiding inside
of them back there somewhere in your skull they're actually
they're out here they're part of the physical world you
see but all these dualities of inner world outer world
physical world non-physical we'll all these dissolve and what you're
left with is just one thing and you might say
well that changes nothing then but actually changes everything because
for an introvert they're stuck in their head and they
actually believe that's real they think that a whole world
is real and it's not and I'm speaking as an
introvert I'm a very strong introvert but I realized that
it's possible to actually go past this inflection point to
extraversion and that's also actually the ultimate solution for introverts
is go all the way around of course you can
also try to go this way as well you can
push yourself to become more an extra virtuous by pushing
yourself to talk to more people and I've done that
too and that's a that's a great strategy so by
no means am I saying you only have to kind
of explore one end of the cycle you can explore
multiple ends sometimes in some of these situations how about
the divine versus the mundane people think that there's like
everyday life which is mundane and then there's divine supernatural
stuff which either doesn't exist or if it does exist
is some lofty airy-fairy thing out there but again they
don't realize that actually these are exactly the same thing
how do you get to the divine you examine the
mundane so much that it stops being the Monday and
you stop taking it for granted and at that precise
moment you pass the inflection point and the mundane everything
you see around you the most ordinary things a a
piece of trash on the sidewalk becomes filled with the
light of God it becomes divinized it becomes spiritual people
don't get that people think divine means somewhere up in
heaven in the clouds in the afterlife nothing could be
further from the truth everything that's experienced right now everything
right here everything you're seeing this is pure divinity happening
right now the question is are you conscious of it
or are you just so asleep that everything to you
is just ah it's just like every other day see
when it's like every other day you're not seeing the
magic of reality the way you do when you were
a child for example that's just because you've become so
acclimated to it you take it now for granted life
and death also cycle back around you think that life
is the most important thing and death is the worst
possible thing nothing could be further from the truth your
death is the greatest thing that could possibly happen to
you and the sooner you can die the sooner you
can start to live people don't realize that people who
are pure up preoccupied with life actually spend most of
it trying to avoid death and so their life is
miserable how about duality versus non duality oh boy this
is a really interesting can of worms this is a
real mind [ __ ] people think that these are
two things on a spectrum two poles you've got duality
here non duality here but what is that but a
dualistic way of looking at the world you see that
itself is coming from the perspective of duality from the
non dual perspective this loops back around from the non
dual perspective there is no difference between duality and non-duality
you get that if you're into non duality and you're
opposing non duality with duality you're actually not being non
dual you're actually being dual you get that it's really
easy to trick yourself to be truly non dual is
to be accepting of duality as well to realize that
duality is literally non duality they're the same thing it's
a matter of perspective whereas from the duelists mind everything
is always a duality they can't see the non duality
and anything how is that possible you everything is everything
is dual everything is separate everything is this it's its
inner world outer world it's black it's white it's exists
at non-existence all that see they can't see past that
they can't see the commonality and shallow forms of non
duality like if you're doing consciousness work you're doing enlightenment
work maybe you had a few glimpses you think you've
seen non duality and maybe you have but still you're
putting them in opposition it's like well my amazing mystical
experience that was the non-dual and this thing here now
I'm in the dual and so there's a non dual
in the dual and I'm in the I'm in the
dual and I want to get to the non dual
how do I get to the non dual see but
that's all dualistic when you're in the non dual there
is no difference between the dual in the non dual
they cycle back around how about knowing versus not knowing
people spend most of their time trying to know more
and more and more acquiring knowledge and I think by
by knowing more that's the best thing and then opposite
of the spectrum is not knowing by not knowing you're
admitting a weakness that's like something is wrong with you
but what they don't realize is that actually the more
and more and more you know actually the stupider you
get in a sense and if you would actually turn
that around and go and start to unlearn let go
of stuff that you think you know let go of
all your models all your ideas all your beliefs unlearn
all that stuff empty your cup completely which you'll get
to is that you will get to a point where
you're not knowing is so great that you then become
conscious of the only thing that can be known which
is that everything is unknowable and that is the ultimate
place to be and you cannot get there through knowing
you can only get there through unknowing how about the
duality that people create between the personal and the impersonal
so maybe you've wondered is life personal or is it
impersonal if you're a religious person you tend to think
it's personal you have a personal connection to God you
have a personal connection to other people that sort of
stuff God cares about you whereas if you're an impersonal
scientifically minded person you think that oh well it's just
all atoms and molecules it's just a materialism there is
no personal God nobody cares about you the universe doesn't
care about you there's nothing personal about reality don't take
things personally to take things personally it would be subjective
human bias but what both these people don't realize is
that in truth reality is so impersonal that it's utterly
personal it goes full circle so if you take your
impersonalism all the way around you will realize that everything
is truly so impersonal and then you go past the
inflection point that then the impersonal nature of reality becomes
very personal to you if you develop personal relationship to
the impersonal aspect of reality and that's really what the
religious person is trying to get to but doesn't understand
that you can't get to it through this side of
the of the circle you want this personal connection to
reality but what you don't understand is that that's your
ego that's the thing that's actually blocking you from getting
to what you want you surrender the ego you get
rid of everything subjective you get rid of all your
self biases all your petty ego clinging all your ideas
and all that stuff and then you wind up being
so impersonal but then you realize oh my god all
of reality is truly impersonal and then that becomes your
one true personal connection to everything how about the distinction
people make between subject and object I think they think
that these are two opposite things like that's an object
over there that chair and I'm a subject over here
so the subject is looking at the object and there's
like the subjective experiences and there's the objective world this
sort of duality is set up but what people don't
realize there is that again they connect behind the scenes
and actually it's possible for your experience your subjective experience
of an object to become so subjective that it flips
back around and you actually literally become the object that
you were looking at the subject disappears the subject and
object they collapse and therefore everything's subjective becomes objective and
scientifically minded scientifically minded people they wonder about this they
say well Leo your ID of God and all that
aren't they just subjective that's because you're you're thinking in
this linear fashion you're not realizing that it connects back
around yeah my experience of reality has been so subjective
that I've been able to experience the absolute by actually
literally becoming the object which is the absolute so through
absolute subjectivity I've gotten to absolute objectivity or as actually
you as a scientific person who thinks he's trying to
be objective with your empiricism in all your tests and
all this sort of stuff and your double-blind experiments that's
actually the most subjective that's a completely subjective human species
specific method that you're using and it will not get
you to objective truth you want objective truth you can
only get to it through pure subjectivity if you try
to get to objective truth through objective methods like science
you don't get to objective truth what you get to
is you get to human truth which is what science
is it's a human centered way of looking at the
world which scientific people don't understand because they're under the
illusion that is subjective when really it's not sure would
be helpful to realize this wouldn't it for many scientists
how about saw lips is Emilio and light and that's
just like solipsistic about no brains you're talking about everything
being hallucination other people not existing that's like salep TSA's
polish you don't realize that solid system goes full circle
so salep says that you are the only one who
exists in the world and you cannot be sure about
the existence of other minds and other consciousness as other
human beings but the reality is far stranger than that
the reality is that even you aren't really real and
that there's no difference being you and other people so
when you discover that you yourself aren't real your solemn
vows soulful Circle that you discovered that oh I'm not
real and everyone else is also not real so were
the exact same nothingness so literally for nothingness in me
is the nothingness in you so it's not that there
aren't other people it's just that all people are all
couched within the same nothingness the same nothing this is
looking through my eyes as is looking right now through
your eyes at me but to realize that you gotta
take your solipsistic 'l how about skepticism i've talked in
the past how people misuse skepticism very easily skepticism goes
full circle most people they like to be skeptical but
not really they don't take their skepticism to the absolute
level if you take your skepticism all the way it
comes back full circle you become skeptical of your own
skepticism your own skepticism defeats itself but see most people
they don't really self reflect enough to see and become
skeptical of their own skepticism and then that becomes a
trap for them how about being ordinary versus being unique
a lot of people tried to be unique and special
and counter-intuitively in trying to do that actually you become
quite ordinary that's like those kids in school who try
to be nonconformist altogether so they come up with their
own little group which ironically all conform to the same
stupid things and the opposite of that is that if
you actually try to be ordinary completely yourself completely ordinary
that will actually make you very unique because most people
are trying to be unique and special and the one
thing they can't accept is that actually they're ordinary how
about the example of the true self versus no self
people who study mysticism religion and non-duality and enlightenment they
get very confused by this some schools like Zen and
Buddhism talk about the truth of no self there is
no such thing as a self and some schools like
advised Vedanta or some Hindu traditions talk about the true
self so which is it it seems like they're polar
opposites are are there two different truths no it's the
exact same truth no self is the true self when
you realize that there is no self what does that
leave that leaves behind nothing and that is the true
self conversely if you realize the true self which is
nothing what do you discover that it's nothing no self
exactly the same thing how about nothing versus infinity as
a as a distinction that people make which is false
they think that nothing is over a year non-existence over
here an existence or infinity everything is over here so
either you can have nothing or you can have everything
can't have both actually they're identical they're exactly the same
thing when you truly have nothing it's so empty that
it's infinitely full and when you have infinity it's so
full that it must be empty in the same way
that if you take all the positive integers and all
the negative integers and combined them together you get zero
but inside that zero are contained every possible integer it
goes full circle how about relativity versus absolutism people like
to rag on relativity and they say oh well there's
moral relativity and that's bad and there's a cultural relativity
and valid people talk about relativity post-modernism talks about everything
is relative everything is just you know different cultures different
values but no one set of values is better than
another set of values and then the opposite of that
is absolute just so much does you think that all
this is the absolute there's the absolute truth there's these
absolute values there's absolute right and wrong there's this absolute
way to live life that's the best what's the truth
well the truth is that everything is absolutely relative reality
is so relative that it cycles back around past the
inflection point goes full circle and you discover the one
thing that is truly absolute about reality which is that
it's completely relative and people don't get that people want
to be absolutists or they want to be relativists but
they don't take their relativity far enough and when they're
stuck in absolutism they refuse to acknowledge that reality is
groundless and so they get stuck there when really what
they need to do the absolutist needs to go from
absolutism to relativity beyond relativity transcend relativity and cycle it
back around to absolutism but this is a different kind
of absolutism for example I've experienced the absolute and the
absolute I know is that reality is completely relative but
that's very different my version of absolute is very different
from your fundamentalist Christians version of the absolute or your
fundamentalist Muslims version of the absolute it's difference being the
absolute in practice and the absolute in theory because when
you realize that everything is relative and nothing is truly
absolute but relativity itself then you don't cling to you
don't need to defend it which is the whole problem
with absolutism is that people who are absolutists in ideology
they need to defend their ideology whereas when you really
experience the absolute relativity of reality all of that flies
out the window how about this example doing nothing versus
taking action some people who really love success and our
ambitious business people they are eight type personalities they don't
like doing nothing you don't like meditation they don't like
sitting around they don't like contemplating they don't like philosophy
they like to go out there and take action and
do this and build a business and kick people in
the ass and dot it on and on and all
this and and as you're doing all that taking all
that action what are you telling yourself that you're accomplishing
so much but counter-intuitively the more action you take the
more you spin your wheels if you would actually sit
down and do nothing if you would just meditate if
you just look inside if you would just look at
the being that is right here that would be the
biggest action step you could possibly take in your life
but see people think doing nothing is just being lazy
or watching television that's not doing nothing I mean truly
doing nothing truly doing nothing is some of the hardest
work you can do in your life I dare you
to sit for one week and do nothing from morning
to night for seven days straight that will be the
most you've grown as a human being in the last
ten or twenty years will be accomplished in those seven
days just by doing absolutely nothing and also notice how
difficult it is to actually pull that off very very
difficult very counterintuitive how can you accomplish so much by
doing so little and conversely how can you do so
little by doing so much interesting paradox how about this
other example egodeath versus strong personality some some people don't
like enlightenment because we talk about ego doesn't they say
oh well the self is gonna die and I'm gonna
realize there is no me and no self and they
think okay so if that's the case then that good
there goes my personality there goes all the stuff that
I love in life there goes my charisma and all
of that what they don't realize is that actually to
experience ego death you go full circle and your personality
flowers people who go through ego death have the strongest
personality the most charisma they're the most spontaneous they are
the first to laugh and not to take life seriously
and taking life seriously versus not taking life seriously another
one of these examples because what people say to me
sometimes as they say like leo but aren't you taking
life so seriously why taking life so seriously like relax
man just have some fun but you don't understand what
I'm pointing you towards I am pointing you towards exactly
that the person who is relaxing and having fun and
all this this is actually the person who actually is
the one who takes life too seriously because would hit
when [ __ ] hits the fan for you you'll
get serious real quick whereas the enlightened person the person
who actually works on himself seriously does the self actualization
does the conscious work he will become so conscious that
everything will become an illusion to him everything is a
hallucination so there's nothing serious to take so you can
laugh about anything you can laugh about death you can
laugh about all the evil and corruption in the world
you can laugh about it you cannot do that when
you take life as a joke because as soon as
someone pisses in your soup or steps on your toe
or encroaches on your ego you're gonna get very serious
very quickly the only way to accomplish that is to
go through ego death how about masculine versus feminine this
very interesting this is actually a little insight for you
guys doing pickup trying to get better with girls see
when you get it to pickup you think that oh
I suck at attracting girls the way I'm gonna get
good at attracting girls is by being more manly more
macho that's what girls love and you try doing that
and you notice that actually it doesn't work and if
you do pickup for a long time eventually what pickup
leads you to is to the realization that all that
pickup is really doing is that it's teaching you how
to act more like a girl that's it surprise girls
are actually attracted to girly behavior here's all of pickup
boiled down to one thing act more like a girl
and girls will flock to you what does that mean
be more emotional be more charismatic be more spontaneous be
more flirtatious be more outrageous be more unpredictable be more
moody show your emotions more wear them on your sleeve
love stuff hate stuff be expressive that's how girls are
don't be self-conscious that's how girls are but see that's
not what you like you as the guy I think
you're gonna stroll into the club and you're gonna act
all macho or like some James Bond guy you're the
James Bond guy here so cool and so suave you
don't smile you're not spontaneous you're not flirtatious and then
you wonder why the girls don't flock to you of
course they don't of course not because to really be
truly masculine is to be comfortable with your feminine side
and being able to express it and girls love that
they love it girls hate a serious guy this next
example attachment versus detachment this also goes full circle best
example of this I would say is neediness when you
are truly needy and you really need something your chances
of getting it are actually diminished and when you're detached
and you don't need anything actually your chances of success
and getting that thing increase a lot this is true
when you're negotiating it's true in business it's true with
attracting girls it's true with many facets of life how
about success versus failure it's very interesting that if you
want to be very successful you need to fail a
lot fail so much that you succeed and conversely oftentimes
when people get very successful they get complacent they get
lazy they start taking their success and their practices for
granted and then that leads to their failure it's oftentimes
very hard to keep up success how about this other
example of rationality versus paradox rational people assume that rationality
is over here and on the opposite and spectrum is
paradox and contradiction and irrationality but as we've talked about
in the strange loop episode actually these two come together
if you become so rational that you become conscious of
the mechanism of rationality rationality becomes conscious of itself rationality
recognizes that actually rationality contradicts and undermines itself and that
rationality itself is a paradox when rationality recognizes that rationality
transcends itself and goes beyond rationality rational people have a
very hard time getting this because they're stuck in their
rationalism and they don't turn the rationalism in on itself
in the same way that the skeptic fails to do
that and get stuck in skepticism how about suffering versus
peace this is an interesting one people assume Authority for
many people in life they have to go through a
lot of suffering to ultimately get to peace and a
classic example this he probably knows Eckhart Tolle you know
how he became enlightened you know his story he was
on the verge of suicide he was so depressed and
so miserable had so much suffering that it ultimately led
to his ego death she would pass the inflection point
and now he's in total peace now I don't recommend
that as a strategy that's a very painful strategy and
it doesn't always work but for some people you know
their path through life is a path of deep deep
deep suffering and then that's what they got to go
through to ultimately get to peace and if that's you
hey that's fine you can do it that way I
don't recommend it I think there's easier ways that's personally
not my path I don't want to go down that
road but you know there's many x addicts for example
who have gone through very tortuous paths in life loss
of suffering and ultimately came out very wise and peaceful
in the end how about stupidity versus wisdom seems like
these things should be polar opposites and yet a lot
of wisdom seems like stupidity to most people that's why
Zen masters and Yogi's and and Saints and mystics they
usually keep it themselves because if they start talking a
lot they start sounding very stupid and people misunderstand them
and I see that all the time people are my
forum post stuff like oh this yogi said this and
this guru said that but it sounds ridiculous it sounds
stupid it sounds crazy yeah because you're not nearly conscious
enough to be able to decipher the profundity of his
wisdom so to you it looks like stupidity so in
most of these examples as you can see the mistake
is often not going far enough like with skepticism the
skeptic isn't going far enough with a skepticism the introvert
isn't going far enough with his introversion the person who
is suffering isn't going deep enough into his suffering the
person whose rationale isn't going deep enough into his rationality
to discover the paradoxes that lie within the person who's
committed to empiricism isn't being empirical enough to realize it
actually empiricism leads to mysticism the deconstructionist doesn't realize that
his deconstruction is only linguistic and that it needs to
go further to deconstruct itself as well the person was
being philosophical isn't realizing that his philosophy doesn't go deep
enough he's just philosophizing in his mind his philosophy isn't
touching his way of life his behavior his very being
the nihilist isn't going far enough to realize that nihilism
ultimately becomes enlightenment the atheist isn't going far enough to
realize that his atheism ultimately becomes God a person doing
nothing doesn't realize that he's not doing enough do nothing
the person who's failing doesn't realize he's not failing enough
to get the success he's after there is this tendency
for us to think of life as being linear like
these simple spectrums but actually life is much more interesting
in that life tends to twist back on itself it
tends to reverse itself it's tends to have surprising twists
in it tends to be counterintuitive tends to be mind
[ __ ] and your mind and the purpose of
this whole episode is to make you a little bit
more open to being flexible enough with your mind to
embrace paradox see the problem with ideology is that it
sets linear expectations for example the religious person will tell
me but Leo I can't be God you're talking about
the self me being God you say you're God yeah
I am God and you are God of course you
are but for the ideological religious person this this can't
work because their notion of God is a very linear
notion of God they have these expectations so for them
God could be anything but it can't be me and
that's exactly what God is or likewise they'll say well
Leo surely God can't be nothing because see that's a
linear expectation set by their ideology but of course God
can be nothing what else could God be but nothing
nothing is infinite nothing is eternal nothing is the source
of everything of course God is nothing but those linear
expectations that have been set by your ideology prevent you
from being flexible enough with your mind to realize that
and a scientifically minded person will say well Leo empiricism
can't be mysticism empiricism rules out mysticism again it's a
very linear notion of what empiricism is that's what they
taught you in school that's what they taught you in
university but all they taught us how to think inside
of a box you need to be much more flexible
to see the non-linearity of life same thing with logic
it's like Leo logic can't have paradox and contradictions in
it what kind of logic is that that's not logic
at all yeah because you're thinking of a logic inside
of a little box because your mind up to this
point hasn't been flexible enough to deal with the twisted
reality of what logic is and if you investigate all
of these things I talked about very very deeply to
the very periphery of them you will discover this looping
back round that I've talked about you will discover that
your little box which society has given you to think
about all these things it's um it's just like a
it's a little handy rule of thumb it's good in
many circumstances but it's not good enough to get you
to the most deep and profound aspects of life and
that is that please remember to click the like button
for me if you liked this episode mmm and come
check out actualize that or guess my website you can
browse videos easier there my blog is there and posting
a lot of stuff my book lists the forum the
life purpose course all those resources and more resources to
come in the future that you'll want to check in
with periodically to see as I update the website I'm
working on it all the time and the last thing
I'll tell you is just um to really take this
work to the next level you got to start to
read books yeah my videos are good but it's not
enough not nearly enough it's just an introduction what I
talked to you about is just an introduction I want
you to go read the top 100 books on my
200 over 200 book list read the top 100 that
will completely change your life that will take everything I
talked about and make it so much clearer for you
so much more persuasive and it'll give you and show
you tools and techniques for actually how to start working
on this stuff so if you're watching my content and
you're feeling lost and you don't know what to do
and maybe you're even feeling kind of lazy and you
don't know like well I don't want to go out
there do something really big and difficult but you want
to start doing something so at least start reading some
books now if you're already reading books then I encourage
you to push yourself to the next level and maybe
start a meditation have and so forth but if you're
just starting off and you're feeling stuck and you're feeling
like you're procrastinating and nothing is working nothing is clicking
go read a high quality book books are not frivolous
things books are powerful powerful things where do you think
I got most of the stuff I talked about with
you books I don't just read a book and then
just regurgitate the information that's there I think about it
I contemplate I try to do exercises I practice it
I get ideas I get inspired by and all that
stuff comes together in this kind of concoction or soup
in my head this melting pot in my head and
then eventually you know new insights for him and everything
cross-pollinate so you got to get that process working for
yourself if you are too lazy to read a hundred
books in order to master your life to master non-duality
to understand personal development to understand how business works how
emotions work our relationship work if you're not gonna read
a hundred books you've got no chance you have no
chance of making self-actualization work for you you cannot make
this work just purely by being lazy and watching my
videos or for that matter watching other people's videos alongside
mine that's still not enough you got to read the
books there's there's detail and depth in those books that
could never translate into a video or even a series
of videos so add that to what you're doing and
then start taking action on the stuff in the books
get inspired by that stuff of course take notes on
those books using your commonplace book which I hope you
have set up now and see you're gonna start to
see all these pieces coming together and then my videos
will just be like commentary and extra bonuses on top
of the stuff you're reading in your books and all
the other practices you're doing and then that's how you
actually start to get the really juicy results that are
possible here so go and at least start doing that
you
