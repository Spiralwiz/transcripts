hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to take you through enlightenment guided inquiry
it's going to be a guided visualization using the neti
neti method from advised Vedanta which can be very effective
at creating enlightenment experiences this is not a newbie introductory
episode about enlightenment if you want that I have plenty
of those go check those out on my website or
my channel this here is for people who actually want
to have an enlightenment experience and this is a very
powerful method this method is called neti neti comes from
Advaita Vedanta very old method what neti neti basically means
it means not this not that it's sort of a
process of elimination for getting towards enlightenment now on the
other hand I should tell you if you are new
to this concept of enlightenment maybe you do actually want
to sit through and just do this right now without
getting a lot of introductory information about it because in
a sense the more conceptual knowledge and understanding you have
about enlightenment the more difficult it is for these kinds
of exercises to be effective it could be really effective
for you just to come into this totally cold totally
clueless and you might have an enlightened experience right now
so set aside 30 or 40 minutes make sure you
have time to do this visualization I'm going to take
you through right this can be a very powerful method
that you can use with me or you can learn
it and use it by yourself I personally do this
myself and it can get you some great results so
what are we talking about here basically we want to
discover what exactly it is that you are that's all
enlightenment is it's the discovery of your true self what
are you exactly the big problem here as you can
already see is that you already know who you are
at least you think you do but the situation is
so bad and there's so much ignorance here that there's
not even a possibility for you to consider that you
might be something other than what you already know yourself
to be it's not just a belief for you that
you know who you are it's not just a feeling
it's not just an emotion it's not just a conviction
or a theory it's truth you know exactly who you
are I'm talking to you right now I'm pointing to
you right now that thing that's sitting there listening to
me that creature that human being that you believe that
you are the body and the mind and the brain
and whatever else you might believe that you are that
for you isn't just a belief that for you is
a fact of reality in fact it's such a brute
fact for you that it might be the most indubitable
fact about reality that you have I could probably get
you to doubt anything that you think you know about
life and reality except the fact that you are this
thing sitting there right there and yet that's exactly my
mission so to speak is to get you to start
to doubt that and to create some possibility that you
could be other than what you thought you've been your
entire life that's very difficult to do because it requires
a degree of openness that most human beings cannot stomach
and their imagination can't even fathom nevertheless that's we're going
to attempt to do so I hope you can remain
open-minded with me now notice that I'm not here trying
to convince you of some belief system or some religious
ideology or some physical cosmology or something like this I'm
not really trying to get to change your beliefs what
I'm trying to get you to do is I'm trying
to get you to have a direct experience of your
true nature and this is possible it's possible to have
a direct experience so you believing me isn't what we're
after and it's not going to help it's very important
to understand this what you need to do is to
actually hear my words read between the lines and have
a direct experience of what I'm referring to because the
words I'm using have no connection to the experience itself
they're just guides they're just aids all right so be
very wise here and read between the lines of what
I'm saying if you're open to that then let's begin
let's just for the sake of shits and giggles let's
do a thought experiment you like thought experiments just take
the rest of this episode than the rest of the
next half-hour the next hour and just let's play around
let's play around with your mind let's play around with
your beliefs right so what I want you to do
is I want you to just kind of to set
aside some of the firm beliefs that you have about
how life works how reality is just set those aside
I'm not saying you have to forget about them forever
I know you hold them very precious and dear I
know you think they're so true and right that you
can't let them go even for a minute but you
know what it won't kill you just let them go
set them aside for like 60 to 30 minutes it
won't kill you I promise unless you do a thought
experiment I want you to open your mind to the
radical possibility that you are not a body or a
mind or a brain that you are not an object
that you are not a thing that you are not
a soul that you are not a spirit or any
other thing that really you might imagine yourself to be
open your mind to the possibility that you are not
your DNA and that you are not the neurons in
your brain and that you are not chemical electrical signals
firing through the brain or are your software in the
brain none of this stuff open your mind to the
possibility like really that you are none of these things
not only that but open your mind to the possibility
that you are not an experience at all you're not
an experience you're not a thought you're not a feeling
you're not an emotion you're not a belief and you're
not an intuition and you're not a sense now what
does this leave us with doesn't leave us with much
because when I say experience the way I define experience
is everything I mean everything that's ever happened to you
in your entire life from the moment you were born
through till today all the decades that have passed everything
that's ever happened to you all those things we might
call those experiences there were sights and sounds and tastes
and feelings and emotions and memories and beliefs and ideas
all this kind of stuff right I'm calling all of
that experience so what I'm asking you to do is
to open your mind to the radical possibility that you
are not in experience and I'm being serious here I'm
not around can you do that can you just open
your mind for even just a minute to the possibility
that you are not an experience and therefore that you
are not an object because a knob is an experience
you experience objects you're not a body or a brain
or a mind because those are all experiences and you're
not a soul because that's also an experience whatever you
call soul this is the hardest part of enlightenment work
is just getting to this stage right here where I'm
trying to get you to I'm kind of belaboring the
point but don't mistake how important this is I wouldn't
just belabor it for no reason I want you to
actually consider that anything you've experienced in your entire life
is not actually what you are I don't want you
to believe that I just want you to be open
to the possibility that that might be the case there's
a difference I'm actually going to guide you through a
visualization here which will demonstrate this to you so you
don't need to believe it but you do need to
be open to it because if your mind is closed
to it then we can't go anywhere you see your
mind is already made up and then this whole conversation
is useless seriously you are not an experience or an
object or anything you've ever felt in your entire life
if you can open your mind to that possibility then
now we can begin the search this is where inquiry
begins there's no inquiry until you get to this point
it's very important that you grasp that inquiry is not
what you do beforehand is what you do after you've
gotten to this point so I hope you're ready and
let's begin the guided visualization this will take 30 to
40 minutes so set aside the time make sure that
you have some time and room to relax and to
be with me here fully present go ahead and relax
your body and breathe in some nice deep breaths as
you get present and really focused on every word that
I'm saying you can go ahead and close your eyes
and just sit there comfortably alert and take a couple
of nice deep breaths in with me good as you're
focusing on your breathing with your eyes closed go ahead
and just notice your whole body relaxing and all the
tension melting away and then your breathing just let it
be natural don't try to manipulate or control it and
just sit there very comfortably and just listen to me
talking to you I'm going to explain some things and
I'm going to start to guide you through some of
the things that I want you to experience for yourself
keep your mind open very very open but also be
grounded in what's going on directly in your experience because
I'm not going to ask you just to believe things
but to experience them what we want to do what
we're really interested in here is answering the question what
exactly are you and where exactly are you located if
you are a thing what thing exactly are you if
you turn out to be an experience what experience exactly
are you and where is this thing or this experience
located exactly now this might seem obvious might be so
obvious that you've never questioned it in your entire life
but what I want you to do is I want
you to actually look with me from scratch at this
issue don't take anything for granted here be very mindful
of any assumptions you might have even assumptions that you've
never been cognizant of before in your entire life I
want you to question every single assumption about yourself and
your existence that you've ever taken for granted even including
the possibility that you exist or that you exist as
a thing or that you exist as an experience let's
not take anything for granted here we're actually going to
look and we're going to see what is actually literally
true and we're going to be very exact and very
precise and very literal with the way that we look
and observe our experience to see what's true we're not
going to let our mind escape and be wishy-washy or
vague because this is an important question right is it
important to know what you are have you ever noticed
that everything in your awareness changes think about this think
to the very beginning of your life and just kind
of scan through your life from the earliest memories you
have when you were a child three or four or
five years old or however old you were and think
through all the stuff that happened to you as a
kid as a teenager and then as an adult and
all the way to the present day now what you
immediately notice is that every thing in your experience has
changed hasn't it notice what happened during the course of
your whole life really all that happened was experience we're
going to call everything that happened to you and experience
there were sights there were sounds tastes and smells feelings
physical touches differences in temperature there were all sorts of
thoughts and ideas and beliefs and imaginations there was an
internal dialogue in your head all of this recalling experience
but I want you to notice that all of it
has changed nothing has stay constant has it we're going
to take a much deeper look into this so don't
just believe me on it but be open to the
possibility and it certainly seems reasonable that everything has changed
even your body has changed what your body is now
is not what it was when you were six years
old or when you were ten years old or when
you were fifteen years old very different all the cells
in your body just from science we know all the
cells in your body have changed too so that's interesting
it's interesting that all these things have changed and yet
we think that were a thing and we think that
we know who we are also notice that all your
beliefs and I mean not all your beliefs but many
of your beliefs have changed the things you know have
changed your knowledge has changed drat drastically over the decades
so just notice that now what I want to suggest
to you and we're just going to kind of take
us as a premise it could be wrong but we'll
just take it as a premise is that the following
list of things is all that you've ever had a
reality sight sound taste smell touch or feeling and thought
that's it your entire reality from the moment you were
born till today has been composed of only those six
things basically in various combinations and of course in a
lot of complex ways they were changing but this is
basically the six channels that you're dealing with as a
human being and all this returning experience now what we're
going to do is we're going to go through and
check each of these channels of experience and we're going
to see do you exist in any one of these
channels so let's take first a channel called sight and
the question is are you a sight are you a
visual experience so by visual experience I basically mean colors
and shapes that's all that site is composed of colors
and shapes nothing else so right now if your eyes
have been closed this whole time what I want you
to do is I want you just to put your
awareness on the fact that you only see darkness because
your eyes are closed and what I want you to
do now is I want you to open your eyes
so go ahead and open them and look around you
now what you have is you see colors and you
see shapes doesn't matter what they are you could be
looking at what we would call your body or other
physical objects in the room around you and all that's
fine so now notice that you have all these colors
and now go ahead and close your eyes again and
notice that every single color has changed if you you
can open your eyes again and notice that again it
wit from darkness again to colors all sorts of different
colors and shapes and go ahead and close your eyes
again and notice that all the colors and shapes have
all completely changed not one of them has stayed the
same and have all turned to some kind of dark
color maybe a reddish tint color if you're looking at
some lights with your eyes lids closed and that all
the shapes are gone too so what does this tell
us it tells us that you cannot be a sight
why because sites change all the time you change site
just by blinking your eyes you change site so by
definition you can't be a color or a shape because
they're always in flux you see and what she wore
is you are a constant notice that basically from the
moment you were born and you were conscious to the
moment you are now the the constant there was you
so experience was changing but there was a constant the
constant is you so we're looking for what that constant
is right so what we've discovered here is that the
constant is not colors or shapes now that's pretty interesting
because notice that your body when you look at yourself
in the mirror you tend to think of like well
I am my body but let's be very clear about
that you can't be the color of your body and
you can't be the shape of your body or any
other visual aspect of your body because it can change
not only that but of course your body the way
it looks has to completely change from when you were
6 years old to where you are now all of
it has changed so that can't be fundamentally what you
are you see good let's go onto the next channel
which is sound maybe what you are is a sound
instead let's take a look are you a sound the
sound channel is pretty easy to deal with because most
people don't really think there a sound seems rather silly
you don't really believe you're a sound but let's just
take a look and again put your attention on the
fact that sounds are constantly changing the sound is I'm
talking to you right now every single second I'm saying
new sounds and these sounds are changing and whatever sounds
you experienced today are different from the sounds you experienced
yesterday and different from the sounds you experienced ten years
ago has there been a constant sound from the moment
you were conscious at birth to today take a look
what you should discover is no there hasn't been sound
always changes so just by very simple logic we can
say that you can't be a sound because we could
put you in a totally soundproof chamber and you would
still exist right you don't believe you would die if
your ears were blocked with wax or if you were
born deaf you're not dead you're still alive you're still
you basically so you can't be a sound now let's
check the channel of taste this one's pretty easy because
human beings have a very poor sense of taste compared
to sound insight but let's take a look for sake
comprehensiveness notice right now that whatever taste you have in
your mouth you don't actually believe that that's you do
you not only that but notice that that taste has
changed it's always different the taste in your mouth is
different after you brush your teeth after you've drank some
coffee after you've kissed your spouse after you chew some
gum every single day your taste changes so you can't
actually literally be a taste can you most people don't
really believe their tastes anyways that's kind of silly so
we're done with that channel let's move on to smell
the channel of smell are you a smell human beings
have an even poorer sense of smell than taste mostly
so this one's also easy to deal with but let's
take a look whatever you're smelling right now is that
you literally is the smell you of course most people
would say no that's rather silly how could I be
a smell but just to be very comprehensive also notice
that whatever smell you have now is not the smell
you had yesterday or the day before or 10 years
ago or when you were born smells are always changing
there's really no such thing as a constant smell so
what you are cannot be a smell because what you
are is constant and a smell is never constant okay
let's move on to the next channel which is touch
are you a touch now this one's a little trickier
so we're going to break it up into first let's
consider outer touch what I'm going to call outer touch
these are all the touches that sort of take place
outside your body so if you put your hand on
a cold can of Coca Cola or if you put
your hand near a fire those are like sensations you
feel outside your body on the surface of your skin
is what we're calling outer touch are you an outer
touch are you a pressure on your skin so like
the feeling of being cut by a knife or poked
by a needle or if you're sitting on your chair
or on your sofa right now then there's some sensation
on your butt from the cushion that's pressure on you
kind of from the outside are you any one of
those sensations take a close look notice that you are
not any one of those sensations what we would say
is that you are experiencing those sensations but those sensations
are not actually you right moreover notice again that these
sensations are very fluid and changing they're changing almost every
minute there is no one single constant sensation that has
been impinging on you from the outside your entire life
that you could possibly identify with there's no pressure there's
no hot or cold there's no sharpness there's no any
kind of outer pressure or outer touch so that means
that you can't possibly be an outer touch good now
let's consider the other component of touch which is what
I'm going to call inner feeling inner feeling is all
the feelings you have inside your body these can be
pains or it could be a warm sensation or a
cold sensation could be a internal pressure could be the
feeling of your heart or your lungs or a tingly
sensation behind your eyes or in your head or in
your skull like maybe a headache or even the feeling
of solidity inside your body all of these feelings either
inner feelings and also will include into this emotions so
when you feel angry or sad or happy or sexually
excited all of these are internal feelings so now let's
take a real close look at this one are you
an internal feeling this is probably the trickiest one of
also look very very carefully if you have a tendency
to say that yes I am an internal feeling that's
what I am and then what I want you to
do is I want you to identify very specifically which
internal feeling are you exactly are you the feeling in
your chest are you the feeling behind the back of
your eyes in your skull are you literally that feeling
is that what you actually are look at this very
open-mindedly without any biases or preconceptions what you should notice
is that you're actually not an inner feeling what we
would say is that you feel an inner feeling an
inner feeling happens to you but you are not literally
it and also notice that inner feelings also change very
frequently and often you're not conscious at all of what
inner feelings are happening inside of you right now you've
become conscious of inner feelings because I've focused your attention
on that but chances are when you are sitting there
and I was talking about other stuff you were not
connected to your inner feelings very much at all if
you do believe that you are an inner feeling take
a look and notice has there ever been a moment
in your life where that inner feeling didn't exist or
you weren't conscious of it because remember if we're saying
that you're an inner feeling that means that inner feeling
must have been constant from the moment of your birth
up till today because that's literally what you are if
that inner feeling ever stops existing you stop existing that's
what it would mean for you to say that you
are and inner feeling so take a look really carefully
are you an inner feeling if you look carefully you
should conclude that you're not because your inner feelings are
always changing even sensations that for example in your chest
or behind the back of your eyes these sensations which
you might identify with they're still always changing they're not
constant they're animated they have degrees of severity and so
forth and sometimes they're totally absent for example when you're
asleep good now let's consider the final channel which is
thoughts are you a thought let's break this down to
several components first let's consider your internal dialogue and what
we might call your internal voice the way that you
usually talk to yourself are you the internal voice take
a look now the internal voice is something that we
identify with usually automatically without even thinking about it much
the inner voice feels like it's me but I want
you just to look at this very objectively and just
with very simple logic if you believe that you are
the inner voice and that really feels like that's what
you are that means that if the inner voice ever
stopped speaking you would disappear that also means that the
inner voice had to have been constantly speaking from the
moment you were born up till today without ever stopping
so are you the inner voice or are you the
one who hears the inner voice notice the difference you
probably want to say that no I'm the one who
hears the inner voice I'm not literally the inner voice
because the inner voice is not constant there are gaps
between the inner voice you don't even have to be
a very good meditator to be aware of that so
you can't be the inner voice can you let's consider
inner images notice that what you have many of your
thoughts are visual thoughts you can picture an apple a
car a tree a house a person your mom your
dad your spouse you can picture all these things with
your eyes closed these are all internal images you can
also picture yourself you can picture your face with your
eyes closed you can picture the back of your head
with your eyes closed you can picture the silhouette of
your body as though it was filmed by a camera
from behind you with your eyes closed you can picture
your arms and your your feet even though you can't
see them you can picture very many things now the
question is are you a picture is that what you
literally are let's take a look really carefully and if
you're going to say that yes I am a picture
then I want you to be very clear and precise
about which picture it is that you are notice that
pictures are constantly changing in your mind so which picture
are you are you the picture of your face is
that what you are what if your face got disfigured
and how it looked has changed would that change who
you are most people would say no are you the
picture of the outline of your body you might at
first be tempted to say yes I am but then
notice that if you lost an arm or a leg
and it got amputated the picture in your mind would
have to change and yet we would still say that
you're basically you and that nothing really about you has
changed you just lost an arm or leg also notice
that if you do identify with any image at all
that means that that image has to have been constantly
displayed in your mind from the moment you were born
up till today without any interruptions do you find such
an image in your mind or is every image in
your mind changing all the time like every five seconds
if you're like the average person if you're like me
every five seconds you have new images in your mind
right picture a purple elephant with polka dots see now
you have that image in your mind and whatever you're
thinking before you've stopped probably thinking about so notice that
you're not an image in your mind that doesn't make
very much sense and the final thing let's consider is
the I fought what I'm going to call the I
thought the thought in your mind that says this is
me this is me here I am I I am
here I exist so put your awareness on that aspect
of your mind right now the I thought and take
a look and ask yourself are you the I thought
now it seems like we're getting somewhere now it seems
like we're really going deep we've gone through all the
clutter and now we've gone to the very core of
who you are you're this I thought right but wait
a minute notice that this I thought if you believe
you are the I thought that the I thought isn't
constantly present there are many moments in your day where
you have no thoughts about yourself where there is no
I thought where there is no internal dialogue most obviously
when you're asleep but also when you're tired or even
when you're talking someone or you're playing a video game
or you're watching a movie you're not thinking about yourself
there is no I thought so if what you actually
literally are is an I thought that I thought would
have to have been constantly active from the moment you
were born until today and that's clearly not the case
the I thought is not even active for 24 hours
let alone four decades at a time so now it
gets a little tricky because we're starting to run out
of things that you could be what is left we've
eliminated sights sounds smells tastes touches feelings internal external ones
we've eliminated all sorts of thoughts and internal dialogue what
is left you might say well leo what I am
is I'm the body I'm the entire collection of all
of these things but notice that what the body is
what you're calling the body in this case is just
either a feeling or a thought an image in your
mind or a combination of these occurring simultaneously and notice
that this combination that you're calling the body isn't constantly
active you might also say well Leo maybe I'm not
the body maybe what I am is I just have
this vague sense that I exist I'm not quite sure
what I am but I just have this intuition I'm
a very intuitive person and intuitively I just know that
I'm I'm a soul I'm sort of consciousness I'm here
I'm present I'm aware I'm this living entity I have
sentient I have this intuition so I'm this intuitive thing
but notice that whatever you call intuition very carefully examine
what that is be very clear about it what you'll
notice is that an intuition is just a feeling in
your body or it's a thought or both also notice
that this intuition is also not constantly active so this
intuition cannot be you now you might say well Leo
what I am maybe is not an intuition but I'm
just I'm there behind the scenes you know all this
stuff is happening to me but I'm just there behind
the scene somewhere I'm not really sure what I am
I'm just behind the scenes I just know I am
okay well what I want you to notice is that
sense that you are behind the scenes that what that
actually literally is is a thought or a feeling if
there were no thoughts or feelings there would be no
sense of you behind the scenes so we've run out
of room we've run out of channels notice that as
much as you look as hard as you look and
you could sit there and I could give you 10
days of straight sitting and looking you cannot find what
I'm going to call the source self what you fundamentally
believe that you are is not a body or a
mind or a brain or some neurons or a feeling
or an intuition or a thought or any of this
kind of stuff what you fundamentally believe you are is
that you're the perceiver the experiencer of all of these
experiences or perceptions right does not feel right that what
you are is you're the perceiver but notice that this
perceiver no matter how much we look and we try
to pinpoint where is this perceiver you can't actually find
it this is what we're calling the source self is
this perceiver what we say is we say I am
experiencing the body I am experiencing the I thought I
am having an intuition right because I is the perceiver
that's perceiving all of experience notice though that this perceiver
or source self is itself not an experience now that's
very odd because on the one hand you feel like
you've experienced all this stuff in life and all you
have of life is experienced there is nothing else to
life but experience so become conscious of that but also
now become conscious of the fact that you are not
an experience what you are physically metaphysically existentially is not
an experience and cannot be an experience because every single
experience you've ever had in your life has changed and
will change and changes on a moment-to-moment basis so the
question is what actually are you because right now you've
been following with me what you are is a question
mark I mean we could say that you're a perceiver
but what this perceiver is we have no clue or
where it is we don't even know where it's located
you might say well it's located in my skull obviously
or maybe in my chest or in my throat or
somewhere in the body but that's not how how can
you be sure you haven't even figured out what it
is and you certainly have it located it because if
you located it you could tell me what it is
and if you do happen to locate something and you
say well leo that's it well what you're pointing at
is another experience you don't actually believe you're that thing
you believe you're the perceiver of that thing so notice
that this is a very slippery game that we play
is that whatever we point to by definition cannot be
us because it's an experience and we're not an experience
more than one perceiving the experience your mind should be
opening up now to a very interesting possibility and this
possibility is that it's never really occurred to you to
question what you are existentially before in your entire life
you've just kind of assumed that you're there and that
you exist and that you are something tangible and very
real and yet when you actually look into the matter
as hard as you try and you can try for
hundreds of hours you will discover that you cannot find
yourself so could it be that what you are is
something very different than you assumed let's examine some of
your core assumptions core assumption number one is that you
exist it's almost unthinkable to question this assumption because well
here you are holding the assumption so obviously you exist
right well let's just be very open minded and just
take this as an assumption so assumption number one is
that you exist assumption number two is that you are
an object or a thing that can be found that
can be located that has a shape and assumption number
three is that you are located in space right you
assume that you're located somewhere you're not without location so
those are three core assumptions you hold now my question
to you if you're very open-minded could any of these
assumptions be wrong how can you be sure that these
assumptions are all true now you might say well leo
these are some very very basic self-evident assumptions they can't
be otherwise but I want you to consider very carefully
that we're looking into the very nature of your existence
we're looking to something very very existentially in a very
fundamental basic way we're looking at the very basic building
blocks of life so your assumptions about what could or
couldn't be true be careful about that because those are
based on everyday normal experience they are not based upon
deep existential investigation and also notice that you have no
frame of reference in this investigation because what we're calling
you yourself what you are it's not like you've been
a hundred different human beings so you have no frame
of reference because you have no experience you've never been
someone else have you you've only been yourself so we're
dealing with one example the only example so we can't
really know what's probable or improbable what's realistic or what's
far-fetched because we only have one example and we can't
compare it to anything else and what you are is
not comparable to a chair or a car or a
tree or a planet or a galaxy or a molecule
or anything else like that because those are all again
experiences what you are is a very different thing so
could it be that your very nature is radically different
from ordinary everyday objects and could it be the sum
of these assumptions you hold that you are an object
that you're located in space and even that you exist
that some of these assumptions are groundless and just assumptions
made carelessly without careful investigation into whether they are true
or not what want you to consider is the possibility
that you've been misled from birth that you were born
and people starting with your parents started pointing at you
and saying that's you the body the brain the mind
this is you and you went through school and you
went to college and you interact with all your friends
and everyone assumed this from the very beginning but all
this was a mistake you've been misled by people who
were themselves misled and never took the time to look
very carefully into who they were they just assumed that
they were a body a mind and a brain this
isn't so far-fetched because after all you do acknowledge that
indoctrination is possible especially with young human beings you know
that if we take a child and we indoctrinate this
child from the very moment he is born and we
tell him some religious ideology or some political philosophy that
this child without knowing any better if he grows up
in Vaught in that environment he will believe unquestionably whatever
he's been taught and that will get program and sort
of imprinted into his mind and it'll be very difficult
for him to see the world in any other way
so now what I want you to do as part
of this visualization is I want you to actually imagine
that this child is you and that when you were
born and growing up and all the way up to
today you have been indoctrinated not in a malicious way
but in an unconscious way with a ideology that what
you are is an object a body a mind and
a brain and that actually this is not true just
open your mind to that possibility remember this is just
a thought experiment I'm not telling you to believe me
I'm not saying this is absolutely true I'm just saying
just imagine it for the next few minutes as a
thought experiment and now again look very closely keep your
eyes still closed look very closely inside yourself and try
to find what we're calling the source self the perceiver
of all your experiences try to find you notice that
anything that you grasp on to as you isn't you
notice how the mind scrambles and tries to cling to
one thing after another thing after another thing but that
nothing that it clings to is actually you it's like
sand that slips through your fingers and now here's the
critical step of this entire inquiry process make sure you
do this right here again look for the source self
really try to pinpoint what you are what are you
physically existentially metaphysically like really no nonsense no hocus pocus
no philosophy no religious just what argue right now in
your direct experience find yourself notice again that you failed
you fail to find yourself now here's the kicker listen
very close right in the moment of failing to find
yourself what I want you to notice is that actually
you're not failing when you're grasping and it feels like
you're grasping at empty air and that nothing you grasp
is actually you and that what you are is intangible
notice that happening right now for you and it feels
like you're failing to grasp on your still you're looking
you're looking for an object to grasp onto what I
want you to notice is that actually you're not failing
you found yourself what you are is you are this
empty nothing that you're grasping inside of but you're telling
yourself that can't be me I have to be a
thing and I what I to open your mind to
is to the possibility that you are purely nothing you
exist but you exist as nothing and that there is
no content or experience that is you and that it
will never ever be found because what you are is
you are nothing you are it that is you that
is real that is as real as real gets and
that this nothingness it exists and not only does it
exist but it is also self-aware it is an inherently
self-aware nothingness now notice that whatever image you might have
or opinion or idea you might have of this nothing
as that is not nothing else that's not what I'm
talking about what I'm telling you is to be actually
become that which you have been failing to find become
it you are it there's really nothing for you to
do here because you are it you've always been it
it's the only one constant that's existed from the moment
you were born to today in fact it's existed before
you were even born nothing is not darkness or blackness
don't confuse nothing with that this nothing is not also
your idea of nothing or an experience of nothing remember
that anything you experience is not nothing what I'm talking
about here is actual honest-to-god nothing it is not an
experience you cannot grasp it with your mind you could
not think about it cognitively this nothing is not an
object it is not a thing it is not located
in any space it has no Cartesian coordinates it is
not big it is not small it is not tall
it is not short it is not wide it is
not thin it is not solid it is not empty
it has no color it has no shape it has
no smell no taste no anything this nothing instead of
being located it is an infinite field so try to
be no don't just imagine actually become the infinite nothing
field that you are this field is self-aware all experience
occurs within this field the field itself is not an
experience experience is what occurs inside the field and this
is actually are physically metaphysically and existentially this is what
you are you are a self-aware field of nothingness that
stretches out to infinity and has no end and no
beginning and no boundary and is absolutely constant bask in
that let whatever you're experiencing be okay don't try to
force anything or change anything just be open to whatever
comes to you even if what comes to you is
not something that you want or expected don't try to
fake the experience of nothingness either it came to you
or it didn't let either way be okay good now
go ahead and open your eyes and that's the end
of the guided visualization but I still have a few
things that I want to tell to you so don't
and the episode yet two things happen here either you
did have a direct experience of nothingness or you didn't
now if you didn't have a direct experience of nothingness
don't worry it's fine most people will not have a
direct experience of nothingness from doing this just once I
have done way over a thousand hours of this type
of work and only once out of those let's say
thousand hours I don't even know how many hours I've
lost track only once have I had a direct experience
so it can be a rare thing and it can
take a lot of work to just get to the
point where you can open your mind up sufficiently or
you can even be open to this experience the problem
is that most people mines are way too closed to
even get close to having this experience now I'm using
the word experience because there's no other word that we
have in the English language so I'm calling it an
experience even though it's not really an experience now if
you did have some kind of direct experience of this
nothing of what you actually are then congratulations don't freak
out it's normal to be scared when you have this
experience for the first time in your life it's a
very radical experience because you've never experienced yourself in your
entire life until now that's a huge accomplishment congratulations it
can be scary because this nothingness is very radically different
for what you believed you were and you've been very
very misled for the entirety of your life it's like
you've awoken for the first time in your life it's
a life transforming experience don't freak out it's not a
negative experience very positive experience but it can seem negative
from the egos point of view because it's very threatening
to your old way of looking at the world take
the time to clarify what you experience here if you
did experience something actually clarify this nothingness what is it
is it really you take a time to look at
it write it down if you need to if you
had something important occur for you because the clarification of
it really helps for you to solidify in your own
mind what this thing was it's a very mysterious and
paradoxical thing if you didn't have an experience like most
of you probably didn't then just keep noticing that if
you look and you try to locate yourself you actually
can't you can't find yourself there's a reason for that
it's because you're not an object and you're not located
in space keep questioning why you assume that you are
an object why would you assume that is that just
something you heard from your parents from your teachers is
that just something that seems reasonable to you seems intuitive
to you is that something that just science told you
will just keep in mind that all these people they
may not know who they are either so the things
they tell you and the assumptions you pick up from
our culture could be very flawed assumptions after all if
you were born 2,000 years ago chances are you had
the assumption that the earth is flat so our culture
dramatically influences our assumptions about reality and don't think that
just because we're living in a modern scientific era full
of technology that we are immune to wrong assumptions about
the core existential nature of reality that is something that
as a culture and even as science we still haven't
conquered we have a long way to go before we
conquer that as a collective culture that's why it takes
an extremely radically open mind what I'm claiming though is
that this practice here is a very profound practice you
can do this by yourself you can re-watch this episode
many many times you can listen to it I encourage
you to do it hundreds thousands of times until you
break through and discover empirically that you are nothing because
this is not a theory of mine this is not
something I just concocted sitting there in my room like
Oh what kind of interesting metaphysical mumbo-jumbo could I come
up to just tell people that they could believe that's
not what I'm doing here I'm claiming this is an
empirical discovery that you can make if you are open-minded
enough that's really all it takes is just radical open-mindedness
and then just persistence with looking looking looking looking looking
looking looking and not giving way to distraction this nothingness
that you are is the most profound thing that you
can discover in all of life this nothingness is eternal
which means that it exists outside of time and space
time and space are conceptual constructs that occur within this
nothingness these are very radical ideas they're more than ideas
they're actually realities but the danger is that you take
them as ideas and beliefs and as soon as you
do you're nowhere you're back in the delusion of your
mind this nothingness is eternal and it's also self-aware so
this nothingness don't confuse it with some existential bleak depressing
nothingness this nothingness is the most divine beautiful Oh inspiring
miraculous thing that you can discover it's not a thing
but we have no words in the English language or
not a thing other than nothingness you see ours it's
self-aware but it's not a human being it's not a
molecule it's not an atom it's not matter it's not
energy it's not spirit or soul what you might call
I mean you could call it that but that just
really gets you lost in labels and ideas that aren't
very helpful this is the neti neti method old old
old ancient method all you're doing is you're just sitting
you're trying to find what you actually are and you
keep failing over and over and over and over and
over again and you're going to fail tens of thousands
if not hundreds of thousands of times until your brain
can't take it anymore it becomes too painful and finally
what happens that there is a surrender and you surrender
to the fact that the thing you are not finding
is actually you you can't find it because you assume
that you're something and what you are is nothing so
it's like you're looking for a needle in the haystack
and the needle turns out to be the air the
empty air that is between the the haystack but that
can take a lot of work to crack that nut
can take a lot of work to crack so I
encourage you to keep at it keep your faith keep
going for it remember this is not a belief system
this is an empirical discovery that anyone can make including
you all right that's it I'm signing off go ahead
