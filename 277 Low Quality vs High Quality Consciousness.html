            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/Hg8JDHlkIrM' target='_blank'>Low Quality vs High Quality Consciousness</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Understanding Low Quality vs High Quality Consciousness</b>: Here, Leo Gura explains the difference between low quality consciousness and high quality consciousness. 
</li><li>- <b>Prime Directive for Life</b>: The prime directive, or main goal, for humans and all life forms is increasing the quality of consciousness. Consciousness is defined as the degree of accurate perception of reality. Increasing consciousness means improving the accuracy of perception.
</li><li>- <b>Opportunities to Increase Consciousness</b>: Every action, interaction, and decision in life is a chance to raise our consciousness. These include relationships, career opportunities, lifestyle choices, etc. Keeping the consciousness low leads to inaccurate perceptions of reality and consequently, problems in life.
</li><li>- <b>Characteristics of Low-Quality Consciousness</b>: This type of consciousness is characterized by ego, fear, dogma, rigid beliefs, materialism, and a focus on short-term gains. It leads to mechanical behavior, selective love, and unequal treatment of others.
</li><li>- <b>Characteristics of High-Quality Consciousness</b>: High-quality consciousness, on the other hand, is selfless, fearless, and focuses on direct experiences and truthful understanding of reality. It values learning and growth, spontaneous and organic responses to situations, and takes full responsibility for actions and emotions. It also acknowledges that there's always room for further growth.
</li><li>- <b>Increasing Quality Consciousness</b>: Leo Gura emphasizes that consciousness can and should be worked on regularly. He defines an increase in consciousness as an enhancement in the ability to perceive reality accurately, which can be achieved through everyday life choices and interactions. Paying attention to these everyday opportunities for growth is essential as it leads to better understanding and navigation of relationships and recognition of behavioral patterns. 
</li><li>- <b>Impact of Consciousness Levels</b>: Consciousness levels have a significant impact on the quality of life. Low quality consciousness stuck in mechanical behavior and inaccurate perception of reality leads to problems. High quality consciousness, being more accurate in perception, driven by direct experiences, learning, and growth, can lead to improved values, behaviors, and decisions, significantly enhancing life's quality.
</li><li><b>Understanding Quality of Consciousness through Emotions & Motivations</b>: Leo Gura presents two key factors to gauge an individual's consciousness level: feelings and motivations. He suggests that our habitual emotions invariably reveal our level of consciousness. Negative emotions indicate a low-quality consciousness while more positive feelings suggest a higher consciousness quality. 
</li><li><b>Monitoring Emotional Responses</b>: Connecting negative emotional reactions (like anger) to specific scenarios or events can be indicative of low-quality consciousness. These emotions serve as a barometer, signaling what needs to be monitored and perhaps changed in one's life. Unfortunately, many individuals with low-quality consciousness often suppress or numb these signaling emotions, leading to disregard for important life changes. 
</li><li><b>Understanding One's Motivation</b>: Motivation offers another insight into the quality of one's consciousness. Analyzing daily micro-level motivations can be instrumental in defining one's consciousness level. These motivations range from the drive towards materialistic gains like money or easy entertainment to acts of compassion and generosity. 
</li><li><b>Measuring Consciousness</b>: Analyzing feelings and motivations at different intervals and in varied life situations provides insights into one's consciousness quality. Self-governing capabilities and personal motivations can likewise reflect a person's consciousness level. 
</li><li><b>Suppressing Motivations and Feelings</b>: Long-term suppression of true feelings and motivations can have negative repercussions, often leading to life dissatisfaction and corroding personal and professional relationships. Understanding and accepting one's feelings and motivations can be key to enhancing consciousness quality. 
</li><li><b>Addressing the Feeling of Unhappiness</b>: People often question their discontentment or unhappiness with life. Leo suggests that such feelings can be seen as an indication of low-quality consciousness. He emphasizes the importance of recognizing the correlation between our feelings, our motivations, and our consciousness quality.
</li><li><b>Understanding Negative Emotions</b>: Negative emotions, such as depression, sadness or frustration, indicate low quality consciousness. These feelings serve as signs that one needs to raise their consciousness. Therefore, the solution to overcome these negative emotions is to raise one's level of consciousness, although the specific methods may vary.
</li><li><b>Perceptions of External Factors</b>: Many attribute their unhappiness or depression to external factors such as genetic predisposition, appearance, or personal failures, but these are illusions. The true root of such feelings lies in the quality of one's consciousness.
</li><li><b>Pursuit of Success, Sex, and Money</b>: The pursuit of success, sex and money, while not inherently wrong, are hallmarks of low quality consciousness. High quality consciousness individuals have generally transcended these motivators, understanding that they are not truly fulfilling and have the potential to waste one's life. Transcending these cravings allows for more fulfilling pursuits such as creativity, contribution, and deeper relationships.
</li><li><b>Fear of Being Walked Over</b>: There's a common concern that high consciousness individuals may become doormats, being walked over by others. However, high consciousness individuals are aware and fearless, capable of enforcing boundaries and obtaining what they deserve, unlike low consciousness individuals who allow themselves to be abused. Raising one's consciousness can resolve the issue of being 'a doormat'.
</li><li><b>Increasing Consciousness</b>: Increasing one's consciousness involves several elements including increasing the capacity to love, to feel happy independent of circumstances, to be intellectually open, and to face fear. It is about increasing awareness in all areas of life, and actively seeking ways to raise consciousness. Leo emphasizes this as the prime directive of every individual, and suggests it should influence career choices, aligning them with one's values and allowing for creativity.
</li><li><b>Daily Opportunities to Raise Consciousness</b>: He encourages individuals to pay attention to the opportunities for personal growth that arise regularly throughout the day, even in mundane tasks or situations. Seizing these opportunities for self-improvement can significantly enhance personal development and increase consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Confronting Fear</b>: Fear, both subtle and obvious, plays a role in our daily lives but it often stems from a desire to protect and enhance our ego and personal interests. Increasing consciousness involves recognizing and transcending these selfish motives, becoming fearless and more open to confrontation and enforcing boundaries.
</li><li><b>Increasing capacity for self-governance</b>: This aspect involves effectively controlling one's behaviors and actions. It is a difficult but vital step in raising consciousness levels and requires continuous effort and lifelong learning. Various techniques can be utilized to increase self-governance and curb procrastination, such as strategic thinking. 
</li><li><b>Increasing capacity to face fear</b>: Fears, both subtle and major, control our lives more than we might realize. These fears can prompt selfish behavior and attitudes, which hinders our consciousness growth. Addressing these fears nstead of dodging them is vital to refining consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Transcending selfish and protective motives</b>: Achieving a high level of consciousness involves overcoming the desire to protect and enhance personal ego and interests. Opportunities to transcend these motives and thus improve consciousness arise every day and should be seized for personal growth. 
</li><li><b>The directive of human life is to increase consciousness</b>: The primary goal of life is to enhance the quality of one's consciousness. This involves actively seeking opportunities for personal growth instead of relying solely on external workshops, seminars, or enlightening events. Even capturing 5-10% more growth opportunities daily can massively boost levels of development. Incremental improvements in consciousness over time lead to a better understanding of relationships and behavior patterns, ultimately enhancing the quality of life.
</li><li><b>Application of increasing consciousness principles</b>: These principles should be applied as a continuous practice in everyday life rather than simply a theoretical concept. Practice involves applying these principles to every aspect of life, even amidst the mundane tasks. The key focus needs to be on pursuing consciousness-raising opportunities rather than seeking pleasure, avoiding pain, or material gain. Without continuous practice, there is a risk of falling into low consciousness behaviors, leading to a decrease in the overall quality of life.
