            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/ufkb8vvbO3k' target='_blank'>Why People Seem Crazy</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Misconceptions about People</b>: Leo Gura discusses the common misconceptions usually held about people, stating that we often tend to believe that everyone is similar to us and wired the same way. He points out that this misconception leads to problems as we define and judge others based on our standards.
</li><li><b>Models of Understanding People</b>: Leo presents two fundamental models that people use to interpret human behavior - "Sameness Model" and "Difference Model". Most people adhere to the first one, believing that everyone shares the same perspectives and experiences, which often leads to misunderstandings, conflict, and miscommunication. 
</li><li><b>Inaccuracies of Sameness Model</b>: Highlighting the fallacies of the Sameness Model, Leo argues that assuming everyone else must be wired similar to us and viewing those who differ from our behavior as misbehaving, results in a narrow understanding of humans and a tendency to falsely label different behavior as 'crazy', 'evil' and 'less than human'.
</li><li><b>The Difference Model</b>: Leo moves towards advocating for the "Difference Model" which proposes that each individual is unique and perceives reality differently. This model urges for a better understanding and acceptance of differences among people, which in turn can lead to improved relationships and a decrease in conflicts.
</li><li><b>Problems Caused by the Sameness Model</b>: Leo outlines the negative implications of using the Sameness Model, including fundamental misunderstandings of people, adversarial relationships, and improper labeling of individuals based on our standards and beliefs. The model also dismisses diversity, limiting our understanding and acceptance of others.
</li><li><b>Diversity of Human Beings</b>: Leo emphasizes that the human psyche is far more diverse than what the Sameness Model can accommodate. By sticking to this model, we isolate ourselves from a vast array of human experiences and perspectives causing us to incorrectly label others as 'foreigners' because they don't think or behave like us.
</li><li><b>Switching Models for a Broader Understanding</b>: Leo stresses the importance of switching from the Sameness Model to the Difference Model for a broader and more accurate understanding of human behavior. Recognizing that each individual is wired differently and lives in their unique reality allows for a deeper, more empathetic understanding of others, preventing conflicts and misunderstandings.
</li><li><b>Implication on Personal Relationships</b>: Moving onto the implications of these models on personal relationships, Leo reveals that differences in wiring can lead to misunderstandings and troubles in relationships, especially when parents expect their children to think and behave like them, not realizing that their child might have a different perspective on reality due to different brain wiring.
</li><li><b>Potential for Friction and Tribalism</b>: Leo explains that assuming everyone is similar to us can lead to friction and tribalism, as we surround ourselves with like-minded individuals and alienate those who disagree or live differently. He encourages stepping into someone else's shoes to understand their unique perspectives, thus bridging the gap between different thought models.
</li><li><b>Overcoming Tribalism and Misunderstandings</b>: In conclusion, Leo emphasizes on the need for a 'change in paradigm' from the Sameness Model to the Difference Model in understanding people. He advocates for empathy and understanding, stating that every individual lives in their own unique reality and that appreciating differences among people is essential to overcome misunderstandings and conflicts.
</li><li><b>How Humans Relate to Each Other on a Collective and Individual Level</b>: Leo Gura explains the harmful effects of the sameness model, in which individuals expect everyone to act, think, and look like they do. This leads to a lack of acceptance of others, frustration, anger, and even violence. It results in people labelling those who are different as inferior or deluded, leading to mistreatment. Human history shows an evolution towards more tolerance, which contributes to better interpersonal relationships. 
</li><li><b>Introduction of the Difference Model</b>: The difference model recognizes the individual genetic and physiological uniqueness of humans across races, genders, and even individual to individual. Depression, moods, strengths, weaknesses, desires, fears, motivations, levels of self-discipline, pain tolerance, and brain chemistry all vary among people, greatly influencing their life experiences. Furthermore, spiritual attuneness differs greatly among individuals. 
</li><li><b>Differences in Perception of Reality</b>: The difference model argues that each individual lives in their own reality; there is no one canonical physical reality. In other words, what we perceive as physical reality is the alignment of our individual realities, and conflicts arise when these realities are not aligned. Leo suggests shifting from the sameness model to the difference model, claiming the latter to be more accurate based on empirical evidence.
</li><li><b>The Big Five Aspects of Personality</b>: Psychologists have identified five major aspects of personality that map the behavioral diversity in humans: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. Each has subcomponents and exists on a spectrum, contributing to individual differences. This empirical data undermines the sameness model, supporting the difference model instead. 
</li><li><b>Physiological and Psychological Influences on Differences</b>: The difference model acknowledges that not only our genetic makeup and upbringing, but also the chemical composition of our brains can contribute to how we perceive and interact with the world around us. Differences also exist in spiritual attunement among individuals. Leo suggests that terms like 'physical reality' and 'sameness model' could be flawed as they don't consider the individual variations and different realities people inhabit.
</li><li><b>Understanding Personality Traits and Attitudes</b>: Leo Gura explains that differing levels of openness between individuals can cause disagreements and misunderstandings, as it influences their lifestyle, interests, and beliefs. This can particularly create friction between partners. He urges recognizing these individual differences and understanding that each personality trait serves a purpose in the functioning of human society.
</li><li><b>Appreciating Differences between Individuals</b>: Leo emphasizes the importance of appreciating different perspectives and personalities, rather than trying to impose ones characteristics on others. He asserts that no single set of personality characteristics can be deemed superior, optimal, or perfect. All personality traits have their specific strengths and roles, just like the different types of ants in an ant colony.
</li><li><b>Importance of Recognizing Individual Perceptions of Reality</b>: Leo discusses that each person constructs their own reality based on their individual perspectives, personalities, and environments. He warns against treating everyone the same and urges understanding and respect for the diversity and uniqueness of individuals' perceptions and experiences.
</li><li><b>Sexual Orientation and Its Influences</b>: He stresses that sexual orientation is not merely a matter of personal preference but is influenced by an individual's wiring, early upbringing, and prenatal factors. He explains that there is a spectrum of sexual orientations, and it will be an error to dismiss what seems "weird" or "edge case" as merely deviant behavior.
</li><li><b>Understanding Addiction Potential</b>: Leo highlights that addiction is not just a moral failing but is influenced by brain chemistry and individual personalities. Therefore, it is crucial to approaching addicts with empathy and understanding, recognizing that their addictive tendencies could be linked to their unique physiological and psychological circumstances.
</li><li><b>Guidance for Parents</b>: Leo advises parents to approach their children's issues, such as addiction, with understanding and compassion, recognizing their unique circumstances and personal struggles. This approach should replace condemnation and an expectation for the child to be like the parent. Addictive tendencies can result from differing genetics, environmental influences, and individual experiences. 
</li><li><b>Avoiding Judgement and Condemnation</b>: Leo encourages viewers to avoid judging and condemning others based on their sexual orientations or addiction potentials. Instead, he insists on understanding that these tendencies might result from their unique physiological and psychological circumstances.
</li><li><b>Implications of Brain Chemistry and Trauma</b>: Leo Gura explains that actions typically regarded as deviations or criminal, such as sexual predatory behavior, are not necessarily borne out of moral degradation. Instead, these actions may be rooted in traumatic past experiences or irreparable changes in brain chemistry caused by maternal stress or drug abuse during fetal development. He emphasizes the need for empathy and urges us to put ourselves in the shoes of individuals engaging in such behaviors for an in-depth understanding of their circumstances.
</li><li><b>Unconventional Behavioral Patterns</b>: Leo highlights the extreme differences in human behavior, stating that individuals all have unique ways of functioning, which often stem from mental conditions or brain disorders. He mentions that such disorders could be a result of physical damage to the brain. Resulting from accidents or strokes. Gura suggests the study of mental illness and brain disorders as a potential avenue to better understand why some people behave in "weird" ways.
</li><li><b>Depiction of Reality Based on Neurological Conditions</b>: Leo Gura exemplifies patients with certain brain conditions that lead to stark differences in their perception of reality. He narrates the story of a patient who hallucinates dancing dwarves and a miniature elephant due to damage in his visual cortex from an accident. Another example involves a patient who sees others as androids, not human beings, due to the deactivation of a specific brain module. Gura suggests that these examples underline the extent to which our physical reality is influenced by brain function, and arguably, each person inhabits a unique reality due to neurological differences.
</li><li><b>Understanding and Compassion for Behavior caused by Brain Conditions</b>: Gura points out that some individuals' behaviors, arising out of their unique realities, might seem strange to others who operate within different contexts. Crucially, he argues that understanding the neurological basis for these differences can generate greater tolerance and compassion. As everyone's experience of the world is so diverse, it is essential to refrain from judgment based on shared or "normal" perceptions of reality.
</li><li><b>Cases of Extreme Behavior Due to Brain Disorders</b>: Lastly, Gura narrates an exceptional case where a man, due to specific brain issues, perceives his father as an Android and ends up killing him in an attempt to expose the assumed mechanical parts within his skull. This story exemplifies how individual perspectives shaped by neurological conditions can differ drastically from what might be considered normal, leading to extreme behavior not understood in the average societal context.
</li><li><b>Understanding Varying Brain Chemistry and Genetics</b>: Leo Gura discusses the idea that each person's brain chemistry and genetics differ slightly, leading to variations in how people perceive the world. Although most people don't have brain disorders, minute differences in the brain can mold people's worldviews and experiences in subtle ways. He asserts that different environments and circumstances can shape the brain's wiring for survival and reproduction, emphasizing the individuality of each person's consciousness. 
</li><li><b>Influence of Brain Disorders and Pineal Gland on Perception</b>: Gura shares the case of an artist named Shawn Thornton who began creating intricate, spiritually significant paintings after being diagnosed with cancer of the pineal gland. These changes in art style are thought to result from increased DMT production in the brain due to the pineal gland cancer. This case supports the hypothesis that changes in the brain can result in altered mental states and experiences. 
</li><li><b>Divergent Views on Spirituality</b>: Gura posits that the vast variation in human views on spirituality cannot simply be attributed to different personalities and cultures. He suggests that some individuals may genuinely experience phenomena like spirits, demons, and aliens due to certain neurological mechanisms in their brains. These mechanisms, shaped by natural selection, result in different consciousness capacities and realities. This explains why only a select few are deeply interested in spirituality or enlightenmentthey might just be differently wired, and interested in conceptualizing existential truths. 
</li><li><b>Limitations of Enlightenment and Need for Appreciating Differences</b>: While Gura believes that 99% of people can attain enlightenment, he asserts that most people lack the necessary inclination due to their unique wiring. Highlighting that some individuals struggle more with certain aspects such as addiction or depression, he underscores the importance of understanding and appreciating individual differences. Despite the challenges, Gura promotes the idea that people should continue to strive for personal growth, while embracing and respecting diversity.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of individual traits and struggles</b>: Leo Gura highlights the need for understanding that individuals can have different struggles such as with addiction or depression, and this divergence should not be simplified as a universal human experience. Drawing comparison to motivational speakers who encourage ambition, he points out that individuals may have different experiences of motivation due to their unique states of reality, indicating that people's struggles and abilities are often shaped by their individual characteristics.
</li><li><b>Awareness of individual strengths and weaknesses</b>: Gura emphasizes the importance of recognizing individual strengths and weaknesses in different aspects of life. He provides an example of weightlifting, pointing out that what is easy and enjoyable for one person due to their physical or psychological traits, can be very difficult for another person with different attributes. The mistake here is to assume that those struggling are simply weak or lazy, instead of recognizing that individual characteristics can impact how a person is naturally inclined towards certain activities. 
</li><li><b>Concept of suitability over laziness</b>: Leo Gura suggests that individuals who face difficulties in certain aspects of life are not necessarily lazy, but may have a physiological or psychological unsuitability for the tasks at hand. For example, a person with low energy levels due to a thyroid issue may struggle with tasks that are easily accomplished by others without this condition.
</li><li><b>Acceptance of nature's optimized roles</b>: Gura arguments that harmful or controversial societal roles, such as criminals or terrorists, might be a part of nature's necessary optimization process, making an overall evolutionary progress. This doesn't mean condoning their behavior, but understanding that nature is efficient in its function and every role serves a purpose within the larger context.
</li><li><b>Understanding of diversity</b>: Gura criticizes the ego-centric morality that condemns diversity in human behavior and roles, labeling some as 'evil', 'crazy', or 'wrong'. He stresses the importance of a global perspective that appreciates and accepts the reality of diversity, instead of dismissing it.
</li><li><b>Value of self-improvement within individual limits</b>: Leo cautions against using the difference model of people as an excuse to avoid self-improvement or to justify bad behavior. Despite individual limitations, humans can still change their behavior and should strive for a compassionate existence that does not harm others. 
</li><li><b>Dangers of superiority complexes</b>: Gura warns against the misinterpretation of his words to support the idea of racial or personal superiority. He emphasizes that differences are contextual and that no race or type of human being is inherently superior than others. 
</li><li><b>Potential for achieving personal goals</b>: Even with individual differences and potential limitations, Gura emphasizes that personal growth and the achievement of life goals are still possible. He warns against using one's limitations as an excuse, and stresses that it's important to acknowledge, work with, and develop one's individual strengths and weaknesses. It's all about strategic self-improvement.
</li><li><b>Effort for success and spiritual enlightenment despite genetics</b>: Despite our genetic makeup, we should continue to put forth effort in our pursuits, whether for success or spiritual enlightenment. Differences do exist, so the effort required for reaching a certain level of achievement or spiritual attainment can be more or less for some individuals. Notions of limitations should not be used as an excuse to avoid effort, but rather as motivation for strategic hard work.
</li><li><b>Importance of societal rules and compassionate law enforcement</b>: Society should create law and order that does not allow harmful behaviours. However, while punishing lawbreakers, it is important to eschew vengeance and condemnation, and instead understand their backgrounds, genetic factors or mental health disorders that may have influenced their actions. An understanding, sympathetic approach could focus more on rehabilitation and healing rather than just punishment. 
</li><li><b>Let people be, refrain from being judgemental and embrace new worldviews</b>: Let people lead their lives as they wish, as long as they are not causing harm to themselves or others. Keep an open mind about different lifestyles and worldviews, realizing that everyone has their own unique experiences and perspectives influenced by their genetics and upbringing. Avoid judging, condemning, and moralizing other people's behaviors without full understanding of their situation.
</li><li><b>Beware of advice influenced by personal perspectives</b>: When giving advice, consider that advice suited to you may not be well suited for others due to their unique circumstances. Consider the receiver's unique perspective and life situation while giving advice.
</li><li><b>Role models and the pursuit of authenticity</b>: Be careful while choosing role models as trying to imitate their actions might restrict you from discovering and expressing your authentic self. While they can be sources of inspiration, it's crucial to avoid distorting your own connection to your authentic identity. It's essential to craft your lifestyle around your personality type and your needs.
</li><li><b>Openness to alternative worldviews and understanding has its benefits</b>: Being open to alternative worldviews aids personal growth. Understanding the context-dependent nature of strengths and weaknesses can be highly beneficial. 
</li><li><b>The importance of crafting one's lifestyle around individual personality</b>: Information needs to be taken into account, but ultimately, an individual needs to discover their strengths, weaknesses, needs and issues and craft their lifestyle around their unique personality type. This requires a deep connection to one's authentic self and a lifestyle that reflects one's individuality and personal context. 
</li><li><b>Sustaining Effort and Embracing Authenticity</b>: Goals and dreams should still be pursued despite genetic limitations, and hard work and effort are still required. It is vital to allow people to embrace their authentic selves, appreciate diversity and remain open to alternate lifestyles and viewpoints. Individuals should strive to be true to themselves while also being open to learning from different perspectives and experiences. 
</li><li><b>Understanding other's reality as a factor in giving advice</b>: More caution should be exercised before giving advice or making judgments about other people's behaviors, as they may be victims of circumstances beyond their control. This awareness promotes a more compassionate approach towards others and fosters understanding and patience. 
</li><li><b>Emulating role models and authenticity</b>: While it can be motivational to emulate successful people or role models, it is crucial to remember that these individuals might have unique abilities or situations that contributed to their success. Instead of imitating others, individuals should strive to authenticate themselves and build a lifestyle that suits their personality type. It is critical to appreciate the distinctiveness of each person's experiences, strengths, and issues.
