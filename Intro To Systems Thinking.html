hey leo here for actualised dot-org and in this episode
I'm really excited to be introducing you to systems thinking
[Music] you this is another one of those foundational episodes
which you will only really be able to appreciate once
you complete it and you get to see how powerful
systems thinking is most people do not understand what this
is and why it's so damn powerful so it's gonna
take us a little bit of work to get into
the juicy details but I promise you that this will
be worth your time especially if you are on track
with your life purpose and you want to that so
what is systems thinking it's a way of looking at
the world as a series of interconnected webs very nuanced
very detail webs webs within webs within webs systems within
systems within systems and all of these interacting with each
other in interesting and counterintuitive ways so Systems thinking is
about seeing the world from this sort of meta perspective
stepping out of your personal perspective your own agenda or
your clans little agenda and seeing the larger systems that
constitute the functioning of our government of environments of economies
of the whole globe and ultimately the entire cosmos living
systems and also nonliving systems it's studying how systems work
recognizing that there are certain laws and principles that govern
systems and that these can be studied and learned through
observation and through analysis and also through integrating a lot
of stuff on in a holistic sort of way and
it's also about studying the traps that befall us when
we try to change and manipulate systems one of the
most interesting things you'll learn in life is that when
you manipulate a complex system it behaves in ways that
you didn't expect and that it might create results that
are opposite of what you intended and it really then
is important to learn why that happens if you want
to be successful at manipulating these systems and that's what
systems thinking is really for it's for changing things that
are larger than yourself so it's not just about how
you become successful and how does your family become successful
that you can probably accomplish without studying system thinking but
if you want to understand and change how government works
how corporations work how the environment functions and many other
things like that then those are all things that are
outside of you that are larger than you and then
it's really important to learn systems thinking why is systems
thinking so important well there's a variety of reasons I
already mentioned that it's very difficult to change a system
to get it to work the way that you want
it to work unless you understand the nuances and the
laws and the traps that are there so that's very
important it's important for your life purpose if you found
your life purpose if you've taken my life purpose course
then that's something you're on track with but now the
challenge you have after you found your life purpose is
well how do I accomplish it how do I have
that kind of big impact that I want to have
in the world so that's one real reason why you
would want to study systems thinking is because to make
a meaningful positive impact in the world you're going to
be changing some kind of system to do that so
that's your life purpose is to have this kind of
specific impact that you want to have but then how
do you do that because you probably noticed that the
system resists you trying to change it that's the challenge
of fulfilling on your life purpose actualize in your life
purpose that's not easy to do so if you want
to be a leader a visionary a designer and architect
an artist all of these people their lives and their
careers are all about making a meaningful impact in the
world they need to understand systems thinking really really well
so this is perfect for you the other reason that
you want to understand systems thinking is actually for your
own benefit not just about changing the world but also
for yourself because as I've talked about before it is
a bit of a complex and geeky topic which is
spiral dynamics I've introduced this model before spiral dynamics if
you understand what that is I'm just going to give
a very brief nutshell explanation of it here basically a
guy by the name of Clare graves he studied how
psyches evolved both individual psyches within human beings but also
collective psyches organizations governments and so forth he studied this
and he discovered that there are wrongs there are stages
of evolution through which the psyche goes through and each
rung is defined by a different set of values and
a different perspective on the world so all these stages
that you can move up through if you're growing if
your self actualize you're gonna be moving up this this
ladder and at every stage has a different way of
seeing the world and so what's really important is for
you to move up to stage yellow stage yellow is
a pretty high stage in spiral dynamics model and that's
all characterized by systems thinking so this is the first
stage and I'm not gonna go into all the other
stages you can see my other episodes on that but
the stage yellow what is different about it is that
it's for the first time aware of the fact that
there are stages it's gotten to the point where it
starts to see the world in terms of systems and
so a lot of what I'm gonna be talking today
is gonna be a very detailed characterization of what it's
like to look at the world from a stage yellow
perspective now if you're at the lower stages you might
not find it immediately palatable you might not see the
benefits of seeing the world this way well that just
means you're gonna need to grow to it and what's
spiral dynamics tells you is that there is a very
linear path that one grows through as they evolve in
their consciousness and their inner development and so if you
want to grow to the highest stages with self-actualization then
you're gonna have to evolve yourself to stage yellow you're
probably not a stage yellow right now maybe you're able
to just tap into it barely but the more you
study systems thinking the more you start to see the
world through stage yellow glasses then the more you're encouraging
your psyche to to evolve up this up this hierarchy
and that's a really important thing because stage yellow is
the first stage that's really reflecting on itself and become
self-aware and that becomes important because that allows you to
avoid many of the disasters that befall you individually but
also us collectively by not being able to self reflect
and to see the world for the systems that are
there so another reason is to avoid disaster humanity is
on a certain brink right now and we're not sure
what's going to happen with humanity just in the next
fifty to a hundred years there are many disasters that
are looming and many of these disasters are not personal
private disasters they are collective disasters they are disasters that
stemmed directly from failure to understand how the world is
made up of systems and we're trying to manipulate these
systems but we're doing it with our blinders on without
understanding that what we're doing is we're trying to manipulate
systems and so to just perpetuate the survival of the
human race it might be important for us to all
learn some systems thinking so let's get into this what
is a system a system is a set of interconnected
things so we can think of systems as elements these
are oftentimes physical things and then the relationships are interconnections
between these elements these relationships are usually much less tangible
so it's harder for us to deal with them because
they seem sort of abstract and yet these relationships are
more important than the elements themselves so this is how
we start to build a web right a web of
built is built of things plus the connections that connect
these things in a meaningful way a system also causes
its own behavior systems often behave in very complex ways
the more elements the more connections the more complicated the
behavior a system also has purpose it serves a function
and is very important to understand what the function is
the function is an even more important aspect of the
system beyond the elements and the relationships so as important
as the relationships are in a system the purpose of
the system is even more important because that determines the
general behavior of what the system is doing and the
most common purpose of systems is to protect themselves to
maintain homeostasis and to expand themselves and to grow systems
are highly ordered and yet at the same time they're
also chaotic chaotic meaning that they're nonlinear and they're difficult
to predict what's going to happen with them systems are
self-organizing self-sustaining and self repairing and systems respond to outside
forces in complex ways so if this is starting to
resemble a life form or an organism then you're definitely
on the right track organisms of course are very complex
systems but there are a lot of other systems which
are not just limited to biological flesh and blood and
bone which are also really you can think of them
as organisms a lot of corporations governments cities states collections
of organisms like entire ecosystems you can think of all
these things as sort of meta organisms and it's really
not that important that these things are not made of
flesh and bone and living cells in DNA you have
to start to see from a larger perspective these systems
exhibit very similar characteristics to a living cell or to
a living creature in that when you poke it it'll
run away or it will exhibit fear or anger or
to lash out at you or it'll be defensive or
I'll try to protect itself or it'll try to reproduce
and so this opens us up to this whole possibility
of these systems now evolving over time changing language for
example can be a system you probably don't think of
language as a living organism and yet languages are highly
ordered highly structured purpose they have elements they have relationships
they are also self organizing self sustaining self repairing and
they also respond to outside forces and complex ways and
they are also evolutionary language does not stand still just
over a couple hundred years language shifts it changes we
know that when we try to read some Shakespeare and
we don't know what the hell he's talking about and
Shakespeare that's only five hundred years old nothing in evolutionary
time and yet think of how much the English language
has evolved over the last five hundred years not to
mention how language of the larger language of humanity has
evolved the last two thousand years you see so this
is where life gets really interesting as we start to
analyze these systems in get get a sense of how
they work and it's really remarkable because it's like your
mind gets blown by just the complexity and the ingenious
design of all these things and yet none of these
things when you look at it were designed by somebody
else sitting from outside it's not like some man was
sitting there an invented language that's not how it happened
it's more like man was the substrate within which language
evolved by itself it's really self-organizing no one man invented
language or even the Lingus language for that matter so
that's what a system is now you're trying to get
an idea and I'm going to give you a lot
more examples as we keep going but what isn't a
system is everything a system well not really not for
our purposes scattered parts are not a system so just
rocks lying around on the ground we're not going to
consider that a system because they're not interconnected in any
interesting meaningful way books on a bookshelf is that a
system well not really even though the books might be
ordered in alphabetical order it's not really a system because
the books are not again in any kind of meaningful
relationship with each other they're not interactive trash in a
landfill is also not a system because it's just lying
there it's sort of random and it's not really doing
anything interesting now of course you could make an argument
say well but the books and the trash in a
landfill and the rocks these do constitute physical systems and
that's true they in a certain level are physical systems
and I'm sure there's interesting stuff to learn about a
landfill and how it decomposes and all that kind of
stuff but for our purposes we're interested in a more
juicy systems so we're gonna consider just scattered parts to
not be a system understanding though that of course at
the highest level the entire cosmos is one giant system
so nothing escapes the entire cosmos is scope and in
that sense it's all just one thing but there's a
lot of useful benefit we get from breaking it down
into smaller systems just to see how they work and
also to be able to manipulate them with our limited
human minds it's not very useful to think of everything
as just one system now let me give you some
other examples of systems so that you get this really
clear in your head so it's not just abstract a
rainforest is a system the human body is a system
an aquarium is a system and actually aquariums are really
interesting if you ever owned a saltwater aquarium especially you
know how complicated it is because you have all these
different elements you have to test the acidity put various
calcium and other supplements and minerals in there to make
sure that your fish can thrive there has to be
enough oxygen but not too much waste products from the
fish so your fish and your plants and your corals
and your substrate the sand all of it has to
balance out there has to be circulation so this is
a very complex system in a little box and if
you get it wrong all your fish die or all
your plants die or there's too much algae or whatever
goes wrong so that's a really interesting little system that
you can experiment with in your in your own home
just to see how systems work of course a city
or a country as a system a soccer team is
a system a corporation any corporation big ones like Microsoft
or little ones the economy as a whole or economies
of individual countries currencies these are all systems a university
is a system a car is a system the US
military is a system public education is a system the
Facebook platform is a system the Catholic Church is a
system your business if you have a business or you're
thinking of building a business that's a system and even
if you are a one-man shop where it's just you
and you're the owner and the the employee of the
business and nobody else works for you that is still
a system in fact that's what actualize that Rigas I'm
basically a one-man shop I don't have any employees I
do most of this stuff myself sometimes I hire a
contractor here or there to help me but otherwise it's
mostly just me and it's still a pretty complicated system
actualize org if you think about all the stuff that
goes into it it might seem simple it's like oh
you're just a few videos but no there's a lot
of website stuff there's a lot of back-end stuff backup
systems computers servers hard drives there's a lot that goes
into it behind the scenes that you don't see and
all that constitutes a pretty complicated system the self of
course is a system by which I mean you yourself
and I don't just mean your physical body of course
that's a system and your physical body has subsystems within
it like the digestion system immune system cardiovascular system so
forth but I mean you you're very psyche and who
you most deeply feel that you are your ego your
self-image all your memories all of that all your beliefs
that is the self daddy is a system and then
of course the entire cosmos as I've already said is
the ultimate system and everything else could be considered a
subsystem within the ultimate system so one thing you should
immediately start to notice is that systems nest and this
is what gives systems such complicated behaviors because you could
have a system within a system within a system plus
these systems can over lap in in complicated ways so
what I want to do now is I want to
I want to talk to you about the problems that
we see within systems and this is really going to
the heart of why we want to study systems is
because some of these problems are really bad problems that
we want to fix as human beings because it's just
not pleasant to live with these problems what are these
problems well these are persistent systemic problems that have existed
for thousands of years in many cases and they're really
difficult to stamp out and that's because it's not the
individual humans that are the problem so much as the
system is creating these problems so let's give you some
examples poverty how long have people try to been an
eradicate poverty forever right and it's still here with us
that's because it's a persistent systemic problem the shrinking middle
class that's a systemic problem that's not just a one
isolated example every country around the world faces this prabhava
shrinking middle class to various degrees and it's always been
this way since the beginning of human civilizations thousands of
years ago you know to various degrees various times in
history this was less of a problem more of a
problem and now like in America we're facing this problem
more and more so this tells you that this is
not a human individual human problem it's a systemic problem
the environment global warming pollution toxicity the coral reefs dying
the ice caps melting these are all systemic problems and
these are not just new environmental problems have existed since
since cities were first formed thousands of years ago it
wasn't global warming back then but it was something else
like you know led in your pipes or disease in
your water supply drug addiction is a systemic problem and
it's existed for thousands of years war also exists for
thousands of years that's a systemic problem obesity crime lowbrow
marketing have you noticed how difficult it is to market
high consciousness things and yet it's so easy to market
low consciousness things this is a huge problem that contributes
to all the other problems we have small business funding
getting funding for a small business idea that's a systemic
province exist for thousands of years unemployment education fundamentalism terrorism
corruption these are all systemic problems depression is a systemic
problem with a depression epidemic in the Western world these
days huge amounts of people are getting depressed why is
that it's a systemic problem something in our system something
in our society is creating it endangered species that's a
systemic problem run away materialism that's created by our system
partisan gridlock that's created by our system spam internet spam
whatever kind of spam you get email spam spam in
your mailbox physical mailbox also gets spammed with flyers and
leaflets and coupons these are all systemic problems and these
problems if you notice they're very difficult to solve we've
been having spam now for 20 years since the beginning
of the internet and there's more and more of it
and no one seems to find a problem a solution
to this problem so why is that well because there's
a larger system at work which we're not understanding so
I hope you can start to see the significance of
working with systems because it allows you to address all
of these problems that oftentimes we just like to sit
back on our ass on our couch and say all
that's stupid wore that stupid politician look at that corrupt
person look at this crime look at the obesity epidemic
look at the bad on him employment numbers look at
the poverty look at all this stuff but it's not
enough to just sit around on your couch and point
fingers you got to say okay what are we not
understanding about these problems where are they coming from what's
creating them what are the forces that work there and
then when you do that now you start to really
have a chance to change something for the better so
what I want to do now is I want to
now go into the bulk of this episode and talk
about the principles that defines systemic thinking so if you
think along these lines along these values then you will
be a systemic thinker and if you don't then you
won't be so firstly we have to recognize that problems
are systemic and not personal this is a very important
principle this means it's not some Hitler or Osama bin
Laden that's creating problems it's not one or two or
a thousand evil people that are creating problems in the
world it's systems it's poorly designed systems that are creating
these problems so one thing this means is that to
be a systemic thinker you have to stop casting blame
at other people you have to stop calling things evil
and start to ask yourself the question okay why what
is the larger meta operating principle here that's creating this
we have a drug epidemic okay it's not because the
drug users are evil people it's because of the environment
it's because of the bad education it's because of the
easy availability of drugs because of pharmaceutical companies or whatever
right it's because the media is serving up such low
consciousness entertainment that people have nothing hired to aspire higher
to aspire to so they just have nothing to do
better than just to go do drugs you see it's
a combination of all these factors and I'm just you
know I'm just scratching the surface of that one issue
it's a very complicated issue so sister thinkers start to
see that all of these issues are a lot more
complicated than they think then we think when we start
to look at them whether it's health care the economy
taxes drug problems environmental problems these are much larger than
we assumed another principle of systems thinking is seeing everything
as a system now of course not everything deserves to
be thought of as a system but hey a lot
of stuff we're talking about here is highly systemic so
it's good if you're starting to move into stage yellow
spiral dynamics to start to put on this sort of
lens of like that's a system and that's a system
and that's this it's like you're walking down the street
and you start to see everything in systems and that
can be a phase that you go through you don't
ultimately want to be doing that for the rest of
your life that's a good phase to go through for
now another principle of systems is non-linearity non-linearity opens us
up to chaos theory that's a very complicated topic that
I also a beautiful topic I wish I had time
to go into it right now but I don't maybe
in a future episode but when non-linearity means is that
the really interesting stuff in life it's not a simple
equation like you saw in algebra class that had one
or two variables it has hundreds if not thousands of
variables and all these variables affect each other and what
this means in practice is that playing the game changes
the rules of the game so a nonlinear system would
be something I mean a linear system would be something
like monopoly you're just playing monopoly we know what the
rules are when we begin the game that's linear that's
easy we can deal with that what's trickier is if
we create a monopoly game where one of the rules
of the game is that halfway through the game we
can change all the rules you see this is tricky
because now your strategy can't rely on the rules staying
fixed the rules will change and you have to take
that into account and that means a whole lot of
unpredictability that means that your system can take dramatic twists
and turns and do 180 degree reversals and that can
surprise you and this leads us to the other point
which is very important to understand about systems is that
they're very counterintuitive they don't work in a simplistic sort
of like I will pull this lever here and the
stock price will go up or I will do this
thing here and poverty will go down it doesn't work
that way there are many many factors affecting when poverty
goes up well when drug abuse goes down win war
increases when the education system improves right there's many many
complicated factors and a lot of times when naive people
people who do not understand system thinking go into a
system and start to muck around with it they don't
understand and appreciate the complexities of these systems and so
they just think like oh yeah I'm just gonna go
in there and pull that lever and I'm just gonna
get the result that I want but oftentimes what happens
you pull that lever and you get the opposite result
of what you wanted and then of course you're stuck
suffering the consequences so that's a very good reason to
study systems so you don't suffer the consequences of naive
counter intuitive thinking non linearity means unpredictability and chaos chaos
does MIT not mean anarchy in the sense that anything
goes a chaotic system like for example the weather is
not random it doesn't just do whatever it wants it
follows physical laws and rules but it's nonlinear which means
that you can't predict out too far into the future
and it can always surprise you which is why weather
cannot be predicted more than about 10 days into the
future because any predictions further out than 10 days they
become meaningless because the weather can change so quickly you
see but we can still predict the weather reasonably well
just as long as we understand the limits of our
predictions that's what chaos means non-linearity also means that just
because you have good intentions when you try to go
in there and change a system does not mean really
anything and really the people with good intentions who are
simple-minded try to go in there and change systems and
what happens we get the opposite effect these people create
evil rather than good that's why a lot of good
people create evil and we've seen that throughout all of
history because the problem was that they assumed that all
my good intentions are enough no you also have to
understand what the hell you're doing and that means you
have to study these systems and really understand how they
work it's a science it's not anything goes another principle
of systems thinking is that local actions have global impact
we can no longer just worry about our own little
sphere here like if I have my company all I
care about is my company and my profits and my
bank account and my employees and that's it we can't
think that way when we're doing systems thinking because we
have to understand that my company is just one element
within a larger system the global economy or the national
economy or the industry that my company is a part
of and so what my company does doesn't just affect
my company in my pocketbook it affects my industry it
affects my country it affects the citizens all over the
world it affects employment rates it affects taxes it affects
currencies right it affects public opinion so all these things
need to be taken into account if you're gonna run
a successful company because if all you do is you
build a local little company that only cares about itself
guess what you're gonna fail you might succeed in the
short term but in the long run you're gonna fail
because the world is becoming more and more global and
big companies now have to worry learn more about their
global impact you can't just say [ __ ] the
world and I'm gonna do whatever I want because you're
gonna have a a backlash of public opinion against you
see people will boycott you if you behave that way
so you have to start to think more globally not
just with companies but with everything you have to see
how you or whatever you're doing fits into the larger
systems that it's a part of this requires broadening your
scope other principle systems thinking is becoming conscious of backfiring
mechanisms this is going along with that point about countering
two of his a lot of times what happens is
that you change something in a system and it backfires
on you and you as a systems thinker quickly learn
that the system is its own greatest enemy what is
the greatest enemy to the United States it's not the
middle-east it's not North Korea it's not even Russia and
it's certainly not terrorists it's ourselves and see in fact
terrorists know that which is why terrorists use this strategy
and the only way that terrorism works is if it
gets the other person to react in a knee-jerk unconscious
fashion in such a way that that reaction backfires and
destroys a system from within see the terrorists understand that
terrorists are not going to be able to compete with
the US military face to face ever nor are they
ever going to bring down the United States by killing
all of its population or even 1% of its population
it's never gonna happen but what they can do is
they can make strategic little attacks here and there get
people afraid and then that fear will lead to a
collapse of the United States by making bad choices based
on that fear and that anger which the terrorism has
incited you see so we have to become very conscious
of this and this issue of terrorism for example is
one systemic problem which is very counterintuitive a lot of
simple-minded people think that oh well we'll just bomb the
[ __ ] out of the terrorists that's gonna solve
everything but no this ends up backfiring because when you
do that of course you kill innocent innocent civilians when
you kill innocent civilians of course that makes it easier
for the terrorists to recruit more people to their side
and then of course the more that happens your problem
gets worse and worse rather than better so you need
counterintuitive solutions to fix some of these counterintuitive problems starting
to ring some bells that's just terrorism there's a lot
of stuff like this this applies to everything from education
to how your company is run to marketing to economies
to taxation to health care so many things as systems
thinkers we learn that we are our own greatest enemies
I hope actualize that org has shown you that at
least for yourself personally that you are your own greatest
enemy and I hope that you're getting a direct hit
of that as you're doing personal development work the more
you do it the more you'll see that man he
wasn't kidding who I really am my own worst enemy
but of course not just individually but also collectively the
United States is its own worst enemy we create all
our own problems nobody else is creating the problems it's
very important to start to understand that because otherwise we're
gonna be stuck pointing our fingers outside of where the
problems are all the problems are really internal problems systems-thinking
also means that there are no easy brute-force solutions it's
understanding that violent disruptive change to a complex system is
gonna create disaster it's not going to fix it you
have to be very careful about overreacting to systemic problems
because systems are all about balance and harmony and when
you don't understand that systems are about balance and harmony
maintaining a certain opposition of positive and negative forces a
system relies on both of these then you start to
run into some of the problems that we're starting to
see politically for example right now in the United States
the American populace thought that hey what we're going to
do is we're going to elect Trump and Trump is
going to be a disruption to the broken political system
because you know politics filled with gridlock a bunch of
political insiders so we're gonna send in a guy who
is completely inexperienced with politics and with government and he
will just magically somehow create the change we want you
know turn the system around but see it's not turning
out that way and it's very obvious that it can't
work that way because the United States government is a
very complicated system you can't just throw a grenade into
a china shop and then expect a good result at
the end you're gonna get chaos not the kind of
chaos I was talking about for here you you're gonna
get disrupted destruction and you're gonna get overreaction and you're
getting a lot of backfiring which is exactly what Trump
is encountering and that was very predictable to a systems
thinker it was obvious because Trump is the antithesis of
a systems thinker he does not honor any of the
principles that I'm talking about here today in this episode
none he breaks them all which is why he's going
to be a failure in a disaster because it's simply
not gonna work can you imagine going to a surgeon
because you have a tumor in your head and you
go to a brain surgeon and this guy takes the
same kind of simplistic violent disruptive approach to your body
that Trump is taking to the government what's gonna happen
can you just take a scalpel and start to poke
around randomly in your head no that's gonna be disastrous
you have to know what you're doing because you're you're
sticking your knife into an extremely complicated system maybe the
most complex system we know of on on the planet
inside your skull you know your brain it's so complicated
in there you have to know what you're doing you
have to study that thing you have to be very
careful because every incision you make could end up making
the situation worse and not better another important principle of
systems thinking is intuition and holism versus reductionism this is
a problem that we've seen in the sciences we've also
seen this problem in the universities where a lot of
scientifically minded logical rational people like to overanalyze everything and
like to reduce everything down to physics when you do
this what you're doing is you're taking a very complicated
system in your you're only focusing on the materialistic gross
elements and you're ignoring all the interesting relationships which really
define the behavior of that system holism means that you
see the thing as a whole and not just a
bunch of parts for example if I take a human
brain and stick it into a blender blend it up
and then analyze the little molecules that are there in
that brain soup with a microscope I'll be able to
see you know various molecules and cells and stuff blood
cells and neurons and neurotransmitters but that is not going
to tell me anything about the functioning of the brain
or about consciousness or about emotions or about all the
other interesting stuff that the brain does to really understand
the brain you have to look at it holistically how
it actually works you have to look at the relationships
between all those elements that's where the magic is but
reductionists a lot of them like to reduce stuff down
like oh well yeah the brain is just a bunch
of neurons and the neurons are they're just a bunch
of atoms and atoms are just a bunch of quarks
so everything is just a bunch of quarks but then
you lose something when you do that you lose a
lot this is a danger of reductionism as systems thinkers
we have to recognize that reductionism is not going to
fly for fixing many of these world's high-level problems you
see you can't just apply reductionism to something like poverty
or to terrorism or - yeah environmental problems you have
to see these things holistically another principle of systems thinking
is being aware of false boundaries it's recognizing that in
reality there are no fixed boundaries in the universe boundaries
are subjective things we as human beings get to say
where we draw which boundaries to different human beings could
look at a group of ducks one of them could
say well that's one group of ducks another one could
say no that's ten individual ducks which is true both
depending on how you look at it see you are
deciding where to draw the boundaries and simplistic thinkers who
are not at stage yellow sorrel dynamics they tend to
think that no there's ten ducks there that's objective or
it's like no that's one group of ducks that's objective
these boundaries are somehow defined within physics but that's not
the case at all systems thinkers understand that we get
to define what the subsystem is that we're looking at
within the entire cosmos we get to draw the boundaries
and as systems thinkers we understand this is a very
important power because how we draw the boundary determines what
we're gonna see and then what potential solutions we might
come up with so just by redrawing the boundaries could
give us the solution that we weren't seeing before because
we were drawing our boundary too narrowly or too rigidly
or it was too big or it was too small
so one of the powers we have systemic thinkers is
to go into a situation say oK we've been looking
at the situation like this but what if we redraw
the boundaries so that we look at it like this
ah dad gives us a better perspective now we get
to see the true root problem and then we can
come up with a decent solution another principle of systems
thinking is that the world is dynamic rather than static
simple-minded people think of the world as static objects it's
like yeah there's my car my house my country my
language my body my my beliefs these are all static
too naive person to a systems thinker they understand all
of this stuff is constantly morphing and evolving my body
is evolving my car is devolving it's deteriorating every single
day right I mean this is true your car is
changing every single day the tires are getting worn out
the engine is getting worn out the oil is getting
dirty as you drive it it the car itself is
becoming dirty as you drive it your government is changing
all the time your country is changing it's growing more
citizens are being added the world as a whole is
changing and evolving your job your marketplace your entire industry
is changing and evolving certain industries are dying coal jobs
are are out the window and they're never coming back
see so all this stuff has to be taken into
account because otherwise you have a fixed static mindset in
a dynamic complicated world and that that just doesn't work
it's not reflecting reality even your language is changing every
single year these dictionaries like merriam-webster they they publish new
words new English words are invented every single year your
beliefs are changing your ideologies even your religion if you
think that well the one thing I got is I
got my religion my good old Christianity well guess what
you know how much Christianity has evolved over the last
two thousand years it's virtually unrecognizable if you actually study
the evolution of Christianity it's very funny that a lot
of modern Christians don't believe in evolution and yet Christianity
itself their form of it has evolved to what it
is today just even in the last hundred years it's
evolved so much totally different another important principle of systems
thinking is complexity nuance valuing wisdom and learning so systems
thinkers actually value complexity they don't try to oversimplify everything
they value nuance not everything is black and white they
value wisdom and they value lifelong learning because they understand
that all these systems are so complex that you need
to be learning them all the time otherwise you're gonna
get stuck systems thinkers also understand that the power in
working with systems is not in manipulating them directly but
in understanding them you have to really understand the system
and that's where your solution lies you don't just jump
in there and start taking action without knowing what you're
doing this goes back to our point about sticking a
scalpel into your brain right you don't do that you
gotta understand the brain so a systems thinker will invest
a lot of time just in understanding now what this
does is it makes the system's thinker look like a
space cadet or an academic in the eyes of people
who are at the lower tiers of the spiral dynamics
model so stage orange stage green stage yellow when I
mean yeah stage orange and green and also stage blue
yellow is systems thinking so blue orange and green when
they look at yellow they look at yellow and say
man why are you so obsessed with theory you're very
much stuck in your head as a systems thinker it
seems just like armchair philosophy that's what those stages will
think of stage yellow but that's just because they haven't
evolved yet to the point of seeing the whole world
as systems and when they do they'll say ho my
god I need to learn so much more there's so
much I don't understand yet and then they'll get to
work crack and open the books learning all this stuff
and try to understand it another principle of systems thinking
is taking preventative action rather than fixing problems once they
arise it's being forward-looking it's having a long time horizon
it's not just about next quarters profits it's about sustaining
the company to grow and thrive in changing market places
10 20 years down the line it's that kind of
thinking it's not just going to the doctor so that
he can give you heart surgery because you spent the
last 20 years eating terrible food it's about taking preventative
action it's becoming conscious of when your body isn't looking
good isn't feeling good and fixing it 20 years before
you get to that heart attack situation it's expecting unforeseen
consequences of your actions it's understanding that hey when I'm
eating this cheeseburger when I'm putting this french fries and
this mayonnaise into my mouth that has much larger consequences
than just feeding my hunger or giving me some emotional
boost or titillating my tastebuds right because the systemic thinker
sees this from a holistic perspective this is gonna affect
how much energy I have with my children this is
gonna affect how long I live it's gonna expect how
much money I spend on health insurance this is gonna
affect my mood whether I'm depressed or happy this is
gonna affect my sex life this can affect my confidence
myself it's gonna affect so much stuff and that's just
me not to mention the fact that hey you know
if I'm fat or if I have a heart attack
and I'm a CEO of a big company that's gonna
affect not just me not just my family but every
single one of my employees my entire company could suffer
from that and all of the family members of all
my employees all their children will suffer from that the
entire industry that I mean will suffer from that you
see so you start to see this kind of ripple
effect of all your actions and then you become very
humble and you become very careful because you realize that
every little thing that you touch could be a huge
thing so here what comes with that understanding is admitting
the unknown system thinkers are humble in this respect because
they see that these systems dwarf them they dwarf your
understanding so much that you have to be humble you
have to say damn I don't know I don't know
how healthcare works I don't know how government I don't
really know how terrorism works whereas simple-minded people when they
see a complex system they assume hey it's easy I
know exactly how I know exactly what the solution should
be those stupid people in government they're so stupid we
can fix healthcare in a week that's what Trump thought
Trump thought that he can just go in there and
hey healthcare is a breeze that's because he has no
systemic understanding of anything which is why he's gonna be
a failure no matter how much he tries he will
be a failure because he's bringing a very simple-minded understanding
of the world to places in the world like the
US government which are extremely complex and nuanced and very
systemic and he's gonna be very frustrated there because every
move he takes is gonna backfire on him you just
watch watch what happens it's only gonna get worse before
it gets better this also means self-reflection another thing that
Trump lacks self-reflection systems thinkers need to self-reflect because hey
for a system to be able to function and this
is kind of where the element of consciousness or awareness
comes into play you know I say in a lot
of my past episode I say that awareness is the
solution consciousness raise your consciousness that will solve many of
your problems why is it the case because like we
said before a systems thinker understands the system creates all
of its own major problems so how can you solve
your own problems when you can't reflect inside yourself to
see what your own structural problems are you see and
this of course for Trump is a problem not just
collectively as he's running the government it's also gonna be
a problem well it has been a problem personally in
his own life in his own development you can see
the man has no self reflection which of course reflects
in how he govern how he interacts with people and
why all that stuff is disastrous why it's disastrous in
business it's disastrous and government is disastrous in your marriage
it's as Astra's in your personal life it's disastrous with
your health all across the board without self-reflection you're going
to die every system that is not sufficiently self reflective
is a dodo bird it is not going to be
able to compete self-reflection wins out self-reflection higher consciousness is
what evolution is pushing towards so it's it's not going
to work it can work in the short-term but it
will never work in a long-term another principle of systems
thinking is looking for the root causes of issues rather
than the superficial aspects a lot of people get caught
up in the flashy and emotional superficial aspects where as
systems thinkers can see through that they don't get caught
by the red herrings so another great example this is
with terrorism a new election comes around and what happens
the Republicans pull out the old red herring all the
terrorists are coming to kill us and blow us up
in all this and look at the bomb attack last
week in the news and that other bomb attack and
20 people were killed 50 be a hundred people can
look at this and look at the terrorists they're recruiting
and I'll see this is all an emotional herring yeah
it might be true that there was a bad bomb
attack and that's a very sad thing but also you
have to understand as a systems thinker that these are
the superficial aspects this is the fear this is the
emotional stuff a system thing you have to say wait
a minute but what are the root causes what actually
causes terrorism let's take a look at that and so
it's all that's in Salaam that sir stays long we
got to get rid of Islam no that's not it
it's not that superficial it goes a lot deeper than
just Islam now I don't want to get into that
that's a politically charged topic that I really don't wanna
get into here I just want to start to point
out to you that notice how in the public when
it comes to climate when it comes to corporations when
it comes to tax policy when it comes to all
the governmental policies every single one of them that they
are all mired in these red herrings of emotional superficial
aspects and that's all pretty much what happened in the
u.s. 2016 election we didn't talk about the real issues
of anything nothing not the real issues of climate change
not the real issues of the economy and the shrinking
Middle's of these things the real issues were not addressed
only superficial stuff little soundbites and that's done largely so
that nothing can be changed that's actually how our politics
works that's one of the systemic problems of our political
system is that we talk about the superficial stuff and
we just trigger people's low consciousness emotions push their anger
and fear buttons and their outrage buttons and their ideological
but we push all those buttons so they don't really
think very critically and systemically about these issues because there
are larger corporate and political interests at play which are
vying for power and they do not want average people
to to know anything about that just worry about the
superficial stuff worry about your terrorists while we robbed the
country blind and take all the power for ourselves you
see this is a classic game that has been played
for since the beginning of civilization this is not unique
to a 21st century American government this is this has
gone on since the days of the Egyptians and the
Greeks and the Romans and everything up till now it's
been this game say you distract the simple-minded people with
red herrings and then nothing changes and the status quo
gets maintained and that's how the larger system maintains homeostasis
that's good for the larger system but it's not good
for for progress and evolution another important principle of systems
thinking is concern for balance I've already touched on this
but systems thinkers really appreciate the yin-yang ass fact of
life they see that even things that look like evil
forces are not just evil forces that systems often have
many opposing forces and that the greatest danger to a
system is actually eliminating all the opposing forces until you
only have one force when you only have one force
without anything holding it back nothing to [ __ ]
its growth then you have an explosion of infinite growth
an explosion of infant and a growth another way we
can think of that is a cancer you have a
cancer and in a sense that's what Humanity is becoming
now on this earth is we're becoming a cancer that's
growing too fast for our own good and we might
annihilate ourselves just because we fail to understand that we
need to balance all these things we need a balanced
population growth we need to balance corporate greed we need
to balance the power that wealthy people have in society
if you don't do these things the thing will collapse
and self implode and this sort of appreciation of balance
also leads to an appreciation of the nature of wisdom
or I mean the I said the back words the
wisdom of nature because again simple-minded people don't appreciate nature
very much more nuanced people start to see that nature's
natural systems the systems of nature like rainforests coral reefs
water aquifers even to a certain extent like tribal populations
that there's a certain natural wisdom that's there that a
lot of times when we build an egoic Western civilization
the ego discounts some of this natural wisdom for example
with a good example this is pharmaceutical drugs right we
make all these synthetic drugs not appreciating the natural herbs
and supplements and medicines that are available in indigenous cultures
all around the world we don't care about those we
care about manufacturing these synthetic drugs that we can patent
and then we give these antidepressants to people by the
millions and then they get hooked on these antidepressants or
on these opiates if they're powerful synthetic opiates and then
that just makes her their depression and their anxiety and
all that stuff even worse because now they got an
addiction on top of that see that's a failure to
appreciate the wisdom of nature and this happens in many
ways so it's not just about the environment of course
that's important but it's appreciating the delicate balances within ecosystems
with endangered animals with fish populations in the ocean you
know so that we can sustain and feed ourselves on
fish and not out fish the whole ocean so they're
all these different um elements come into play there another
important principle systems-thinking is having a global concern rather than
a local tribal concern simple minded people are tribalistic and
systems thinking is anti tribal because it's integrative it integrates
the whole thing global concern for the entire species we
don't make distinctions between people we see all people is
basically the same and not just people but even animals
and even the environment we start to see that all
of this is important we can't just say that people
are the only important thing on the planet and we
certainly can't say well only America or only Germany or
only a certain race of people is the only important
one so you can't do that because we've seen throughout
history that when you do that you ignore the larger
dynamics that are going on and it's ultimately unsustainable that's
why slavery wasn't sustainable maybe it was a good idea
for the white people in the south but it wasn't
sustainable could not be morally sustained they were conquered in
the war for that reason it was morally unsustainable and
they were not appreciating that see they didn't think about
now we didn't think about like oh oh yeah we
can have these slaves but what's gonna happen when people
are outraged by the cruelty that we inflict on these
slaves I mean maybe we're cool with it but maybe
we're gonna get out competed and ultimately destroyed in war
because of this cruelty that we're inflicting see that would
be systemic thinking but of course slave owners weren't very
good systemic thinkers see they were try ballistic systems thinking
is all about seeing situations as democratic and egalitarian and
as humanistically as we can because we recognize that anything
other than that is not sustainable you cannot run a
sustainable dictatorship these days on the planet it's not gonna
last for more than 100 years what also comes along
with this is the principle that materialism is not the
only game in town and in fact success is not
the only goal and it's not even the most important
goal never-ending growth is not what humanity is about because
if it is then we're just a cancer growth at
all costs is just a cancer and the cancer ultimately
kills itself so systems thinkers need to understand this they
understand that there are there's a much bigger game being
played here in life than just growth or just success
or just raising our gross national product or just everyone
having a house in a car there's much more to
the game of life than that they also need to
understand when enough is enough and just ever-increasing velocity is
not what we're doing here in life that's not what
humanity is about a system thinker is very concerned about
sustainability every system that he or she looks at they
always ask themselves is this sustainable is this dictatorship sustainable
is the war on drugs sustainable is our deficit sustainable
are these tax rates sustainable is this business model sustainable
is my marriage sustainable are the lies that I'm telling
myself about my personal development are they sustainable when you
look at that and a lot of situations you'll be
shocked to discover that wow it's not sustainable at all
I can clearly see how if this continues we're gonna
go crashing right into the ground and then you can
start to ask yourself well how do we make it
sustainable how do we can we engineer the various elements
relationships and forces of this complicated system how do we
redraw the boundaries how do we widen our scope how
do we see this thing from some new perspective how
do we raise our awareness so that sustainability then becomes
part of the system notice that some systems are sustainable
and others are not so what's the difference there well
that's something worth studying another principle systems thinking is recognizing
the dangers of self-interest people generally that are stages below
stage yellow in the spiral dynamics they're not very good
at seeing the dangers of self-interest they are mostly serving
their self-interest blindly without self reflection of course you see
this with Trump very clearly but you also see it
collectively to see don't make the mistake of me picking
on Trump as though Trump is a bad person he's
just a very good example that we have right now
in and in the public mindset that we can draw
attention to but you also have to wonder Trump where
do you come from did he create himself or is
he the product of a system what is the system
that created Trump ah interesting see a systems thinker is
not blaming Trump for being Trump a systems thinker is
asking the bigger meta question of like what created Trump
how many other people are there out there who are
like Trump that you never even see that are behind
the scenes running all sorts of corporations businesses governments you
name it kind of a scary thought huh how many
of those people there might be because you understand that
Trump is just a product of a system he's a
victim as much as anybody because what where to come
from well is a sort of materialistic stage orange success
oriented mindset that he has and this has been indoctrinated
into him through his upbringing through his family history through
the place he grew up in I guess that was
New York or wherever he got his chops right the
kind of business environment that he was in so somehow
he learned how to run business in the sort of
ruthless fashion this non self reflective manner growth at all
costs see so that was a product of our culture
and American culture right now is suffering and suffocating because
of this because look at Wall Street look at these
giant corporations who are just lining their pockets with money
like Apple Microsoft Facebook Google these corporations are gonna become
a huge problem for us in the future we think
that these are just innocent corporations right now Google might
seem like a good corporation but what happens in 50
or a hundred years when the founders are dead long
dead and you have a manager running Google for maximizing
profit oh boy you better watch out that's gonna that
could create a global catastrophe right there because these companies
like Apple Google Facebook Microsoft they have so much money
so much power if they really wanted to use it
they could do some real damage so system sinkers understand
that self-interest whether its corporate self-interest or government self-interest or
religious self-interest that this is ultimately tribalism and tribalism is
not going to work in the larger system of the
entire planet this means recognizing problems like the tragedy of
the Commons I'll talk about that in the future studying
things like arms races why do we have arms races
and arms races of course are not just nuclear arms
races but there are arms races that happen with corporations
with lawsuits patent lawsuits these days between giant corporations are
an arms race in and of themselves political arms races
so starting to study all these becomes important and generally
you start to come to the conclusion as a systems
thinker that hey we need to include everyone into our
solutions because if we exclude somebody those people get pissed
off they're gonna rock the boat and ultimately they're gonna
dis stabilize and break our system so it's not really
a solution unless it includes everyone also it means being
conscious of systemic addictions addictions are not just personal things
but they're also collective things a nation could be addicted
to oil could be addicted to low taxes could be
addicted to subsidies could be addicted to growth and these
are all very serious addictions that we face today with
our government and with many of our corporations and these
need to be addressed and we need to see that
these addictions are not just because the company is evil
we have to look at the larger environment how do
we change the larger environment so the companies are not
so damn evil and so selfish and so money hungry
and so growth oriented that there are virtually cancerous how
do we change the rules so that doesn't happen systems
thinkers think about how to think it's like meta thinking
it's self-reflection systems thinkers also recognize that changing paradigms is
a huge leverage point for changing systems many times the
biggest problem that is keeping a bad system in place
is a bad paradigm and these paradigms are intangible things
it's sort of like a framework or a set of
beliefs that you look at the world or like a
lens that you look at the world through right most
people completely disregard the power of their beliefs their ideologies
and their paradigms they think this stuff is just like
odds it's just some mind stuff you know mind stuff's
not important what's important is money what's important as military
power what's important as oil what's important is killing terrorists
you know that they think of it in this very
kind of gross way whereas actually a systems thinker understands
that shifting one's perspective is highly significant it's not armchair
philosophy it's not just something for academics and colleges by
shifting our perspective we can see the problem in a
way that there is a solution some things when you're
looking at them from some paradigm or completely unsolvable for
example the mind-body problem a lot of scientists are wasting
their [ __ ] time right now in universities arguing
over the mind-body problem and philosophers as well and they've
done this for hundreds of years they've argued about the
mind-body problem they don't understand that their whole paradigm is
backwards you're never gonna solve the mind-body problem through a
naive realist paradigm it's never gonna work on the other
hand you shift your paradigm you realize that everything is
consciousness and that the brain is not creating consciousness but
that consciousness is the location of the brain when you
realize that the whole problem is solved it's amazing but
see that takes a paradigm shift and making those paradigm
shifts are the hardest things because it means you have
to change you're one with beliefs which of course most
people don't want to touch systems-thinking also means integrating multiple
perspectives you go out of your way to survey many
perspectives and then you integrate and bring them all together
because you realize that every perspective has a tinge of
truth to it this doesn't mean all perspectives are equal
some can be very misguided but even the super misguided
ones go study Nazis and you will find a tinge
of truth in some of their perspectives see a simple-minded
person saw Nazis a can there's nothing for me to
learn from Nazis there's nothing for me to learn from
terrorists there's nothing for me to learn from from a
pedophile there's nothing for me to learn from this from
that I'm gonna only study the good stuff the stuff
that agrees with me that's a very simple-minded way of
looking at the world what I do is I gather
all the perspectives I try to see the truth there
bring it all together understanding that there is no one
true perspective also this means that as you're integrating multiple
perspectives when you're coming up with your solution you have
to accommodate the values of various people that are out
there you can't just be serving your own private values
because you're not the only thing around in the world
and other things out there that are out there they
will object people things government's corporations animals they will object
to your values see you have to find common ground
there and you have to be very open-minded as you're
studying these multiple perspectives because a systems thinker knows that
some of these perspectives are nasty ugly horrible on the
surface or they seem false there's no way this perspective
could be true and I can't see how it could
be true but a system seek to understand is that
hey I can't know what I don't know I have
to be open enough to do an honest investigation and
only then will I know where as simple-minded non-systemic thinkers
they assume they already know which perspectives are good or
bad before they've actually adopted them and tried them on
for themselves and of course leads to a huge blind
spots another principle of systems thinking is studying patterns and
cycles you recognize that many of these systems are cyclical
they oscillate they grow through they go through the you
know noticeable phases and studying these phases and patterns becomes
important business patterns government patterns ideological patterns even patterns in
your own life you know your own life goes through
cycles it can be useful to study the cycles of
a human beings life because then you know what's anticipate
this is true science you're studying how these systems work
in reality not how you think they work but how
they really work empirically it also means studying systems versus
manipulating them so if you get eager to go manipulate
a system I encourage you to pause and really think
about it I think a good long while before you
manipulate anything because it might easily backfire on you it
also means studying feedback loops because you're gonna see as
a systems thinker that a lot of the systemic problems
are caused by poor feedback loops where feedback is not
clear or it's too long delayed there's not a quick
enough feedback so the people in your corporation aren't getting
the feedback quickly enough to fix the problems that are
there that could be fixed if you just fix the
feedback loop or the wrong kind of feedback is being
given so that's in a nutshell what systems thinking is
you got a pretty good idea it's still only an
introduction we're still just skimming the surface but you can
see how deep of a field this is you could
spend here studying this stuff and I think you should
if you're interested in changing the world for the better
how do you know if you're a systems thinker next
time you're sitting in traffic big old traffic jam and
you're pissed off rather than being pissed off and blaming
the guy in front of you for the traffic jam
you wonder to yourself why is there this traffic in
the first place what is the systemic problem causing this
traffic is it the number of lanes is it the
speed limit that's posted there on the side that I
saw is it too slow is it the stoplight maybe
there's too many stoplights too many intersections maybe there's not
a highway nearby or vice versa maybe there's too many
highways in this area and the way that they're converging
is causing this bottleneck see when you start to think
of every mundane problem in the world in that fashion
that's when you know you've really become a systems thinker
and now you're at stage yellow this is how stage
yellow thinks they see the whole world like this and
this gives them a certain tranquility because they're no longer
going around blaming people there are actually much more pragmatic
their solutions oriented they're interested in understanding the actual problem
rather than the superficial pointing my finger at somebody now
you might say leo this is all well and good
but you know why should I care about changing the
world I'm just interested in improving myself I want to
get my little family I got I want to get
my little business going and earn some good money and
that's all that I really care about who cares about
changing that we were talking about these big things government
taxes terror is like I'm not gonna change any of
this stuff well look then what you're admitting here is
that you're admitting that you're a useless human being that's
what you're admitting understand this because you're saying that all
you care about is your personal pleasure and satisfaction and
your own personal private success and you're not tying that
success or pleasure to anything of value that you're contributing
to the world you're expecting that stuff to just kind
of be given to you because you go in there
and you work for eight hours a day but your
work is not directly tied to actually improving the world
what that means that you will be eliminated you will
go extinct you like the dodo bird it's only a
matter of time you understand this your ability in the
future to get paid to make a good living will
be directly proportional to how creative you are as a
systems thinker and the kind of challenges that you're out
there solving for the world if your work is not
solving meaningful world problems you will get eliminated you will
not be successful you will be miserable and you will
be wandering just like those coal miners hey where are
my coal jobs I need my coal job back because
you're just expecting somebody to provide you with employment and
you're not thinking about hey hey this thing I'm doing
by digging a [ __ ] coal I'm destroying the
environment yeah it's good for me and my family but
there's seven billion other people around who don't want to
be breathing coal and there's solar companies and wind companies
and all this innovation happening all around you but you're
I just want my call I just want to make
call and bring home a paycheck well you know what
[ __ ] you because you're a selfish bastard that's
what you are you're not thinking ahead you're not being
creative and so therefore you are being eliminated I'm sorry
to say that that's what's real and that's not just
gonna happen with coal that's gonna happen with everything we're
living in a society where change is accelerating every single
[ __ ] year change is accelerating you need to
be on your toes you need to be learning educating
yourself you'd be on the cutting edge or you will
go extinct that's what's gonna happen and before you go
extinct you will be very miserable extinction does not just
mean your physical death you will be miserable in many
other ways you're not gonna have the satisfaction of contributing
meaningfully to humanity that's an enormous satisfaction I at every
single day it's a huge component of my happiness in
my life you're not gonna have that you're foolish if
you're turning that down see not to mention that you're
contributing to many of the world's greatest problems and that
you might directly lead to the destruction of the human
race that's what might happen when you blindly go about
working for somebody what's most likely gonna happen is that
you're gonna be working for a cancerous corporation which is
contributing to a cancerous society which will ultimately lead to
a cancerous end to this little experiment of life that
we are part of so start thinking of bigger challenges
than yourself this is counterintuitive you think that thinking about
yourself is gonna get you everything you want and actually
it's the exact opposite thinking about the world and virtually
paying no attention to yourself is what's gonna really grow
you the most and give you the most fulfillment and
satisfaction in life so be careful about your intuitions here
understand that the world is at a precipice we're in
a dangerous place and in a sense it could be
a bad thing or it could be a great thing
because we have a great opportunity for redemption the world
needs you to help fix some of these very big
and important challenges that we have these systemic thinking challenges
and to do that you need to turn inside yourself
and make yourself a systems thinker that's it I'm out
of here please click the like button for me and
come check out actualized right here my website I have
resources there my life purpose course my book list and
the forum my blog and many other things wait one
