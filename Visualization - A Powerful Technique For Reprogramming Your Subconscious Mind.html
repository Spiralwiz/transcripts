hey this is Leo for actualised dot-org in this video
I'm going to talk about visualization alright welcome back let's
talk visualization I'm really excited about this video because visualization
is a very very powerful technique and tool that we
can use as self development junkies I hope you are
one if you are we can use this tool to
work directly on our subconscious and to start shaping and
working with our self image this is an incredibly powerful
thing and I want to get into all the details
in this video in this video what I'm going to
do is I'm going to tell you what visualization is
why it's important how it works I'm going to give
you a whole checklist that you can go down to
do a proper visualization so that you're getting every point
correct and then at the very end I'm actually going
to take you through a visualization exercise so that you
know that you're doing it correctly you're going to do
it with me here as you're watching and then you're
going to go away and it going to be a
visualization master then you can go and practice and get
some really powerful life-changing transformational results from using this technique
so what is visualization visualization is simply a technique where
you sit down quietly by yourself and you use mental
imagery your own imagination your using your own your own
imagination to to start priming your subconscious mind with various
images of the goals that you want to achieve so
whatever kind of goals or ambitions you have in your
life whatever kind of life you want to create if
you're like me and you really want to create a
powerful extraordinary life live to the fullest then this is
where this relation comes in really really handy because then
those goals are going to get programmed into your mind
and then it's going to be much easier for you
to go out and to take action on them so
that's also the why of visualization why do we why
do we care about visualization it's because we are self
development junkies and we want to accomplish big things in
life and I don't know if you've tried but when
you try to accomplish something in your life whether it's
losing a lot of weight or improving your diet and
nutrition or starting a business or improving your career or
whatever it is that you want to do starting an
amazing relationship if you want to do any of those
things and more then you know that you need to
really put in something extra extra effort extra initiative and
this is where visualization is powerful is that it gets
your mind soaked in the imagery and the goals and
it creates a sense of motivation so you can go
out there and be inspired to do the things that
you want to do rather than grinding through them because
if you're going to grind through everything then you're not
going to accomplish nearly as much so that is the
why now let's talk a little bit about the how
I'm going to go into a whole list of all
the different steps you're going to take the how is
basically what you're doing here kind of on an abstract
level is that you are using images in your mind
to work on your self-image and the self image I
actually have a video on self image which is a
very critical video for you to watch you should watch
it and I'm going to link it down below in
the comments section so you can find that really easy
but quickly here to recap the self image all it
is is it's the the worldview that you create that
resides in your subconscious mind so these are the beliefs
that you have how you believe the world works how
you believe the world is what you believe is true
what you believe is false and most importantly what you
believe about yourself what you believe your weaknesses are your
strengths your capabilities or impossibilities for you so that's the
self image and the self image it holds you back
from doing the things that you really want to do
in your life the reason that is is because most
people self self images are flawed and they have a
lot of disempowering beliefs residing in there and it's hard
to work and shape that self image because those beliefs
are below the level of awareness so you a lot
of times don't have even the awareness that you have
these beliefs you just don't know that you have them
and yet they're there and they are they are what's
controlling all the subconscious actions that you take in your
life and most of your results in life stem from
subconscious actions so wouldn't it be nice if we could
take this flawed self-image this disempowering self-image that has been
accumulated from childhood and all the traumatic experiences that we've
had and all that now it's here couldn't we take
that and somehow reshape it and engineer it to be
the way that we want it to be so that
we can get the goals and objectives that we want
our life actually realized wouldn't it be cool if there
was a way to do that well there actually is
and visualization is one of the most powerful ways that
I know to do this so it's really about reshaping
the self image that's why this thing is so important
don't worry if you don't consider yourself a visual person
or a natural visualizer I find that most people when
you tell them visualization is just a label don't get
too hung up on the label most people already visualize
in their lives they just aren't aware of it and
they don't do it consciously what we're doing here the
only thing is is we're just taking conscious control of
this process if you take a time from your past
where you've accomplished something big or something successful where you
overcame a really big challenge where you really accomplish and
achieve the major goal which you're going to discover is
that the reason that you were able to do that
is because you were visualizing your success either throughout the
process but especially in the beginning phases so if you
start in a business or you if you've worked really
hard through college to get a job or a career
or maybe you work really hard and got yourself a
marriage or relationship so the way that you did that
is because you were always dreaming in your mind about
what you wanted you had literally images visions of what
you wanted and then what happened was that your life
slowly by you taking action your life started to come
closer and closer and closer to that image and if
you were really good then your life maybe even resembles
that image perfectly right now or maybe it's even better
than your original image or is close to it so
this is the process of creation right this is how
people create stuff everything in the world that has been
created that's meaningful that's big that's ambitious that's beautiful any
work of art any business any product any industry any
service it all started with a vision it all started
with an image in someone's mind this is an important
idea to understand and to buy into because if you
don't buy into this then you're not going to take
visualization seriously and I will show you what the exercise
we do at the end just how powerful visualization can
be so this is something that is not to be
underestimated if you are somebody who wants to create stuff
in his or her life and you want to be
extremely productive and you want to be successful this is
especially important for you because to achieve those goals you
have to be driven by it you have to have
a sense of inspiration and motivation and imagery is the
way that you do that with your mind so this
is super super critical so hopefully that proves to you
that you already are a visualizer and that this isn't
something foreign to you this is just something that now
we're really taking control of this process we're really optimizing
it and now we're going to use it very consciously
and deliberately to plant those ideas in your mind because
for most people what I find is that they do
visualize but it's very very random and sporadic and so
that's the kind of results they get in their life
the results are very random in sporadic we don't want
that right we want very consistent very powerful results so
that means we take this process under our control and
here is how so here's kind of the checklist that
you're going to follow to do successful visualization off on
your own so here's how it works step number one
is that you sit down somewhere alone in a quiet
room where nobody can disturb you you need some time
by yourself you're going to have a timer with you
or a stopwatch what I like to do is I
like to just have an app on my smartphone with
a little countdown timer so that's going to be important
that's going to tell you how much time you're spending
on your visualizations and you're going to need at least
5 or 10 minutes for this process so that's step
number one five five or ten minutes of timer and
just sit down step number two is you close your
eyes step number three is that you set a focus
for your visualization what do you want to visualize so
that means some sort of goal or objective or purpose
so maybe for you that's losing some weight or improving
your business proving your career getting more money or any
kind of personal development goals that you have whatever so
you goal and make sure it's something specific and something
focused don't pick ten different goals or two different goals
select just one goal one focus for this session of
visualization good next what you're going to do step four
is that you're really going to calm yourself down our
mind tends to be busy as we're walking around the
day doing stuff running our busy hectic lives our mind
is always thinking thinking thinking a churning well we want
to shut that off to do successful visualization this fourth
step it's not strictly necessary a lot of times I
will skip it if I'm short on time but I
found that if you do it it's going to lead
to a more powerful visualization and this is simply you're
going to spend one or two minutes just doing some
deep breathing with your eyes closed some deep calm breathing
breathing nice and deep into your stomach and then breathing
out and you're going to do that for two minutes
at most just to get yourself a little bit like
calm and centered and if you can put your focus
in your body put your focus in your breath and
in everything that you feel in your body so that
you're right now in the moment don't think about the
past or the future be present while you're doing this
okay so that was step number four you centered yourself
now it's time to do the visualization you're going to
take your timer and you're going to set five or
ten minutes let's say you set five minutes so you
set five minutes you click the start button now that
five minutes are ticking down what you're going to start
doing is you're gonna start visualizing your goal so what
is your goal let's use just a throwaway example here
so that we are talking about something specific and not
abstract how about the goal of becoming a millionaire let's
say you want to become a millionaire okay good so
if that's your goal now you start picturing it what
does it look like to be a millionaire what kind
of car would you drive what kind of house would
you have what kind of work would you be doing
what would you two be doing with your life how
would your life be different how would you feel inside
would you have a big smile on your face what
kind of friends would you have how would your family
feel about you so you start thinking and visualizing all
this stuff and what the key here is that you
want to be you want to be filling your mind
with the imagery right vivid vivid imagery the next point
that I'm gonna tell you is that you got to
be very detailed and as vivid as possible with your
images now your images aren't going to be as vivid
as real vision they're not going to be that vivid
they're going to be murky and hazy some of us
are better at visualization than others but what I find
and what's been really proven and documented is that as
you do visualization you get stronger and stronger and stronger
because it's like a muscle you got an imagination muscle
in your head and you're flexing it every time you
sit down to do this visualization so at first you
might start off and it might be little hazy just
work through it and try to get as much detail
as possible a good trick is to start to use
multiple senses so even though this process is called visualization
that doesn't mean it only pertains to imagery so definitely
have the images there of you being a millionaire but
also have the sounds here it what is it what
does it sound like to be a millionaire what does
it feel like in your body what kind of emotions
does it bring up in you senses of touch even
smell and taste maybe you see yourself going and having
a nice really expensive meal at some restaurant and you're
you're tasting that meal and you're smelling it maybe you're
touching you're touching things maybe you're feeling the the smooth
slick metal body of your of your expensive car and
you're running your hand across it right stuff like that
you want to get as much detail in there as
possible that's going to make it seem more real and
that's the treat that's the the trick here is that
the more real this feels to you the better because
what's happening is that it's it's going from the conscious
mind into the subconscious mind and it's programming itself in
there as you do this visualization good the next step
is that you want to visualize in the now in
a present moment so here we're talking about being a
millionaire so here what that means is that instead of
visualizing yourself being a millionaire ten years from now which
is nice what you ought to do is visualize visualize
yourself being a millionaire right now right this second your
millionaire right now picture yourself being a millionaire right in
the moment this is a very important point and many
people get this wrong about visualizations that you want to
visualize about the present not the future the future is
better than nothing but the present is even better than
the future your mind will buy into it even more
you're basically tricking your mind with this process so to
really trick it make yourself feel like you've got it
right now and really soak in emotions soak in everything
that you're feeling this should be a very emotional experience
not a logical experience okay good so that's basically the
process you sit there for five minutes or maybe ten
minutes your timer rings and goes off that's it you're
done now if you want you can do another round
of visualization after that maybe on some other goal that
you have or you can then get up open your
eyes and do whatever you got to do run run
your errands and run the rest of your life in
your day now a couple of points very very critical
this whole visualization process doesn't work unless you do it
every single day so if you plan on doing visualization
where you do five minutes here 10 minutes the next
day and then you skip a week and then you
do another five minutes might as well not even try
don't bother you're just gonna waste your time because it's
not going to work the whole point here is to
reprogram your subconscious mind and the subconscious mind is reprogrammed
through repetition the way a dog's mind is that's literally
how it is so to do that you're gonna have
to do this consistently that means weeks weeks have to
go by it you consistently doing this visualization every single
day like clockwork I do it every single day like
clockwork I don't miss a day because I know how
important it is for me to be seeding these images
of my future into my mind because I'm very ambitious
I have very big goals and I know that I'm
not going to achieve them unless I do this so
for me this is top top top priority structure your
day around this do this in the morning maybe do
this in the evening do it at lunchtime whenever you
can but make sure that you don't skip and the
other caveat that I'll throw out there is the point
about resistance so when you're visualizing in the now your
subconscious mind is going to start coming up with all
sorts of resistance to you doing that for example if
you're visualizing that you're a millionaire right now and you're
actually not a millionaire and let's say you're only earning
fifty thousand a year that's your salary and you've never
earned within that and you have no idea about how
you're actually to become a millionaire if you start visualizing
that you're a millionaire right now in the moment then
your subconscious mind is going to rebel against you and
it's gonna say whoa wait a minute what are you
doing here you're not a millionaire you can't be telling
yourself that you're a millionaire this is hogwash this is
wishful thinking it's fantasy this is not reality we need
to be realistic you got to do is got to
push through it this is the training process right when
you're training a dog the dog is not going to
obey you that's the training process it disobeys and you
train and you give punishments and rewards same thing here
when your mind is disobeying you and resisting you need
to drill into it even more with even more intensity
so this is a very critical point don't worry that
you have resistance especially when you're visualizing about the present
and you're really making yourself feel it you have to
just fantasize about it and let yourself be in fantasy
land for a little while you're not spending the rest
of your life or the rest of your day even
in fantasy land you're just spending five or ten minutes
so shut off your critical mind for five or ten
minutes while you do this exercise this is very important
okay so with that if you do this process and
you do it consistently then you're going to get some
amazing results and you also have to have the right
expectations so again it might take you at least two
to four weeks to start seeing some of the results
of this visualization but then you can continue doing visualization
even longer and longer and longer and the more you
do it then the more benefit you're going to get
out of it it's kind of like a meditation practice
personally I do it for about 20 or 30 minutes
every single day and I've done it for almost a
year now straight and I only miss telling maybe one
or two days from that whole period because it's that
important to me so go ahead and try that out
alright so that's the core fundamentals of visualization what I
want to do now is I want to give you
an actual demonstration of how to do a visualization so
I'm going to guide you through one right now okay
what I want to do now is guide you through
a visualization so this is a live exercise go and
do this with me as I'm speaking this will be
powerful in it will drill into your mind how visualization
is supposed to work all right so go ahead and
find yourself a comfortable seat with your back up straight
and sit comfortably and relaxed as you do that go
ahead and close your eyes and just listen to me
talk and let me guide you through this visualization good
as you're sitting there now with your eyes closed go
ahead and start to feel your body get in touch
with your body all the different parts and how they
feel now really notice your breath go ahead and take
control that breath now and take one deep nice slow
breath in and then exhale as you exhale go ahead
and relax your whole body good go ahead and pay
another nice deep breath in just like that one and
exhale and relax your body even more nice feel your
mind shutting off and just getting very calm and still
and feel your whole body sensing itself get your mind
completely into the present moment imagine that there is no
past you have no past at all no personal history
whatsoever the future forget about the future completely imagine that
you have no future at all all you are is
what you are right now just the present right now
what's happening right now good go ahead and take one
more nice deep breath in at your own pace and
as you're exhaling that breath relax your body completely good
make your mind very still very centered very clear your
mind isn't thinking any thoughts it's just being aware of
everything it's feeling in its body good go ahead and
feel the the soles of your feet go ahead and
feel your upper thighs and your butt sitting on the
cushion or the surface feel your back muscles all the
way from your lower back up through your spine and
up to your shoulder blades good now go ahead and
feel your arms feel the awareness and sensation going from
the shoulders of your arms down through the elbow and
the forearms and into the hands good and now feel
it go through your fingertips good now shift your awareness
to your neck muscles and move that awareness slowly up
from your neck muscles all the way up into your
jaw and your facial muscles and now relax all of
your facial muscles in your jaw completely and finally feel
the very top of your head the very point at
the very top of your head put your awareness right
there good now your whole body is relaxed and nice
calm and your mind is very still I'm going to
guide you through a visualization now keep your mind just
as still as it is right now and just as
focused and keep your eyes closed breathe comfortably at your
own pace I want you to imagine in vivid detail
the following scene imagine that it's a Saturday morning the
weekend has come and you've got your whole Saturday free
to yourself and it's early morning you feel full of
energy you wake up really early in the morning and
you decide that today you're just going to spend the
whole day golfing you woke up with the Sun you
feel full of energy you're focused laser focused you feel
totally calm and you walk out onto that golf field
it's so really early in the morning the Sun is
now up but it's shining in your eyes nice and
bright that bright morning sunshine the air feels kind of
cool and brisk but you're dressed nice and warm so
you don't feel cold it's just nice and refreshing feel
the slight breeze across your face as you're out there
on the grass and feel your feet your feet have
golf shoes on and they're sinking into the wet grass
grass a little bit mushy and it gives way to
your weight notice how green the grass is it's such
a bright rich green the sun rays are hitting that
grass and every blade of glass just sparkles and you
see the little dew drops on every blade of grass
as you're standing there admiring the grass you also take
a nice deep breath in with your nose and you
start just smell it to that crisp grassy air and
the wind it just feels so refreshing and crystal clear
that crystal clear morning air and your body just totally
relaxed so that you breathe that in your mind is
completely still you have no thoughts of work or family
or friends or any obligations or the past or the
future you're just enjoying yourself on the golf course right
now and you hear in birds chirping in the morning
as the rising with the Sun there birds all over
all around in the trees fly around in the grass
you just bask in that you bask in the sunshine
you feel the sun rays warming your skin and now
you look ahead all the way down the golf course
and you see yourself you're at the driving point at
the very beginning and hundreds of yards away you see
that little white flag the hole and the golf course
just looks so peaceful and green and calm and beautiful
there's nobody else out here but you you're the only
one you just feel good you just feel so good
in your body you don't even care about the game
you don't care about your shot you don't care about
how many strokes you make you just feel good for
being out here and now you take one of the
balls and you put it down on the tee in
the grass and then you bend back up and you
grab your driver in your hands and you hold it
in your hands you get a nice grip on it
you feel the leather of the driver the grip it's
nice and soft you feel it on your hands just
the perfect grip your favorite grip and you set it
down right next to the ball the head of the
driver is right next to the ball they're all lined
up you look at the ball then you look forward
at the white little flag all those hundreds of yards
ahead and you just feel so good everything feels so
perfect you're all lined up for the shot the club
feels just the perfect weight your hands you just lift
it off just a little bit off the grass where
it was resting and now you're ready for your swing
can you swing like butter it's just so smooth and
effortless like you were born to make that swing and
you just pull the club back and then you sweep
it forward right through the ball and arc it all
the way across for the follow-through and your driver just
hits that ball crisp right in that sweet spot that
sound you hear that perfect sound of the perfect hit
right at the center of the club with that ball
you just nailed it and the power behind that Drive
it's just perfect and you look out and you see
that ball flying through the air that nice long high
arc and then it disappears into the bright Sun and
then you see it plop down right on the green
right next to the flag and you just smile because
that was the perfect shot and this is the perfect
morning good go ahead and bask in that for a
few more seconds and then we're going to bring you
back okay on the count of three I'm going to
take a few more deep breaths and then bring yourself
out you can open your eyes you're going to come
back nice and refreshed feeling good one two three go
ahead and open your eyes and welcome back all right
how was that so that was a visualization if you
did that and I hope you did then I hope
you also felt the real power of that now I
use this one example of golf I don't know maybe
you're a golfer maybe or not I'm actually not a
golfer I don't golf but to me that was just
a piece one good scene to illustrate the power of
visualization I wanted to use something that everyone could really
feel and buy into and I hope you've got the
the vividness in there that I wanted you to get
now I want you to really imagine what would your
life look like if all those big goals that you
have in your life whether your weight goals your business
goals your create career goals your relationship goals whatever if
you visualized the way that you visualize right now with
this golf scene if you did that for all your
major goals and everything that you want in your life
and you did that on a daily basis and you
did that consistently repeatedly do you think that would help
you to accomplish those or not do you think that's
worth the 10 or 15 minutes that it takes to
do this I think that's worth it for you you
think it's worth to master this technique yourself so that
you could run this on yourself I hope so it
definitely is so I want to encourage you to give
it a shot try to make a habit of it
