[Music] if you've been following along with my work for
any significant period of time you've heard me mentioning this
concept called meta or going meta i've used this concept
a lot in the past but i've used it indirectly
obliquely implicitly without formally defining what it is and so
i think it's worthwhile to do that here today because
this is a concept that we use recurringly if we're
trying to understand life or reality at a deep level
or if we're trying to understand the nature of science
or we're trying to understand religion we're trying to understand
spirituality we're trying to do personal development at a deep
level to do these things you really have to come
to terms with the notion of meta and even though
this notion of meta it's actually being used even by
kids these days by teenagers i hear the young ones
the kids are using it in school and so forth
to say meta this meta that but they don't really
understand what they're saying and even many scientists and computer
programmers and so forth who should have a deeper grasp
of this notion they still don't really understand the significance
of what meta means so it really is worthwhile to
spend a couple hours discussing this notion in depth explaining
why it's so important and giving many examples so let's
begin so what does going meta mean and usually when
we say meta we attach to other domains or concepts
like metaphysics meta data metacognition so once you start to
think along these lines you realize that you've probably heard
this concept used many times before and i'll give you
way more examples than this as we keep going but
the dictionary defines it formally as the following quote showing
or suggesting an explicit awareness of itself or oneself as
a member of its category cleverly self-referential or as more
comprehensive transcending or transcendental or situated behind or beyond end
quote that's from the merriam-webster dictionary so that gives you
a bit of an idea it has something to do
with self-reference and self-reference is a is a very powerful
concept that is also the depth of it is not
fully understood by science and by philosophy and just how
deeply ingrained it is into the very fabric of reality
itself we'll be explaining that as we go so really
though what it means to go meta is it means
to step outside or to zoom out or to transcend
a thing to make it the subject of one's awareness
it means self-reference it means self-reflection it means self-consciousness all
of these terms should be very familiar to you if
you've been following my work i've used all these terms
a lot and each of them has its own subtle
connotations but also we want to we want to develop
a sort of vocabulary as we're doing this work so
that we can use these different terms to refer to
different nuances of consciousness what we're ultimately exploring so meta
essentially is when a thing becomes self-aware and to become
self-aware you have to step outside you have to zoom
out to transcend a thing otherwise you're too close to
it to be aware of it sort of like for
a fish swimming in water for it to go meta
would be for the fish to step outside of the
water crawl up on the shore let's say or get
fished out by a hook and then maybe the fish
now has enough distance from the water to realize oh
i've been swimming in water this whole time and now
it's gone meta on the water whereas most of its
fish friends who have never been outside the water they
haven't gone meta on the water so to them even
the notion of water doesn't really make sense you see
also what it means to go meta is that as
you're doing something to notice that you're doing it another
term i have for that is self observation to observe
oneself this is a lot of what spiritual work involved
meditation is about self-observation so for example you might be
using language and normally you just use language to tell
somebody something and you wouldn't be aware of the fact
that you're using language to do it although of course
if someone asked you you would say yeah of course
i'm using language to communicate something to you know get
my get my restaurant order in or something like that
but you haven't really gone meta on the situation because
there's a sort of a level higher where you can
actually place your restaurant order and as you're placing your
restaurant order you can also simultaneously be conscious of the
fact that you're using language and be wondering what is
language which normally people don't wonder after using it so
you see that creates a difference and as you're doing
that you're observing yourself you're still you're sort of and
that that's taking up mental resources it actually requires consciousness
to do that your conscience sort of has to split
between part of your conscience is going to using the
language and then part of your conscience is going to
observing yourself using the language so it's a little harder
to do it's like juggling two balls instead of one
what else it means to go meta is to step
outside the frame of a thing and to observe it
so almost everything within reality that we can talk about
is framed in some way or comes in some kind
of context like when you're playing a video game the
frame of the game is the game world and we
might say the tv screen that's displaying the video game
or if you're watching a movie at the theater the
frame is the screen that's being projected upon and then
to break out of that that would be to go
meta another term for this is called breaking the fourth
wall in cinema this concept is is used whenever a
character inside of a tv show or a movie speaks
directly to the audience which usually these characters wouldn't do
and they do it in sort of a self-aware way
where the audience now understands that the character in the
movie understands that he's just a character in a movie
and he's stop talking to you about the fact that
it's a movie so he's gone meta he's broken through
the illusion of the sort of context or frame of
the movie world so you might even take this to
a further extreme where for example a movie might be
set in ancient roman times and the character would literally
knock on the tv screen and say hey hey you
over there in the 21st century watching this right now
how's it going and that shows you sort of uh
self-awareness of even the fact that even though he's in
the frame of ancient rome he can break out of
that frame break the reality of that and to connect
it to the 21st century so he's aware this character
is aware that actually this is a movie happening in
the 21st century so uh another way to phrase it
is that to go meta is to go one level
above in abstraction one level higher in abstraction and perhaps
the best way to illustrate this is imagine if you
were playing super mario brothers on your tv and mario
all of a sudden woke up inside of super mario
world he knocked on the screen and he started having
a conversation with you about the fact that hey i'm
mario and i'm made of pixels and i was programmed
by nintendo programmers and yet here i am running around
in this world and i know you're outside playing me
and i'm aware that i'm just character of pixels in
this pixel world but i'm also cognizant that you're playing
me and you're some other entity sitting outside of me
observing me and here we are that would be a
very a very radical level of going meta and you
would see that if that happened to you imagine just
imagine for a moment that that actually happened to you
the next time you were playing a video game imagine
how shocked you would be you would be the hair
on the back of your neck would stand up if
that happened to you and it's not outside the realm
of possibility that this will happen i mean of course
not with the old school mario games but in a
future mario game maybe in 50 years and 100 years
something like this is feasible can you start to see
how powerful that is and why this concept of going
meta could be so important and so significant to give
you a little further hint as to its power imagine
that you are like that mario character right now one
who isn't aware one who isn't able to go meta
stuck inside the frame of super mario world unaware of
the larger context of what's really going on that this
is a video game and then imagine that something clicks
one day and suddenly you're able to go meta and
you're able to pop outside of the frame of the
video game imagine how groundbreaking that would be for you
see this wouldn't just be another thing like a belief
you adopt it wouldn't be some ideology like oh you
became a a conservative or you became a liberal or
you adopted islam or you did some science no no
this would be this would be a completely new dimension
to reality that you didn't even know existed and that
none of the other characters in the movie or in
the game recognize as being real it's almost like entering
the fourth dimension or the fifth dimension that's powerful you
see and as it turns out if you're trying to
do serious personal development and serious spiritual development and you're
trying to really get a handle on what reality or
life is it turns out that it's impossible to accomplish
that without going meta and the number one mistake that
all religious people political people and even scientific people and
logical people that the biggest mistake they make is that
they're always operating within the same dimension as they've always
operated and that their mind is not able to jump
out and go meta into a higher dimensional perspective and
because of this they're not able to resolve the enigma
of life and they're not able to solve the majority
of their serious structural existential problems they're only able to
solve the problems within that single plane that they're working
in whereas certain problems can only be resolved by jumping
outside of that frame into a higher dimension and the
the whole challenge here is that it's extremely difficult to
communicate the existence of a higher dimension to someone who
is stuck within a single plane because to them when
you're talking to a two-dimensional character the idea of three
dimensions it's like a fantasy it doesn't compute until one
day something clicks and it does compute and then they
discover the third dimension or some other dimension we're not
just talking about spatial dimensions that's just an analogy we're
using here so before we start to get real existential
on this stuff let's uh go through a list of
examples here are some examples of going meta so there's
a famous painting by renee magritte a surrealist painter called
the treachery of images it's a very simple painting of
a pipe that says this is not a pipe which
of course it isn't because it's just a painting how
can a painting be a pipe on the other hand
it is a pipe because what else are you looking
at here but a pipe so it is a pipe
and it isn't a pipe which is true well it
depends sort of what level of perspective you're at that
you're looking at it from another example of course of
going meta is meta data within emails your email has
the subject of the email which is the message that
usually you and the person you're sending your emails between
and communicating with cares about you know your name and
the body of the text but then there's the metadata
of the email this is the stuff that usually like
the police will track the nsa is probably tracking the
metadata of every email in the entire world and that
metadata includes the ip address the email was sent from
the servers it went through the geograph you know the
geo locations of the of the recipient and the sender
probably what computer an operating system it was sent from
what web browser what email client was used and who
knows what else is in that metadata so email metadata
is data about the content of the email and you
can't get that data by just reading the body of
the text of the email it's always something outside of
it something beyond it likewise we might also think of
there's an analogy here even with physical mail with physical
mail there's a sort of also metadata and it's implied
it's never made really explicit but when you get a
letter in the mail what would be the metadata of
that letter let's say the actual data would be the
content of the letter but the metadata would be stuff
like the actual envelope it came in was it a
cheap flimsy envelope was it one of those sort of
scammy marketing envelopes what is was it a glossy envelope
was it one of those brown manila folder envelopes did
it have certain stamps on it did the post office
put a postmark stamp on when it was sent and
when it was received and other sorts of information like
that who it was from where it's going to uh
things of that nature that would be the metadata and
that can give you clues about where the letter came
from or other stuff there might even be and of
course there is on every letter there's fingerprints you could
you can closely analyze the fingerprint signature on every letter
and that might even tell you some information about who
wrote it who sent it who touched it who delivered
it and so on you might even be able to
do a dna analysis of the saliva on the edge
the sealed edge of the letter if it's one of
those old-fashioned ones that you lick you can analyze the
saliva and you can use that in a sort of
sherlock holmes way to to see who actually sealed the
letter maybe the person who wrote the letter isn't the
same as the person who sealed the letter and that
can give you some more clues and information and i'm
sure the police and forensic departments around the world use
this sort of data you know to catch criminals and
whatever else pretty cool right and so this is sort
of what we discover at a deep philosophical level about
reality is that any time anything is made explicit like
we have an explicit scientific theorem about gravity or we
have a scientific explanation about evolution or something else or
or really anything of that nature there's always more than
is ever being said or made explicit and i've discussed
this in quite a lot of depth in my episode
called explicit versus implicit understanding go check that out for
more but see we're tying this episode with that episode
together because these are closely related concepts so what i
want you to realize is that the nature of reality
is such that there's always more that is not being
said and in fact the most important elements of reality
are those which are not being said those which are
left implicit and to really master reality to master business
to master marketing to master philosophy to master science to
master spirituality you have to be very attuned and wise
enough to be able to read between the lines and
read the hidden clues in a sherlock holmesian sort of
way to see that which is not being said because
if all you take as real is the explicit stuff
that's being said you're going to be pretty dense and
dumb in your understanding of reality and human beings and
politics and economics and many other domains of life and
there is a sort of tendency a cultural tendency within
science and other certain domains where we have a bias
towards making everything explicit and if it's not made explicit
then we treat it as though it's unimportant as though
it's unreal as though it's got nothing to do with
truth and we have this sort of latent assumption that
the truth can always be made explicit and this turns
out to be false for very deep existential reasons which
i've explained in the past when i talked about kurt
goodall's and completeness theorem and i'll elaborate upon a little
bit more here after we're done with this list of
examples so going on here how about in a video
game uh meta elements of a video game might include
the hud elements on the screen like the health meter
and score points and other things these are sort of
outside of the frame of the actual game itself the
the graphical user interface any online strategy guys that you
use any cheat codes you enter in the game these
would all be meta elements outside of the actual content
of the game and cheat codes are a very interesting
example because look at how powerful cheat codes are there
are things that you can do with cheat codes in
a game that allow you to violate all the the
physical we might sort of say the physical rules and
laws of the game world by using these cheat codes
and look if you were a character inside of super
mario world and you were operating by the traditional rules
that were programmed and then all of a sudden one
of the characters in that game discovered the existence of
cheat codes as with it and was able to use
those cheat codes to gain extra lives extra continues to
live longer to gain superpowers and invincibility and god mode
and all of this literally that character can become godlike
within that world but the other characters who did not
go sufficiently meta to understand these cheat codes then to
them it would appear as though magic like how is
it possible for you to be invincible in super mario
world that's impossible nobody's invincible unless you go meta and
you use cheat code and of course computer hacking is
another great example where this is constantly happening there's a
sort of a battle between the software companies and the
black hat computer hackers who are always looking for loopholes
and exploits within software and the way that they're able
to to break operating systems and you know crack government
servers and all this sorts of stuff that you you
know we see every day in the news every week
we see new hacks by different governments and different hacking
groups what are they doing they're analyzing the code and
they're figuring out ways to to to kind of use
the code against itself to go meta on the code
and then to break it in ways that the designers
of the code never even anticipated and so that revolves
a lot of meta thinking and going meta another example
is self-referential humor meta humor meta humor is humor about
humor so a lot of times you could say a
joke which isn't even funny uh and then the audience
doesn't laugh but then you simply point out the fact
that oh i would that you were actually that that
was a joke a poorly timed joke or whatever and
then that's what becomes funny is not the original joke
that you flubbed but the meta joke you made about
the fact that you screwed up your joke and then
that's what causes people to laugh and in fact there
are certain comedians who make their entire comedy routine just
this sort of self-referential meta-humor of course another classic example
of going meta is lucid dreaming when you're dreaming ordinarily
you're not aware that you're dreaming you're stuck inside the
frame of that video game we might say or the
dream and then if something clicks and for some reason
you recognize that you're dreaming inside of your dream that's
called lucid dreaming and then you've gone meta and then
that now gives you almost again sort of this cheat
code god mode ability to be able to manipulate your
dream in ways that normally you wouldn't be able to
do now that you've simply become aware that you're dreaming
and this is like a super power that you gain
entire books have been written about how to how to
practice lucid dreaming and how to use lucid dreaming to
have sex with beautiful women and to go on roller
coasters and eat great food and go on adventures and
do all sorts of stuff or even personal development there
are books that have been written about how to do
personal development or even spiritual work after you're lucid in
your dreams you can go find some of those books
and read them and try it it's powerful stuff another
example of going meta is meta learning so usually when
we're learning in school for example we're just the teacher
tells us to read a book or to to do
some project and we're just working on that doing some
homework but when we're doing that we're not usually aware
of the fact that we're learning or how we're learning
or what is creating the learning but what's really powerful
to become a really powerful learner you want to become
a meta learner which is to learn how to learn
that means the next time you're learning something you need
to take half of your attention put it into learning
take the other half of your attention put it into
the fact that you're learning how to learn and then
as you're doing that you can spot yourself learning something
new and as you're doing that you can ask yourself
the question how did i just learn that what caused
my learning to happen and then if you observe that
over time you will develop principles that will allow you
to become a powerful meta learner such that you will
learn how to learn and you will get better at
learning and this turns out to be one of the
keys to being really good at learning you're not just
learning you're learning how to learn with language this is
also the case most people use language simply to get
whatever they want in life but they're not paying very
much attention to how they're using their language or how
language shapes their thoughts or their world view and when
you start to pay attention to that now you get
into metal language language about language and now language starts
to become self-aware and you start to recognize holy [
__ ] my language has such a significant influence on
how i think such that language and reality are not
two distinct things but are actually deeply interwoven and what
i consider reality is not just reality given to me
from the outside it's very much shaped by the language
that i use and how i think about reality and
even the thoughts that i can think are shaped by
the vocabulary that i have as i expand my vocabulary
and i take responsibility for building up my vocabulary and
i develop new concepts and new distinctions which i attach
labels to such as the concept of going meta when
i develop that distinction and i attach that label to
it and i make it explicit now that becomes part
of my lexicon now i can use that vocabulary to
communicate in a much more robust manner with myself and
also with other people and this is an extremely powerful
thing and yet at the same time i can become
aware of how language limits me so in certain ways
making these linguistic distinctions empowers me and us as a
collective community if we develop these distinctions collectively it also
limits us as well because however we define that term
or that distinction now we're going to start to see
the world carved up into this the distinctions that we
have learned and of course we haven't learned all the
possible distinctions there's too many we only learn certain ones
and we have certain biases towards certain ones and not
others and of course that all shapes our worldview and
so this is really when exploring reality becomes interesting is
when you become cognizant of how language shapes reality until
you've reached this level that i'm talking about here you
haven't even begun to to think seriously about existence you're
just operating blindly using the very limited linguistic categories that
your particular culture has handed down to you and you
just use those and usually you don't even consider that
there could be much more powerful ones or the limits
of the ones that you've been given and then of
course we can start to talk about the different pros
and cons of various languages the fact that the english
language has a certain set of restrictions a japanese or
chinese language might have a different set of restrictions and
also possibilities and strengths and then to be able to
jump between those that's very powerful see as you're doing
this whole thing you're going meta on language and then
you could even start to connect to to even more
abstract languages like logic and like mathematics and you can
go meta on those as well and then you might
even maybe one day we discover aliens or ufos and
we meet with them and they have an even you
know more robust language you might imagine than any of
the human languages and then imagine what it would how
powerful it would be to learn their language which would
be orders of magnitude beyond human language to learn that
from them and then to go meta on on that
as well and now you start to see some some
radical possibilities emerging another example of going meta is with
science this is something i'm really passionate about i've spoken
a lot about this in my episode uh my whole
series of episodes called deconstructing the myth of science where
we really get into the epistemology and metaphysical foundations of
science but in general most scientists when they're doing science
they're doing science without doing meta science which means that
they're not actually doing a science of science they're simply
taking science for granted as a given and they're using
that scientific method whatever it is they're just using it
as though it couldn't be any different and they think
they're just whatever results the method gives them is just
reality very few scientists invest the time to really think
about wait a minute where did the assumptions and the
methods of science come from and were those themselves scientifically
derived by which i mean empirically derived or are a
lot of them just dogma and belief and how do
we know that the actual foundations and methodologies of science
itself are valid when you start to ask those questions
of course you get into something that's beyond science itself
these questions are now getting into the realm of philosophy
one of the problems with modern science is that modern
science doesn't like to associate itself with philosophy it likes
to create a distinction between itself and philosophy because philosophy
is sort of a stuff that doesn't have any strict
quantifiable answers whereas science deals with the hard facts of
reality equations and calculus and quantities but as it turns
out there is no such sharp distinction and it turns
out that asking these meta questions of science is actually
the most important work that a scientist can do because
as it turns out for one to do science one
has to depend upon epistemic principles and assumptions and also
metaphysical principles and assumptions which are not themselves given by
science this is necessary otherwise science wouldn't be able to
accomplish any work any time you run a scientific experiment
there's always dozens of assumptions that are made about how
the experiment works and about how the world works and
about how the universe is structured in order for that
experiment to be possible to run it all for example
you have to assume certain basic things about the nature
of causality and time and space even to run the
most basic scientific experiment but a lot of these assumptions
about causality time and space and other things these are
not actually scientifically derived or scientifically proven these are just
conventions these are our best guesses because the fact is
that we began exploring reality from a position of total
ignorance that means we never even had a scientific method
we had to invent the scientific method as we went
along and of course as you're inventing the scientific method
how do you invent it which method do you use
to invent the method that you're going to use to
explore reality how do you know that the method you
used to derive the method was itself a valid method
you see it creates a circularity problem so if you
really want to do high quality science you've got to
go meta on science and do meta science but then
of course you're wondering will leo but then if it's
possible to do meta science wouldn't it be even better
to do meta meta science the science of meta science
and of course the answer is yes and then you
wonder well where does it end and of course the
answer is that it doesn't end that's what makes it
so tricky that's what makes reality so interesting is that
it doesn't end you can always go more meta and
that's difficult for our minds to do every extra level
of meta becomes more and more challenging requires higher levels
of abstraction ability within politics for example within political debate
you can go meta on a political debate which would
mean that you notice yourself being ideological defensive and closed-minded
so let's say that i'm a progressive and i'm arguing
against a conservative we can be arguing on content like
i might believe that abortion is is good and the
conservative might believe that abortion is evil and we might
start to hash it out and we're we're getting lost
in the content of this debate and then what could
happen is i can really realize wait a minute we're
fighting on this single plane of content but what's really
going on here is that he has his position i
have my position he has his perspective i have my
perspective both of our perspectives could be partial and incomplete
and we could be speaking past each other and therefore
it's not a matter of him being right or me
being right it's a matter of me going meta and
realizing that what this whole debate is about is about
him defending his own personal biases his ego and me
defending my personal biases and my ego i'm defending the
beliefs that i've been indoctrinated with in my liberal family
when i was growing up and he's just parroting ideas
that he learned from his conservative family who was religious
that told him that abortion was evil and all that's
happening here is we're just clashing our biases together without
any kind of higher awareness and that's like a light
bulb going up this is a earth-shattering revelation when you
realize this then you go meta on the whole debate
and you realize ah i see this is not going
to be resolved at the level of defeating his ideas
or him defeating my ideas and it doesn't matter who
wins this debate because this is all just an ego
game and then i can look inside of myself and
i can realize oh yeah i can actually use mindfulness
to penetrate into my own body become aware of my
ego at work inside of me generating this ideology and
then defending it and being closed-minded about it and refusing
to look at the situation from a higher perspective i
can actually feel my body getting hotter i can feel
myself getting angry or defensive when he's making a good
point i can also start to notice the various manipulative
tricks that his ego is using against me in this
debate and then i can notice myself using those tricks
against him and i can notice the double standards that
i have and i can notice my own biases and
i can notice his biases and i can notice the
fact that the only reason i'm arguing with him is
because i have a certain survival agenda that i'm trying
to defend with my ego and i can notice that
he's doing the same thing and when all of that
is noticed the entire game of this debate collapses that
would be going meta can you see how powerful that
is can you see how liberating that is you see
this is the kind of higher dimensional move that needs
to be done to solve this particular political problem not
just between me and him on the issue of abortion
but everywhere across society when it comes to political debates
whereas most people spend their entire lives just fighting back
and forth on the same plane without realizing that there's
a higher dimension involved and of course this doesn't just
pertain to political debates it also pertains to scientific debates
debates between science and religion atheists and theists various debates
within philosophical schools such as realism versus idealism or any
of the schools of philosophy that you've that you've read
about or might have studied in college that's that's the
power of this concept of going meta you see it
it really is the master key to resolving the majority
of mankind's problems the majority of our problems cannot be
solved on the same plane in the same dimension that
we've been trying to solve them at which is why
the problems are so sticky and so seemingly irresolvable liberals
and conservatives have been debating with each other for centuries
maybe for millennia and they still continue to do it
so that should already clue you into the fact that
we're going to keep fighting unless we realize there's a
higher level likewise mankind has been going to war with
each other for millennia we've been killing each other and
starting wars so and we're still doing it now in
the 21st century this is not something that used to
happen it still happens today there's going to be more
wars tomorrow so when you realize that you you start
to ask yourself the question like well wait a minute
what is the what is the the root structure here
that is causing us to get entangled in these wars
and you might even notice yourself getting embroiled in one
of these wars supporting one side versus another side and
then you ask yourself well wait a minute if i
get entangled and everyone's getting entangled we're just all going
to keep getting entangled forever is there a way to
make a meta move to to switch to a higher
dimension such that we're no longer getting entangled in these
debates and wars and battles and you realize there is
and you can also realize the same thing in your
relationships too if you keep fighting with your spouse or
your romantic partner or with your family members you know
your mother or your father you keep fighting with them
your children see the solution to a relationship problem or
a marriage problem is not to fight harder to get
what you want even though that's the most intuitive thing
that's that's what you it seems like hey you know
if i could just force her to give me the
sex that i want everything would be a-okay and she
thinks well if i can just force him to start
to you know say nice things to me and tell
me how much he loves me then everything would be
a-okay and of course that's not it that's not going
to solve the relationship problem the relationship problem has to
be solved at a meta level so we see this
all throughout mankind's problems individually and collectively see you can
go meta on religion too let's say i was born
as a fundamentalist christian and i'm growing up that way
until i reach my early twenties and then i look
around maybe i'm in university i notice that my friends
and others that i'm you know i have a diverse
group of friends and they have their own ideas and
beliefs some of them are hindus some there are buddhists
some of them are jews whatever and then one day
i notice wait a minute what if my religion is
not some special one the one right one what if
my religion is just one perspective out of all other
possible perspectives that mine is not any better than any
of the other ones and the only reason i believe
mine is because that's what i grew up in and
that's just what felt natural to me i was like
a fish and water i didn't even question it because
i was so young i was brainwashed with it just
like all of them were and that that's all that
it is and now i'm attached to it and i
could let it go and see if you realize that
that would be going meta on religion think of how
powerful that is think of the effect that has on
liberating one's mind to be able to do that of
course easier said than done speaking of going meta in
a in a relationship like when you and your spouse
are in a fight together you can go meta in
the sense that you can actually notice yourself creating the
fight contributing to the fight because usually when you're in
a fight you're so enmeshed in the fight you have
no distance from the fight and therefore you know you're
just thinking about how do i throw the next good
punch like you know she told me that and i
i'm gonna i'm gonna you know i'm gonna tell her
something nasty and mean about what she did last week
and that's gonna hurt her you know get her back
like that but then you can notice yourself and you
can stop it and say ah oh i look at
that i was just about to say something nasty and
mean to her which would have just triggered her and
then she would have responded with something even nastier and
meaner about me and then i would have had to
respond with something even nastier about her and then we
would have just you know been escalating rather than going
down that road which you know we've probably done many
times before why don't i stop and ascend one level
higher and try something totally different which doesn't involve fighting
i can notice myself contributing to the fight that is
how you stop a fight consider meta chess if you're
a fan of chess a little bit like i am
see in a normal chess game it's very linear in
the sense that the rules of the chess game are
all well defined and they don't change but imagine if
we were playing to speak the cliche something like a
four-dimensional chess where you had the normal chess board but
with every move of a piece you know you can
move your pawn or your rook or whatever just like
normal but every time you do every player that that
makes the move gets to also make a modification to
the rules of the game now that would be interesting
chess so let's say i move my pawn and then
i also make a second move which is a meta
move where i change one of the rules and i
say that from now on pawns instead of moving one
square at you know at a time they can move
five squares at a time from now on and so
now we make that move and we write it on
a whiteboard and now the next player you know the
next the next guy who my opponent now all his
pawns are going to be moving five steps ahead instead
of one but then when he moves his piece he
gets to make a move too he can either reverse
my move my meta move about the pawns or he
can come up with his own he can say that
from now on for example that knights move in a
diagonal the way that bishops usually do and bishops now
move like knights think about how much more interesting that
game becomes see that's metachess uh how about meta art
meta art is art that critiques other art or tries
to change how art is done or if you want
to go really meta with art you can make art
that makes the process of making art into an art
itself that would be interesting or think of uh you
know actually these are pretty common these days uh meta
movies these are hollywood movies that make critiques to the
hollywood movie industry or think about a meta tv show
where two characters inside of a tv show are talking
to each other about how the audience is watching them
and the two the two characters might be wondering like
huh i wonder if the audience who's watching us if
they're eating popcorn right now think about a meta meeting
that would be a meeting to discuss the parameters of
the meetings that we're going to have like how should
we hold our meetings how long should they be should
we have food what kind of food should we have
healthy food pizza soft drinks we can have a meta
discussion a discussion about how to have discussions what is
a valid discussion and what isn't to set those parameters
of course you've probably heard of meta analysis and meta-studies
a meta-study is a study of all the studies that
are relevant that you want to to analyze and find
data for so for example you can do a meta-analysis
of every study that has been done on the paleo
diet let's say if you're into nutrition you know what
are all the studies there's probably been hundreds of studies
done on the paleo diet well you could take all
hundred of those studies combine them together into a meta
study into a sort of a meta-analysis where you analyze
the data of all those studies and synthesize them together
and what is the ultimate conclusion of all those studies
and that can be more powerful than any single study
by itself in mathematics and in logic they have metatheorems
which is a theorem about a theorem meta theorem you
can have a meta worldview which is a world view
about all world views and in fact most people have
an implicit meta worldview so for example i could ask
you of all the different views that exist all the
religious ones the scientific ones the philosophical ones what do
you think do you think that there's only one world
view out of all those that is correct and the
all the other ones are wrong and diluted or do
you think that each one is partially correct and do
you think that they're all equally partially correct or that
some of them are more partially correct than others and
do you think that absolutely everyone is partially has some
partial truth to it or do you think that some
have no partial truth to them whatsoever at all like
for example do you think that nazism has any validity
to it whatsoever even if maybe only five percent or
do you think that nazism has zero validity whatsoever as
a worldview see you probably have some opinions about that
but then we can go met and we can ask
well how do you know that is that something you've
scientifically tested how would you know did you explore all
these world views see the problem is that most people
have very strong opinions about other world views and yet
obviously they haven't explored them which is very easy to
verify simply by asking them a few basic questions factual
questions historical questions about a worldview very few people in
the world have have seriously studied for example feminism socialism
capitalism buddhism hinduism judaism jainism zoroastrianism and that's just eight
world views right there very few people have studied that
many worldviews and yet if you ask most people about
these worldviews they're gonna have very strong opinions interesting huh
so one of the most powerful strategies in life is
to not get stuck in any one world view but
to go meta on all of them and to explore
them all as many as you can without clinging to
or getting biased into any particular one and trying to
make sense of them and trying to you know sort
out which ones have some validity and which ones don't
have any validity at all that is one of the
most valuable things you can do in your life if
you want to understand life and reality and yourself at
a deep level virtually nobody does this and the reason
is is because you would have to be able to
go meta so this ability to go meta it's very
powerful it's difficult almost nobody does it and the rewards
you can get from it are huge if you actually
do it but it takes work it takes emotional labor
it's not easy to do the reason is is because
we get attached to a particular frame right we get
stuck in these frames it's very difficult for our minds
to pop out of a frame and to discover that
higher dimension to transcend notice that in all these examples
we're really talking about some kind of transcendence how about
if we had an argument or a debate about what
constitutes a valid argument see a lot of people will
argue about stuff but really how do you know what
constitutes valid argument you might say well logic but how
do you know logic is a valid way to argue
and which kind of logic there are different kinds of
logics many different kinds of logics so we can start
to debate that and then of course that's going to
devolve into a meta-meta debate about the meta arguments because
the meta arguments themselves will be groundless and we'll have
to ground those in something and on and on it
goes and this is why argument and logic and debate
is uh not very productive most of the time because
the bottom line is that it's not grounded in anything
it's arbitrary for the most part it's arbitrary so mostly
when people are arguing or losing logic all they're doing
is they're just they're arguing to defend their biases and
their biases are just something that arose out of their
survival agenda as they were growing up there's nothing special
or absolute or true about them how about a book
about how to write books that's very meta how about
making a video game about the business of making and
selling video games that would be meta on my forum
on the actualized forum we actually have a meta forum
which is a private forum specifically for the moderators of
the forum normal people can't see this forum it's a
sub forum and but but those who are moderators and
administrators they get to see that forum and that forum
is for talking about the problems that exist on the
public part of the forum very meta uh a great
meta example is the abbot and costello skit who's on
first if you haven't seen that search it on on
youtube i'll post an example of it on my blog
it's very meta sort of joke uh james bond has
some meta jokes in it like in gold's finger [
__ ] galore it's a very meta joke um you
can find a lot of great meta humor and meta
examples in in movies for example in the tv show
house of cards with kevin spacey he breaks the fourth
wall a lot by doing those monologues you know he's
doing something like he he commits a murder it's so
over the top but he commits a murder let's say
in that show and then he will actually turn and
face the audience and speak to the audience about why
he murdered so and so that's classic breaking of the
fourth wall and actually that's that's one of the most
interesting parts of that series so it's a nice little
interesting touch that show wouldn't be quite what it was
without those breaking fourth wall monologues here's a great example
that some of you guys will like um so you
know i i i used to do pick up when
i was younger i kind of got into self-help and
pick up at the same time and so with pickup
you're learning all these principles and methods that are good
for picking up girls getting them attracted to you what's
interesting about pickup is that when you really deeply internalize
pickup and this is what a lot of women don't
understand is that if you're doing pickup effectively and you're
not just using some cheesy pickup line but you really
internalize the principles of pickup these are such honest signals
of attractiveness in a man what happens is that even
if you explicitly tell the principles to the girl as
you're picking her up they will still work and so
in fact i've actually tried this and it's one of
the one of the most amusing and enjoyable ways to
pick up a girl is to actually explain to her
how you're picking her up as you're picking her up
and as that's happening what you'll notice if you're doing
it right and you're not just faking it that she
will get really attracted to you because it's an honest
signal because really what women get attracted to in men
is they get attracted to confidence and authentic masculinity such
that if you're trying to pick up a woman but
you're doing it in an underhanded sneaky sort of way
where you're trying to hide the fact that you're trying
to pick her up then she'll notice that inauthenticity from
you because she'll feel that something is sketchy about you
you're trying to trick her in some way and she
will get repulsed and you won't be able to pick
her up she won't give you her number she won't
go on a date with you but if you're picking
her up and you're fully embodying who you are which
is like you're you're playing up the fact that you're
a player right you don't hide this fact you're open
about the fact that you sleep with lots of girls
that you're this guy and you're doing this whatever and
you're honest with her about that you would think that
all well she would not want to have anything to
do with you actually the opposite because it's such a
it's such a a powerful signal that you send when
you're comfortable with that right when you can actually carry
that and hold that that shows her that you're very
confident that you're a leader that you're a man that
you've got some balls that you don't apologize that you're
not going to back down you're not going to be
meek or weak and that makes her very attracted and
so in fact what happened once is i i met
a girl at a nightclub this was some years back
a while now um she ended up being actually this
was such a crazy coincidence and these happen when you
go out a lot and you talk to thousands of
girls this happens so anyways i bumped into this girl
who was actually tony robbins's copywriter i didn't know that
at the time i just bumped into her just literally
grabbed her she was walking through the club um grabbed
her number you know spoke to her for three three
minutes grab her number then we went on a date
the next night or something um in her hotel bar
we were at the hotel bar and anyways uh i
i kind of walk in there and she's like oh
you know the way you were texting me the other
night you know are you familiar with pickup and i
i think to myself oh [ __ ] uh she
knows about pickup what am i gonna do so i
have to so i had to admit it i couldn't
lie to her so i had to admit it so
so i decided my strategy was gonna be just to
own it right just own it and i'm like yeah
i yeah like i just was kind of honest with
her i'm like yeah you know i wasn't that good
with girls in the past so i you know got
into pickup then i got into personal development and she's
like oh personal development i you know i do i
do copy writing for personal development authors i'm like oh
yeah really which ones and she's like you know tony
robbins evan pagan and she started naming all these people
who i knew and i'm like oh no [ __
] i got all their books i read all their
books i tell her and she's like oh really which
ones and so we started so basically we had like
we had this deep connection on the fact that we
both were you know knowledgeable about this stuff and actually
and so i asked her how do you know about
pickup because you know most girls don't and she's like
well because i was in this whole self-help world i
also you know met and hung out with these pickup
artists she actually knew mystery she hung out with mystery
and neil strauss and like all the other pickup guys
and i'm like oh no [ __ ] so we
started talking about that and so we sat there for
like a couple of hours just connecting on this but
that's not the meta part the meta part is that
after all that happened i'm like okay well i mean
this is all good we're talking here but i mean
i want to sleep with you but she was playing
the game like oh i'm not going to sleep with
you tonight i'm like no we're going to sleep tonight
um and she's like oh no no i'm not i'm
not the kind i'm not that kind of girl right
so she starts playing her game i start playing my
game but as i'm playing my game i'm narrating to
her how i'm playing the game and i'm just telling
her like and i'm actually making this explicit usually this
would all be implicit but now i'm making it explicit
because you know we've we've opened this can of worm
so i start actually like every technique that i use
on her i start just telling her what technique i'm
using and i'm like okay we're gonna go walk around
we're gonna go bounce around like to different locations in
this in this hotel and she's like oh i don't
want to leave my hotel i'm like okay well we'll
just bounce around and she's like i know what you're
doing you're trying to trick me and i'm like it
doesn't matter and we just keep going and going and
going and uh and so uh yeah like i will
do my kino escalation on her like you know i'll
touch her you know this part of the body that
part of the body in a certain order you know
the way you're supposed to like ramp up the physical
escalation so as i'm doing that i'm explaining it to
her and it's it's so hilarious she's giggling and laughing
and she's getting more and more attracted by all this
and so um yeah we spent like three or four
hours doing that and i was trying to pull her
from that hotel but you know she and her friend
were staying in the same room in that hotel so
there was like no opportunity to sleep with her in
that hotel but uh but anyways like i was i
was using like every trick i had to try to
get her out of that hotel um in the end
i started she's like no i got it it's like
it's getting late it's like 4am i'm leaving town tomorrow
so it had to happen that night just because she
was leaving town and um and eventually we st we
started kissing and started making out right outside of like
her friend's room and like i was i was trying
to think of everything i could and in retrospect um
i knew exactly what would have worked now in retrospect
i know it would have worked i should have just
taken her down to the lobby and uh and actually
rented a room in like a neighboring room in that
hotel and then we would have been able to have
sex but uh but actually the reason i didn't do
that is because i was i was being very cheap
and i had this sort of principle which was actually
a bad principle it cost me it cost me multiple
girls this bad principle that i refused to pay for
any girl for anything i wouldn't buy her a drink
i certainly didn't want to buy a hotel room probably
would have cost like 150 bucks uh in that hotel
but um but yeah if if i was more flexible
on that one rule i could have paid 150 bucks
and we could have closed because she was she was
really into it it's just that the logistics of it
were impossible because her and her girlfriend were literally sleeping
in that same in that same room um there was
one other possibility which is that i could have i
could have actually gone into that room with her with
her girlfriend there and then pulled her into the bathroom
and had sex with her in the bathroom in that
room while her girlfriend was uh in the room um
you know outside the bathroom that would work as well
um but it didn't happen but anyways that is just
an example it's a long-winded way of saying that attracting
females is not about what is explicitly stated it doesn't
matter what you say verbally when you're trying to attract
a female what matters is the implicit honest signals that
are sent based on how strongly you're able to embody
your masculine authenticity and the kind of confidence and humor
and detachment from outcome that you're able to display this
is one of the most crazy and unbelievable aspects of
game when you learn to really game is that it
does not matter what you verbally say it matters what
you sub communicate and what you do and this is
what most people don't understand about pickup and this is
what a lot of women don't understand about pick up
you know most women will say oh leo if you
try to pull any of those stunts on me it
wouldn't work leo it wouldn't work on me i don't
care what you said it wouldn't work on me those
cheesy pick-up lines that wouldn't work on me but what
you don't understand is that it doesn't matter what's said
what matters is how i show up how the guy
shows up if the guy shows up and he's confident
he's cocky he's humorous he's lighthearted he's detached he's cool
he's suave it doesn't matter if he if you know
he's a player you'll still get attracted that's just how
it works it's unbelievable i mean these things i would
not have believed if they were told to me unless
i actually went out and tried it a lot and
then actually experienced it working so if if you guys
there are our gamers and you practice some game and
you really practice it authentically not just cheesy pickup lines
try it the next time you're picking up a girl
it can be so effective to be meta about it
for example one of my favorite techniques if i want
to hit on a girl like at a supermarket at
a grocery store one of the most effective openers because
that that's always you know what you're wondering like how
do i open how do i start this conversation what
do i talk about what do i say i don't
know what to say well that is your opener if
you're authentic the authentic opener is to walk up to
her and say you know i just saw you walking
by and i just stood in the corner over there
for five minutes thinking about what am i going to
say what am i going to say am i like
what can i tell her to impress her so just
that's exactly what you're telling her this is what you're
saying and like and you just tell her you know
i wanted to come up and say something but i
was nervous i didn't know what to say so here
i am that's an extremely powerful effective opener but you
have to again do it authentically because the tendency will
be for you to want to open her that way
but to still game it up and to kind of
be fake about it and in which case it won't
be very effective so so yeah authenticity like that is
is very very powerful even when you're admitting a mistake
you've made or you're admitting something bad about yourself just
the fact that you're able to admit a mistake or
the fact that you're able to admit something bad or
negative about yourself that already sub-communicates in a powerful manner
to the other person that actually this guy is honest
and he has some balls and he's able to put
himself out there because most people if they did something
wrong or had something bad about them revealed they wouldn't
be able to own it or to hold it and
so people admire that so there you go it works
on a sort of meta level another example is meta
lying which is lying about lying see most people they
don't just lie they met a lie they lie about
the fact that they lie like donald trump it's not
that she he's a a ridiculously prolific liar it's also
about the fact that he lies about the fact that
he's lying and he doesn't just lie to others he
lies to himself that he's lying most liars do that
likewise with deception we've talked about self-deception i have a
three-part series called self-deception parts one two three go check
that out very important series one of my most important
uh we talked about deception there but really deception has
a meta component to it which means that to execute
a successful deception you also have to deceive about the
fact that you're deceiving and to deceive yourself effectively you
have to not only deceive yourself but you have to
twice deceive yourself meta deceive yourself by then deceiving yourself
that you've deceived yourself and denial has this meta quality
as well whereas wherein if you are in denial you
will also deny the fact that you're in denial and
so therefore to escape self-deception and to escape denial effectively
what's required of your mind is to be able to
do this double jump maneuver where you're able to realize
that not only are you deceiving yourself you're deceiving yourself
that you're deceiving yourself and that you're denying it and
that you're double denying it only when you are conscious
of all of that will you able to go sufficiently
a level to be able to escape the self-deception very
tricky another example of meta is when you accuse someone
else of being selfish normally you would just make that
accusation and it would stop there that would be the
first tier like you know someone's being an [ __
] and you tell them how selfish they are but
there's a meta level when you become more conscious and
you do spiritual work conscious work every time that you
call someone out for being selfish like let's say you
say oh donald trump he's such a selfish [ __
] right okay but you know most progressives and liberals
feel that way but what most progressives and liberals don't
understand is that actually when you're calling donald trump a
selfish [ __ ] even though that's true the only
reason you're calling him a selfish [ __ ] is
because you yourself are selfish you see otherwise if you
weren't selfish why would you be bothered by the selfishness
of others now you say oh leo but uh it's
not because i'm selfish that i'm bothered by the selfishness
of others it's that people being selfish they're hurting others
and i'm bothered by the fact that they're hurting others
because i'm selfless aha but the fact that you're hurt
because other people are being hurt by selfish people that
itself is an act of selfishness on your part and
see to really go deep in your spiritual effort and
development you need to be able to recognize all of
this and you need to become so selfless that you're
not even bothered by other people being selfish by recognizing
that that is more selfishness within you you see anything
that's bothering you by definition is your own selfishness and
in this way you attain nirvana and you will never
attain nirvana so long as you're bothered by the selfishness
of others because others will always be selfish to the
only way to transcend that is to realize that the
selfishness of others only bothers me because i myself am
selfish and so if i want others to stop being
selfish i have to do the first and final move
which is just to eliminate selfishness within me once i
eliminate selfishness with me within me it doesn't even matter
that others eliminate selfishness with them because it no longer
bothers me and you might say leo but that's selfish
and then of course i would say yes it is
but that's selfish with a capital s yeah and there
we're getting into sort of very very weird strange loopy
non-dual um collapses between selflessness and selfishness uh and speaking
spiritual work you know nettie nettie method the nettie nettie
method of self-inquiry that you might have been taught seen
some youtube videos about this probably i have a video
about this myself nettie method you can search for it
uh yeah the self-inquiry method is basically a method of
going meta on everything on the entire world you say
i'm not the body i'm not the hand i'm not
the foot i'm not the face i'm not the brain
i'm not the mind i'm not anything at all and
then eventually through that you can get to awakening meta
meta meta meta you keep going meta meta meta on
everything until you awaken and you know how in the
classic zen colons the zen masters are talking about the
finger pointing to the moon well the finger pointing to
the moon what is that that's meta see when the
finger points to the moon and the fool looks at
the finger he's not going meta but when the when
the fool is able to see that the finger is
not there for you to look at the finger the
finger is there for you to look at the moon
ah okay now i've gone meta i've gone meta on
the finger to see that it's pointing to something that's
going meta so that's my list of examples as you
can see some of these examples are very trivial but
some of them are very deep and significant in fact
the most significant and there are a lot of domains
where this is applied metaphysics meta-science metapolitics metaphilosophy metalogic there's
a lot a lot i could talk about with better
logic you know you could have a even a meta
metalogic and a meta meta metal logic uh for that
i recommend you read the works of douglas hofstadter gerda
lasher and bach i recommend you check out my episode
on google's and completeness theorem called the metaphysical implications of
google's completeness theorem i have multiple episodes that touch upon
strange loops and logic and the logic of infinity and
things of that nature go check that out um some
of those are very technical topics but basically what logicians
and mathematicians learned in the early 20th century is that
logic itself there's an infinite number of different logics logics
are just axiomatic systems and there's an infinite number of
them and that every single logic itself requires a metalogic
to ground that logic in and then a metalogic requires
a metametalogic to ground it in that's because all logics
are ultimately groundless because all of reality is ultimately groundless
and so anytime you're dealing with a closed system which
is what a logic is there's always some larger system
that that closed system has to be couched within some
you know larger frame so every finite frame has another
frame outside of it by definition that's what it means
to be finite that's a very brief overview i'm kind
of glossing over it here let's move on though to
meta philosophy so meta philosophy is philosophy about how to
do philosophy and that's what was most interesting to me
when i entered the field of philosophy see when i
first started doing philosophy around late high school early university
undergrad days for me my problem was this is that
i got an encyclopedia philosophy i flipped through it and
i thought there were all these different philosophical schools there
was idealism there was realism there was empiricism there's rationalism
there's a solipsism there's uh buddhism and a million others
so i looked at all that and i said okay
well which one's true and there was no answer and
so this this made me very concerned not about philosophy
but about metaphilosophy because i didn't want to get stuck
into some you know one bad philosophy i cared about
how do i figure out which philosophy is the correct
one which takes you into the realm of meta philosophy
so then i started thinking about well what would it
even mean to know which philosophy is better than another
one or which one is truer than another one that
got me into epistemology i started thinking about foundations of
knowledge how humans know anything at all and as i
started researching and contemplating all of that uh i started
to to realize that it's all groundless and that it's
all relative and that it's all based upon personal biases
and that there really isn't any one right philosophy and
that really the entire academic philosophical pursuit is really just
a game it's just ego games of people arguing but
never getting to any absolute truth um metapolitics what is
metapolitics well it's what i presented in my conscious politics
series part one two three four to me metapolitics means
if conventional politics is you know dividing ourselves into tribes
liberals and conservatives and then battling back and forth trying
to win over the other one trying to dominate and
exterminate the other one if that's conventional politics metapolitics is
becoming conscious of that whole game and realizing that that's
not gonna solve anything and that really what is necessary
is we need to raise the level of consciousness of
everybody involved in the game to the point where they
can recognize this sort of tribal all these tribal dynamics
and the way in which our worldview and our belief
systems are shaping our biases and then we're fighting over
these different biases and the fact that it's all just
brute survival and that our survival agendas are arbitrary and
that really we need to spiritualize our politics and make
it about consciousness not about winning any particular policy battle
it's not about abortion it's not about civil rights it's
not about racism it's not about gun control really politics
is about raising the consciousness of mankind and getting everybody
to love each other that's what politics is really about
and then when you realize that and you start to
work with politics in that manner to understand politics in
that manner then you're getting into what i would call
metapolitics meta science already touched upon a little bit meta
science to me means the stuff that i discussed in
my three-part series deconstructing the myth of science it's basically
thinking deeply and critically about the foundations of science and
how we can make science better by questioning and deconstructing
and then improving those foundations there's also meta business if
conventional business is about figuring out how to earn the
most money and how to monopolize a marketplace that's what
it is meta business is about thinking about how to
create a more conscious business it's about looking at how
business is done as a whole what are the sort
of externalities that businesses create and what kind of impact
do businesses have on their environments and on their marketplaces
how do businesses shape the consciousness of mankind individually and
collectively how businesses are just functions of survival usually and
then trying to look at business from this higher perspective
uh you can have meta art you can have meta
media media about media meta relationships basically if you want
to have a effective relationship you need to do meta
relationship the problem of relationship can't be solved with relationship
only with meta relationship there has to be almost like
three entities within a relationship there has to be you
there has to be your spouse or partner and then
there has to be the third entity which is the
larger whole lawn of the two of you together sort
of the relationship itself as a whole and both of
you and her or him whoever got to come together
and kind of merge yourselves and surrender yourselves to the
higher unit and that would be meta relationship then there's
meta spirituality which is if conventional spirituality is picking one
school of spirituality and just doing its techniques blindly meta
spirituality is the study of all the different schools picking
the best practices out of all of them and trying
to ask the question of like what are all of
them trying to do why are they fighting with each
other why don't the hindus agree with the buddhists agree
with the christians and so forth and how do we
align all those together take the best parts of all
of them and just ask ourselves what are they all
trying to do what's the essence of all of these
different traditions to me that would be meta-spirituality meta work
would be doing your work but while you're doing your
work finding ways to do your work better there could
even be meta sex when you're having sex and it's
a little bit tricky because usually when you're having sex
you want to be fully present and in the flow
that's an important aspect of sex but also see most
people the way they have sex is they just have
sex they're not interested in improving how to have sex
they're not interested in talking to their partner about how
to please them better they're just unconsciously having sex like
animals but imagine having sex in a way where you
actually try to communicate with your partner to figure out
what what turns her on the most or what turns
him on the most communicating and then turning that as
part of the intimacy sort of aikidoing that jiu-jitsu in
that and converting it into part of the intimacy that
you two have as the sort of meta relationship such
that you're having sex but you're also figuring out ways
how to please each other better and learning how to
improve the quality of the sex and the intimacy and
then that would be medisex alright so those are the
examples now let's get into the real meat i want
to explain i want to explain why this meta thing
is so important so as we've seen many of our
deepest problems can only be solved one level higher by
going meta as i've talked about in my episode called
content versus structure a lot of our problems are us
getting locked into battles of content differences while not noticing
the structure like for example we might have atheists and
theists arguing with each other on content like one of
them says god exists the other one says god does
not exist and it seems like they're they couldn't be
more different and one of them has to be right
and one has to be wrong right no they're both
wrong and they're both part right in certain ways um
and they're both engaging in the same dogmatic limited paradigm
locked perspectives in a certain sense and so we got
to be able to to see the structural similarities between
atheists and theists they're both dogmatic that's the structure it's
dogma it's personal biases and then to transcend that you
got to let those go then you can get to
a higher level so i've just i've discussed and given
many examples of this in my episode about content versus
structure so see that another point here about why med
is so important is that if you're going to do
something well anything in life that you want to do
really well you must bring the method of doing it
or the process of doing it itself under scrutiny so
what do i mean by this like for example if
you want to do language really well you can't just
walk around spouting language you also have to reflect about
your language and you have to go meta on the
language and develop a language about your language you have
to think deeply about the language you have to observe
very mindfully how you use your language otherwise you're not
really going to be a master of language likewise if
you're going to be doing art it's not enough for
you to just do art you also have to think
about art you have to do meta art you have
to ask the question what is art how can i
do better art why is this the case that the
method or process itself has to be brought under scrutiny
well think of it this way it's like trying to
observe something with a telescope if you're so busy focused
on the content of the telescope what the what the
telescope is showing you right the thing you're looking at
so let's say you're looking at the moon with a
telescope if you're so preoccupied with seeing the moon that
you never divert any attention to inspecting the telescope itself
can you see how this is a problem what if
your telescope has a crack what if the lenses are
misaligned what if there's dirt on the lens what if
the glass of the lens has a certain tint red
green blue that's going to distort every object you look
at the lens at the you look look at with
that telescope see that's going to be a systemic corruption
all the way through so likewise if you're doing art
without looking at the method of how you're doing art
if there's corruption or distortion in your method or lack
of optimization in your method that's going to lead to
bad art for the rest of your life unless you
look at it step outside of it to look at
it and then change it you can't step outside of
it to look at it and change it if you're
too identified with it like if you're too attached to
using your paintbrush in a particular way so attached that
you're not willing to let go of your paintbrush then
you can't pick up a better paint brush you're stuck
with that one see likewise if you're doing science and
you're not gonna devote significant amount of time wondering if
the scientific method you're using is itself fully valid or
whether it has corruptions in it that means you're just
going to use your method and if there's any corruptions
in your method all of the science you do for
the rest of your life is going to be corrupt
and the only way you can know is by stepping
outside of the science you're using observing it objectively from
the outside and then changing it but to change it
and to observe it objectively you would you can't be
identified with it see because if you're identified with it
then any mistake in it you're going to take too
personally and then you won't change it likewise with how
you do business likewise with logic with mathematics with philosophy
if you're too attached to one philosophical school you can't
see that philosophical school objectively you can't see its errors
you're blind to its errors you have blind spots and
therefore you're going to be stuck with those heirs for
the rest of your life it's this which gets you
to detach from your you know pet philosophy or from
your pet science or from your pet religion the recognition
that it could be corrupt and you don't know that
it's not corrupt because you've never examined it if you're
honest like ask any christian have you really combed through
all of christianity to examine whether it's corrupt or not
no of course not there's no way they could have
done that that's a huge monumental undertaking that would take
decades to accomplish and if they did it they would
realize yes it is corrupt guaranteed likewise with science likewise
with business likewise with art likewise with mathematics likewise with
spirituality if you're too attached to doing spirituality one way
ask yourself where did that one way come from where'd
you get that way you didn't make it up yourself
you got it from other humans you saw a youtube
video you read a book your parents taught it to
your rabbi taught it to you somebody taught it to
you and when they taught it to you you didn't
critically examine it because you didn't have that capacity if
you learned yoga you didn't critically examine yoga if you
learned meditation you didn't critically examine meditation you just took
it on blind faith that the yoga the meditation the
christianity whatever you learned that it's not corrupt and the
person teaching it to you also wasn't corrupt these are
just implicit assumptions that needs to be brought under scrutiny
and i guarantee you once you bring it into sufficient
scrutiny you'll realize it's way more corrupt than you could
have ever imagined which is precisely why you don't want
to bring it under scrutiny it's not that you don't
want to bring it under scrutiny because it would be
a waste of time because actually it's it's very pure
and you don't want to waste time examining looking for
corruptions where not exist no no no that's never the
problem the problem is always that you don't want to
look and scrutinize for corruption precisely because the corruption is
so bad that if you truly looked you would be
horrified that's the real reason that nobody bothers to do
any scrutiny of any of the methods whether it's science
or religion or spirituality or business the corruption is just
massive in all of these fields in medicine too oh
boy especially in medicine western medicine is one of the
most corrupt of all possible methodologies so that's extremely important
can you see that i'm going out of my way
here to try to convince you of how important this
is going meta creates detachment that's one of the super
powers of going meta you see if you don't go
sufficiently meta you're going to be attached to the thing
because you're going to identify with it and of course
the best example of that is your own body if
you believe that you are this body if you believe
that you are this mind this ego mind you haven't
gone sufficiently meta in your consciousness to realize that you're
you are those things but you're not just those things
those are those are minor aspects of you you're way
beyond that if you haven't done that meta meta move
then you're identified with the body with your physical appearance
maybe even with your youth with your beauty with your
wealth with your fame with your status with your humanity
with your culture with your religion with your nation you're
identified with all that and then any time any one
of those things gets threatened or destroyed you take it
personally because you're attached to it you have to be
because you're identified with it right like if you're identified
with being an american and america gets attacked you're going
to take it personally and then you're gonna act in
dumb ways to defend that attachment if you're a scientist
you're attached to being a scientist your whole career and
your whole ego mind is invested in doing science you're
invested into realism materialism rationalism atheism other isms you're you're
so attached to those things that you can't even conceive
of a reality otherwise and so you're stuck with that
and you're going to suffer for all those attachments because
all those attachments will end one day whether it's with
your physical death or with something else maybe you lose
your career maybe your your theory gets disproven maybe you
write a book and then somebody writes a better book
than you that trashes on your book and then you're
going to be butt hurt about it why because you're
attached to it so the whole logic behind spirituality or
awakening is that you go meta meta meta meta meta
meta meta meta meta through the neti method you go
so meta that eventually you identify with absolutely nothing and
then nothing can hurt you you become literally immortal that's
spiritual transcendence that is your truest nature your truest nature
is infinite transcendence but of course this is what makes
spirituality so difficult and so controversial and so threatening and
so confusing to people it's confusing because your mind doesn't
want a direct path towards complete detachment and transcendence and
emptiness your mind wants to attach to stuff therefore it
makes spirituality into this very complicated controversial difficult ordeal simply
because your mind on its way to nothingness your mind
just wants to cling to absolutely everything that it can
so you personally suffer when you can't go sufficiently meta
and also important domains of life like science logic politics
religion they also suffer when they're not able to go
sufficiently meta jail breaking your mind which again is one
of our goals here with this work requires that the
mind go meta the mind is always engaged in an
active process of constructing reality but the mind is not
aware that it's doing so and it needs to keep
denying that it's doing so why is it necessary to
deny the construction of reality because if you don't deny
it you realize that reality is a construction in which
case it becomes illusory and therefore it loses its reality
so reality is really just a lack of consciousness of
the fact that you're dreaming this whole thing up so
the trick is to dream it up but then to
deny that you dreamt it that's the whole game that's
the game everybody is playing here your mom is playing
this game your dad is playing this game muslims are
playing this game christians are playing this game scientists are
playing this game conservatives are playing this game progressives are
playing this game marxists are playing this game capitalists are
playing this game that's the game humans play we're always
constructing reality to suit ourselves and that's why we're so
touchy about it too you see because when you're constructing
your reality to suit yourself it's very fragile it's very
easy for it to break apart therefore the ego needs
to get very defensive and very manipulative about how it
goes defending that that's why it loves to argue and
to debate and to troll to little nasty comments online
and stuff like this and to wage crusades and holy
wars those are all the tactics and methods that it
uses to convince itself first and foremost that it's not
constructing reality but of course that is the very evidence
that it's constructing reality because if you were constructing reality
why would you be struggling so hard to maintain it
notice how hard you struggle to maintain it why would
you get emotional about issues of god or science or
logic or math or business or politics why would any
of these things emotionally affect you unless your survival hinged
on it unless these things were sand castles that could
go at any any moment with the next wave you
see the trick with science is that no amount of
science can get you to realize that you're inside of
a dream because science is happening within a frame see
this is what scientists don't understand is that they think
that science is just like this universal solvent this universal
method that explains and touches everything but it doesn't science
is just like a picture within a frame hanging on
a wall in a giant museum that's filled with a
thousand other paintings same goes for rationality rationality is not
a universal solvent rationality is also just a single painting
in a frame hung in a museum with a thousand
other paintings the problem is that when you get stuck
in any one frame this frame could be science rationality
skepticism nihilism atheism christianity islam buddhism whatever if you get
stuck in that one frame from your vantage point it
will seem as though that frame is all that there
is that's what a frame is it seems total but
it's not total that's the trick to realize that it's
not totally you have to be able to go meta
if you can't go meta beyond something that thing ends
up being the totality of your reality but really it's
like you just confined yourself to a kiddie pool and
you think that well this kiddie pool is as big
as water gets no the kiddie pool is just some
artificial thing you've been swimming in there's a giant ocean
out there that's a billion times deeper than your kiddie
pool but if you insist on staying in the kiddie
pool that's all you're going to know and no amount
of logic or debate will convince you that there's more
outside your kiddie pool the only thing that will convince
you there's something more outside the kiddie pool is the
intuition that there might be something more and then your
personal effort to step outside the pool and go find
something more that would be going meta if you're uninterested
in doing that if you're lazy and you don't want
to walk outside the pool then you'll be stuck in
there forever and you will be totally convinced that that's
all there is this is why scientists can be so
dumb this is why highly rational people with high iqs
can be so clueless about the nature of existence and
consciousness and spirituality why is meta such a deep feature
of reality you might wonder what's so special about it
why would reality be this way well as we've talked
about in the past it's because reality is infinite see
infinite means it has no limits it has no outer
boundary it's completely open-ended infinite means there's always more no
matter how much of a reality you've seen there's always
an infinite number more of reality that you haven't seen
that's the radical nature of infinity if you want a
deeper explanation of infinity check out my two-part series called
understanding infinity part one and part two and beyond those
two parts i've also talked about it elsewhere as well
so reality is one reality is infinite or infinity absolute
infinity we could call it but see the problem is
that us humans were finite creatures and we create lots
of finite closed systems via language logic thought and symbols
we're always trying to grasp some little corner of reality
but every little piece of reality we grasp is not
the whole thing by definition but then we take our
little finite closed systems and we want to pretend as
though they are the whole thing but every finite closed
system has a boundary around it if it has a
boundary around it that means there's an inside and there's
an outside see infinity is that which has no inside
and outside the inside and outside are the same but
in every finite closed system there's always an inside and
an outside and this is where the problem happens if
you have a system that has an inside and outside
that means you could be inside it or outside it
so to go meta is to jump from inside to
outside when you jump outside of it you can see
it if you're inside of it you can't fully see
it when you're inside of it it seems like it
is the total thing when you're outside of it you
can see that oh this is just one part of
something larger right so since reality is made out of
holons we've talked about that in my episode called what
are holons go check that out if you don't know
what a haul on is so since reality is composed
of these holons you can always jump outside of one
hole on to a higher one to a higher one
to a higher one infinitely because that's what infinity means
it goes on forever and why is reality infinite and
not finite simply because uh there can't exist anything outside
of reality that would constrain it or put a boundary
around it because anything that's outside of it by definition
has to be inside of it here's where it gets
paradoxical and strange loopy because if you had two realities
you might say well there might be there could be
two realities but then those two realities have to be
connected into one larger reality because what would be the
thing separating the two any boundary between two realities to
say that there's two realities that means you must say
there's a boundary between between them what is that boundary
matter is it mad at something real if it's not
that means there's not two of them if it is
that means that real boundary has to not be either
one or two but a third thing and if it's
real and this is real and this is real all
three are real that means it's reality real one sit
down and think it through with a piece of paper
there's a pretty pretty simple logic to it it's not
it's not that complicated most people just don't want to
do the work so as it turns out truth exists
truth and reality are identical and truth is infinitely meta
truth is the whole of reality everything that exists is
truth with a capital t and that truth is infinite
it it spans forever it's endless and this truth is
transcendental it can't be captured with symbols thoughts logic or
any kind of closed systems or language anytime you try
to capture the truth in a closed system you can
capture a piece of it but the piece is never
the whole it's an infinitesimally small piece of the whole
therefore you can keep talking and talking and talking and
talking but you're never ever going to be able to
reach the end of truth truth will always remain transcendental
truth always escapes symbolic and systemic encapsulation and if you
want more on why that is the case check out
my episode called the metaphysical implications of google's incompleteness there
so why do smart people not understand god because god
is not a bearded man in the clouds god is
infinity god is truth god is infinitely meta to understand
god your mind needs to become infinitely meta literally you
need to be able to detach from the whole of
reality every single one of your attachments and you have
to grasp it implicitly you can't grasp god explicitly in
a finite manner because god is infinite so you can't
make god finite so this is the mistake that scientists
and rationalists and other materialists and folks make is that
they they keep asking like leo show us a proof
for god but when you say a proof for god
what you're talking about is you're talking about a a
quantified formalized finite explicit symbolic proof via language or logic
or mathematics or whatever but by definition that can't be
god because that's finite see the problem is that you're
not understanding you're not understanding that you're not understanding what
you're asking for what you're asking for is impossible and
you take the impossible thing you're asking for and you
take that as evidence of the fact that god isn't
real but that's just because you're asking for something impossible
it's like you're asking for for me to show you
uh you know a square circle so this this kind
of impossible thing you're asking for gives you then gives
your ego then a plausible deniability where you say ah
leah since leo can't can't explicitly state it since leo
can't explicitly state the truth that means the truth must
not exist or he might not must not understand it
or that the truth cannot be accessed no one can
know the truth no that's not what i'm saying i'm
saying the truth exists you can access it i've accessed
it many people have accessed it you can access it
too but you have to drop your foolish expectation to
make the truth explicit you can't make the truth explicit
you need to go meta see you're trying to get
the truth while staying within your frame and i'm saying
you can access the truth but not within your frame
you have to pop outside your frame and the next
frame and the next frame and the next room you
have to pop out outside of every single frame and
then you will get absolute truth and if you click
to any frame at all you will not get absolute
truth and because you're clinging to one particular frame somewhere
in this infinite chain of frames you think that there
isn't truth or there isn't god that's just because you're
stuck that's all it is your mind is just stuck
that's literally all that it is and all of our
work here is just to lubricate your mind all of
these videos all of my talking you might wonder what
leo if if the truth can't be spoken how come
you talk so much well because the words are only
fingers pointing to the moon they're just lubrication for your
mind for you to lubricate your mind such that these
frames stop clinging and you can just keep going meta
meta meta meta and not cling to anything at some
point it's going to click in your mind that like
you pop out of one frame religion then you pop
out of the next frame science then you pop out
of the next frame mathematics then you pop out of
the next frame logic then you pop out of the
next frame physical objects then you pop out the next
frame time then the next frame space you keep popping
out of every single frame until you realize they're all
just [ __ ] partial frames and it doesn't matter
what the [ __ ] content of the frame is
it doesn't matter if it's religion or science or anything
mathematics it's all imaginary and you keep popping out of
it forever until you're [ __ ] dead and you
realize in the end that the final frame that you
have to pop out of is the thing you call
your life and then you're awake but you see everybody
is holding on to every single frame because if you
truly were able to lubricate your mind sufficiently that the
frames would just slip past and you would just fall
out of them your life would be over your life
hinges upon which frames you cling to therefore i'm trying
to lubricate your mind but your mind has defense mechanisms
which are resisting the lubrication and nobody can help you
with that but you you have to want this it
can't be done to you if you're too scared of
the consequences of what's going to happen if your mind
is fully lubricated and every frame is broken then that
fear you have whatever level of fear you have that's
exactly where you find yourself in life that's where your
mind is stuck your mind is stuck by your level
of fear the more of the fear the lower down
you're stuck you'll be stuck somewhere in christianity or in
islam if you have a little bit less fear you'll
be stuck in science and atheism if you have a
little less fear you'll be stuck in some spiritual thing
buddhism or whatever you have a little less fear you'll
be stuck somewhere higher up so really just ask yourself
what am i clinging to intellectually what do i cling
to in life which ideas which theories which ideologies and
then let them go notice the payoff you get for
the things you cling to like if you're a capitalist
and you cling to your capitalist beliefs you get a
payoff for that and that payoff it could be intellectual
satisfaction like you might just feel like oh yeah i'm
better than those those stupid marxists it could be like
that that's one payoff another payoff is just millions of
dollars in your bank account from the business that you
run that could be another payoff maybe you're trading stocks
maybe you're a landlord and you earn lots of money
that way great payoff for you do you want to
let it go no okay well then you'll be stuck
where you are see you're afraid of letting that go
what what would happen if you let go of wall
street what would happen if you let go of running
a business what would happen if you let go of
your anti-marxist ideology the kind of satisfaction you get for
hating marxists that's just one example if you're a marxist
it's the same same [ __ ] the same [
__ ] on a structural level on a metal level
it's the same [ __ ] the content is different
but the shit's the same if you're a marxist one
of the biggest juices you get in your day is
haiti on capitalists you see a rich capitalist on tv
and you just you just want to smack him in
the face for being such a selfish [ __ ]
and that that juices your ego up and you feel
good about yourself because of this it's an addiction you
have and then you get to whine and complain for
your lack of success in life because you know leo
i can't i can't be a millionaire because you know
if i was then i would be one of those
evil capitalists and so and all i do is i
just sit online on some marxist forum and just you
know talk [ __ ] about capitalism and that's what
you devote your life to you know but if if
if i would rather have you spending the next 10
years on a marxist forum whining about capitalism or actually
being a capitalist i'd rather you be a capitalist at
least you'll produce something of value for the world even
if you end up you know burning some rainforests while
you're at it at least you'll do something productive your
stupid you know [ __ ] marxist posts on some
forum on reddit or whatever isn't gonna do [ __
] it's just gonna get more people um you know
stuck in the same kind of frame of mind that
you're stuck in so what if you let that go
do you dare see that's that's the whole trick here
is that nobody dares let this go it's very difficult
to let let go of these intellectual attachments and they're
not merely intellectual they also have real world payoffs like
for example you might be a marxist and you might
be married to a marxist and maybe the reason you
and your girlfriend who's now your wife or whatever are
you know maybe the reason you have you fell in
love and even had children is because you were both
marxist and really passionate about that and your whole relationship
is built upon you know discussing political theory or whatever
maybe i don't know for some people it might be
that way and then see would you surrender that how
do you convince the person like that to surrender it
you see the more you invest in something in your
life the more important it is to you the more
it pays to you especially like for example your children
your family your religion your military service if you go
volunteering in some organization see these things you invest so
much of your time and energy into these things that
it's virtually impossible for you to let them go and
then that's what you become stuck on now be careful
i am not here saying that you should just throw
everything out the window in a reckless manner that would
be dangerous uh or rather i should say that would
be reckless um see the problem with spiritual growth is
that you it can't be forced upon you you have
to come to it yourself so even though i want
to push you to the highest levels because that's kind
of what i'm interested in and what i'm here to
teach but don't let me force you to go beyond
what you're able to handle sort of like you know
like if you're in fourth grade learning mathematics and i'm
up here teaching calculus just because i'm teaching calculus that
does not mean that i expect you to you know
drop all your fourth grade homework and then just to
come up to my level in a single month or
whatever likewise i teach a lot of advanced stuff on
this channel through these videos and many of you aren't
ready for it for many of you this is just
stuff for the future it's a road map of where
you can go if you really want to go somewhere
with your growth but that doesn't mean you have to
do it all right now it means you can you
can use these ideas and plan out a long-term plan
for your maybe maybe maybe this is a plan for
you for the next you know in 10 years or
in 20 years you'll get there but right now maybe
you still have to explore the lower stages maybe you
got to start a business maybe got to go get
the sex you need get a relationship have some children
you know go do the stuff you're attached to burn
through those attachments recognize that they're not all as great
as you think they are and then come back and
we can we can take you higher see so it
really just is a matter of what you're comfortable with
what is your ego comfortable with how much growth can
you tolerate how much are you willing to detach from
in your life if you're not willing to detach from
sex and from hamburgers and from lamborghinis and fine jewelry
well that's where you're at it would actually be a
problem if you try to fake it and you try
to act as though you're above these things but really
you're not you see that's the trap here it's very
tricky there's a lot of traps in this work so
watch out for this one if you're trying to follow
me make sure you're honest with yourself where you're at
in your growth roughly how dense is your ego and
just be honest about that if not to me or
to others at least to your own self because there's
this danger where you start to think like oh i'm
all interested in awakening and i'm all interested in this
meta stuff and god but actually you're not you're interested
in sex and food and money well if that's the
case then just be honest about that and work from
there you have to work from an honest place and
to be honest i'm not fully ready to detach from
all this stuff i talk about this stuff because you
have to plan ahead right like you can't just if
you're if you're if your goal is to do something
ambitious like fly to mars you got to plan this
years and decades ahead and you gotta you gotta like
have some ideals that you're operating under that doesn't mean
necessarily that i'm ready to fly to mars tomorrow maybe
i will be in 10 20 years but not right
now but that doesn't mean i can't plan so that's
kind of what we're doing here i still got attachments
i got attachments to food i got attachments to sex
i got attachments to business i got attachments to my
work but the important differences is that you can be
attached to stuff but you should already start to be
thinking about how these attachments are limiting you so while
a lot of people in the world are attached to
stuff most of them have no idea they're attached to
it for in the first place and most of them
have no idea how much they're limited by that and
they also thirdly they don't know what's beyond that what's
possible beyond it this creates a very stuck situation with
me i would say i still have plenty of attachments
the difference is that i'm becoming more aware of these
attachments and how limited how limited they are and i'm
also already sort of laying the groundwork for what's coming
ahead because i know that these attachments are not going
to hold they're temporary so maybe you can maybe that
helps you you can resonate with that i want to
point out this interesting feature of going meta which is
that there's a sort of thrill to it notice this
thrill and the best example of this i read online
when i was doing research for this episode is i
noticed some father was discussing how his young child learned
this idea of meta and he had a label maker
so this child has a label maker and he used
the label maker to print out the word label maker
as a sticker and then stick it on the label
maker and as he did all this he got a
great chuckle out of it and he was very delighted
in himself the child now this might seem like an
innocent little example what does it really say but actually
what you should notice is that throughout your life like
this child you too have had encounters with going meta
when you see the frame of a situation and you're
able to pop outside of the frame and when you
do this there's a certain delight that fills your soul
i call this the delight of meta recognition you recognize
that the finger is pointing towards the moon rather than
just a finger that you look at you discover that
there's something implicit that's being suggested and then when you
discover that implicit thing it gives you delight it feels
like you've discovered a hidden truth about reality it feels
like an inside joke and that's what a lot of
awakened people report when they awaken you know sometimes you
can ask an awakened person so what was it like
for you to awaken and uh they just laugh they
chuckle or they so or they just say i get
it it's it's god's cosmic joke why do they say
that because there truly is a delight in recognizing this
sort of secret mystery behind existence going meta has this
ineffable slippery quality to it you can never fully articulate
it in the same way that a really good joke
has a strong punch line and you either get the
punch line or you don't and if you don't get
the punch line explaining the punch line to a person
who didn't get it is not the same thing as
just getting it right off the bat so notice that
i want you to notice that and the next time
it happens to you this meta recognition next time it
happens i want you to notice that delight that appears
and i want you to contemplate what is that delay
why is this happening why do i enjoy this and
i suggest that if you do enjoy it as you
might notice that you should keep pursuing that and ask
yourself the question of like well if i got some
meta recognition here where else can i get some meta
recognition where else can i go meta and you keep
doing it and doing it and doing it and then
as you do that you develop a sort of a
love for it a delight for it and then maybe
one day that'll lead to your awakening the ultimate delight
see when you're going meta you're in some way touching
the implicit touching the divine you're discovering the divine within
the universe and if you're a bit of a logic
nerd science nerd math nerd and you appreciate the works
of douglas hofstadter and his masterpiece girdle escher and bach
then one of the remarkable things about hofstadter's work is
that it's so whimsical on the one hand it's this
dense nerdy mathematical logical topic and it's hard to read
through that book one of the most challenging books you'll
ever read with all these math mathematical proofs but it's
different from just other it's different from like the logical
textbook it has this whimsy and artistry to it it
has a cleverness um he writes at such a clever
way he won a pulitzer prize for that back in
the late 70s but uh but for a lot of
guys who are like in the computer science community the
math nerd logical community and so forth they can appreciate
that whimsical nature to logic and that's just a little
taste of what you get when you pursue spiritual work
see you get more of that not within the logical
domain outside the logical domain you get more and more
of that and it's addictive it's not just a chore
you do it's addictive and you can see a beauty
and an artistry to it and that is one of
the one of the charms of doing consciousness work is
that sometimes it's difficult and grueling you go through emotional
turmoil and ego backlashes that's all the bad stuff but
then as far as the good stuff sometimes you get
these moments of clarity and just this beauty and you
see the the mystery awe and wonder and genius of
existence and i would suggest to you that if you
entered science and you're a serious scientist that that is
really why you're doing science is for that reason that's
really what you want out of science you don't want
to do dry boring crusty old science you want science
which is connected with soul and spirit so really we're
completely on the same page the difference between what you
might perceive i'm saying here if you're an atheist or
you're a rationalist or a materialist or a realist or
a scientist uh or a logician or mathematician it might
seem like we're totally you know diametrically opposed actually we're
not we're much closer aligned than you would think because
you and i are both just trying to explore the
mystery of nature right and the ultimate achievement of that
is awakening not your math or your logic or your
science even though those are little little tidbits of it
little tidbits now as we're wrapping up here i have
to end on this of course no episode about going
meta would be complete unless we went meta on the
topic of going meta of course so that's how we'll
end i want to take you to the ultimate level
of meta with a little demo so here is truly
going meta see if you can follow this with me
so throughout this episode i've been using language to speak
to you to communicate about a concept called going meta
in fact that's what i'm doing right now i'm conscious
right now that i'm speaking to you using consciousness using
symbols and language which is arbitrary which but which communicates
certain powerful concepts so as i'm using language i'm thinking
and as i'm thinking my thinking is triggering your thinking
through this medium of language that's exactly what is happening
right now become conscious of this as it's happening and
notice that this is you and me together going meta
but it doesn't stop there let's keep going you are
watching this as a youtube video i am appearing in
this youtube video i'm conscious that even though right now
as i'm speaking i'm sitting here and i am not
in a youtube video but when you're going to be
watching this i will be in a youtube video and
in fact notice that what i am is i am
pixels on a screen so this entire video has been
pixels on a screen talking to you about a concept
called going meta using language but moreover you can notice
that these pixels on a screen are actually just a
fragment a figment of your own consciousness so actually this
entire time what's been happening you might have thought that
some human was sitting there talking to you about some
concept really what was happening is that a fragment of
your own consciousness manifesting as pixels on a screen through
this thing we call a youtube video has been thinking
and using language to trigger thinking within you and now
you're becoming more conscious of that become conscious that the
youtube video and this screen full of pixels is your
own consciousness you are speaking to yourself and you are
not a human speaking to yourself you are the universe
speaking to itself the universe now as it is talking
is also hearing these words and becoming conscious of itself
as the universe you are the universe talking to yourself
becoming conscious of yourself as the universe the universe is
reminding itself that it is the universe because the universe
forgot to put it another way what the universe is
telling you the universe is telling you that you are
god dreaming up this life and this very moment this
room that you're sitting in that you think of as
a physical room is actually a dream your entire life
is a dream your childhood is a dream and the
ideas you have of your death is a dream this
everything you're experiencing right now what you are is god
god talking to itself god being god god going meta
in order to tell itself to wake up to the
fact that it is god that's what god is is
god is a universal movement of self-awakening which is happening
in you right now if you are conscious and going
meta along with me as i am speaking because actually
i am you and you are me and if you
can recognize that you're awake do you get it tada
that's powerful stuff a powerful mind is one that can
do this one that can become infinitely self-aware able to
go meta on any finite part of itself and when
a finite mind is able to go infinitely meta it
becomes the infinite mind which is what you are whether
you're conscious of it or not that's it i'd like
to point out some related videos for you to watch
that will dovetail nicely with this concept of going meta
so the first one is called reality is a strange
loop the second is metaphysical implications of google's and completeness
theorem the third is explicit versus implicit understanding the fourth
is called context versus structure the fifth is understanding recontextualization
followed by how paradigms work and lastly developing introspection all
of these if you watch all of these together you
will get a much deeper understanding of all of them
they will all interpenetrate and bolster each other to help
you to crack the tricky mechanics of how your mind
thinks about the nature of reality all right i'm done
here please click that like button for me and come
check out actualize.org that's my website you will find my
blog you will find the book list you will find
a live purpose course you will find the forum you
will find other resources that i post there and future
courses that i will be releasing that you should stay
in touch with me about if you would like to
support actualize.org you can do so at patreon.com actualized and
the last thing that i'll say is just this that
our work here is to build up core concepts within
your mind that you can use for the rest of
your life to make sense of reality so a lot
of times i will publish these videos that have these
rather esoteric impractical abstract seeming titles or topics and you
might wonder well what does this have to do with
anything what does this have to do with helping me
in my life for example the concept of going meta
when you just read that as a title it's like
what is this going to do for me but but
you see you have to be more of a long-term
thinker you have to appreciate that we're doing something bigger
here than what most youtube channels are doing when they're
trying to teach you some self-help i'm really expecting that
you see the value of this work long term and
that you stick with me to build up the core
concepts to build a foundation i'm much more interested in
helping you to build a very deep solid foundation for
making sense of reality than i am about anything else
and i am about helping you to lose some weight
or to get laid or to make some money or
some other little thing like that because those things are
all insignificant compared to the true value of this work
which is which is laying that foundation this foundation unlike
what some might say or think this foundation is not
an ideology it's not a belief system i'm not programming
you with like a christian foundation or islam foundation or
even a buddhist foundation rather i'm trying to give you
very powerful core concepts which are very abstract and you
can use them in to apply to so many domains
of life and these core concepts and principles these are
not things you take on faith or that you believe
from me or that we come up with a proof
for these are things you test out in your life
and you see if they work you contemplate them you
see if they make sense if they do you adopt
them if not then you you discard them and so
only when we put into place some number of dozens
of these core concepts will reality start to make sense
to you will you have some direction and hope of
ever understanding what reality and life are really about and
how to put your life in order these core concepts
really they should have been put in place when you
were in elementary school and middle school and high school
but because of the corruptions within our education system and
the ignorance all around society the these core concepts are
not taught so somebody has to teach them that's what
this work is about so if you look around you
and you see that most people in the world do
not have a a good sense of what's really going
on in life you can ask yourself the question you
can start to wonder why is that or you look
around you see a lot of people are bullshitting even
scientists and doctors and philosophers a lot of them are
bullshitting they don't really understand what's going on in life
why is that you might start to suspect that it
might be because they haven't really dug deeply enough and
built a solid enough foundation of core concepts that are
necessary nor have they even been interested in that kind
of work they've been interested in something else and so
if that's the case then you can start to take
more seriously the importance of these core concepts and you'll
get excited about learning new ones and putting them into
place and then using them to make sense of of
reality ultimately i am not the one who's making sense
of reality for you only you can do that for
yourself i'm just sharing with you possibilities my own conclusions
and discoveries things that make me excited which would be
fuel for you to inspire you to motivate you and
i try to kind of give you the tools and
techniques and directions in which to go and to explore
and to do your own exploration in the end the
only one who can make sense of life is you
only you can do that but uh but even to
get that idea in your mind that you can make
sense of life at a deep deep deep level just
that idea that's sort of my function here is to
is to feed you that idea that that's possible just
that possibility is a huge thing that most people are
missing most people don't understand that this is possible or
that it would be worthwhile to do this or how
to go about it and that's why we're doing this
work and if you're on board with me for that
then of course stay tuned for more
