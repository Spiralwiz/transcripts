hey this is Leo for actualize org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about the dirty secret behind
all human knowledge in 10th grade in high school I
bumped into a person who would forever change the trajectory
of my entire life and his name was Thiago Thiago
was kind of a friend of mine and he was
in some of the similar classes that I was in
10th grade and basically Thiago was the most religious person
in the entire school and I grew up in Southern
California so as a pretty liberal area wasn't highly religious
area but this guy was extremely devoutly religious like he
would do the whole Christian thing the whole missionary Christian
thing he was all into that in fact he would
walk around with a big fat book under his arm
and for the longest time I thought this was a
dictionary and one time I asked him hey what are
you doing walking out of the dictionary all the time
he's like no dude this is a Bible not a
dictionary and it kind of blew my mind but anyways
we were in a lot of similar classes and we
started having kind of discussions about religion and I was
just curious about why he's so devoutly Christian and he
was telling me about stuff he did anyways so what
happened though was that this completely opened my eyes to
a whole new world to like a whole new intellectual
domain because I grew up and I wasn't like adamantly
atheistic but basically I was just very pragmatic about it
and my views on God and how the universe works
was basically that what I see before me is pretty
much what there is and there's nothing really hidden there's
nothing to find out there's no gods out there sitting
in the clouds judging me Ernie this kind of stuff
so that was my perspective but then I talked to
him and he has a very different perspective and also
debated with his friends and when I started debating with
him and his friends I immediately noticed there was something
odd going on because there was a strange emotional reaction
that I saw in them and also I saw in
myself and this what today I would call being dogmatic
it's the emotional reaction of being dogmatic of being set
in your own beliefs of trying to prove your beliefs
as correct and so I was debating with them about
many things and many things that just seemed factually indisputable
for example the history of the earth how old is
the earth is the earth five thousand years old how
can someone seriously be in a science class learning biology
and chemistry and physics and at the same time also
believe that the earth is only five thousand years old
what about dinosaur bones what about radiocarbon dating what about
what physics tells us about the Big Bang Theory and
all this kind of stuff so debating with them made
me realize that there's something deeper going on here that
I don't quite understand about the human psyche and about
reality because I'm really I thought I would have an
easy time convincing them of my points of view but
then I realized it was a lot harder than I
thought in addition to this I was also in some
rigorous history classes at this point in my life and
I was into rigorous science classes biology and chemistry and
physics and all this kind of stuff and so what
I started to see is I started to see that
from a history point of view if you take a
look at what history is basically you can describe it
as cultures being blind to other cultures and so it's
one culture trying to dominate another culture or one tribe
or one group trying to dominate another tribe starting wars
or waging political rivalries or whatever but that's basically the
way history has unfolded and we need to look at
that you start to look at and study all these
different cultures what you start to notice is that man
a lot of these cultures sure did hold some crazy
beliefs at least from my perspective now from our culture
it looks like all those are crazy beliefs so how
is it that my beliefs are different how is it
that I can be sure of my beliefs from my
culture when all these people like really smart intelligent people
scientists and Nobel Prize winners and so forth held all
these other different beliefs how do we reconcile and arbitrate
between different cultures and decide who's right and who's wrong
so that started to create another avenue of doubt in
my mind about my worldview and also as I was
studying the history of science I saw the amount of
intellectual blunders that have been committed by humanity in the
last three thousand years many many blunders by again very
intelligent scientifically rationally minded people and these blunders just make
you wonder like well if 2,000 years ago the majority
of mankind believed that the earth was flat or just
500 years ago people believe that the earth is the
center of the universe and that the Sun orbits around
the earth then how can we be sure that we're
not committing these same kind of intellectual blunders today in
the modern time why don't we take these doubts more
seriously and so in general I started wondering about this
deeper question of why do you intelligent people believe crazy
things at least from my perspective it seems like there
are a lot of people out there who believe crazy
things and certainly from a historical perspective we know this
is true and they have been proven wrong you know
centuries later so we know that now they're wrong but
they didn't know that at a time and if you
try to convince them at that time that they were
wrong then probably they would not believe you and they'd
be very dogmatic and then the other question I had
is how do I justify how do I really justify
my belief that there is no God because the core
contention I had with Thiago is that he was saying
there is a God I was saying there's not a
God and I really feel like I was right and
that he was wrong but I wasn't quite sure how
to really prove it because there's there's like different avenues
I could take for proving that and they all didn't
seem very conclusive which struck me as odd created doubts
in my mind and then I had my major epiphany
and my major epiphany was wait a minute what if
I'm the one who's wrong here I'm assuming he's wrong
and that he's being dogmatic and he's being deluded about
his worldview but could it be the case if he
could be so deluded that I could also potentially be
so deluded how could I really honestly assess if I
wasn't bullshitting myself and so here I got the real
a serious doubt that came up of self-deception it became
a real possibility in my mind that I could be
deceiving myself and so this I took very serious I
didn't just take it as some abstract philosophical concern I
really thought like well if I can't be sure about
my own self-deception then what can I be sure of
at all in life how can I be certain of
anything how can I know what's actually true and I
was interested in knowing what's true I wanted to know
what actually exists in the world do gods exist do
molecules exist do forces exist do principles of mathematics exist
what about good and evil - those exist how about
moral laws do they exist do logical laws exist does
even external reality exist how can we know for sure
how can we know that we're not wrong how can
we know that we're not deceiving ourselves so what I
started to do is I started to study something called
epistemology pista mala G is the field of philosophy which
is concerned with the theory of knowledge metaphysics is a
branch of philosophy that's concerned with what's true what's actually
physically real epistemology is more concerned about how do we
know what's true and in a sense before you can
even answer the question of what's true you have to
first answer the the more fundamental question of how can
I even know what's true we're just kind of assuming
that I can know what if I can't have we
considered that possibility so I started looking off into all
these issues and started reading about it but more importantly
actually sat down contemplating it really introspecting to see what's
really going on here with my own beliefs and also
with the beliefs of people that I'm bumping into how
can I be certain of my own beliefs and my
core question was really how do I explain why intelligent
people hold wrong beliefs and they do it very passionately
and could I be one of these I really took
that as a serious possibility that I could be one
of these people even though it feels like I'm not
maybe I could so what I did is I sat
down one day and I decided to really examine my
beliefs totally objectively from Ground Zero and so what I
did is I just pulled up a belief like well
God does not exist and then I would ask myself
okay so why is that true and then I would
come up with some kind of justification in epistemology they
call it a justification you have a belief how do
you then know that it's actually a valid piece of
knowledge well you justify it somehow you have some sort
of explanation or evidence or proof to back it up
so what I would do is I'd say well okay
so how do I know God does not exist well
I can't see him okay and how do I know
that that's true and then how do I know that
the next thing is true and the next thing is
true actually so what you do is you just sit
down and you can actually do this I encourage you
to try this take any belief you have that you're
really certain about and just ask yourself why is that
true and then whatever answer your mind comes up with
just ask yourself again and why is that true and
why is that true and why is that true it's
basically the old kids game right you just keep asking
and asking the asking except you take it seriously and
what I discovered is that if I really boil it
down and I do this very objectively very self honestly
then I always just arrive at under belief the justification
itself is just another belief and then if I boil
back down it's just another belief and another belief and
another belief and ultimately what happens if you go through
it maybe takes you five or ten steps you finally
get to some kind of ultimate rock bottom and this
is what we would call an assumption and usually these
assumptions are so basic and fundamental that it's inconceivable to
us that they could be false they're kind of like
self-evident assumptions we call them but I started questioning even
those how do I really know what is self-evident and
what's not after all I don't really see a difference
between the original starting belief such as there is no
God and the more basic more primitive assumption that justifies
it why don't I just take the belief that there
is no God and have it justify itself I mean
what's really going on here I have to be very
careful that I'm not deceiving myself because I want to
do this very objectively so what I did is I
sat down and I started ask myself okay honestly why
do I actually believe this why do I believe it
and because I was able to be very self honest
what I discovered is that the reason I believe it
is not because there is a good piece of evidence
the reason I believe it is because it feels right
intuitively makes sense because it fits into other things that
I know about the world if this wasn't the case
then other things in my worldview wouldn't make sense and
so this feels like it's the right puzzle piece that
should fit into this hole that I've constructed but basically
that's a feeling how can I know that I can
trust my feeling how can I know that I'm not
deluded about my intuition what if my intuition is misguided
what if the universe is not intuitive what if human
intuition is not the only intuition that's out there after
all different people have different intuitions about these kinds of
things right so how do we arbitrate between which intuition
is the correct one and perhaps even more damning how
could I really trust myself to be a fair judge
in my own trial because in a sense that's what
I'm doing I'm putting myself and my beliefs on trial
but also who's actually doing the judging Here I am
I'm judging myself I'm judging my own deepest beliefs but
how could I take the bias out of that if
this was an actual criminal trial and let's say I
committed a murder and then I had to sit down
and judge myself as the judge in the trial we
would say that that's a complete conflict of interest you
can't judge your own muhrtelle murder trial you need someone
else a third party to judge for you but in
this case how do I get a third party to
judge for me if I get a third party he
comes in there and he looks at my beliefs how
do I know that his beliefs are not also biased
by his preferences and that he can trust himself so
no matter how many people you get into this party
in the end there's no ultimate arbiter so this really
started to bring a lot of doubts and skepticism into
my worldview and I sat down I didn't just do
this with the belief in God or no God I
also did it with other beliefs that I hold more
fundamental I mean more uh more practical mundane beliefs you
can even take the beliefs such as that the Sun
will rise tomorrow how can you be sure that the
Sun will rise tomorrow well it's risen every single day
of my life and supposedly humankind says the Sun has
risen every single day for as long as humankind has
existed okay that might all be true but how do
we know that it will continue to do that how
do we know that tomorrow the Sun will not just
decide to not do that you can say well you
know physics and gravitational laws tell us that the Sun
will keep orbiting or appear to keep orbiting around the
earth for for hundreds of thousands of years to come
but how do we know there's not an error in
those gravitational laws well because they've been proven by many
other experiments and other verifiable studies well how do we
know there's still not a higher law after all Newtonian
mechanics was replaced by Einstein Ian's theories and so technically
Newtonian mechanics is flawed and it's wrong even though it's
a nice approximation how do we know that Einsteins laws
are also not a nice approximation how do we know
that the laws the universe won't change tomorrow how do
we know they're going to stay consistent well you could
say well they've been consistent or eternity well how do
you know they've been consistent for eternity I mean you
haven't been alive for eternity plus just because they were
consistent up till now it doesn't mean they gonna be
consistent forever so it's like these kind of doubts just
like these existential really deep doubt started to creep into
my mind and ultimately I came to the conclusion that
if I really honestly assess all my beliefs through this
process I can see that all the justifications are just
a game all the justifications are ultimately groundless because it
all boils down to some fundamental belief that is never
justifiable it's just accepted on faith and when I realize
that I have to admit to myself that my belief
in no God that God doesn't exist is ultimately no
more justified than my friends believe that God does exist
but it didn't just apply to God this had a
ramifications for all the other beliefs I had including all
the scientific beliefs that I thought were really true because
what I start to realize is that every belief system
has a personal bias in it because basically I'm using
my own intuition to judge whether this belief deserves to
be valid or doesn't that's how you do it if
you take a look at what you're doing with your
belief system that's how you're judging your judging using your
intuition does it feel right to you you're not actually
going based on evidence you think you're going based on
evidence and the mind likes to say that I'm going
based on evidence it likes to say something like no
leo leo my theories are really based on solid scientific
evidence but that's not really what's going on you're not
being objective enough in assessing what you're really doing in
your mind when you're saying that if you drill it
down you look very very carefully I promise you that
eventually you'll get to a personal bias and you can
actually see your own personal bias at play it's not
just an intellectual thing it's an emotional thing you're going
to see that your emotions come into play and in
fact when you try to debate with other people at
the dinner table or at at a meeting with your
friends or in some conference room with a bunch of
scientists you sort of have a debate you start to
see that this is prevalent everywhere people disagree about these
kinds of things everywhere how do we explain that that's
what I really wanted to get to the bottom of
how do we explain it this is a phenomenon of
human beings of human societies and what I ultimately kind
of discovered for myself is that the reason it happens
is because we're all just using our intuitions and of
course our intuitions are highly fallible and they're highly self
biased and so that's the game that's being played it's
very interesting that justifications are created by the mind because
if you create a a string of five or ten
justifications the mind gets tired after a while and then
what it says is it says something like okay this
is solid enough and I don't need hunters that prove
this is good enough I'll just believe it so that's
really what's going on inside your mind no matter what
kind of beliefs you hold whether they are religious ones
or scientific ones or philosophical ones or anything else even
practical mundane beliefs like the Sun will rise tomorrow so
this was all going on in my mind creating a
lot of doubt for me and I got really interested
in philosophy at this point so I actually became a
philosophy major I started studying philosophy kind of like in
a professional manner I actually wanted to come up philosophy
professor and as I was doing this I stumbled upon
a really brilliant model that helped me to validate some
of these plugging doubts that I had cuz see these
doubts I was kind of just trying to figure all
this stuff out on my own and one of my
problems was that I wasn't seeing anybody else in society
or anybody around me really questioning their beliefs this deeply
it seemed like they just assumed that their beliefs are
solid and they didn't really think about self-deception didn't really
think about that they could have personal biases they didn't
really care to know why people disagree with each other
or why intelligent people believe crazy things like it's like
nobody cared about this stuff and when I saw that
no beliefs are ultimately justified it seems like this is
a really big discovery at least it was in my
worldview but yet nobody takes this seriously when you talk
to them about it so this kind of started getting
me to doubt my own self and wondering am I
even on the right track here could I still be
deluding myself even with all this theorizing and that was
a real possibility but then I stumbled upon a model
clines model willard van orman quine was a analytical philosopher
from the early 1900's he did a lot of philosophy
based around logic in mathematics and science this was a
hardcore guy he wasn't just some fruity meta physician and
he wrote a really seminal paper that shook philosophy circles
at the time and it was called two dogmas of
empiricism it's a paper it's like a 20-page paper but
I don't recommend you go read it because it's extremely
dense and if you read it you probably won't understand
almost anything he's saying but the main takeaway from this
paper for me was that it validated a lot of
the things that I was already suspecting namely he described
human knowledge as a field a field picture it this
way imagine that you have a graph a knowledge graph
in your mind with a bunch of nodes and it
looks kind of like an amoeba it's got this kind
of irregular but circular shape and it's got a bunch
of nodes that are all interconnected together and so you've
got this kind of like lattice work this framework in
your mind and each node in this graph represents a
belief of yours every single belief you've got fits into
this knowledge graph so the grass is green snow is
white dogs have four legs and tail and that the
Earth orbits around the Sun and the Sun is in
the Milky Way and e equals MC square so every
single belief you could possibly imagine fits into this knowledge
graph and the way client described it he said that
what's really going on is you have this knowledge graph
but then it only contacts direct experience at the periphery
here so actual raw data the empirical stuff the hard
facts are only along the edges and the stuff that's
on the inside is all the beliefs there that don't
really contact reality directly so for example maybe you have
a belief such as e equals mc-squared okay you might
think that that's actually an empirical truth well not exactly
not fully because that sits as a belief more inside
towards the center rather than at the very periphery of
the knowledge graph why is that because you don't actually
see e equals mc-squared as a as an observable fact
that's something you have to prove and demonstrate through uh
through modeling and various mathematical you know functions and you
have to combine all that stuff together and then you
get a end result from that a conclusion called a
equals MC square and then you can take that on
as a belief by the way a belief is simply
a statement about reality that you think is true or
it's a statement about reality that you think is false
either one of those is a belief technically speaking so
what Klein said is that human knowledge is this graph
and what I want to do is I want to
point out some interesting features that he himself pointed out
about this graph and I'll do that by reading you
some really eloquent quotes from client because he does really
good job describing this so here we go he says
quote the totality of our so-called knowledge or beliefs from
the most casual matters of geography and he three to
the profoundest laws of atomic physics or even the pure
mathematics and logic is a man-made fabric which impinges on
experience only along the edges and quote so that's a
really important statement so basically what he's saying is that
no matter what belief you hold whether it's abstract logical
and mathematical beliefs or just simple scientific beliefs or historical
beliefs or Geographic facts this is still part of a
man-made fabric your knowledge graph and that this knowledge graph
only loosely fits with empirical data the knowledge graph itself
is much deeper and wider than the data itself the
data is just on the periphery it's just the rim
it's like the envelope right the envelope is very thin
and it's very scanty and then you've got all this
stuff in the middle which is kind of up to
you you can fudge it however you want next he
goes on to say quote a conflict with experience at
the periphery occasions readjustments in the interior of the field
truth values have to be redistributed over some statements re-evaluation
of some statements entails re-evaluation of others because of their
logical interconnections the logical laws themselves being in turn simply
certain further statements in the system certain further elements of
the field but the total field is so under determined
by its boundary conditions that there is much latitude of
choice as to what statements to reevaluate in light of
any single contrary experience and quote this here is extremely
important so imagine that you have your knowledge graph and
you think that it fits nicely with experience now what
happens is you get a new piece of experience come
in right because we're always seeing new hard experience coming
in if we see a new brute fact come in
now our knowledge graph has to account for it somehow
so now what's gonna have to happen is that a
ripple will Kaskade through the knowledge graph starting from the
point where the knowledge graph meets the hard fact so
there there'll have to be some adjustment and also the
rest of the knowledge graph can adjust itself to accommodate
and explain away this brute fact in various ways there's
not just one way to do it that's the key
here he uses the word underdetermined the whole system is
under determined what does that mean that means that there
could be many configurations of the system that will account
for all the Roth acts and that right there to
me was the key that showed me that this model
must be correct because this is exactly what's happening with
human beings is it seems like we have world views
lots of different world views but basically the same facts
we're all living in the same world basically I mean
my experience of reality is not that much different than
yours and we agree on many things but also we
disagree on some stuff and we disagree with a lot
of different people why is this their disagreement well because
there's this underdetermined element not every single belief is pinned
down by hard facts this gives you wiggle room so
to speak next he goes on to say quote if
this view is right it is misleading to speak of
empirical content of individual statement especially if it is a
statement at all remote from the experiential periphery of the
field and code so what this means is that you
can't just take a single belief and really verify if
it's true or if it's false you can't just take
a belief like God exists or he doesn't exist or
you can't just take a belief such as the Earth
orbits around the Sun and just say if it's true
or false because it depends on other beliefs and other
facts within your worldview the whole thing is interconnected in
a very deep way which means that if you change
one part of the model you probably have to make
adjustments else in the system he goes on to say
quote any statement can be held true come what may
if we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the system
even a statement very close to the periphery can be
held true in the face of yeah in the face
of recalcitrant experience by pleading hallucination or by amending certain
statements called logical laws and quote so this is huge
this right here explains why it's impossible to argue with
a fundamentalist because of fundamentalists what he does is he
takes a certain fact or a certain belief and holds
it us so true that he's able to then readjust
his entire knowledge graph to then somehow support or buffer
that one belief that one statement from contact with direct
experience so even something as obvious as the sun is
shining in the morning if you really wanted to you
could deny this fact and the way you can deny
it is you could say well yeah it appears that
the sun is shining on my face in the morning
but that's just an appearance actually I'm hallucinating or actually
I'm in the matrix and outside the matrix there's no
Sun at all you see so now this this kind
of goes into far-fetched territory and you might be thinking
well yeah that's that's really far-fetched olio but if yet
take a look at what's going on when you argue
politics or religion or environment or some other Hot Topic
issue with an average human being what you discover this
is exactly what happens you present them with some kind
of fact which you think will convince them that oh
they're wrong and you're right but what you discover is
actually no what they do is they take that fact
they acknowledge the fact but then they reconfigure their whole
scheme so that it explains that fact away in a
nice convenient way without them having to admit that this
fact somehow breaks their model you see and what's really
profound here is that even the logical laws themselves are
a part of this model there is nothing that's outside
of this model everything you think is right is a
belief in this model everything even the most fundamental unquestionable
things are just additional beliefs and what's crazy is that
things like the logical laws these are not actually hard
empirical facts these are things that sit in the middle
of the knowledge graph the stuff that sits in the
middle of the knowledge graph that's the stuff that's the
most unassailable that's also the stuff that allows you to
hold on to no matter what evidence is presented so
this is where people get into really lots of trouble
is when they try to maintain a position or a
theory or belief that is really really far from the
periphery of the field because then no amount of evidence
can get and pierce through into the middle to get
that belief to change right because it has to ripple
through all the other beliefs which is exactly what happens
if you try to argue with a fundamentalist religious person
is that they have layer after layer after layer and
layer of beliefs that protect the core belief that you're
trying to attack of course this is not just true
of religious people it's also true of scientific people it's
true of every person so this is not just being
used as an attack on religion just actually the opposite
what this does is this levels the playing field a
lot because in science what we like to say is
we like to say well no but you know scientific
truths are much more accurate and verifiable than religious claims
it certainly feels like scientific claims have a certain higher
standing in our mind they seem more empirical well what
Klein demonstrated with this paper is that actually they're not
any more empirical the logical laws are not any more
empirical and you can actually sit down and question in
your own mind why you believe in the logical laws
and what you'll discover is that actually it's an intuition
that you have the logical laws are not some carved
in stone absolutely given by God commandment to us the
logical laws are part of this man-made fabric and you
believe in them because ultimately after all the rationalizations are
cut down and boiled away you believe in them because
it feels right and it makes sense in your worldview
and if they stopped being believed in then your worldview
would not feel as cohesive and as integrated Cline went
on to say quote revision even of the logical law
of the excluded middle has been proposed as a means
of simplifying quantum mechanics end quote and quantum mechanics was
a field that was just coming into its own while
Quine was was writing this stuff and coming up with
his theories and in quantum mechanics a lot of weird
stuff happens a lot of very counterintuitive stuff happens about
reality that scientists and mathematicians who study this stuff will
admit that it functions in such a weird way that
all your intuitions have to fly out the window which
of course is a really interesting clue which shows us
that reality could be structured in such a way that
your mind is not able to intuit anymore what's correct
and what's not correct which is exactly the doubt that
I had in my mind how do I know if
my intuition is right or wrong about this issue how
can I trust myself kuan goes on to say quote
for my part I believe in physical objects and not
in homer's gods and I considered a scientific error to
believe otherwise but in point of epistemological footing the physical
objects and the gods differ only in degree and not
in kind both sorts of entities enter into our conceptions
only as cultural posits the myth of physical objects is
epistemologically superior to most and that it has proved more
effective than other myths as a device for working a
manageable structure into the flux of experience and quote so
this is some heavy heavy stuff right here he's basically
putting all beliefs on the same level playing field so
your belief if you can imagine in physical objects is
no more or less justified than your belief in God
or your belief in what other or other thing you
think is very very certain and true right you have
to recognize that these are conceptual entities that we create
whether it's gods or physical objects or physical forces or
atoms or Clark's or whatever these are not things you
directly encounter in experience these are not brute hard facts
these are actually things that exist within the center of
your knowledge graph because they're useful for explaining the raw
hard facts you see and a lot of people get
this wrong about science science is not brute hard facts
what science is is a lot of modeling and conceptualizing
and those concepts and models are then buttress and supported
by experiments and brute hard facts but still there's a
lot of interpretation that goes on a lot of wiggle
room for what kind of models you can create and
this is something that most people fail to acknowledge about
science Klein goes on to say quote physical objects small
and large are not the only posits forces are another
example and indeed we are told today that the boundary
between energy and matter is obsolete moreover abstract entities which
are the substance of mathematics are another posit in the
same spirit epistemological II these are myths on the same
footing with physical objects and gauze neither better nor worse
except for differences in the degree to which the expedite
our dealings with sons experiences and quote so he's continuing
on and he's even strengthening the claim here right even
mathematics is not excluded from this discussion even logic is
not excluded from this discussion all of these things are
man-made creations you understand it's really important understanding is that
these are man-made creations and the only reason we care
about them or feel that they're true is because in
some sense they help us to deal with sense experiences
with the raw data the indisputable raw data but actually
most of us completely ignore the raw data and what
we do is we get lost in the theories and
the models and these abstract entities and we don't acknowledge
to ourselves that these are abstract entities and so we
get lost in this kind of fairytale land and then
what we do is we go and we start debating
and arguing with people without understanding what we're really doing
here and lastly Klein said and this is a famous
quote of his he says quote our statements of the
external world face the tribunal of sense experience not individually
but only as a corporate body and quote which means
that you're never evaluating any one individual statement it's not
like you're just going to go and say well does
God exist let me go check it doesn't work that
way all of your statements all of your beliefs come
into play all at the same time they all reinforce
each other you're dragging everything you're basically dragging the person's
entire worldview into the argument when you're questioning God which
is exactly what you get when you're questioning someone's religious
beliefs you don't just question a little intellectual fact or
a little single statement their entire worldview gets dragged in
there and what you notice is the person gets very
defensive very quickly and they get very emotional and then
you get very defensive and you get very emotional and
then there's a heated debate why is that because you
have a literal clashing of two knowledge graphs that don't
fit together so that's Klein's model now this validate a
lot of my own kind of discoveries and research and
what this led me to is just just the some
of the following takeaways some of the following conclusions that
I had basically what I saw was that there's a
ton of leeway for personal preference within how we construct
our knowledge graphs our knowledge graphs are mostly arbitrary they're
not nearly a set in stone and fixed as we
think and as we like to believe there's so much
wiggle room so much wiggle room that you could almost
say that these are complete fictions of the mind that's
how much wiggle room there is here and yet this
is almost never acknowledged everyone whether they're scientific or religious
or spiritual or philosophical everyone creates fictional entities in their
own minds a fictional entity could be God or it
could be a corporation or it could be atoms and
molecules or it could be energy or dark matter right
scientists have come up with tons of fictional entities even
more than religious people have God is one of these
entities and it's no different fundamentally from the entity such
as an atom or a molecule not if you really
look at it objectively another takeaway for me was that
worldviews work in a holistic way like I just described
right the entire worldview gets questions simultaneously and this makes
the worldview very difficult to question it be easy for
the other person to weasel out of any argument you
create because this knowledge graph has a certain integrity a
certain structure to it and it's got a lot of
it's got a lot of ways that it can just
kind of like grow and morph itself and do some
mental gymnastics and accommodate any kind of fact that you
present to it and this is extremely damaging and dangerous
because it creates a massive blind spot possibility it creates
this possibility where you can feel like you're certain and
you're right and your knowledge graph is correct but actually
what's happening is that your knowledge graph is morphing around
all the all the facts and you're just excusing them
away or denying them and then of course other takeaway
for me was that argumentation and justification is just a
game it's a tool that the knowledge graph uses to
maintain its structural integrity that's what you're doing when you're
actually arguing or justifying something in your own mind and
of course I'm not just talking about all the people
you disagree with I'm talking about you most importantly I'm
talking about you so when you are arguing and you
feel like you're right and when you're justifying in your
mind something even when you're justifying some like oh that
kind of such an idiot he shouldn't have called me
that he's so wrong for doing that thing that he
did to me just a very you know Monday an
example from ordinary life not philosophical at all but in
that situation you're justifying to yourself why you're right and
he's wrong and that is all part of your knowledge
graph you see your knowledge graph is not just vague
abstract philosophical concepts such as does God exist do molecules
exist in this kind of scientific stuff it's all the
practical stuff - what are your beliefs about women what
are your beliefs about men what are your beliefs about
politics what are your beliefs about how you should raise
children what are your beliefs about sex what are your
beliefs about what's right and what's wrong what's moral what
immoral what are you beliefs about terrorism what are your
beliefs about rape and murder and theft what are your
beliefs about personal development what are your personal beliefs about
what you can accomplish in life what are your beliefs
about your spouse your girlfriend your boyfriend and your family
members what are your ideological beliefs about how the world
works what's your cosmology your personal cosmology how do you
think the universe is structured and functions all of this
stuff is part of the knowledge graph everything even when
you think that you're going to walk out tomorrow and
see the sun shining in your face in the morning
that's party a knowledge graph and even a statement such
as grass is green or snow is white is all
part of your knowledge graph so I hope you can
see that this is not just something or like philosophical
debates this here is something that directly speaks to what's
happening in your life and the problem is is that
nobody wants to admit that this is actually happening nobody
wants to admit that we're all playing a justification game
in our mind and really in a sense this knowledge
graph is controlling us more than we control it what
people care about actually is practicality they don't really care
about truth they don't care about what's ultimately true they
care about what's convenient to them in their life if
you really look honestly that's what you care about you
don't care about anything else even if you're a philosopher
you don't really care about anything else even if you're
a scientist you don't really care about anything if you
care about practicality do your beliefs explain away the world
in such a way that you feel confident and certain
and safe and as soon as they don't you are
in emotional reaction against it and that right there pretty
much explains what's going on with why people disagree so
much and hold crazy beliefs despite being otherwise intelligent the
only thing that we could claim as being true really
is not this knowledge graph but the experience itself that
lies at the edge of the knowledge graph that's the
truest thing we have access to and even that you
have to understand is still extremely limited because basically what
we're saying is that we're reducing everything down to our
sense organs sight sound vision well that sight also smell
taste touch right those are all our senses so that
is what we're actually receiving as hard factual data well
what's crazy about that is that that's just unique to
human beings right a human being happens to have vision
a bat does not a human being happens to have
smell a bacterium might not I don't know if bacterium's
have smell probably not a human being has hearing some
other creatures might not so what can we really know
for sure what can we really know for certain and
what I concluded was that well we can't really know
what's absolutely true because we have this knowledge graph and
this knowledge graph is always biased it's always operating towards
itself it's always trying to serve its own self agenda
and then we have our sense organs and our sense
organs are just limited to us as human beings so
what happened for me at this point this happened kind
of late in college is I just basically kind of
sort of started to give up the search for absolute
truth because that's what was driving me is how do
I find absolute truth and what I basically discovered is
that I can't find absolute truth and at that point
I just said well if I can't find absolute truth
then I have to give up philosophy and so I
did I actually decided not to become a philosophy professor
because of this and yet still there was something nagging
in my mind about this whole thing you know I
told myself ah I'm just gonna go work on my
career and work on my relationships you know just do
the ordinary mundane life kind of stuff this philosophy stuff
is just too philosophical it's not very practical but something
in my mind told me that there must be something
practical here because there's something very deeply true about how
human beings interact and this model really fits I just
couldn't figure out you know how do I connect it
all together and also I couldn't understand you know science
is so effective technology has advanced humanity so much and
we've accomplished so much I mean we've landed a man
on the moon how is it that fictitious entities that
science has created has allowed us to do this whereas
you know some other kind of fictitious entities are not
able to accomplish any work in the real world how
is that possible so there are still questions that didn't
quite click for me but I just put them all
aside and went and live my ordinary practical life and
I did that for six years until one day I
read about enlightenment and when I read about enlightenment I
read about the master stroke the whole clincher to this
thing and the master stroke is this and this is
something that I had not considered before in all my
theorizing and in all my ruminations about this issue and
the master stroke is this what if it was possible
to get rid of the self this boundary that I
feel exists between me as a creature standing here as
a human being standing here and the external world that
I'm interacting with what if that's a conceptual boundary and
not a physical boundary what if that this self is
actually a node within the knowledge graph that's the master
stroke because think about what this really means what this
really means is that if there's a self that means
this self has a personal agenda and a bias so
that's one thing also what it means is that the
self doesn't have direct access to reality so how can
I know reality directly well I can't I have to
do it through my senses and I have to do
it through my mind because I'm separate from reality see
but what if I'm not separate from reality what if
the self is an illusion and I can get rid
of that and then what happens is that I have
a possibility of direct access to empirical reality that blew
my mind that piqued my curiosity to the highest that
it's ever been on this issue because for the first
time I saw the solution to the whole problem here
and this is what I was I was looking for
the whole time but I didn't really know how to
get to it because I didn't consider that something so
radical could be possible it's so obvious you dismiss it
but this really allows us to get rid of the
personal bias problem this allows us to access truth directly
without using the knowledge graph at all you see you
don't need to construct entities or models about truth you
can get truth straight from the source so to speak
at least that becomes a possibility if you allow for
the possibility of getting rid of the self now that's
not proven for us yet we have to demonstrate that
is that true can we actually do that well at
least there is a possibility intellectually that maybe we can
and then what truth becomes is truth becomes not a
model of truth not a concept not an entity explaining
truth but truth actually what truth is is its what
remains after the knowledge graph has been completely destroyed right
because truth is what's at the root at the rock
bottom of everything truth is what we're trying to explain
the explanations are not truth the explanations are just explanations
and that's what got me really interested in enlightenment really
interested now at this point you might say well leo
all this sounds like just more theory so how did
you solve any problems here because all you're doing is
doing more philosophy and you just gave us another theory
here and isn't Klein's model just another theory isn't just
another model and of course the answer is yes Klein's
model is just on their model and everything I told
you here is just more models and more theories and
more concepts it's just beliefs right I'm just giving you
more beliefs to believe and of course that's silly yes
that's silly because what you're trying to do is you're
trying to take my beliefs here and you're trying to
add them to your knowledge graph and of course nothing
changes because you just added one more note to the
knowledge graph nothing changes even if you believe me if
you don't believe me that's another knowledge graph a node
that you've added which says leo is wrong doesn't change
anything if you want to change something here's where something
can really change is if you decide instead of adding
stuff to your knowledge graph to destroy the graph entirely
that's when you can get a real change but you
can't destroy the knowledge graph just by listening to me
you can't destroy it by thinking more stuff you can't
think your way into enlightenment you can't think your way
into truth in fact your thoughts and your models and
your beliefs about reality is the only thing that separates
you from truth and enlightenment if you're smart and you
see the ramifications of what I'm saying here then these
are very serious ramifications in fact you should I hope
see that everything you hear from me with actual eyes
drug videos every single video I've talked about including all
my enlightening videos that all of this is just adding
more [ __ ] to your knowledge graph that's all
it's doing all the personal development material you've studied in
red in your entire life and will read is just
adding more to your knowledge path that's what it's doing
it can't do anything else you see because this is
how human knowledge works this is what human knowledge is
it's a game it's a [ __ ] game what
people are doing in life is they're rearranging a web
of [ __ ] that's what they're doing and this
is exactly what explains why people disagree so much about
so many things and that they're impossible to convince and
it's almost impossible to get them to change their perspectives
this is why because people are so busy rearranging their
[ __ ] web of beliefs that they don't recognize
that they're just beliefs and that there's something actually deeper
going on and even if they do recognize that they
still don't have enough wisdom to see that what's required
is not to add this to their graph but to
take this as a hint that they have to destroy
their graph so you might wonder well Leah what's the
use of listening to you then if all you're doing
is adding more to our graph and the answer that
is very paradoxical in a sense there is no use
in listening to me but also in a sense there
is because what doing here is we're fighting illusion with
illusion most illusion that you hear from society and for
other people and from personal valid books what they give
you is they give you illusion that doesn't call itself
out as illusion the difference with me is that in
this video for example I'm telling you that what I'm
telling you is an illusion and you can be intelligent
and wise enough to actually register that to read between
the lines of what I said and to put yourself
on track with perhaps deciding to question your knowledge graph
and to finally stop the process of adding more [
__ ] to your knowledge graph and rearrange your knowledge
graph to defend your ego and to defend all your
personal biases because that is what you've been doing your
whole life all your beliefs about men women children family
religion politics signs it's all just rearranging [ __ ]
that's what it is that's what it is and you
can sit down you can actually discover this for yourself
you don't need to believe me for on this point
in fact he won't really help you to believe me
because a belief is just an addition to the knowledge
graph what you need to do is destroy your knowledge
graph and that really is the direction in which actualize
that work will be going in the future is that
my chief concern will be to help you to destroy
systematically destroy your entire knowledge graph and why are we
doing this because when you destroy your knowledge graph what
you remain with is truth and truth as it turns
out is a very paradoxical thing and a very counterintuitive
thing and it is actually the thing that you've been
searching for your whole life it is ultimately the reason
that you started doing personal development you didn't do personal
development to get a girlfriend you didn't do personal development
to improve your marriage you don't do personal development because
you want money those are all [ __ ] reasons
the ultimate reason why you're doing personal develop it without
even being conscious of it yet is you're doing it
to discover truth the truth of your own being who
you really are and what reality really is because let
me tell you when you discover truth it is not
the truth of philosophy it is not the truth of
science those are not truths that is beliefs that's fiction
in the knowledge graph actual truth outside the knowledge graph
is something vastly different it's a profound life-changing truth it's
a very practical thing it's not something that's just like
oh yeah I know something it's not that kind of
knowing it's a being you have to become the truth
you have to remove the barrier between you and the
world and when you remove the barrier between you and
the world then all of your problems in life dissolve
everything you thought was bothering you everything you thought was
wrong with the world dissolves because guess what your problems
they're all nodes in the knowledge graph that's it I'm
done I'm signing off click the link button for me
please share this video with a friend post your comments
down below and come check out actualized Auto right here
this is my newsletter sign up to the newsletter so
you can stay tuned stay tuned on this journey of
self actualization it's a deep rabbit hole we're going down
deep deep deep deep stuff all of this stuff I
promise you is extremely practical I don't just come up
here to spout philosophy and [ __ ] I'm interested
in getting you the most profound transformation possible in your
life and this is how it's going to get done
and I don't just talk about it but I also
do it in my own life so if you keep
watching me you'll see that I'm doing this in my
life as well I'm going to systematically destroy my knowledge
graph and you will see the result of what I
become from doing that that will be pretty cool so
that's what's in store sign up stay tuned and I'll
see you soon with more you
