hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about my experience of absolute
infinity how I became God how I became conscious of
the entire structure of reality and how you can too
I want to share with you the deepest insight I've
ever had in my life by far by far by
far the deepest this is the most profound thing you
will probably ever hear me say and the most incredible
part about all this is that I will show you
in next week's episode how you can achieve this exact
same insight for yourself in 15 minutes or less sound
too good to be true well you've got to stay
tuned and to see what that entails ah but let
me begin sort of at the beginning as you know
a few months ago I started experimenting with psychedelics and
I've been researching them now for a little bit and
experimenting as well and in my research into psychedelics I've
been reading a lot of books doing a lot of
academic style research and just taking a look at the
history of it all and what's available out there what's
possible and what I stumbled upon is I stumbled upon
a substance I'm going to withhold the name of the
substance until next week's episode or important reasons which I
will talk about later this substance creates 100% ego death
that's what it does it is not a traditional psychedelic
it doesn't produce fun visual effects it doesn't take you
on spiritual quests and journeys into distant lands and different
universes where you get to encounter new beings and spirit
animals and this sort of stuff it doesn't do any
of that it's a very very very clean substance what
it does is it allows you to maintain full normal
consciousness full clarity of your own thoughts but it just
completely robs you of your ego within a matter of
five to ten minutes this is the most powerful psychedelic
that exists it's not LSD it's not DMT it's not
ayahuasca it's not mushrooms it's not mescaline it's not MDMA
it's not salvia it's not ketamine or probably anything else
that you're thinking of this is a little-known substance it's
quite rare and it's not well known in the psychedelic
circles so of course I decided to try this out
given the fact that I've been pursuing enlightenment now for
three years pretty hardcore and I talk a lot about
the ego so what would it look like to get
100% pure ego death now this is an interesting thing
to consider because even though we talk about the ego
a lot and you've heard me talking about it you
hear me ragged about it you heard me talking about
all the negative stuff and you kind of know what
the ego is but what you fail to appreciate is
just how radical of a shift in paradigm and perspective
you would experience if you ceased to exist in reality
try to comprehend the significance of what I'm saying you
will cease to exist in this reality what then will
be your experience if there is no more you you
that thing right there if you stop existing well that's
a very interesting question and you know I want to
say a couple of things about this word god I
don't really like the word god I'd use it a
few times before in my episodes but generally I stay
away from it because I'm sort of a rational person
I'm a very grounded person I'm very skeptical in my
approach to understanding reality in life I question everything I
don't take anything on faith anything is belief everything must
be questioned and found in direct experience and in my
direct experience honestly there's no such thing as God and
I was an atheist for basically my entire life at
least that was a much better option than being a
theist like a theist why would I be a theist
that sounds ridiculous so that just gives you a little
bit of my background right out I was in philosophy
for for college thinking deeply about these kinds of existential
questions about what is reality and where did it come
from in this sort of stuff and God is an
explanation was never a satisfying explanation because God itself needs
to be explained and that was never sufficiently explained by
anybody so I didn't really take that as a serious
thing also another thing I should point out in case
you're telling me hey Leo you know psychedelics you're talking
about psychedelics here and talking about some sort of powerful
insight that you had but aren't psychedelics not real they're
just like hallucinatory well stay with me here keep an
open mind because you know what that's what I thought
when I came into this experience so I'm in for
some rude awakenings here just as much as you might
be watching me talk about this stuff so what was
the insight that I had I took this substance that
robs you of your ego and within a few minutes
what started happening is that I was quite lucid but
what started happening is that my experience of reality started
to get pretty wonky even though there's not a lot
of visuals and stuff it starts to get wonky because
what starts to happen is that this chemical is as
far as I can tell like pure powdered consciousness it's
pure awareness and so what happens is it doesn't screw
with any other aspects of your awareness other than awareness
itself and what it does is it takes you from
your kind of regular baseline level of awareness up a
notch and up a notch and up a notch and
up a notch by ten by factors of 10 and
10 and 10 and 10 and 10 and 10 and
just starts going in an exponential curve very very quickly
within just five minutes and I'm sitting there on my
couch having taken the substance experiencing this and expecting that
I will get some sort of like powerful meditative effect
because that's kind of what I think of when I
think about no ego and so that's what I'm expecting
but pretty quickly what starts to happen in my awareness
is impossible it's literally impossible given what I know about
science and physics and chemistry what starts to occur with
me is not just interesting colors changing and shapes distorting
the way you might see on LSD or DMT or
whatever what starts to occur with me seems physically impossible
it is against all laws of logic and physics it's
so shocking and so radical that it feels like someone
snuck up behind me with a razor-sharp ninja sword and
sliced my skull in half and all that I'm aware
of is that my skull has fallen down on the
ground and half my brain is gone but I'm still
conscious as you might be in the situation imagine this
happens to you you're still conscious because it happened so
quickly and so cleanly but what might you feel well
you're in total shock it's not necessarily a positive or
a negative emotion it's just a state of complete and
utter shock and actually others uh there's a sort of
like existential terror that accompanies that but also a sense
of amazement because something is happening with you that's never
ever happened to you in your life that you've never
conceived of and here it is it's happened to you
and all you can do is just surrender to it
you can't fight it it's not you can glue your
skull back on this is a serious situation that you've
gotten yourself into so what I do is I just
surrender into it and then very quickly I have the
deepest insight that I've ever had and that I think
I will ever have in my life what did I
become aware of I can still remember myself sitting on
the couch in that moment where it felt like my
entire life changed completely and what I became aware of
is that it's absolutely infinite reality is absolutely infinite it's
absolutely infinite it's absolutely infinite it's just absolutely infinite it's
absolutely infinite you don't understand it's absolutely infinite there's no
way you can understand this it's absolutely infinite and I
became directly conscious of this this was so shocking of
an insight that there is nothing that it could possibly
be compared to in everyday life as far as insights
go and what happened to me as I died Leo
died and I became absolute infinity and my reaction to
this I can very vividly remember was that I was
sitting on the floor by that point and said oh
my god oh oh my god oh my god oh
my god oh my god oh my oh my god
are you over here oh oh and that was my
reaction and it lasted for quite a while and what
I realized is that I am looking at God and
that this is what God means is simply absolute infinity
and that not only am i looking at God but
that I am God God is what I am that's
what I am it's nothing other than me and then
this insight hits me that I created everything I created
it all from nothing I created it all from nothing
including this thing called Leo I created this ignorant thing
called Leo and now that ignorance has been broken the
veil of ignorance has been broken and I've seen myself
as the creator of everything an interesting thing occurred to
me as I was going through this process I was
kind of observing myself I was kind of like meta
observing myself and I was puzzled that I was using
this word God because I don't use the word God
in my ordinary vocabulary if I do talk about these
kinds of concepts because I study mysticism and so forth
then I'll talk about it as nothingness or I'll talk
about it as source I'll talk about it just absolute
truth or something like that but not as God because
God to me comes loaded with a lot of cultural
baggage um there's so many silly ideas attached to God
for example it's God being some you know father figure
up in the cloud with a beard looking down at
you or like a st. Peter at the pearly gates
meeting you when you die and go to heaven something
like this no no let me explain what absolute infinity
is and what God is because this is the ultimate
insight you can have about life it's absolute infinity when
I say the word infinity you probably think of some
sort of mathematical concept like the natural numbers one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten ten thousand
ten million ten billion ten trillion and all the way
up to infinity you can kind of extrapolate up that
way or you might think of infinity as a line
a geometric line which stretches endlessly in both directions but
that's an imaginary concept we have in geometry or you
can think of infinity as maybe space a volumetric three
dimensional space which extends out in all directions which you
might think like what the universe is is some sort
of very large vast maybe perhaps infinite geometric object but
when I say absolute infinity I don't mean that I
mean absolute infinity you can't grasp this with your mind
you can only become directly aware of it but here
is a little idea if you take infinity your concept
of infinity and multiply it by infinity by infinity multiplied
by infinity multiplied by infinity multiplied by infinity multiplied by
infinity multiplied by infinity an infinite number of times now
you're going a little bit closer to absolute infinity it's
infinity but not in one dimension or in three dimensions
it's not a spatial coordinate type of thing see it's
infinity in every dimension possible it's infinity raised to the
Infinity power raised to the Infinity power raised to the
Infinity power raised to the Infinity power an infinite number
of times it's a runaway chain reaction that has no
beginning and no end and includes absolutely everything and when
I say absolutely everything I don't just mean you and
me and your cat and your car and your tree
and the moon and the Sun and other galaxies I
don't mean that that's far far far shy of absolute
infinity I mean that what reality is is like a
possibility field of everything that's possible and even stuff that's
not possible and that doesn't exist reality is all of
that expanding outward so to speak almost like a sphere
but it's not a volume see this is happening in
every dimension it's happening in infinite dimensions there are infinite
dimensions and all of them contain infinite everything because and
here's the real deep diamond of an insight that explains
everything is that there cannot be a limit to any
limit within reality you see because reality has to include
everything and if reality includes everything it also must include
any limits that we would think exist upon reality what
do I mean by limits well you might think that
reality is limited to three dimensions or to four dimensions
or it's limited for example running in one direction in
time from past to present to future like that time
has an arrow pointing in one direction or it's limited
to the actual things here that exist that we can
see or it's even limited by the physical laws or
the physical constants like the gravitational constant the speed of
light in all these other mathematical physical concepts oricon constants
I mean that uh that we think create the structure
of our universe but you see those constants themselves are
groundless they are if they even exist they are just
particulars within a field infinite field of possibility because the
constant itself has to be enforced by something but what
would enforce it you see the enforcement on reality would
have to sit outside of reality but reality includes everything
which means that reality must be absolutely infinite because there
can ultimately never be anything that enforces it reality ends
up being absolutely free it's free to be any way
that it can be to get a little taste of
this imagine we have a tropical island with a nice
beach somewhere in the Caribbean and on that tropical island
is lying one little bit of sand now that little
bit of sand if we move it one millimeter we
could almost say like it's as though we constructed an
alternate universe right where the sand particle is just shifted
it's everything in the universe is just like it is
right now but the stats and particle in this alternate
universe has been shifted by one millimeter now imagine that
we take all the sand particles on that beach and
we shift them around by one millimeter not just on
that beach but on every island in the Caribbean not
just there but on every island in the world on
every particle of sand on the entire earth and each
one of those if shifted by a millimeter will create
an alternate universe but we also take the moon and
the Sun and we take every particle on every heavenly
body around every solar system around every galaxy in the
entire universe and that right there is not yet what
I mean by absolute infinity that is a tiny tiny
tiny tiny tiny subset of absolute infinity because what we'd
also have to do is take our universe and imagine
every possible universe that could ever possibly exist at every
possible moment in time ever and each one of those
consider those as though they were alternate universes sort of
like multiverses right and you have now imagine you have
an infinite number of those and now you start to
get a little taste of absolute infinity it's absolutely everything
everything everything everything not just that is but that ever
was and ever will be everything everything possible and everything
that doesn't exist it's all contained in this and it's
all absolutely nothing so this absolute infinity it's not like
you're seeing anything here there's nothing to see there's no
color to it there's no shape to it there's no
smell no taste no feel you're not even feeling it
you're only able to be aware of it directly aware
of it by being it this absolute infinity and you
see how out of nothing the absolute infinity spawns everything
and it's not like it's taking place across time there's
no such thing as time everything in absolute infinity including
time time is one possibility one dimension of absolute infinity
it's all there as one thing past present and future
is there all contained in one it's like a white
hole an infinite singularity like a mathematical point which has
no dimensions and yet at the same time if you
take that point and you zoom in on it that
point contains everything that's possible and this is what God
is and what I became conscious of is that this
is what I am so that will first chunk of
my insight then what happened in this experience is that
immediately I recognized for the first time in my life
I've awoken like I've awoken to awaken to awaken from
life you understand what this means this this is an
awakening from life life doesn't exist anymore it doesn't exist
from this absolute infinity perspective to awaken the experience of
awakening from life is the most shocking thing that you
can possibly imagine it's as though you know like maybe
you're fiddling around scratching some itch on the back of
your skull one day and then you discover this a
little something there and then you discover oh it's like
a little zipper you can just kind of pull on
it so you start to pull on it you should
to pull on it there's like an invisible zipper that
just goes across your skull like this down your face
down your neck down your body like this and it's
almost like you're taking off a costume and you just
unzip this thing you unzip in it and your body
it's as though it just kind of falls down like
a floppy banana peel falls to the ground and then
you awaken from this existence that you thought was reality
and now you're absolute infinity you're nothing you're just nothing
there was nothing in that suit but everything that's ever
possible for there to be with no limits and no
bounds and if that's what you are this awakening is
so shocking that you finally understand what the ego is
what it really is like not just that all I'm
egotistical here I'm a little selfish here I'm all this
no no your ego is your entire life as you
know it the fact that you were born that you
have parents all this stuff all this just gets wiped
away from you it just a fiction it's just a
dream what happens to you when you had a dream
last night and now you're sitting here listening to me
where did that dream go did it have any reality
at all any substance no it just it's gone it's
gone it's like a little silly hallucination well imagine now
that what you call reality what we call reality right
now that it's possible to awaken from this and the
degree of difference between reality and awakening from reality is
greater than awakening from a dream into everyday life it
is not possible to understand what the word awakened means
without actually experiencing this and when you experience it you
have a mind-blowing epiphany of like oh this is awakening
it's nothing I could have possibly a map I wasn't
even close like not even [ __ ] close I
was infinite orders of magnitude away from understanding awakening and
same thing with God and like what I was saying
about God you know I was saying that I don't
like the word God but there was a funny thing
that happened to me is that this word just came
to me as the most natural explanation for what was
happening that in the phrase absolute infinite that also came
to me as the most appropriate description of what was
happening and for the first time in my life I
understood what the Gord God actually means and it's a
very very appropriate word but only if you have the
experience if you have an idea of God it's not
appropriate at all it's silly it's totally silly and so
when I awoke it was greater than I could have
ever imagined like my wildest fantasies about what awakening could
get me were nothing compared to the power of actual
awakening it was so ridiculously overwhelming that I was just
drowning in a sea of love infinite love because that's
an attribute of God that you quickly realize is infinite
love and so you're drowning in it it's like you're
drowning in it and it's just like love is pouring
down your throat you can't handle it anymore injures coughing
it up it's so much it's frightening it scares you
this is the true meaning of the word awesome and
the true meaning of the word oh my god that's
where that phrase comes from but you don't really know
what that phrase means until you've actually become God and
seen what that means it's not possible to imagine in
your wildest dreams and the crazy thing is is because
I took this chemical you know I was expecting that
this chemical it can only do chemical things right and
that's what most people think about psychedelics I call you
have some some nice hallucinations you see some weird stuff
and say yeah I can understand that because you know
chemicals go into your brain and they can make a
little funny pictures and stuff and distort your reality but
what I became conscious of is no picture it's no
picture you can't describe this and you can't excuse us
away as just and just say it's like oh yeah
it's just some kind of chemical thing no no because
this isn't possible you see this is impossible to it's
impossible to experience this at all given conventional understandings of
human experience and what human beings are there is no
way that a chemical can do this it's not possible
how can you become infinite from taking a chemical not
an ID of becoming infinite but you literally become infinite
how is that possible that's something to ponder for another
day another thing I realized is I realized that everything
I knew about reality is wrong everything every belief everything
every thought everything I've ever taught you it's all rise
like it's it's all part of the dream it might
work in the dream but when you awaken from the
dream it's silly it's just silly and deluded and the
degree of delusion that I became aware of his infinite
infinite delusion is what my life was infinite delusion the
degree of delusion as much as I talk about delusion
and self - self-deception mechanisms and the ego tricking you
and all this kind of stuff the delusion that you
are playing on yourself and that I play on myself
as my little ego leo is so massive that no
words can describe it you would need to write thousands
of pages to describe the degree of this delusion it's
that deep this absolute infinity is the most beautiful thing
you can ever experience it's like pure raw beauty to
the infinite degree and it's so shocking this experience that
there aren't even any tears with this experience it's pure
all and shock and tinged with terror you're terrified by
the experience of God imagine when you look at a
sunset or you're in the desert and you look up
at the night sky and these beautiful stars the Milky
Way you can see it all and you you get
this kind of beautiful sense of connection with nature this
sort of spiritual feeling will take that and multiply it
by an finiti every sunset you've ever seen in your
entire life would not be enough you need to multiply
all those by infinity and now you get a little
taste of the power of this experience it completely melts
you this is not a experience just of the mind
or of the brain this is a full-body experience it
melts your heart my heart completely melted my body even
started to release energy from it like as though I've
been I'm releasing a a lifetime of carrying around all
that this this torture and fighting and struggle of the
ego and releasing all of that like one giant blast
out of your body it completely transforms you like there's
there's no going back after this experience it's ridiculously powerful
can't be imagined and so that's what happened to me
and then about 30 minutes later I came back as
Leo into the small leo ego because the chemical wears
off and then of course you're back and you're like
normal but you're not really like normal because you've seen
something that cannot be ever unseen and so my ego
my my little eco miser to try to make sense
of this you know how come if I'm infinite how
come I'm here in a very limited form and I'm
living in a very limited ordered reality and it is
a very specific way like I'm standing you're talking to
you and you're sitting there listening to me and that's
exactly how it is how do we reconcile that with
absolute infinity so I started thinking about this a lot
and I came up with an explanation now caveat here
this is just my little ego self coming up with
some little explanation so this explanation might be delusional I
might change it later it's sort of like a tentative
hypothesis that I have but it seemed to satisfy me
quite a bit because it explained basically all of reality
you want all of reality explained here it is what
reality is is an infinite matrix in infinite dimensions and
everything that can be is happening all at once simultaneously
so there's that but now how do we explain me
and you as little egos well here's here's the stroke
of genius and I don't take credit for this the
stroke of genius is that if I didn't exist as
my little ego and you didn't exist as your little
ego and our universe in our world didn't exist in
this very limited way that it does then absolute infinity
couldn't be infinite could it you see something would be
missing from it namely my little perspective and your little
perspective and humanity's little perspective and the entire current universe
that we're living in what we're experiencing right now is
one possibility out of a infinite sea of possibilities and
of course we have to experience it as separate and
limited because that is what that experience is actually part
of absolute infinity see absolute infinity includes absolutely everything which
means it includes realities that are like little bubbles inside
of it which are very limited and very diluted and
it includes everything including pain murder rape genocide Wars atomic
bombs all the evil [ __ ] that you don't
like about life all of that has to be included
in absolute infinity see including all the quote unquote good
stuff also has to be included because absolute infinity is
absolutely infinite you can't subtract anything from it you see
and that explains everything everything is explained by this it's
extraordinarily satisfying to get that explanation especially for me as
someone a philosopher who's been asking these existential questions for
years and years and years for my whole life couldn't
wrap my mind around it now I see why I
couldn't wrap my mind around it you can't run matte
wrap your mind around it because it's infinite but you
can experience it see so that was my experience now
I'm not enlightened I don't claim to be and I
don't feel like I am I'm back in my little
ego self and that's fine but this was an important
experience in my life the most powerful experience I've ever
had for sure and be most important for my personal
development for sure if I took the last three years
of daily meditation all the retreats I've done thousands of
hours of work all the self inquiry of I've done
and if I take all of that and I can
replace it by this one experience that I've had I
would take this one experience it's infinitely more more powerful
it's just life-changing um and what's really heartbreaking about is
that I can't really communicate to you everything you're after
in your life every goal you have money relationships business
success being a good human being raising children whatever that
is that's all part of a dream you see that's
not life when you awaken from life you realize you
look around you realize you can't die you can't go
anywhere there's nowhere to go there's no one to die
it's just a silly game it means absolutely nothing see
and you are so complete because you are absolutely infinite
that you have everything you have everything you need you
need nothing more when you realize that everything is put
into proper perspective everything your entire life is put into
proper perspective it's crazy but that's reality it's infinite and
it's at the same time absolutely nothing and it created
itself you created yourself you just don't know it yet
maybe one day you will I'm sharing this with you
not to brag or to gloat but because this is
an experience that you can have this is the quintessential
experience of life there is nothing else that can compare
to it this is it is the whole shebang everything
else is a distraction and when you ever awaken if
you ever do you will realize in an instant that
your entire life was just a distraction from this that's
all it was has no meaning whatsoever compared to this
what you are doing right now is you are living
in fear in your limited little reality that you think
is so important that you're so afraid to lose and
the biggest thing you will discover in your life when
you awaken is that you were living in the worst
possible situation you could have been living in this thing
that you think is so great that you're afraid to
lose it's pathetic it's like you're a poor man on
the street who's sitting there with a with a little
dirty paper cup a little dirty crumpled up paper cup
and he thinks that that little paper cup because that's
his only possession that little paper cup he clings to
it and he thinks that this dirty little paper cup
if he loses that ever his whole life will come
to an end and what he doesn't realize is that
if he only released and had enough faith to release
that paper cup that he would get the entire universe
in return and yet he's so afraid that all he
can do is cling to that little cup and he
will never ever ever because of that experience God Himself
is God this experience was so powerful that after about
a week passed and I was going asleep and what
I was experiencing is even though this chemical passes out
of your system very quickly within 30 minutes or so
I would go asleep deep asleep normally where I would
be unconscious but here I actually would go asleep and
I would become God I would become absolute infinity and
then I would awaken from that into my regular dreams
and then from my dreams into regular reality ordinary reality
but then I'd have a memory of like oh yeah
I was infinite while I was sleeping and Here I
am now as this little ego Leo Here I am
it's powerful sometimes I just get an after like an
after image or just like a flashback of this experience
and you know while I'm sleeping this is weeks weeks
weeks later so there's no chemicals at this point affecting
me I just get an image of what it was
like that moment when I died I actually died and
became God that moment was so petrifying that it wakes
me up in my sleep just thinking about it and
I wake up and I just cry for 15 minutes
at the beauty and also the frightening uh majesty of
God you might think like oh okay so you got
the substance you could just do the substance every day
right and just experience God every day well see God
is terrifying it's so beautiful it's so overwhelming it's infinite
so it's terrifying in a sense even though it's kind
of a good positive terror but no you don't want
to do this every day even though you could you
don't want to do every day fact I haven't done
in a month a whole month has passed and every
time I kind of look at I'm like oh I
should do a little bit more of that and like
no I don't know I don't know if I'm ready
for that that's some heavy heavy heavy [ __ ]
I still AM I'm still uh struggling to understand what
I saw the first time see so like I said
this is an experience for you to have not to
believe me I don't care what you believe it doesn't
matter what you believe you're right your beliefs are irrelevant
your thoughts are irrelevant your logical understanding is irrelevant you
either will have this experience or you won't next week
I will reveal how you can have this experience within
15 minutes and I will divulge the name of the
substance I haven't done it right now because I want
to hold off because for safety reasons there's going to
be important precautions and guidelines that I need to explain
for how to use this substance properly and safely and
I can't do that here in this episode because that
would run way too long and there'd be too many
technical details so what I recommend is that you stay
tuned with me for next week learn more keep a
very very very very open mind I know it sounds
like I've gone down you know some rabbit hole that
I've gone crazy ah let me assure you I'm not
crazy I'm still basically the old leo but I've also
seen some very deep [ __ ] that has also
changed my life forever in the same way that it
will change your life forever if you stay open-minded and
stay on this path and if you don't to use
a substance don't use a session so you can pursue
this all you know through meditation or self inquiry whatever
eventually you might be able to break through to this
but it'll probably take you some decades multiple decades to
do it and that's assuming that you do it every
single day for many hours a day because this insight
is way beyond a simple little experience of no self
I've had some experiences of no self I had some
samadhi like experiences this is this is a whole nother
deal this is absolutely infinite and speaking of which I'm
going to leave you on one final note with what
I call the gallery of absolute infinity [Music] you [Music]
you [Music] you [Music] you [Music]
