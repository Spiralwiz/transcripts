[Music] you I'm super excited to be talking about this
topic this is a topic that I wanted to talk
about for a long time but it's a tricky topic
to approach properly because we need to cover this topic
from many different angles simultaneously and there are a lot
of traps of the mind that we can fall into
very easily so we've had to build up to it
this talk is going to be about quantum mechanics and
non-duality I'm not going to get into super technical detail
about what quantum mechanics is although I will cover the
basics what I'm interested in though more is the big
picture and I'm interested in the ramifications of quantum mechanics
what are the metaphysical and epistemological ramifications of quantum mechanics
and what can quantum mechanics say about spirituality or non
duality is there something worthwhile there to be gleaned from
this science and let me address this concern right off
the bat that what I'm gonna be doing is just
doing some typical new-age justifications of spirituality or religion that's
not what I'm gonna be doing I'm actually going to
be quoting to you from very serious scientists not quacks
not fringe people not new-age people I'm gonna be mostly
quoting to you from the fathers of quantum mechanics themselves
the big guys Schrodinger and Einstein and Richard Fineman and
Arthur Eddington and Niels Bohr and people like that so
these are the guys who actually invented quantum mechanics and
they were not just regular scientists they were real pioneers
and we'll get into that as we keep going quantum
mechanics is very easily misused by new age people or
religious people who want to use it as justification for
the dogmas that they already hold that is not what
I'm interested in doing here what I'm interested in show
is in showing you some very deep connects which exists
between quantum mechanics and non-duality and spirituality but in a
way that probably you haven't heard before and this will
blow your mind if you stick with me through the
end at some points this talk will get a little
bit technical and I'm gonna be quoting to you a
lot from these various scientists and physicists precisely because I
don't want these ideas coming just purely from me I
want you to understand that these fathers of quantum mechanics
that they really understood the deep metaphysical and epistemological ramifications
of their discoveries in a way that many modern scientists
and modern physicists do not because they subscribe to the
materialist paradigm what's not taught to us in school and
what almost nobody really knows in mainstream culture is that
in the 1920s there was a silent metaphysical and epidemiological
revolution that happened in Western intellectual tradition it was utterly
ground-shaking but the problem is is that these ideas can
become so abstract and so esoteric that they don't easily
permeate into popular culture and so the general population still
does not know of the metaphysical and stoma logical revolution
that happened in the 1920s most popular cultural conceptions of
science and also of what reality is is hundreds of
years out of date and this is a shocking fact
to discover and the reason it is because this stuff
is is rather complicated it can be sometimes technical and
it can be sometimes difficult to see what are the
practical implications of this stuff so this is not taught
to you in school and it's not really even taught
to you in university for example if you're watching me
for the first time you might think that I'm some
new ager or that I'm some religious person or I'm
trying to justify my Christian beliefs or whatever or my
Buddhist beliefs not at all I was an atheist my
whole life I went into hardcore philosophy epistemology and university
I studied philosophy of science I studied logic and I
was an engineering major as well so I studied hardcore
physics and calculus for two years of my engineering degree
it was just non-stop physics classes and calculus classes so
like really hardcore stuff and I was a I was
a pretty good student so I got A's in most
of my classes and I understood the material I was
pretty good at physics and despite that even though I
took more physics classes than most people can dream of
they still didn't teach me this stuff in university and
even though it took a lot of philosophy classes I
only just scratched the surface of the implications of quantum
mechanics it required lots more research later after that on
my own initiative to really understand this stuff they just
don't teach this to us in university because it doesn't
have a lot of practical implications or so it seems
actually the implications are enormous they are enormous and they
are extremely practical but of course this doesn't resonate within
academia the problem though is even worse than this the
metaphysical implications of quantum mechanics are so poorly understood that
even the hardest scientists that exist today and the most
reputable academics who have Nobel Prizes and who are PhDs
at Caltech and MIT and who actually work within field
of quantum mechanics and are doing cutting-edge research they themselves
still do not grasp the enormity and the profundity of
the metaphysical physical and epistemic implications that were discovered in
the 1920s by some of these fathers of quantum mechanics
they still don't understand because there's a big difference between
being a good scientist and publishing research papers and doing
laboratory experiments that's one thing you can be really good
at that but then to understand the significance and the
implications of your work and what that means for the
human psyche and human consciousness and how to live one's
life and what that means for metaphysics and epistemology and
philosophy that's a separate domain you can be good at
one and terrible in the other and one one of
the things I'm claiming is that many modern hard physicists
and scientists are really bad at this second aspect of
the domain which is why this conversation is so necessary
this is something this this this conversation we're having right
now is not just something as an introductory course that
you can give in a university to two you know
two freshmen this is something you can give to PhD
students this is something you can give to Nobel Prize
winning physicists like Stephen Hawking well I don't know didn't
Hawking win a Nobel Prize I don't even know but
you know take someone like Stephen Hawking you can talk
to him have this conversation with him and he will
learn something from this if he's open-minded now of course
the trick is once you're at that class of intellectual
or academic as Stephen Hawking well are you really going
to be inclined to be very open-minded and have these
conversations maybe not there's a important distinction that we need
to make to really understand what's going on within science
to make sense of science this is a three part
distinction of triple distinction so first well before we can
get into the first part when we say the word
science the word science gets thrown around a lot as
though people understand what science is but science is a
very very tricky thing and in fact I'm gonna have
an episode in the future that's just gonna talk about
what science is and we're gonna get into a little
bit of that here but I'll cover it more there
but so this word science it's so tricky it's so
tricky it's so self-deceptive people use it in different ways
first of all there's popular science the popular lame and
conception of what science is which is extremely sloppy it's
just this idea that Oh science is the way that
we know things and the way that we engineer things
and we just listen to the scientists and the scientists
just deliver truth to us and whatever the scientists say
is just true and science in this sense is just
the the polar opposite of religion and so either you're
religious or you're scientific and if you're scientific that means
you're aligned with the truth and if you're religious that
means you're aligned with superstition and dogma and biblical references
and stuff like that and you believe in various mythologies
which is the polar opposite of science and everybody knows
that religious beliefs are not true and have nothing to
do with reality whereas science is the thing that actually
tracks reality this is a very gross characterization of what
Sciences science does not actually work this way this is
the myth of science this is an idealized version of
science this is not how science actually works then there
is the modern technical hard version of science so if
you are actually a scientist a physicist a chemist a
biologist you work in a university setting or maybe you
studied signs a little bit more in-depth such that you
actually studied the philosophy of science then you understand that
science is actually a lot more tricky and technical than
most people assume and that it's not so easy to
discover what's true from what's false and you've studied the
history of science and you realize that actually throughout history
many scientists were religious and they were superstitious and they
were spiritual and also to distinguish between whether a theory
is actually true or not is not simple and that
science is not just raw truth science is not just
the doing of experiments science is also the conceptualizing models
and theories and frameworks that are put forth which need
to be tested against reality and that process of testing
these theories against reality that's challenging that's tricky that's a
non-trivial process and it can be highly error-prone and it's
very easy to delude yourself in that process and that
science is always in a process of revising itself and
that in fact at any given point many aspects of
modern science could be flawed or wrong or incomplete and
they will be radically changed in the future by scientific
revolutions by a shift in paradigm so that would be
a more nuanced understanding of what science is and then
there is even a third layer and the third layer
is visionary science this is where science sort of comes
at the intersection with philosophy and with metaphysics and epistemology
and this is where you go beyond just doing laboratory
work you know the modern technical scientist in an academic
institution he writes research papers he does laboratory work he's
not usually a visionary scientist he's not a genius he's
not a philosopher whereas the fathers of quantum mechanics like
Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr and Schrodinger and Heisenberg and
others like that which will be discussing they were not
just laboratory technicians these were visionary theoreticians and philosophers first
and foremost and scientists real secondarily wishes in fact why
they were able to make these radical breakthroughs and created
the quantum mechanics revolution and these guys had a very
different understanding of science than even just modern technical scientists
that you find in many universities and these guys were
just not materialists the way that modern technical scientists and
universities are because you see what modern science has devolved
into is a pragmatic exercise of doing laboratory work finding
out certain correlations between phenomenon in the world how something
works and then selling that technology or that information to
other companies starting businesses starting pharmaceutical companies or technology companies
making a money off of it or just writing research
papers and building your status and career as a scientist
for for doing the sort of stuff getting Nobel Prizes
that sort of stuff all of that can be done
in a sort of mindless unconscious way without grounding it
in the human experience and without understanding the deep philosophical
ramifications of what you're really doing you see in the
same way that you can build a nuclear bomb using
scientific theory but are you thinking through what you're doing
and why you're doing it when you're designing this nuclear
weapon are you seeing that this thing will be used
as a weapon of war you see because modern technical
scientists who are materialist they don't care about that stuff
for them it's a purely pragmatic exercise mostly I mean
I'm not saying they don't have heart I'm not saying
they don't care if people die but mostly it's just
a sort of mindless process of can we make a
discovery can we make a technology out of it whereas
if you're a visionary conscious scientist you will think through
the consequences very carefully and it's not just going to
be about what kind of technology can I create you're
gonna you're gonna have to connect that more holistically with
questions about how is this gonna impact humanity is this
something that's ethical or moral is this something that is
going to increase the consciousness of the world or decrease
the consciousness of the world what are we getting ourselves
into and what are the philosophical implications of all this
stuff see so make this distinction in your mind between
these different levels at which we can talk about science
so when I say science what do I mean by
that word I'm not just talking about popular signs this
is some idealized myth am i talking about this technical
science as done in universities or am i talking about
this very deep genius level philosophical science which well is
very rarely done these days it's very rare to find
people who are at this level that's sort of a
quaint notion these days because our society is actually becoming
more materialistic in a sense and we'll get into that
now before we get into the really heavy stuff you
might be wondering well Leo why are you qualified to
talk about quantum mechanics who do you think you are
how arrogant of you where is your PhD where's your
Nobel Prize where are your books if if you are
not a professor then why should I listen to you
over a a quantum theorists who is who's credentialed how
can you actually honestly believe that you know more than
them well a couple of points to address here it's
true I don't have a PhD I'm not a professor
and in fact I haven't read that many books about
quantum mechanics I haven't studied the technical details in that
much depth I haven't really looked into the mathematics of
it but my points here will not be technical or
mathematical they will be metaphysical they will be philosophical now
you can say olio but if you don't do the
mathematics then really what do you understand about quantum mechanics
well as a counter to that point I would say
that if that's the level of rigor and standard that
you're gonna apply here then we can hardly talk about
anything because most about most the time when we talk
about anything we are not technical experts in the thing
that we're talking about and yet nevertheless we feel like
we can talk about it at a high level and
you get a big picture understanding of what it is
we can talk about cars and when you talk about
the philosophical implications of cars and what they mean for
our life without actually being car mechanics or engineers see
because that's irrelevant those details are largely irrelevant we can
trust on unreliable experts so by no means am i
saying that these academics and these PhDs are are useless
people who don't provide us with valuable information no they
do good technical lab research which we need and then
we need to be able to rely and Trust on
them to do accurate lab research and tend to share
their conclusions with us so that then we can work
with those conclusions so that's what we're doing here nothing
I say is gonna hinge upon the mathematics of quantum
mechanics and I'm not gonna bore you with all those
details this is actually gonna be a very juicy and
interesting topic this is not going to be a dry
topic at all we are going to explain the very
origin and substance of existence in this topic conclusively at
least as much as possible as as it is possible
using language and using concepts another point I'll make about
this qualification issue is that I have studied epistemology and
philosophy of science very seriously since my teenage years this
is something that's been a deep passion of mine and
in fact my deepest passion is not personal development and
it's not even enlightenment my deepest passion is really philosophy
of science and epistemology understanding what is knowledge and how
does it work and what are the limitations of knowledge
that has driven me my entire life and that's ultimately
what what deeply grounds my personal development work and all
my consciousness work and all the enlightenment stuff that I
do and all that so I've read quite a lot
of different philosophers on this topic I've I've read a
lot of scientists I've thought about this stuff deeply so
my deepest qualification is not a certificate or a PhD
it's simply that I've thought about this stuff I've been
passionate about it and I've cared about it and that's
really the only qualification you need to understand a thing
you need to care about understanding it and you need
to contemplate it and that's it and everything else is
nice but it doesn't get guarantee.you accuracy or truth or
really deep understanding only contemplation does another point about qualifications
is that I am gonna be siting very serious scientists
to you here I'm not gonna be citing new-age quacks
and crackpots and speculative theorists who have crazy ideas and
crazy interpretations no I'm gonna be citing to you the
guys who actually invented quantum mechanics I'm going to be
citing to you modern scientists who are from from Caltech
from MIT the the most reputable people so I'm going
to be using their words to make my points now
of course I'm not just gonna confine myself to their
ideas because their ideas are limited we're gonna take it
to the next level so I am going to embellish
and elaborate a little bit and I'll point out where
I'm doing that and the final point I'll make about
qualifications is that even more important than having technical mathematical
knowledge of quantum mechanics is actually experiencing profound states of
consciousness non-ordinary states of consciousness and that's something that I
have quite a bit of experience with at this point
I've experienced profound states of consciousness which not to brag
I'm not bragging here I'm just saying this is a
fact I've experienced these states of consciousness which almost no
human being has ever experienced on this planet and the
depth of these states of consciousness is extraordinary and mind-blowing
and from these states of consciousness one can see the
very profound interconnections between quantum mechanics for example and spirituality
or non duality or epistemology or metaphysics so that is
something that I wish more scientists add because then they
would be talking the way that I'm talking here but
again we'll get into that a little bit later what
is my key argument or thesis for this episode it's
as follows there are several points to it firstly my
thesis is that quantum mechanics corroborates non-duality what quantum mechanics
basically points to is the fact that reality is a
non dual singularity and that all distinctions are untenable and
must ultimately collapse secondly my thesis is is that quantum
mechanics conclusively debunks materialism and the notion of there being
an objective reality or physicality these notions have been killed
since the 1920s reality is not material it is not
objective and it is not a linear rational clockwork machine
thirdly my thesis is is that paradox is inherent to
reality there cannot be reality without paradox paradox is not
a mistake it is not a bug it is a
feature it is the thing that makes reality occur reality
is a strange loop and that when we get to
the root bottom of the substance of of what reality
is to to the bottom most levels what we must
discover is that it will cycle back around and involve
ourselves and itself in a paradoxical strange loop if you're
not familiar with the concept of strange loops go watch
my very deep and profound episode about reality is a
strange loop where I talk about that in great length
that episode is going to be very important to understand
what I'm gonna be talking about here because the deep
structure of reality is a strange loop fourthly my thesis
is is that the consequences of quantum mechanics are too
radical so radical that the human mind cannot cope with
them they cannot be believed and they cannot be logically
understood the only way to really understand the full consequences
of quantum mechanics is to transcend the human mind and
to go to levels of consciousness which are transcendent levels
of consciousness which most human beings have never experienced and
don't even know are possible and that the consequences of
of this are so radical that it will literally destroy
reality itself and it will end your very life that's
how radical the consequences are this is not a mere
intellectual exercise in philosophy this is not merely a system
of belief or some new-age religion that I'm talking about
nor is this even science that I'm talking about where
you can write a textbook about this stuff what I'm
talking about is to to embody these consequences is such
a radical thing and the only way to understand these
consequences is to embody them that it will literally kill
you that's that's a rather bold claim and that takes
some explaining we'll get into that and fifthly my my
thesis is that people who say that quantum mechanics has
nothing to do with non duality or spirituality and there's
a whole group of people that say that including scientists
and philosophers and and and even enlightened people that they
are wrong and I will show you how that is
the case so let's begin first we have to understand
the classical model which is the alternative to the quantum
mechanical model of reality the classical model is what I
call the materialist paradigm it is the de-facto way that
you think reality works as you're born and part of
it is because it's imprinted to you by culture and
part of it is simply because I think that's how
the human mind is actually wired it's wired for this
classical simple materialist model of how reality works what does
this model really say this model says that there is
a physical reality we see it we interact with it
it's an objective thing I was born into this reality
I exist as a physical body within this reality this
physical body if it gets killed or harmed sufficiently it
will die and that will be my exit from this
reality but the reality itself will still be there it
was there before I was born and it will be
there after I die this reality what is it made
of it's made of ever smaller building blocks particles particles
may have more particles metamour particles cells made of molecules
made out of atoms made out of electrons and protons
and quarks and neutrons and maybe strings at the very
lowest level and that ultimately there is a substance to
reality there is an objective way that reality is and
of course we can't deny the most obvious thing of
all which is that reality is that's the classical materialist
model there are a lot of very subtle implications metaphysical
implications that come with this model most people don't realize
that it's a model at all or that it's a
metaphysics at all people just hold it as reality it's
like well how could it be any other way what's
the alternative of course it's like that what's even the
point of discussing this stuff that's how most people hold
it including many serious scientists the classical model comes about
from well really it stretches back thousands of years all
the way to the ancient Greeks and probably even way
before that cuz like I said it's probably hardwired into
our into our human psyche but there were a couple
of key thinkers that really solidify this model in Western
intellectual tradition and they were Democritus Aristotle Euclid Descartes Newton
and Laplace amongst many many others but these were sort
of the big guys who shaped this paradigm most people
aren't aware of this most people aren't aware that when
they're born they're picking up these ideas which came from
these people and have have really constructed this sort of
conceptual cultural framework see most people understand that culture and
science are inextricably linked science is a part of culture
all your scientific beliefs are a part of culture you
understand this it's very twisted science is not just someone
sitting in a laboratory doing experiments it is that but
it's much much more than that it's very cultural as
well so this classical model Democritus he was a Greek
who basically came up with the idea that the world
is made of atoms and that idea is still stuck
around even to this day most people today believe the
worlds may have atoms right that's what the average person
on the street believes if you ask them of course
quantum mechanics has disproven this long ago but we'll get
into that then there's Aristotle Aristotle came up with all
these rational categories for dividing the world in reality and
science has basically still stuck with that idea there's Euclid
who came up with just geometry the postulates of geometry
and he came up with Euclidean geometry and for a
long time for thousands of years it was thought that
Euclidean geometry is the only kind of geometry until later
we discovered non Euclidean geometry which then led to discoveries
of of Albert Einstein and we'll get into that and
most people today still think that reality is Euclidean that
there's no other kind of geometry but Euclidean geometry then
of course there was Descartes and Descartes was huge Descartes
really enshrined the idea of dualism the idea that there's
matter and then there's spirit or there's mind and that
these are two separate entities and that what I am
I'm a physical body but I'm also a mind inside
the physical body and there is the physical external world
but then there's the the subtle internal world and that
duality that that is a huge huge component of every
human beings operating system and how they interact with life
as a whole right you actually believe that there's an
external physical world and then there's an internal world of
emotions and colors and sights and sounds and phenomenon and
that this private inner world is separate from the external
world and it doesn't make sense how anything else could
be true but that then there's Newton and Laplace Newton
of course came up with calculus and Newtonian mechanics and
that was good for describing how physics works in the
normal everyday sense of the world of the world but
but then Einstein came along and ultimately Newtonian mechanics we
know is actually inaccurate it's an approximation it's not really
true and so from Newton and Laplace this idea came
about that the world is this clockwork universe God because
Newton was a believing man Newton said God sort of
created this clockwork universe and set it to run and
now it just runs by itself like this elaborate perfect
clock now what modern scientists do is they say well
we don't need God screw God we throw God out
of the picture so we just have this clockwork universe
and it works perfectly it's mechanical it's all causal it's
all rational you can figured all of it out and
it just works perfectly but of course this was disproved
by quantum mechanics so that was the classical model this
classical model can be called realist materialist atomist rationalist and
Objectivist that's the metaphysics of the classical model and this
metaphysics has so thoroughly permeated an infected Western culture that
it has become reality the very word reality means that
and it's not clear what else it could possibly mean
but if you've actually studied modern science then you've been
shocked to learn that with the discoveries of quantum mechanics
and general relativity Einstein's work and also chaos theory it
has been shown that reality is actually nonlinear non rational
non Euclidean non Cartesian non Aristotelian a causal non physical
and highly relative now what all of that means we'll
get into in a little bit but basically what it
means is that reality is not a clockwork machine when
you really investigate this idea that reality is a clockwork
it appears like a clockwork when you look at it
superficially but when you really bore down to the very
bottom of it you discover this notion of a clockwork
it doesn't work it collapses which is exactly what quantum
mechanics reveals so then what is reality if it's not
a clockwork as I've said in my understanding absolute infinity
episode and I explained it in a lot of depth
there with a two-part series quite a long one but
very worthwhile to watch is that reality is an infinite
intelligent conscious singularity reality is not a physical thing it
is not a physical clock it is mind stuff it
is an infinite hallucination or an infinite dream and within
this dream you can experience physicality as a limitation of
the larger set of possibilities you can experience physicality you
can experience a condensed form of consciousness where you are
a self or an ego or a body or where
you're doing science or where there is a physical objective
world but really this is all relative and subjective and
itself this dream has no substance and it doesn't really
exist that's pretty twisted that's a pretty bold claim to
make how can I make such a bold claim well
the only way you can discover this for sure for
yourself is through direct consciousness of non-duality which is called
otherwise enlightenment or awakening that's the only true way that
you can that you can really get it and that
requires going beyond ordinary human levels of consciousness it is
possible to do many people have done it but relatively
few people have done it compared to the billions of
people alive on this planet and we are still at
this point in human evolution in human history where this
stuff is not gone mainstream yet and it's still very
difficult for people to understand this stuff precisely because they're
locked into the dogma of the materialist paradigm and they
don't see that they're locked into it but short of
having these direct experiences which you can have and I've
talked about many times in the past how you can
have them there are many techniques you can use I've
shared all the techniques with you so I'm not hiding
anything you can go and do it there are many
shortcuts you can use many different technologies and methods so
this is not just you know this is not just
religion here but you know short of having these right
experiences what you can do is you can also understand
how modern science fits in with that and how it
points to it see in the same way that you
know they started discovering planets that exist outside our solar
system in the last 10 20 years they've discovered hundreds
now of these they're called Zeno planets planets that you
can't really see visually because they're too far away but
how did scientists discover them well they couldn't see them
through a telescope because there's not enough light entering the
telescope to actually see these planets so what do they
do well they made an inference and so what they
do is they they track the actual gravitational pull that
the planet has on the Sun which not our Sun
but you know a star far far away a star
you see the gravitational perturbation of the orbit of that
planet around this this Sun and then you can see
this star a wobbles like this you can see the
wobble it's a tiny wobble you can't see with your
eyes but you can measure it with precise instruments and
so through this sort of wobbling effect they can infer
that all there must be a planet there and they
can even calculate how many planets and how big the
planet is based on the wobble you see so in
precisely the same way we can use discoveries of quantum
mechanics to intuit or infer that there is a higher
level of consciousness to which we can arrive and that's
what we'll be exploring here so in the 20th century
there were some key discoveries that were made by scientists
which shook loose this classical materialist model firstly it was
discovered that time velocity and position are all relative things
this was discovered by Einstein there's no such thing as
simultaneity which means that time for me and time for
you are actually different things and that time depends on
how fast I'm moving relative to you and so everything
is relative in fact and in fact if you look
at the world from the point of view of a
beam of light everything is frozen and standing still because
light is relative to what we know the rest of
the world and measure it that's technical stuff I'm not
going to get into heavy general relativity theory here but
you're probably familiar with that idea so that destroyed this
notion that there is an absolute space and time which
is something that Newton thought and that was a very
twisted sort of notion it was not easy to come
up with this sort of idea this was a very
paradigm shattering idea but nevertheless it was actually verified and
proven and we know that it's the case we have
actually built technologies like the GPS system which depends on
general relativity being true it was also discovered that space
is non Euclidean Einstein said that there isn't just space
there's a fabric a four-dimensional fabric called space-time space and
time are interwoven and gravity affects the curvature of this
this non Euclidean space it was also discovered that particles
or atoms are actually clouds of probabilities and not substantial
objects and it was discovered that when when a particle
is not being observed that actually it exists as a
superposition of all the possible states of where that particle
could be it's not merely that we don't know where
the particle is because our instruments aren't accurate enough it
was literally discovered that there is no such thing as
a particle there are these probability fields and we'll get
into that a little bit more later it was discovered
that particles actually don't have a position or velocity you
would think they would if they were like ordinary objects
but particles are not ordinary objects a particle is an
abstract concept that we have invented to talk about certain
phenomenon in the world and certain experimental results but there
actually is no particle there and it has no position
or velocity because it's actually in a state of superposition
where it's all the possible states that it could be
in simultaneously when you're not looking at it that's pretty
twisted stuff it was also discovered of course by Einstein's
famous equation that mass and energy are identical or convertible
e equals mc-squared did you know that in a nuclear
explosion where does all that energy come from what actually
happens they have a ball of plutonium or uranium which
undergoes fusion or fission and in that process of fusion
or fission what actually happens is that the the initial
mass of the uranium or plutonium gets decreased by a
tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny fraction tiny fraction like point
zero zero zero zero zero zero 1 of a of
a milligram a very tiny fraction and that tiny fraction
of plutonium is literally converted into energy the mass is
converted into energy and that turns out to be a
huge amount of energy enough to cause this nuclear mushroom
cloud explosion which obliterates everything within many miles that shows
you how much energy there is in a particle of
mass enormous quantities of energy so this what this did
is this blurred the distinction between mass and energy and
that was very interesting it was also discovered that light
is neither a particle nor a wave but both depending
on observation so this traditional Aristotelian idea that well an
object must either be this way or that way it's
either a or it's B but it can't be both
right well it was discovered that it can and that
it is and then it must be because it depends
on observation you see in the old Newtonian model the
classical model it was assumed that the subject and the
object are two separate and distinct things such that the
scientist who is looking at the particles or doing the
lab experiment he is sort of outside of the world
and he can look in objectively as an objective impartial
observer and just look and see okay so what does
reality really like and you can just kind of like
look through a telescope and you can say oh well
that's how it is but what quantum mechanics showed is
that no it doesn't work that way you looking at
the object effects the object the subject and the object
are entangled and you can't extricate them from each other
the entanglement is absolutely necessary and fundamental it was also
discovered that observation effects all measurements such that you can't
actually take a measurement of anything without affecting the thing
that you're measuring which should have been obvious from the
very beginning but the classical model sort of just assumed
that the scientist isn't involved in the picture whereas in
quantum mechanics we realize that if we if we go
deep enough we have to say no I am involved
in the picture because just the fact that I'm looking
at an object already means that there is a photon
that's kind of bouncing off the object going into my
eye and there's an interacted interaction there which entangles the
subject and the object it was also discovered that there's
a phenomenon called quantum entanglement and what that means is
if you have two sister particles and you move them
to opposite sides of the universe and you change the
position or spin or rotation or momentum of one of
the sister particles its other sister particle will instantaneously react
to the change that you made to this sister particle
even though they are 15 billion light-years apart in distance
they will change instantly violating of course I'll Albert Einstein's
um idea that information can only propagate at the speed
of light so what quantum mechanics discovered is that actually
nature violates the local realist you of causality there is
no such thing as a chain of causation that needs
to happen reality can instantaneously know and react to changes
in its own state and this produces instant action at
a distance Einstein called it spooky action at a distance
it's quantum entanglement so that that kills the old idea
of causality under the classical model it was also discovered
that 95 percent of the mass of our universe is
not made out of matter or anything that we know
or understand 5 percent of the universe is classical matter
the stuff that we are made out of the stuff
you see all around you the other 95 percent is
broken into two things 27 percent is dark matter which
is some other kind of matter that we don't really
understand what it is or why it's there or what
its properties are and we we can't really detect it
other than through its gravitational effect and we don't know
what it's made out of none of the particles that
we presently understand and we understand hundreds of subatomic particles
none of them are candidates for the struck matter as
of yet so that's still cutting-edge research that's ongoing and
then the remaining 68% is dark energy what the hell
is dark energy well we really don't know but the
best idea is that what dark energy is is it's
sort of just it's actually a negative form of energy
it's the net energy that's that's that exists in a
in a pure vacuum of empty space which is sort
of the background energy which offsets the matter and the
sort of positive energy such that ultimately and we don't
know this for sure but the speculation is now that
actually the net energy of the universe appears to be
zero which would be an interesting result such that the
dark energy and the the vacuum energy cancels out all
the positive energy and all the matter so that we
can say that the whole thing came out of nothing
as a as a as an infinite singularity back you
know stretching back to the to the Big Bang and
even before that so these are just some of the
rather mind-blowing and twisted discoveries that were made in the
20th century now let me give you a quick overview
of quantum mechanics this is quantum mechanics of the of
the non technical sort or for the layman so what
quantum mechanics really says I mean it's not complicated it
says that there are no such thing as particles really
so then what is there everything is fields a particle
is really just a field it's a cloud of possibilities
when you look upon this cloud with some instrument or
with your own eyes or with your own consciousness what
happens is that that cloud congeals and collapses into a
particular result now these fields are very interesting things because
what a field is mathematically speaking is it's an infinite
set of scalars so that means that if you take
every single point in space and you put a number
on it that will be a field so if you
have a two dimensional space like a piece of paper
imagine that every point on that paper can have a
different value just a random value like 1 5 100
200 and it's sort of distributed so if you gave
every point on that piece of paper every atom on
that piece of paper and there's trillions of them there
a particular value that would be a field and there's
different kinds of fields that science has discovered so modern
science there's also a branch of quantum mechanics called quantum
field theory says that basically everything is a field and
so reality is a is an interaction of different fields
coming together now what's interesting about field is that what
is a field really it's values but values of what
what do they actually point to and of course the
answer is nothing there's nothing there a field is infinite
nothingness interesting coincidence we'll get back to that modern physicists
talk about and think about reality as something called quantum
wave functions so you can you can write an equation
which represents a wave function for the probabilities of this
cloud of possibilities of congealing down into one particular configuration
that you see in the laboratory and so there's different
kinds of wave functions and so really when we're talking
about what is everything made out of what we're saying
is that everything is wave functions but what are these
wave functions whether they really point to another important component
of superposition or I mean of quantum mechanics is superposition
superposition is just again it says that when you're not
looking at a thing it exists as the state of
all of its possibilities so for example imagine that if
you're not looking at an elephant you would think well
if I'm nothing I thought if I'm not looking at
an elephant it's still an elephant right no not really
according to quantum mechanics when you're not looking at an
elephant that elephant just imagines is just a metaphor that
elephant exists as every other animal that it could have
possibly been think about that and really think through the
radical consequences of this it's enormous when you're not looking
at an elephant that elephant is literally infinite it's every
possible elephant that could ever possibly be that you could
ever see or any other creature could see or any
other instrument could detect not only that but it also
it exists as a kangaroo as a chipmunk as a
rhinoceros as a beetle as a bird as a dinosaur
as everything else and then when you look at it
it collapses down into that particular elephant that you see
that's that's that's a good metaphor for what superposition really
means but think about that and compare it to the
classical model because people when they walk around the world
when you go to work when you leave your children
at school you know for the day do you think
that your children exists as children as human beings do
you think your house still exists do you think your
your office still exists your boss your co-workers your family
members when you're not looking at them of course you
do that's part of your materialist paradigm and what we're
saying is that that's not the case that has been
disproved when you're not looking at your child that child
exists as infinity as nothingness when you're not looking at
elephant it's infinity its nothingness we're not looking at your
house it's infinity it's nothingness that's what it is that's
also what you are but you're not aware of it
so these wave functions they collapse through observation and so
observation is essential and absolutely fundamental to the concept of
reality there is no concept of reality without observation without
participation without subjectivity without relativity relativity is reality without relativity
without a subjective point of view what you have is
you have everything you have infinity you have every single
possibility so you sitting here right there listening to me
are experiencing a particular version of this infinity the one
from your point of view not only that but you
are that point of view that's what you are you're
not a body you're not a mind you're not a
thinking thing or a soul you are the point of
view and you are of course also nothing at infinity
because on this is this gets deep but there is
no difference actually between infinity and affinity affinity is implied
by infinity you actually cannot have infinity without also every
possible finitude that's a good luck wrapping your mind on
that one that one requires enlightenment to understand it's also
important to point out this is a confusion that many
new agers make is that the observer can be any
measuring device the observer doesn't have to just be human
consciousness it could be a laser a computer an animal
a machine a measuring stick whatever it doesn't have to
be literally human consciousness or the human mind of course
there's an additional wrinkle though to that because even though
a good scientist a good quantum theorists will will be
sure to stress this point and he will actually use
this point to say aha leo but that means that
if we could just use a laser to be the
observer then in what sense is consciousness important or essential
to quantum mechanics but of course it still is absolutely
it still is because the only consciousness that exists is
one consciousness your consciousness there is no other consciousness but
your consciousness that laser device that computer that measuring stick
and even that animal or whatever who is doing this
measuring and collapsing the wavefunction guess what it's your consciousness
it's nothing separate from you so in the end it
all boils down to your consciousness because all of reality
is occurring within your consciousness which really should be obvious
but you know many good scientists miss this nonetheless so
that's quantum mechanics in a nutshell it's important to understand
that quantum mechanics is not just philosophy or theory but
that it's extremely accurate it actually predicts with extreme accuracy
real physical phenomena that we use every day and many
of our technologies are completely and utterly dependent upon quantum
mechanics being true and being accurate most modern telecommunications and
computer technologies and smartphones and video games and all the
stuff that you know would not be possible if these
discoveries and quantum mechanics were not made in the 1920s
and in fact it's said that quantum mechanics is the
most accurate scientific theory that has ever been proposed it's
been the most validated of theories and while all that's
true there is a trick here or a trap because
the human mind because it's so pragmatically oriented it very
easily gives up questions about the truth and the meaning
of things as soon as it discovers something that just
works and so many even good scientists D say is
what they did is they said oh well it just
works it works it's accurate look what sort of so
who cares what it really means who cares what the
implications are it just works let's just go start using
it to build computers and phones and video games and
and all this sort of stuff and Wow what does
it really mean the interpretations out that's that's for philosophers
that's for armchair debates that's you know that's speculative stuff
we leave that to the to the theologians and who
cares let's just go build our technology we got the
real goods but actually when you take that attitude you
you miss something very important and what you miss is
you miss the very substance of the thing you were
studying what does quantum mechanics really say about reality what
does it say is the substance of everything let's think
it through quantum mechanics tells us that matter is identical
to particles which is identical to wave functions which is
identical to energy which is identical to fields but what
is matter what are particles what are wave functions what
is energy what are fields what are strings what are
functions and equations what is mathematics and what is science
and what is human thought because all of this notice
is human thought and what is consciousness because all of
this is taking place within consciousness you never encounter a
particle or wave function or an equation or a string
or a field you only encounter your own consciousness so
you see the circularity here you see the strange loopiness
of what we're doing here we're talking about the external
world as though it's out there but really we're talking
about our own minds and then when we wonder well
where does my mind exist well of course it exists
in the external world that exists in the physical body
which is sitting in the external world it exists in
the brain but then where is the brain how do
I know there's a brain because it's in my mind
so then is the mind in the brain or is
the brain in the mind or maybe it's both or
maybe it's neither or maybe it's a superposition of all
of those mmm interesting that's what I mean by paradox
that's what I mean by strange loop this is not
a mistake this does not mean that we don't know
this means we know but the thing we know is
so radical that your mind can't handle it that's a
very big difference a very important distinction that gets lost
on even many scientists and then we have the ultimate
question which science still hasn't answered why does reality exist
why is there something rather than nothing mmm very good
question but see the typical signs will say Oh Leo
that's a kind of question too philosophical that's a religious
question you can't really answer that question science can't possibly
answer that question or can it or maybe the version
of science that you're using can't answer that question but
a different version of science can hmm maybe it's not
that the question can't be answered maybe that the question
has been answered but that you are not prepared to
understand the answer maybe the answer cannot come to you
in the form of a verbal explanation but rather you
must embody the answer because after all you are involved
in the inquiry deeply involved and so this classical assumption
that well I'm over here and reality is over there
so I can just ask the question well how come
reality exists over there while I'm sitting over here uh-uh
you can't do that quantum mechanics says we're entangled the
questioner is involved with the question at the most fundamental
level so when you ask the question why does reality
exist you ask the question why do I exist and
what am I and what is reality and yes absolutely
there is an answer to that question and absolutely you
can know it but it's gonna require a sacrifice it's
gonna require a sacrifice of the self you will have
to surrender everything you know and everything you hold dear
to embody the answer because as it turns out you
are infinite and for you to realize this infinity and
to realize that infinity must exist because it is every
possibility is to literally face your own death because right
now you are conscious as a finite observer looking at
the world from a perspective and what we're asking you
to do is to collapse your perspective or rather to
take the reverse of the process so you have a
wavefunction you look at it you it at an object
that collapses the wavefunction into a particular thing we're before
was just a cloud of possibilities and now what we're
asking you to do is to run that process in
the reverse which very few people do because it's not
easy we're asking you to go from being this particle
this particular specific thing to disolve uncollapse the wavefunction and
become the cloud of infinite possibility and of course you
know what that means that is otherwise known as physical
death we're asking you to physically die which of course
nobody wants to do which of course is why the
stuff stays a relatively unknown a very important question that
needs to be asked additionally to all this is what
is quantum mechanics itself because C we use quantum mechanics
to describe reality but then quantum mechanics is it sitting
outside of reality or is it part of reality it's
a part of reality so that if we're using quantum
mechanics to describe reality what the hell is quantum mechanics
what are we really explaining this is a question that
very few serious physicists really ask because this gets us
deep into the weeds with epistemology and this gets us
face-to-face with the paradox and the strange loopiness of this
entire investigation but I'll spoil it for you what does
quantum mechanics is a mathematical model it's a thought it's
a thought within consciousness it's important not to confuse quantum
mechanics with the thing that it is describing quantum mechanics
is a map and as we know the map is
not the territory the menu is not the meal quantum
mechanics is the menu not the meal and this is
a big mistake that many modern materialists scientists make including
those that work within quantum mechanics which is rather shameful
and it's rather embarrassing but they make it and I'll
point this out to you in a moment how this
really works now quantum mechanics has many different interpretations and
there has been debate throughout the last hundred years as
to what quantum mechanics really means and there's different schools
and camps scientists break and kind of fight with each
other in two different camps about this some are anti-realists
some are realist some are many world interpretation subscribers and
some think of it as formalism and this and that
so there's different schools and I've looked into all those
and what I would be presented to you here is
not one particular interpretation but something transcendent something that that
goes beyond all these interpretations all these interpretations including all
the interpretations that came from the granddaddy's of quantum mechanics
they are all partial and they all lack the ultimate
understanding because the ultimate understanding must come through actual embodiment
and not just thinking and an interpretation is after all
just a thought a thought process so we're gonna be
presenting some multiple interpretations to you here I'm going to
be reading like a lot of quotes to you now
so I've explained to you what quantum mechanics basically is
in a nutshell how it all works we've set it
all up and now what I want to do is
I want to really drive the point home into your
mind how serious these implications are and the way we're
gonna do that is I'm going to be citing to
you from various professors and academics and the granddaddy's of
quantum mechanics a lot of quotes from them which are
gonna blow your mind and I'm gonna be offering a
lot of commentary to get you to see the stuff
they understood and then also going beyond all that to
the stuff that is transcendent to the stuff that I
really want you to get to to the stuff that
quantum mechanics is pointing at which it can't get to
through its own symbolic methods and now I want to
introduce you to the first physicist who I'll be quoting
extensively and he is a modern physicist so I selected
him in particular because he's a great representative example of
a high quality modern academic who is very deeply subscribed
to the materialist paradigm without realizing that he is and
his name is Sean Carroll he's a research professor at
Caltech he specializes in cosmology dark energy in general relativity
he is written books he has given lectures about quantum
mechanics in fact I highly recommend his lectures if you
want to understand the nuts and bolts of quantum mechanics
in a not overly technical way but still in a
much more technical way that I'm covering here some of
the mathematics and some of the the various experiments and
things like that then he's a very reliable and high
quality source I'm gonna be quoting from his book called
the big picture where he talks a lot about this
stuff I'll be quoting a lot but I'll also be
interjecting with my own commentary here because again I'm not
just interested in saying what other people have said but
taking you to the next level so I actually really
enjoy Sean Carol I think has a good sense of
humor I think he's a he's a very smart guy
I just think that the only problem is is that
he's not taking it to the highest level that you
can take it so let's get some quotes going here
he says quote in quantum mechanics the state of a
system is a superposition of all the possible measurement outcomes
known as the wavefunction of a system the wavefunction is
a combination of every result that you could get by
doing an observation with different weights for each possibility in
principle every possible measurement outcome can be part of the
quantum state and quote so here he is just setting
up the basic theory of quantum mechanics and how it
works we already talked about this so the one additional
wrinkle he's adding here is that there are different weights
to these possibilities so of course it's not equally likely
that everything will precipitate out of this field of infinite
possibility particular things tend to precipitate out at various degrees
of possibility so that's why the equation has a bunch
of variables in and stuff because you're trying to account
for those differences in possibilities and then it's it's that
which you're actually using to then make predictions about the
world because some things become very probable other things become
extremely unlikely from those equations and then how are those
equations created well of course from doing experiments and by
doing all these experiments many many times thousands of times
over you find out what the probabilities are now it's
very important to understand though and this is still my
commentary that it's not that we don't have good enough
tools to measure what's really going on inside and therefore
we're just using statistical analysis that's not what quantum mechanics
is saying quantum mechanics is literally saying that there's nothing
there when you're not looking at it let's continue with
what he writes quote a radical approach is to simply
deny the existence of an underlying reality altogether that's what
I tell you this would be an anti realist approach
to quantum mechanics since it treats the theory as merely
a bookkeeping device for predicting the outcomes of future experiments
if you ask an anti realist what aspect of the
current universe our knowledge is about they will tell you
that that's not a sensible question to ask there is
in this view no underlying stuff that is being described
by quantum mechanics all we are ever allowed to talk
about is the outcomes of experimental measurements so again this
is my commentary now that's right so what he's basically
saying is he's he's saying that the interpretation that Leo
is offering you is an anti realist interpretation of quantum
mechanics and that's correct I am arguing his realism and
I am arguing us materialism of course he's a materialist
and he's a realist so he's not going to accept
this position but we'll get to that in a minute
next he says quote ante realism is a pretty dramatic
step to take it seems to have been advocated by
no less of an authority than Niels Bohr the grandfather
of quantum mechanics his views Bohr's views were described as
and he quotes for now this is Bohr talking there
no quantum world there is only the abstract physical description
it is wrong to think that the task of physics
is to find out how nature is physics concerns what
we can say about nature and quote so Niels Bohr
was an anti realist but Sean Carroll continues quote perhaps
the biggest problem with anti realism is that it's hard
to see how it could be in a position to
hold how it could be a position that one can
hold with perfect consistency it's one thing to say that
our understanding of nature is incomplete it's another thing entirely
to say that there is no such thing as nature
for one thing who is it that is doing the
saying even Bohr in the quote above speaks of what
we can say about nature and that would seem to
imply that there's something called nature about which we can
say these things and quote so here we need some
commentary so here's where he's already going off the rails
here's the problem is that he's sort of positing this
little paradox within Bohr's speaking and he's citing that as
an example of the fact that well that means anti-realism
really can't be true or it's too radical of a
leap to take that's right though it is a radical
leap to take because that's what quantum mechanics is it's
extremely radical when you really understand it so the problem
here isn't really one of there not being enough evidence
for the radicalness rather that it's you don't want to
accept the radicalness because what you're looking for is you're
looking for perfect consistency in being able to symbolize reality
which of course is impossible because reality is a strange
loop so what Sean Carroll is pointing out correctly here
is that the way that Bohr is speaking ultimately leads
to a strange loop yes of course that's not a
bug that's a feature that's precisely what's necessary now Bohr
who I will be quoting extensively a little bit later
in this episode understood this he was a more profound
metaphysical and epistemological thinker cuz he was a visionary scientist
he went way beyond the traditional paradigms that they teach
you in universities he knew how to think outside the
box it has precisely what's necessary when we're talking about
the fundamental nature of reality now Sean Carroll very interesting
Lee he also says for one thing who is it
that's doing the saying precisely who is it that's doing
the quantum mechanics who is it that's being conscious of
reality who is it that's doing the lab experiments precisely
what is that thing that's the ultimate question we're trying
to get at what is that thing and that's something
that he's not conscious of yet because if he was
he wouldn't be taking this materialist position because it would
be utterly untenable so yes what anti-realism is saying is
that there is no such thing as reality there is
no such thing as nature and what quantum mechanics is
is it's a set of symbols or bookkeeping devices that's
exactly what it is that's exactly what mathematics is that's
exactly how science works there's not a problem with that
that is what it is now Sean Carroll goes on
and he says quote fortunately we have not yet exhausted
all our possibilities so now he's going to present a
new possibility to anti-realism this is a different interpretation of
quantum mechanics so he says quote the simplest possibility is
that the quantum wave function isn't a bookkeeping device at
all nor is it one of many kinds of quantum
variables the wavefunction simply represents reality directly the modern quantum
theorists can think of the world as a wavefunction full-stop
now this is patently absurd this is a huge mistake
so let's just take this sentence that the wave function
simply represents reality directly so what this is showing is
a lack of consciousness of what a wave function is
a wave function is a set of symbols to say
that a set of symbols represents reality directly is an
oxymoron it's Peyton Lee absurd because a symbol a symbol
only works through representation that's what a symbol does so
you can't represent reality directly because representation by definition is
indirect every representation isn't the thing that's being represented you
see like if I took a photograph of you that
would be a representation of you and then if I
show that to you I said look this is directly
you know it's not that's a photograph of me or
a photograph of you in that case you would say
you see but what Sean Carroll is doing here because
he doesn't like anti-realism he's not open mind to that
possibility so he wants to maintain materialism so can you
do that yes in theory you can how do you
do that by being blind to what representation is to
what symbolism is and to mistake the mathematics the bookkeeping
device for reality so see what shown here to do
here is he wants to make the bookkeeping device make
his equations actual reality now of course equations are a
part of reality but they are not the reality they
are representing in the same way that a menu at
a restaurant it is real it is a part of
reality but the menu is not the cheeseburger that's depicted
on the menu you see to say that what is
ultimately real is the menu and not the cheeseburger is
absurd and that's exactly what's happening here but let me
quote him some more he says quote but if everything
is just a wavefunction what makes the wavefunction collapse and
why is the act of observation so important aha indeed
that's real tricky for materialists so he says quote resolution
was suggested in 1950s by a young physicist named Hugh
Everett the third he proposed that there was only one
piece of quantum ontology the wavefunction and only one way
that it ever evolves via the Schrodinger equation this means
there is no collapse there is no fundamental division between
system and observer and no special role for observation at
all of course that's what a materialist must do but
if that's right he continues why does it seem to
us the wavefunction collapses when we observe them in classical
mechanics we can think of every different place or piece
of the world as having its own state for example
the earth moving around the Sun with a particular position
velocity and Mars has a position velocity of its own
now quantum mechanics tells a different story there is not
a wavefunction for the earth and another one for this
Vermont for Mars and so on throughout all of space
there is only one wave function for the entire universe
at once and we call it with no hint of
modesty the wave function of the universe a wave function
is simply a number that we assigned to every measurement
outcome so the wave function of the universe assigns a
number to every possible way that objects in the universe
be distributed through space there's one number for the earth
is here and Marge is over there and then another
number for the Earth is here and Mars is somewhere
else and another number for the Earth is at this
place and Mars as yet at some other place Everett
says that we should take the formalism of quantum mechanics
at face value not only is the system you're going
to observe described by a wave function but you yourself
are described by a wave function that means that you
can be in a superposition when you make a measurement
of a particle to see whether it's spinning clockwise or
counterclockwise everett suggests the wave function doesn't collapse into one
possibility or the other it evolves smoothly into an entangled
superposition part of which has the particle is spinning clockwise
and you saw it spinning clockwise and the other part
has that particle spellings been in counter clockwise and you
saw it spinning counterclockwise both parts of the superposition actually
exist and they continue to exist and evolve as the
Schrodinger equation demands so let's pause right there and has
some commentary so you see what he's saying he's saying
that this is basically a multiple universe multiple world interpretation
of quantum mechanics and that's what it's called is he
saying that basically every possibility that can exist does exist
and they all just are sort of superimposed into each
other and then are just sort of like acting them
themselves out without there even being an observer there is
sort of like just being now what do I have
to say about this yes in a sense actually this
is exactly correct in a sense Sean Carroll is perfectly
correct there actually are no observers but not in the
way he thinks what's happening here right now is I'm
standing before you is that there is no observation going
on there is purely being and in fact this particular
collapse of the wave function this particular finite moment that
I'm experiencing or that you're experiencing of me is actually
one infinitesimal piece of absolute infinity absolute infinity is every
single possibility that could ever possibly be so this is
what Sean Carroll is calling the the wave function of
the universe except it's not it's not a set of
symbols it's not an equation this is it you're in
it you are it and yes it is in this
state of superposition and yes there's no observation going on
because there is no observer that's what enlightenment tells you
that's what non duality tells you everything is one all
distinctions collapse and therefore there can be no distinction between
observer and observed the thing you're observing is you which
means that it's being at that point it's no longer
observation so when you become deeply deeply conscious conscious to
the level of enlightenment conscious to the level of absolute
infinity once you become conscious of is that there was
never an observer to begin with and that what's happening
here is not a process of perception but it's a
process of pure being and that might sound like a
word game but let me assure you it's anything but
this is a very radical very deep absolute state of
consciousness it's utterly mind-blowing utterly it completely destroys your understanding
of what reality is but at the same time you
realize there is no such thing as reality because part
of the superposition is that nothing exists you see to
have a true superposition of every single possibility you must
include the possibility of every particle being in every place
we got that part but the part that these quantum
physicists like Sean Carroll because they're materialists are missing is
you're missing the fact that at the same time it
also includes a superposition that negates every single one of
those so while the the ultimate wave function of the
universe includes a particle everywhere it also includes a particle
nowhere so that's why I say that right now I'm
standing here before you but everything that's being experienced here
is nothing it's empty there's nothing here nothing isn't an
empty space or a blank void or a black hole
nothing is precisely everything you've ever experienced in your life
that's a one piece of nothing that's the key mistake
that every physicist and every materialist makes and I made
this mistake for a long time as well because this
is this is only this only becomes clear when you
awaken now he goes on to say quote at last
then we have a candidate for the final answer to
the critical ontological question what is the world really it
is a quantum wave function at least until a better
theory comes along and quote now here is the conclusion
where he is wrong so what is the world really
it's not a quantum wave function the world really is
absolute infinity it is everything and nothing it is a
superposition of every single possibility including the negation of every
possibility it's the ultimate strange loop the ultimate paradox the
ultimate mindfuck your mind cannot understand this because you are
it you can't understand it because it's already you you
need to become it rather than trying to understand it
through an indirect method through symbols so the mistake he's
done here ultimately is he is concluded that his symbols
and equations are the world which is paint Lee absurd
he's confused the the menu for the meal because he's
a theoretician because he's committed to understanding the world rationally
and as far as rationality and theories go he's right
this is the best you can do with theory but
reality is not a theory and the assumption that you
can't go and become reality directly that you can't transcend
your theories that is an incorrect assumption and let's wrap
up here with a few more quotes from him he
says quote while we do not have a finished understanding
of quantum mechanics at a fundamental level there is nothing
we know about it that necessarily invalidates determinism realism the
idea that there is an objective real world or physicalism
the world is purely physical all of these features of
the Newtonian laplacian clockwork universe can easily still hold true
in quantum mechanics but we don't know for sure and
quote so he's carrying on the mistake it's actually not
the case that quantum mechanics is still open to realism
and physicalism quantum mechanics has actually disproven and debunk these
but because he starts with the assumption that realism and
physicalism must be true he carries it in so his
assumption becomes his conclusion now at this point you might
still be wondering well Leo why should I believe your
interpretation over Shawn Carroll's interpretation because he's a physicist he
works at Caltech he wrote this book and you know
isn't he a more reliable source well I'm not gonna
ask you just to believe me I am gonna quote
to you extensively from the actual founders of quantum mechanics
who came before and Sharpe before Sean Carroll and they
will explain to you that actually quantum mechanics completely debunked
realism and physicalism and this idea of a Newtonian laplacian
clockwork universe this is gone this is gone the only
way it survives is as part of your metaphysical dogma
as unseen assumptions about the world which you picked up
as part of your culture or as part of your
institution or part of the culture of academia which you
never questioned and for Sean Carroll you can't blame him
too much because he's a physicist and he does technical
work so for him it's not important to really have
a direct experience of the nature of existence that's sort
of beyond the domain of what the university has carved
out for him his job is to teach to write
books to be a professor to do research make papers
make technical discoveries none of that has anything to do
with what we're really talking about here although what we're
talking about here is extremely important and it's being pointed
to by his work and finally he says quote in
a sense it is the ultimate unification not only does
the deepest layer of reality not consist of things and
mountains it doesn't consist of things like electrons and photons
it's just the quantum wave function and everything else is
a convenient way of talking end quote so again he's
part writing part wrong he's right that this is the
ultimate unification we're unifying everything into one quantum wave function
which is a superposition every single possibility otherwise known as
absolute infinity you don't even need to write an equation
for it just write an infinity symbol that is the
shortest symbolization of what all of reality is you don't
need technical quantum mechanical equations to do that of course
the complaint will be well Leo if I just write
an infinity symbol what can I do with it it's
not very practical I can't go build a supercomputer or
I can't build a smart phone I can't make some
new you know rocket ship technology using your infinity symbol
I need something more concrete something something a little bit
smaller more fine-grained yes precisely do you see that the
endeavor of science to be practical and to make discoveries
that that can enable the creation of technology and the
prediction of certain specific situations in the future that that
is in a sense antithetical to what we're really asking
about when we're asking about what is the nature of
everything these two questions are almost completely at odds because
when we're asking about what is the question of everything
we're asking about the biggest possible picture we shouldn't have
an expectation that the answer to that will be practical
that we can just take it and immediately apply it
to build a rocket ship otherwise we don't want it
know the nature of everything in a sense you might
say well what's so practical about knowing the nature of
everything well in a sense it's not practical but another
sense it's the ultimate practicality because the nature of everything
is what's responsible for there being anything at all which
is what we're interested in the ultimate question why is
there anything at all if there was an absolute infinity
you wouldn't have anything else you wouldn't have science you
wouldn't have math you wouldn't have physics professors you wouldn't
have Caltech you wouldn't have MIT you wouldn't have me
you wouldn't have you there'd be nothing well not really
but that's not possible because see nothing includes everything that's
the paradox of it nothing is unstable you might think
well why isn't there just like a black hole or
just a blank space why is there stuff because think
it through if you just have a blank space the
question then comes up well why would there be a
blank space what would enforce there being a blank space
and not being for example an elephant so then you
you're forced to say okay well there must be an
elephant then too so now we have a blank space
in an elephant okay well what what prevents a kangaroo
okay fine we'll add a kangaroo okay so what prevents
a car okay fine we'll add a car so what
prevents humans okay fine we'll add humans so what prevents
bacteria okay fine we'll add bacteria what prevents aliens okay
fine we'll add aliens what prevents unicorns nothing will add
a unicorn we'll add every [ __ ] thing you
see because nothing is unstable if it stays as a
blank nothing must instantly inflate see this hasn't happen through
time this inflation happens instantly if you imagine that the
universe at the very very beginning was just a blank
slate you've already imagined every possibility because that blank slate
instantly must inflate to include everything else because there's nothing
to enforce the emptiness and yet at the same time
the emptiness doesn't disappear the emptiness permeates through all the
elephants and all the kangaroos and all the people and
all the cars and everything else and the emptiness is
not separate from the elephant the elephant is emptiness the
elephant is what emptiness is but this gets lost on
physicists so in this quote Sean Carroll says that everything
is just a quantum wave function in a sense that's
true but another sense that's false he says that everything
else is just a convenient way of talking so when
we talking about oceans and mountains and elephants and photons
and electrons and protons and all this sorts of stuff
these are just convenient labels and really it's the it's
the equations which are the real deal no the equations
are also convenient labels the real deal is the real
deal there is nothing more real than infinity it's the
only reality there can be there can't be anything outside
of it because it already includes every possibility that could
be outside of it or inside of it so there
you have it I've broken down how modern quantum physicists
think of this stuff and now we need to move
on to the granddaddy's of quantum mechanics and see what
they have to say you
