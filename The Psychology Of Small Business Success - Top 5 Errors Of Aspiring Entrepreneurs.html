hey this is Leo for ashlyn org and in this
episode I'm going to be talking about the psychology of
small business success I'm going to tell you the top
five errors that almost all newbie entrepreneurs make so you
want to start a small business a well that's a
very admirable goal but also challenging to do in practice
let's talk about how to bootstrap a small business and
the many pitfalls that people fall into when they first
try to do it what I'm talking about here is
not how to go work for a large corporation somewhere
and do business in a big corporate environment we have
millions or billions of dollars and the structure has already
been set in place that's basically a form of management
rather than real entrepreneurship real entrepreneurship is creating something from
scratch how do you create a small business that comes
out of nowhere from scratch and is able to generate
money and be self-sustaining and maybe turns into a brand
and all that good stuff right I've watched a lot
of people close to me family members friends girlfriends try
to tinker and toy around with this idea of starting
a business they want to start a blog or a
YouTube channel or maybe a coaching business or a yoga
studio or get into some kind of art or change
the world in some kind of way through business right
they try to do this but then they fail and
I look at them years later and I'm like hey
you know years are passing and nothing is happening why
is it your business taking off and it's interesting to
me because I study psychology I'm fascinated by it is
I just like to look and just see I'm kind
of curious to know what's going on what's the psychology
behind it that's creating the failure or the lack of
success and when I look at them and I talk
to them on I kind of interview them and ask
a couple of questions here and there and I try
to maybe give them some tips immediately I can start
to see why oh yeah quit that's why it's not
working for them because they have no chance they really
have no chance given their psychology the psychology they're bringing
into business is preventing them from ever succeeding like they're
so far off they're not even close they're missing it
by miles not by inches and what's what's really sad
is that they don't even understand what's going on and
it's difficult to teach it to them right so that's
what I want to do in this episode is to
to get at the root of that just in case
you're in that situation and if you're new to business
if this is the first time you've ever started a
business then all of this will apply to you many
many times over on a big-picture level what I want
you to understand is that business is psychologically very tricky
it's very counterintuitive if you as just a kind of
a normal person who's just worked a regular job your
whole life decides to come up with a business idea
one day and then to actually get that business idea
off the ground and flying and actually working and generating
some cash flow you come into it with all these
ideas these naive ideas about how business is supposed to
work and very rudely you're awakened to the fact that
many many many of your ideas are just flat-out wrong
and will never ever work because what's intuitive to you
is not what actually works in the marketplace so let's
talk about these errors one by one I'll give you
the five errors as we go forward so error number
one and this is perhaps the most practical reason why
people fail at business is because you're not practical enough
about the marketplace realities that's your problem when you first
come up with a business idea you're pie-in-the-sky and most
business people who are new they stay pie-in-the-sky forever and
of course that can't work they're not quality quantity of
enough right it's like they're not looking out for the
dollars and cents and they're not looking out for how
this idea will actually work in the marketplace how it
will sell who will buy it how much they will
pay for it will anyone even want it way too
little attention is paid on those very mundane boring details
of business all the all the person's energy because they're
excited by this business idea they have what they commit
is they commit this mistake of what I call placing
all your hope on the dream product or the dream
service or the dream invention or the dream project that
you have right like you've got this brilliant idea for
something that will sell well or something that people would
love to purchase or some service that would really be
helpful to people out there in some segments of society
right that's like your dream product so you put all
your attention to that thinking that all you know if
I just develop my dream product that's it that's what's
necessary for me to succeed in business but that's that's
the least of your concerns developing your product is the
least of your concerns you're paying way too little attention
to sales and marketing sales and marketing is like 90%
of business the hardest part of business is not creating
your dream product it's marketing it and acquiring clients that's
the hardest part of business and newbies totally ignore this
part because this part is kind of boring this part
is kind of like the stuff that you would maybe
want to give out to an accountant to do for
you but this is the stuff you got to really
worry about this is the hardest business the heart of
business is getting eyeballs not your product it's getting eyeballs
for your product you could have a mediocre product but
if you have eyeballs that will be enough to make
your business stay afloat you could have a amazing dream
product but if you don't have the eyeballs it's not
going to do you much good so what's necessary is
for you to develop a strategy for getting eyeballs for
your dream product and that strategy can't be some pie-in-the-sky
strategy it has to be a realistic like hyper hyper
practice strategy it has to actually work people have to
actually be willing within this strategy to ultimately pull out
their wallet and hand you some cold hard cash or
write you a check or swipe their credit card and
if you know how resistant you yourself are to doing
that then you can appreciate how your customers and your
clients will be equally skeptical and resistant to doing that
you have to have a strategy that will first of
all get them to even notice you because the marketplace
is a very crowded place there's a lot of competitors
there's a lot of advertising there's a lot of products
you know there's there's millions of products these days and
they're all very cheap and they're all generally pretty good
these days so uh how do you get noticed that's
your number one problem when you're bootstrapping something like a
business but then even after you get noticed still then
there's the problem okay so you have to take the
eyeballs now convert them into cold hard cash as a
secondary problem still a big problem because you can get
a lot of eyeballs but then uh you know what
do you how do you going to convert those you
have to have a very very practical strategy and this
strategy is not something you dream up this is something
you have to test and this is where again a
lot of newbies go wrong is that they do not
test the engine the heart of their business the cash
flow they don't test that there's kind of like what
I call the cash flow engine within the business it's
like the beating heart of an organism right it pumps
blood through the whole thing and if that heart stops
beating the engine it dies you're not going anywhere everything
comes to a screeching halt so this cash flow engine
this is a very practical thing and this is something
that you have to discover through actual testing and implementation
and experimentation and usually what happens is that the the
way that a newbie goes bankrupt in businesses like this
he has a brilliant idea he works on it for
a couple of years he really develops it then he
goes out he puts it out there into the marketplace
and what he gets is just the chirping of crickets
there's no eyeballs there's one or two eyeballs those eyeballs
are impossible to convert into cold hard cash there's no
cash flow he didn't test his engine he put all
his attention into the dream idea didn't test the cash
flow engine and uh usually that's where the whole project
ends but for some tenacious people they're not willing to
you know to stop there so what they do is
they they keep going they iterate they start to look
for what the cash flow engine might be and they
start to test different cash flow engine ideas until ultimately
they stumble upon one that actually works in practice what
you'll discover is that the first idea you have for
how you're actually going to generate cash flow within your
specific niche in the marketplace is not going to work
it's not going to pan out you're going to actually
put it out there and you're going to see that
it's just like it's not practical people aren't going to
go for it and at that point you have to
you have to be flexible enough to change and to
look for a cash flow model that actually does work
and that's where most people go wrong if you're smart
you're gonna you're going to test your cash flow model
very early on in your business endeavors you're not going
to wait a couple of years to create your dream
product test your business model early early early early early
early get a proof of concept of your cash flow
and when you got a little bit of proof of
concept then start building on top of that all right
so let's go on an error number two all of
that was error number one just lack of practicality about
marketing and about sales so now error number two is
that you're not experimental enough to be successful business you
have to be creative and highly clever and what I
mean here is not the artistic form of creativity what
I mean here is like the very clever strategic form
of creativity it's the kind of creativity that's required when
you and your men are on the battlefield and you
are the general on this battlefield and you're going to
war with a neighboring army and when you lose you
die and you're outnumbered ten to one and what do
you do in this situation you have a battle on
your hand you can't run away they'll just chase you
down they outnumber you 10 to 1 how do you
win well believe it or not it's possible it is
possible to win if you're a very clever and creative
military strategist you will devise a way to win even
when you're outnumbered 10 to 1 that's possible that's been
done in history you can go read the history books
well that's the kind of cleverness that I'm talking about
here that's what's required in business because when you sit
down and you start to think about ok what kind
of product or service could I create that's going to
help people that are going to want to pay me
money for your mind has to then be extremely creative
in the solutions that it comes up with to the
practical obstacles that will be in your way there's always
practical obstacles to selling stuff to getting people to pay
you to get people interested in looking at your product
to get them excited about purchasing your product and so
forth right there's just very very practical obstacles so your
mind has to be very persistent in its cleverness because
what's going to happen you're going to try one solution
it's not going to work you're going to try another
solution it's not going to work you're going to try
the third one it's not going to work you're going
to need to try dozens of solutions most likely before
you stumble upon one that will work and what this
requires is this requires something called requisite variety requisite variety
this is a very powerful concept from cybernetics and I'm
not going to be able to do a justice here
that'll have to require a whole episode on its own
but in a nutshell what requisite variety means is that
when you have a cybernetic organism which is just basically
a self-regulating organism that's what cybernetics is it's the study
of self-regulating systems so when you have a highly complex
self-regulating system such as you a human being human mind
for that system to succeed in coping with a significant
challenge it has to have more requisite variety than the
challenge that's presented to it so what that really means
is that you have to be more clever and more
flexible and more adaptable than your problems and this is
so true in business right because what you're going to
face you're going to be problem after problem after problem
after problem and some of the problems you face are
going to be very clever problems not clever in the
human sense where you know a human can be clever
because we can sit there we can think of stuff
so your problem is doesn't have human consciousness it's not
actually clever but it's clever in the sense that it
it requires a clever solution what most people do is
they don't have enough requisite variety they don't have like
a bag of tricks right they usually come in and
they've got like one or two tricks whereas what's required
for the solution because you're facing a challenge that's very
complex and it's very nuanced and you come in there
with just like a couple of tools right you need
a lot more tools a lot more requisite variety a
lot more cleverness in order to solve this nuanced challenge
that will be facing you right what does this mean
well it means like you know if I want to
start a new car company I would face all sorts
of practical obstacles how would I get the financing how
would I compete in an already crowded marketplace what about
government regulation what about environmental laws what about you know
all these sorts of problems would come up and I
would need to be clever enough and flexible enough in
my approach to dealing with every one of these very
nuanced Black's subtle challenges in an even more nuanced in
an even more flexible way right you need to have
more nuance than your problems and most people their thinking
is so black and white and their their bag of
tricks is so small that they exhaust their little bag
of tricks very quickly and what happens is that your
challenges end up outsmarting you you see you need to
be smarter than the challenges fundamentally what this means with
your specific business idea is that you need to find
a unique angle into a niche within your marketplace what
is going to be your unique angle that's different from
all the other businesses out there what's going to be
your leverage point your point of power what's going to
be the the thing that you're using to generate power
because business is about power right money power visibility in
the marketplace these are all sort of synonymous with in
business so what's going to be your unique leverage point
there is it going to be because your product is
the most cheapest is it going to be because your
product is the highest quality is it going to be
because your product offers some unique clever patented feature that
nobody else has is it going to be because you're
first to the marketplace in a in a totally new
market place where there are no alternatives yet or maybe
it's going to be a combination of these or maybe
it's going to be something else I haven't even mentioned
yet right but you got to find that unique leverage
point maybe it's going to be the personality that you
bring to the business maybe it's going to be your
unique point of view on life or your unique life
experience that you bring to the business like for example
with actualize that or one of my one of my
leverage points is that I bring my personality into it
right so it's me there's a lot of people doing
self-help advice a lot of them are way more successful
than me have way more money than me and you
have more knowledge than me and so you know how
do I compete in that well it's the style that
I bring the style is something that is very difficult
for other people to copy because if they copied my
style first of all it would be kind of like
being second to the party second of all it wouldn't
be true and authentic to them so they couldn't sustain
it right so my style now my style there's nothing
super special about my style my style will resonate with
some of you and then with others it won't resonate
at all right but those that it does resonate with
then it works right so my style and I try
to actually I try to strategize about that doesn't just
happen by chance like I really think about the style
what are the things that define my style and my
brand of self-improvement advice right there's something there and it
takes years to think about it and to articulate it
it's not easy to articulate this is very subtle stuff
so this is just kind of an example I'm giving
you for my life but anyways uh you gotta you
got to find your unique leverage point and then you
got to discover that cashflow engine what's going to be
the actual mechanism by which cash flow is generated so
that you have enough funds to then propel and perpetuate
all the business activities are going to be doing in
the years to come you gotta see business as like
a research project or as evolution so when like serious
scientists do research or if you think about how evolution
works how natural selection works what you see in that
process is that there's a lot of trial and error
going on a lot of trial and error and a
lot of failure and that's what's going to be happening
with you when you are going through this evolution process
or this research process to develop your cash flow engine
and your business right so you have to have a
high tolerance for failure and you always have to keep
in mind that all you require is just one success
you don't need a million successes you just need one
so as you're going out there and you're applying requisite
variety and you're trying all this different stuff out the
process of trial and error is happening and you're just
looking for that one thing that actually clicks and it
works and then when you find that then you stick
to it you focus on it you don't deviate you
don't let yourself get distracted and then you bring that
home and you start to earn money off of it
all right so let's move on to error number three
error number three is not taking enough action not taking
in a fashion this is a very simple error but
it's very deadly and this is what I see in
most of the people that I know who have trying
to start businesses like friends and family members and stuff
is that they're just not taking enough action their pace
is way too slow they have some kind of idea
but then they're not like really going to work on
that idea the next morning the idea just kind of
floats around to the back of their minds like oh
yeah I'd like to start this kind of business or
wouldn't it be cool if I could just kind of
like work for myself and be self-employed and that you
know it's like these very very loosey-goosey type of ideas
very successful people have something called a rapid speed of
implementation that means when they get an idea they go
to work implementing that idea very quickly they don't sit
around and wait oh wait four weeks or four months
or four years to go by they get to work
they get to work immediately when I had the first
idea um to start my original business not actualize that
are before that my internet marketing business that business I
had the idea and I was like online already starting
to look and research and already starting to like implement
stuff that same day it didn't take five years for
it to get off the ground it took like I
mean I was I was already experimenting with stuff like
it was funny like within five weeks I had stuff
you know I had tangible stuff to show I was
already testing I was already testing for cash flow and
within five months the business was already earning enough money
for me to to quit my job five months five
months most people I know if I asked them hey
you know what are you doing they're like oh yeah
I'm working on my business I come back to the
five months later I'm like hey what are you doing
oh I'm still working on that business plan business plan
for five months you're working on [ __ ] business
plan this is ridiculous in five months you should already
have implemented everything and tried out ten different two business
plans and you should be able to tell me which
one of those generates money and which one doesn't you're
way too slow that's because you've made a half-hearted commitment
you're not really serious and you really lack focus this
is not a life and death situation for you for
me when I started my first business it was a
life and death situation I mean not not literally I
was fine I wasn't like bankrupt I didn't need the
money to pay my mortgage or else I was going
to kicked out get kicked out or anything it wasn't
like that but in my mind it was it felt
like a life and death situation was very serious in
my mind because I thought like if I don't get
this right if I don't create this business that means
all of my dreams everything I want for my life
all of that is going down the toilet that's literally
how I was thinking so for me it was uh
haha it was like I was extremely motivated it was
like there was no option to fail there was no
opt no possible option there was like nothing I was
willing to do that wouldn't uh that would have just
like been too much I was willing to do anything
anything to make it work and I I had some
very crazy ideas at the time right very crazy ideas
and um man I'm kind of surprised that it that
it worked but anyways I'm also kind of not surprised
because I had that kind of like full commitment it
wasn't any weak half-hearted ask commitment the way that most
people have it right so you start implementing taking action
action action action action business is super practical super practical
every single day you need to be working and testing
your business model every single day something practical not just
sitting around and daydreaming error number four is lack of
self governance lack of self governance well this really goes
to the core of the issue with why most people
cannot do business it's not because they're not clever they're
not smarter they don't have the money or the education
it's simply because they are incapable of motivating themselves over
the long term this is a very difficult thing do
not underestimate how emotionally difficult it is to keep yourself
motivated on a project with single-minded focus over the course
of months and years this is extremely difficult 99% of
people are incapable of doing this and this is why
they work in boring 95 jobs because they are incapable
of this you're incapable of working consistently and you're incapable
of dealing with the emotions that come with self-governance when
you are working on a project of your own design
with nobody there at the beginning right there's no employees
there's no business partners nobody it's just you it's just
you and your idea and how do I get this
idea lifted off the ground Wow all sorts of emotions
will come up yes it's practical there's all these practical
steps you have to do but also it's very emotional
you have to deal with some very harsh truths as
an entrepreneur and a lot of these truths when you
first stumble upon them they will be so harsh that
they will demoralize you you will literally be demoralized out
of business this is what happens and you have to
be very vigilant and you have to be very persistent
to make it past that what are some harsh truths
you might face as an entrepreneur well the first one
is going to be that a good product is not
good enough you want to have an amazing product and
still doesn't sell that can totally crush your hopes and
dreams another thing that might demoralize you is this harsh
truth that some products are simply not marketable you might
have a dream product a brilliant invention but it's just
not marketable because it costs too much to produce or
because the timings not right or because whatever you know
just because of some little niggly practical thing this brilliant
idea you have that you're really attached to that you
really love that's been so exciting for him and so
motivating for you now that gets cut from under your
feet can you still keep going or you're going to
be so demotivated and demoralized that you go back to
your nine-to-five job another very harsh truth of business is
that competition is very fierce it's fierce fierce out there
it's a real jungle and your competitors will sometimes do
nasty things to you that can be tough to swallow
because it's almost like you know business in a sense
is is is can be a zero-sum game to a
certain extent not totally but it is from a certain
perspective it can be because sometimes you're fighting for like
a position in the marketplace and so are a thousand
or a million other people and only a handful of
you can win that position not everyone gets to be
number one and not everyone gets to be number ten
even so if number one through ten make all the
money in the in the business and everybody else doesn't
that means you're you're fighting for ten ten slots and
if there's ten thousand people fighting for ten slots there's
gonna be a lot of disappointed people and your chances
of being one of them are very high so that's
what I mean by competition being fierce you know that's
worse in some businesses that another's depends on what your
marketplace is another very harsh truth is that you have
to be willing to kill your babies as it's called
which means that a lot of times you know we
the reason we get into business ideally is not for
making money it's for turning our ideas into reality or
transforming the world so if that's the reason you got
into business and you have this brilliant idea for how
to transform the world or how to really you know
change the nature of technology or change the nature of
humanity or something like that you have this brilliant idea
and then you have to say no if to say
no that's not going to work that's not practical it's
not realistic or I can't do that yet I don't
have the experience yet maybe in 10 years maybe in
20 years I can do that but not now and
you got to set that aside and that can be
very emotionally difficult because this is the whole reason you
got into business I mean if you set this aside
why am i doing business in the first place you
might say and that's something you're gonna have to work
through right all these emotional blocks you have to work
through because there's no way you're going to do business
for any extended period of time and not face any
of these issues that I'm talking about right here right
this is going to be recurring stuff these are these
are themes and business that keep coming up psychological themes
another psychological theme speaking of which is being lonely starting
a business is very lonely it's very isolating because you're
sitting there is just you and your ideas your ideas
are so vague and abstract at first that you can't
even articulate them to yourself yet let alone other people
so you can't convince others yet to help you because
it's just you and your vague ideas you got to
clarify and develop and build a whole foundation before you
can bring people along right so it's just basically you
you're sitting there it's lonely nobody understands you your wife
doesn't understand you your husband does understand you your boyfriend
or girlfriend they don't understand you your children understand you
almost nobody does right because you're just sitting there you're
you're spending long hours late into the night thinking about
this calculating the numbers thinking about practical problems and strategies
and being creative and all this and it's just you
you and you you and your thoughts you and your
monkey mind you and all your doubts you and all
your fears you and all your worries about money and
about mmm looking stupid and about failure and about ah
the how difficult it's going to be in all this
to all these fears all your inner demons they will
all come leaking out of your mind and how well
will you be able to cope with that most people
can't can be very challenging so uh what you will
discover if you start to be a entrepreneur is that
self-governance is very central to success in entrepreneurship and that
self governance is very hard it's a lot harder than
you thought which is one of the reasons that CEOs
and top level executives and managers get paid the big
bucks right sometimes we look at a CEO or some
manager we say oh you know that guy he doesn't
do the hard manual labor that's someone you know digging
a ditch would do he's not working outside he's not
getting dirty you know he just sitting in the corporate
boardroom he's not really doing anything well from a certain
perspective that's true and those guys get you know totally
overpaid and and so there's some truth to what you're
what you're thinking there but also what you might be
failing to see is how challenging it is to be
at the top where nobody governs you but yourself where
you're accountable to almost nobody but yourself now that's also
not totally true because if you're if you're a CEO
and a you know in a big company that's a
public company you've got a lot of accountability but still
fundamentally the reason you get paid the big bucks because
a much higher degree of self governance is required to
be a CEO of a fortune 500 company then is
required to do the nine-to-five crappy job that you do
even if your job involves lots of physical manual labor
and it's very exhausting and challenging that's still easier than
the emotional labor that this CEO has to do right
it's not manual labor that's the standard it's emotional labor
and while you might be great at manual labor you
might be great at technical labor you might even be
a brilliantly creative artistically creative person and so you might
think well Leo because I have these skills I should
get paid a lot but actually the question boils down
to are you able to govern yourself and are you
able to withstand emotional labor are you a good emotional
labor and if you are then you will rise all
the way to the top and if you're not then
you will stay stuck and frustrated at the bottom or
somewhere in the middle for the rest of your life
and this is not a fixed quality right self governance
is developable and emotional labor is also something you can
develop this is the ability to cope with it to
manage it to kind of maneuver around it in fact
you found one of the greatest sources for that right
here actualized org is gear everything I talk about is
all geared towards developing more self governance and showing you
how to how to deal with massive doses of emotional
labor that you would never ever ever be able to
grapple with on your own right so if you're trying
to develop self governance and you lack it right now
and you have some big ideas for business and you
see that you need more self governance well that's something
you can cultivate so just stay with me and you'll
cultivate more and more of that let me give you
an example of a really harsh truth about business this
is something I love to philosophize sometimes I can go
into very deep territory in my own mind when I
start to think about like what is business really you
know what's going on in business why is it so
challenging uh and one thing I realized lately is that
uh I was just thinking like what does business on
a high level like what is business ultimately and I
started thinking back towards you know history and thousands of
years ago in civilization and evolution of thinking about all
this stuff and I and I look at it and
from a very very big picture point of view what
I realize is that business is basically a toned-down form
of rape and pillage that's what it is so if
you think back a hundred thousand years ago or ten
thousand years ago before the advent of civilizations and agriculture
what do we have we had like little tribes of
people a hundred two hundred five hundred people you know
living just around the land they would move around they
would scavenge and they would hunt some pack animals like
like deer or like buffalo or something like that and
maybe they would harvest some berries here and there maybe
they would grow one or two crops like it was
very very low-tech and so that's how you survived there
was no business there was no corporate structures but then
what happened one tribe got the bright idea that hey
wouldn't it be easier to go over there and we
could murder and pillage the neighboring tribe that means we
don't have to work to do all the hard manual
labor of you know finding food and growing it and
harvesting it and preparing it we can just steal and
take everything that they have over there all we need
is more power more force let's see do we have
more force if we don't let's go gather enough force
that we can do it right um and so this
was this is a part of evolution right so haha
this is a more advanced way of survival also more
ruthless more bloody way of survival but anyway so this
tribe gets enough power and it goes and it conquers
that tribe over there then they have even more power
and they go conquer the other tribe and they get
even more power and they conquer the other tribe and
they just do that and they do that back and
forth for thousands of years and that's what early human
civilization was all about it was about this and what
if you take a look at how civilization has been
developing and evolving over the last couple thousand years what
you clearly see is that we're arising out of this
kind of like very dark very brutal very bloody to
a more tame version of that more and more tame
basically in order to create a civilization kind of a
peaceful civilization we need to move away from this sort
of brutal istic just conquering and dominating our neighbors um
but not totally we don't want to totally move away
from that because we're selfish and because we want an
easy form of survival we don't to work hard so
we kind of move away from it but also we
don't fully move away from it and so where we
are right now in business is that current business you
got to realize that it's a substitute for murdering and
raping each other that's really what it is and it's
held in place by these various forces and institutions and
rules that have been developed over the last couple thousand
years you know uh the Constitution legal codes moral codes
the various military powers came into play so all of
these forces came into play and basically they've contained rape
and pillage into a more manageable form so that it's
not as outrageous and house bloody and ruthless and like
horrific as it was a hundred thousand years ago so
it's been contained right it's being contained and it's kind
of being sugar-coated and it's being made kind of like
we're kind of rounding out the edges so that it's
kind of like nice and cute and not too harmful
but it's still pretty harmful it's still pretty harmful and
um that's not something that I hold against it that's
just part of the evolutionary process in fact if you
take a look at what business is now how we
survive today because today we survive through business we don't
survive by killing neighboring tribes right we survive mostly through
business that's why government what is government mostly care about
economy the economy it's the economy stupid that's what presidents
that's what congressmen mostly spend their time worrying about how
do you make sure that people are economically satisfied because
if they're not they're going to kick you out of
office right white why because economics is directly tied to
your survival that's how you survive in the modern era
right but we haven't we've totally forgot because we're we're
so disconnected from history we've totally forgot that just ten
thousand years ago if you were living you know your
survival would have been a life and death thing and
there were no institutions there were no benevolent military powers
there was not the UN there were no treaties they
were nor there were there were no sovereign borders there
no nations or countries you know there were no judges
there was no Constitution there was no law there was
nothing it was complete anarchy so you know what whoever
had the power set the rules but over time see
we've been evolving so the survival process over time it's
kind of becoming a nicer you might say nicer and
nicer and nicer but it hasn't reached its final point
maybe in 10,000 years it'll be very nice and we
won't really harm people but the reality is that today
in business a lot of businesses do a lot of
harm but still put that into perspective and it's a
lot less harm than would have been done 10,000 years
ago where they would have just come and wiped out
your entire city so why am I talking about all
this well because it puts things in a little bit
of perspective for you so that when you get inside
of a marketplace and you're like hey I have this
brilliant idea for how to transform the world and you
know I'm a dreamer and have these great dreams well
understand what you're entering into you're entering the [ __
] jungle 10,000 years ago you and your family and
maybe your entire village and maybe your entire city would
have been burned and [ __ ] raped as corpses
right that's what you're that's the environment that you're really
entering into except now it's been really pacified and it's
been kind of nice if I'd buy a lot of
rules and you know thousands of years of bloodshed have
now led to something that's a little bit more civilized
but still not totally civilized so ah think about now
the effort you got to put into it you got
to treat this with a lot more respect and seriousness
than you currently do because if you just think you're
entering business just all yeah I'm just going to start
a business how the [ __ ] are you going
to be competitive when you've got some [ __ ]
out there who are like dictators right they are running
their business like a [ __ ] dictatorship and they
are willing to slit every throat on their path to
materialistic success how are you going to compete those people
your little pie-in-the-sky ideas aren't gonna be no match for
that no match right you have to be extremely pragmatic
in how you deal with some of these larger forces
that are out there right and you got to really
be serious if you want your ideas to become reality
and to not just remain fantasies for the year for
the rest of your life you got to be very
serious and very practical you got to get very sober
about how you go about thinking these ideas up and
the actions and the preparations you make for realizing them
right you got to be very very serious about this
because there's people out there for whom business is life
and death life and death even now even today go
look at a third-world country there are many third world
countries nowadays where um you know they have access to
the Internet they have access to cell phones but still
for many of them uh their job or having a
business is life and death it's not like it is
for you if you're living in some cushy first world
country where it's like yeah you know if I don't
succeed at this business then that just means that I
get to go back to my cushy old job it's
not like that for millions of people for millions of
people for them to create a business that means the
difference between their family being alive and dying so think
about how much more motivated those those people are than
you you know if some guy is barely keeping his
family and his children alive in some third-world country think
about how hard he's willing to work to start a
business you have to be willing to work just as
hard as he is it has to be that serious
for you so I'm not trying to be overly negative
I know this sounds kind of pessimistic but I'm trying
to just um give you a dose of sober reality
because I think the number one problem with new entrepreneurs
is they're way too starry-eyed way too naive about how
these things work and that's why they ultimately fail so
those are the four main errors there's one more that
I will give you but first what I want to
do is I want to give you the action steps
what are the action steps for avoiding these errors and
for starting a successful business well here they are in
outline firstly do tons of research learn your marketplace become
a master of your marketplace not in the sense that
you're a master of it financially or that you have
the best business in that marketplace I mean intellectually learn
everything there is to know about your customers your clients
custom I mean your competitors customers how they think what
they want what their problems are really research that right
become totally engrossed in it so that you know your
market place better than anybody else even if there's a
company out there who's doing way more business than you
how do you beat them by learning more about the
marketplace than them because I guarantee you that chances are
that they probably are not as serious as you could
be about learning about the marketplace because their focuses money
not learning your focus should be learning and research the
next action step is test test test test out any
idea that you have in some little baby form right
if you have some big idea that's going to take
five years to create test it out in one week
somehow how can you test it out in a week
get a little proof-of-concept going test test test test a
lot of different possibilities when you first start you want
to go kind of broad then you can hone down
and narrow it down towards something that actually works once
you find something that works but when you first start
instead of starting with just one idea be very open
to a whole range of ideas that might work in
the marketplace that'll get you a lot better chances of
success the next tip I'll give you is look for
things that have practical value to people not just your
dream idea because your dream idea might not be practical
to anybody but you you might fall in love with
it doesn't mean that people want to look at it
or buy it look for the actual problems that people
have in their lives and then use that as a
seed for new idea that you have you need to
treat your ideas in a very disposable manner don't cling
to any one idea as an entrepreneur you should be
having hundreds thousands of ideas so your first idea is
not the one you should be going with you should
be very open at first too many ideas hundreds ideas
filter through those then through a process of trial and
error discover which idea actually makes practical sense and has
a a match or a fit with some of the
needs that people have in the marketplace now you're on
to something that's more practical another tip I'll give you
is prove at least one Marketing Avenue so remember that
point I made about how you need to have a
strategy for getting eyeballs well prove it come up with
one strategy for getting eyeballs and actually prove that it
that it gets eyeballs and see how many eyeballs can
it get you and then take a look is that
enough is that good enough to start of course you
can make it better but can you even get two
or three eyeballs looking at your product looking at your
service and if you can't go back to the drawing
board and keep looking you know rely on requisite variety
to keep looking and looking and looking until you can
find that Marketing Avenue the marketing Avenue is even more
important than your product next tip is to prove your
cash flow generate at least one or two sales can
you do that can you generate a sale that's a
a huge proof-of-concept right there if you can generate one
sale that means you've proven something is possible most people
in business they're never even able to generate a single
sale and that's why they fail because they weren't planning
and trying to generate a sale they were just dreaming
[ __ ] up and they were working on your
dreams but that had nothing to do with cashflow so
prove that and the last action step I'll give you
is work on cultivating self governance and start taking self
governance very very seriously start taking the psychology of business
very seriously start taking your emotions very seriously because I
guarantee you the biggest thing holding you back from success
in business is not money it's not opportunities it's not
a the economy it's not this stuff it's actually your
own emotions that's the biggest thing holding you back and
this action step is actually the easiest for you to
follow through on because you're already here you're already on
actualize that or just stick with me and you'll learn
a lot more about self governance take action on the
various things that I talk about that have nothing to
do with business right I talk about awareness I talk
about conscience I talk about meditation I talk about counterintuitive
topics I talk about some very deep philosophical topics take
these very seriously because they all have to do with
self-governance they all have to do with mastering your own
mind and when you master your own mind and your
own emotions then everything is open to you all possibilities
become easy for you right it's like man you can
go do and achieve whatever you want at that point
and until you have self-governance and until you understand how
your mind works it's like you're trying to to fight
with with both your arms tied behind your back you're
at a very significant disadvantage so don't treat some of
the abstract philosophical stuff that I talked about as just
you know Leo's going off into the deep end you
know now here comes his New Age a spiritual talk
has nothing to do with me starting a business hahaha
yeah that's something you will at one point in your
life you will come to understand why I talk about
these deeper things ah and now let me give you
the final error the fifth error that entrepreneurs make and
this is a very advanced trap even the successful entrepreneurs
the people who have gone through and have done everything
I've talked about so far and they've aced that part
and they've you created a really successful businesses generally lots
of money you think okay so they made it they
did it that's it what's what's left but I guarantee
you that 99% of those people the very successful ones
they fall into the following trap because it's a very
advanced trap and this is getting lost in materialism and
success it's running a business without consciousness it's running a
business without awareness creating a successful business by which I
just mean it generates cash flow that's how I define
business success um that's not the real challenge that's actually
relatively easy the real challenge is how do you stay
very practical and pragmatic and quantitative that kind of business
mindset how do you have that without losing your soul
how do you have success in business but have a
business that has a soul and isn't just a money-making
machine but something with a soul how do you create
a responsible business not just any business not just a
profitable business but a visionary business a business that is
a leader the business that shows the world what's possible
in business a business that takes this evolutionary process this
bloody process that has been going on now for for
thousands of years and refines it and carries it forward
doesn't continue that vile unconscious bloodshed but takes it up
a nut another notch in terms of consciousness how do
you do that and the great secret there is to
to really believe in your cause when you start a
business you can't just start a business like oh yeah
you know I think that product right there would earning
a lot of money I'll just go do that or
it's like oh you know my dad you know my
dad was in the in this kind of business so
you know I'll just go and do that business to
know the purpose of business is not to make money
the purpose of business is to promote a cause and
to improve the world to raise awareness in the world
that is the point of business all business I'm not
just talking about my business I'm talking about all business
there's a lot of different ways in which a rate
awareness can be raised it could be done through technology
could be done through manufacturing could be done through education
could be done through advice giving could you know there's
so many ways there's so many ways and the businesses
that will survive in the long term are the ones
that are going to be conscious businesses unconscious businesses will
not survive in the 21st century there's a turning point
now the 20th century was the century of kind of
unconscious business not anymore it really makes a difference whether
your business is a visionary leadership business or it's just
kind of like oh yeah I'm just making some money
it makes a huge difference it makes a huge difference
to the community to the environment but also it makes
a huge difference to you personally because the kind of
joy and pleasure that you imagine you will get from
a very successful rich business that just completely pales in
comparison to the kind of joy you will get when
you have a sustainable business that also actually helps to
improve the world in a way that is meaningful to
you those two are in totally different leagues totally different
leagues and in fact if you just start a business
and all it does is focuses on maximal success and
profitability and you ignore this element of consciousness and improving
the world and being a visionary if you ignore that
you will actually become more depressed and more unfulfilled after
your business succeeds than you ever were in your life
now that's counterintuitive and this trap right here man I
could name names of extremely successful people who fall into
this trap very intelligent people fall into this trap because
the thing that's the key here to avoiding this trap
is not smarts and it's not practicality it's uh it's
awareness and you know what I say you know how
I say that thinking is not awareness thinking is different
than awareness and awareness is something that needs to be
cultivated and many very successful business people even though they're
smart and they're successful they lack awareness they don't think
it's important they've discounted it they've forgotten about it they
fall into this trap it's the trap of materialism and
success it's the trap of spiral dynamics stage orange that's
the trap and that's the kind of culture were in
these days modern 21st century culture is staged orange which
means materialism at all costs except the costs of materialism
ultimately becomes too high they become too high for you
to bear individually and they become too high for us
to bear collectively so we are at a very interesting
point in human civilization it's a very interesting time to
be alive we're not really sure where it's going to
go might go to hell in a handbasket or it
might go to very great places and it might hinge
it just very might well hinge on what you decide
to do right here what kind of business you decide
to start the first business that I started was not
a visionary business it was not a cause I believed
in but anyone it was successful successful earn money ah
could have kept doing it could have kept being very
comfortable you know could have lived for a long time
being very comfortable on that business but uh a few
years in pretty early in I saw I saw this
problem right I saw this I had enough awareness to
see the problem and so I immediately made plans for
how to exit that business and how to create my
visionary business and that's what actually I thought or use
for me and every day every day I wake up
I think about am i falling into this trap with
actualize that or because even Lashley Assad or Giza is
a whole magnet order of magnitude better than what I
had before still there's potential for traps here I'd be
very very vigilant about it because this is an advance
trap this is a trap of awareness and I'm conscious
of how little awareness I have when it comes to
these things so that means that I have to be
extra aware how do you raise awareness well by noticing
you don't have any at first right and then you
kind of maybe step it from there what's really challenging
in business is balancing the pragmatism that's required to create
a successful living breathing business that can sustain itself but
also the idealism and the higher consciousness combining those together
and balancing that out that is extremely rare extremely rare
and if you can do that you will have a
level of success and fulfillment in your life that is
extraordinary because your business will be tied with growth with
expansion with evolution right and you will be um you
will be sort of at the forefront rather than at
the back right cuz you might say well Leo what's
wrong with just having a business that just earns lots
of money well it works for now but that's not
going to work for very long because ultimately on the
very very big picture scale what's happening is that consciousness
is growing and it's developing not just in individual humans
but collectively as a civilization is happening so the [
__ ] that businesses do in the 21st century is
simply going to be impossible in a 22nd century and
in the twenty third it's going to be impossible because
all of civilization will have moved on and the [
__ ] that you're trying to do now is probably
[ __ ] that's been done like in the 19th
and 20th centuries and we're already in the 21st right
so you're already you're like the dodo bird you're like
the [ __ ] dodo bird and you're saying well
Leo why can't I just say a little stupid dodo
bird because you're a stupid [ __ ] dodo bird
you have no consciousness so evolution killed you if you
want to stay alive if you want your organization to
thrive you need to develop consciousness that's what makes organisms
thrive consciousness right stupidity and mechanical nough switch is the
opposite of awareness is really mechanical 'no snow more room
for that no more room for it and it's also
deeply unsatisfying to you as a human being cuz no
matter how mechanical you behave within you there's always still
a core that conscious core that is aware of your
own mechanical news and that suffers for it and that
knows that there's something higher out there for you to
pursue alright that's it I'm done please click like button
