[Music] Division versus unity in this episode we're going to
talk about the engine that drives all of reality this
is it the engine is division and unity and we're
gonna explore this through a long list of examples because
really everything in life that you see is an example
of this and it'll be amazing when you see this
high level pattern that I'm about to show you how
all of reality is gonna suddenly start to make sense
have you ever wondered what's really going on here in
life like is there some sort of reason rhyme or
reason to it or if stuff just happening accidentally is
is there a purpose a point a goal is it
just a thing that's out of control or is there
some logic to the mechanism and of course what you
see is that there's some logic to the mechanism it's
a very high order of logic it's it's a logic
beyond mere human logic see all of reality is an
interplay between division and reunion that is what's happening everything
is about this this this includes the the social human
levels that we're talking about includes relationships it includes your
personal life and what's going on with you it includes
your birth and death but even aside from all that
human stuff it includes what's happening with biology with chemistry
with physics and even beyond all that it's really profound
when you start to see how this shapes everything that's
happening in your life at a practical level it really
puts everything into context it allows you to take a
step back and to see kind of like what is
the rhyme and reason of reality and then you also
see how ingenious it is to it's not just a
stupid process that's happening blindly the way that many materialists
are scientists fool themselves into believing so we can start
off by noticing that the history of mankind if you
are a student of history is a series of divisions
and reunions and it unfolds like a fractal all of
reality unfolds like a fractal divisions within divisions reunions within
reunions consciousness polarizes and depolarizes it expands and it contracts
back it diverges that it reckon verges and it keeps
doing this forever eternally and that is the dance of
consciousness or infinite mind so let's start to get into
some of these examples very common everyday examples for example
the hydrologic cycle have you noticed how water works on
this planet that we're on pretty important resource water but
how does it really work well basically we could say
that it starts in the ocean a giant puddle of
water that's what the ocean is and then that evaporates
through heating so it starts being unified as a unified
body giant body of water then it heats evaporates as
it does so of course all the little particles they
separate from the puddle they rise into the atmosphere and
now they're suspended in the atmosphere and they form clouds
of course the clouds are individualized divided from each other
and some clouds then reunite forming bigger clouds eventually when
enough clouds unite enough of the divided clouds unite there's
enough reunion going on that you get a giant column
of cloud of these water particles and then from that
Union now we get a precipitation literally precipitation the Union
divides itself into individual rain droplets millions and billions and
trillions of them and of course they all fall down
and then what happens they form individual puddles but then
those puddles they get large enough you know they're divided
puddles then they get larger and then they start to
merge together into larger puddles streams rivers then those little
rivers run together to form larger rivers so the division
reunites even further goes all the way down the land
until it all Rican verges and reunites back to its
which is the ocean or maybe it gets locked somewhere
underground or it gets locked in some sort of lake
but eventually all of that will also evaporate it at
some point it'll all reemerge back with the ocean sea
pretty cool how that works right pretty profound actually when
you think about it something so simple like like rain
you never thought about it being an example of division
and reunion but that's just the tip of the iceberg
think about for example a very common case let's say
you make a morning smoothie maybe you've watched my video
about my super blueberry smoothie if you're making one of
those let's say for your morning meal that's a great
example of division and reunions so how does your smoothie
get made well it starts off as just elements earth
water and the Sun basically then what happens well over
a long period of time those elements they grow into
plants trees fruit trees that's what you're putting in your
smoothie so you've got plants growing individual plants so the
plants have to divide so first of all to get
a plant at all one plant that plant has to
unify separate elements of Earth water sunlight of course the
earth is composed of a bunch of different elements but
we're just calling it earth for simplicity of the soil
you know it has to unify those arrange those in
some sort of unified structure which is the plant that
plant that can bear fruit of course the fruits now
individually on the plant because one plant can have many
fruits and what is a fruit really but just a
division of a plant literally the fruit contains partial DNA
fragmented divided DNA of the plant because these fruits are
used to then reproduce other plants you know the fruits
have to be pollinated so forth DNA combines to create
a whole new plant and but then you you know
your smoothie has multiple different fruits so so at some
point in evolutionary past there was a proliferation of different
species of plants humans divided fruits they you know they
grew different types of apples if you're putting apples in
your smoothie or they groove different species or varieties of
blueberries if you're putting those in your smoothie different varieties
of bananas got bred and genetically modified or whatever they
did to them to to get different species of them
so that created a proliferation of different kinds of fruits
then of course those are picked then some super marked
it has to aggregate all the fruits because you got
to go to one supermarket to find all the fruits
for your smoothie that's usually what you do so a
lot of work and effort was put in by the
supermarket to get supply chains of all the different fruits
that you might want for your smoothie you go there
you pick them all out put them in one unified
basket take them all home then you chop them up
and then you throw them into your blender and then
your blender literally takes them divides them into little pieces
but then all those pieces get blend together and reunited
into your smoothie and then you drink this smoothie and
then furthermore it doesn't end there what happens your body
further now it has to it has to do the
opposite of what you did the blender unified all the
little bits of fruit together but now your body has
to undo that process by chemically digesting all the fruit
pieces and breaking them down subdividing those further into individual
molecules and proteins that your body can then use those
nutrients minerals and vitamins and so forth can can then
use those to nourish the cells in your body of
course what are the cells in your body but subdivisions
within your body each cell has its own requirements and
needs and all those divided cells then work together in
coordination as a unit to create the body and to
create a sense of you a sense of separate self
that you have your ego mind see and then of
course your body is just a division within consciousness so
you see the general pattern here this is what life
is doing at all levels up and down the the
chain it's doing this at microscopic levels and at macroscopic
cosmic levels it's doing this consciousness and this is consciousness
it's it's polarizing and depolarizing it's diverging Andry converging and
doing this over and over and over again because there's
nothing else for consciousness to do but this and it's
doing this an infinite variety in infinite situations with infinite
intricate 'no sand sophistication and it's producing all of this
amazing stuff from televisions to trees to fruit smoothies to
to children to animals and everything else species are a
great example because species proliferate and go through actually it's
called a process of speciation you start off with one
species but then usually that species is living in some
geographical area but then something happens you know the geology
changes a mountain range occurs a new forest grows a
new lake forms which then divides let's say a mountain
range you know arises which divides what was one unified
species now into two species and you know at first
they're one species just divided into two geographical areas but
then over time because the geography is gonna change the
two areas aren't gonna have the same geography let's say
this area gets more rain than the other area so
this is dry this is wet and so the species
I have to change to adapt to the dry or
the wet environment and then over over millennia you get
totally different species starting from one you see and that's
a process of division but of course then what might
happen is that over time you know the wind erodes
the mountain range and the species now there's a like
a little Canyon between the mountain range or somewhere now
the species reconverge they meet each other if they can
interbreed if they interbreed with each other and now some
some now unified new third species comes some sort of
hybrid from these two different ones who are still able
let's say to interbreed because they're not that far apart
yet and then that third one is some new thing
which is again you divided and now you reunited them
and then of course that third species will go on
and the same process will happen with it again and
through this process we got all of life on this
planet all a variety from bacteria to fungi to plants
to single-cell organisms and then mammals birds and humans and
primates and then after we got humans in Africa they
started to migrate out of Africa that's the the best
theory I think we have so far if you track
the genetics basically all human genes go back to somewhere
in Africa and so hundreds of thousands of years ago
maybe even a million years ago humans Homo sapiens emerged
from Africa and then started to proliferate and we were
basically one species and one race at that point started
to proliferate into the Middle East through Egypt I assume
and then up from there through Europe and into Russia
and into Asia and then into the South East Asia
into China and then from there down into Polynesia and
into Indonesia and to Australia even and then all the
way to Alaska and then through down through Alaska into
the Americas and down into the south Americas and then
basically that happened and then we got the different races
we got the the Asian races we got the African
races we got the white northern races we got the
Indian race we got the Austin Australian Aboriginal race and
we got the Indonesian races and all this and for
a long time because there were so few humans and
the planet relatively was was so large relative to how
few humans it or that we could live in little
pockets it was very easy to just go off in
the wilderness and start your own tribe I mean it
wasn't easy it was very difficult but it was easy
in the sense that you didn't have much competition and
so during this period there was a proliferation of human
races cultures and tribes and civilizations and then they actually
many of them became disconnected from each other the aboriginals
never spoke with the with the Chinese and the Chinese
probably never spoke much with the Europeans for a long
time until you know they grew each of these little
pockets they grew more and more and more to the
point where now they became large civilizations with hundreds of
thousands of people in each city you know millions of
people in one city and then there was technology there
was trade there were ships there was Commerce and so
slowly the Europeans the Chinese started to do trade with
each other there was the Silk Route and there was
trade or seas and eventually the Europeans came over to
the Americas and started to do trade and started to
interbreed of course now you have interbreeding between different races
and so what happens first we had the division which
created the different races now we have the interbreeding and
intermarriage between different races and so now how we get
some sort of mix in between you know white person
black person you know they have a child in the
chair a child is usually somewhere in the middle you
know sometimes there's variants there but usually the child is
kind of half light half black or half asian half
European or half whatever half European half Native American that's
basically what the Mexicans are and the South Americans Spanish
plus the original natives and so through this now of
course we get a reintegration reunion literally and of course
we're still seeing it to this day and we're not
nearly done with this process the because globalization is still
happening right now and if you think about it if
this process keeps going for thousands of years you know
as the globe becomes more interconnected airplane travel becomes even
faster and better we get supersonic travel maybe we even
built teleport machines that allow you to just teleport from
one side of the globe to another side of the
globe really quickly in an instant what's this gonna do
this is gonna erase all of those old boundaries you're
not gonna have Europeans and Australians living separately in Africans
it's all we're all gonna intermingle and ultimately really there's
gonna be one race we're all gonna [ __ ]
each other and interbreed until you're not gonna have black
people and white people and brown people and yellow people
we're all gonna be some lukewarm mix of all that
and then what what are you gonna do all those
boundaries were erased but it's not gonna end there because
of course once we do fully unified by that point
we're gonna have space travel we're gonna send humans to
different planets maybe even to other solar systems maybe we
build a teleportation device inside their solar system and then
we can travel there really fast but if we do
that then there's gonna be a new diversification see we're
gonna begin the whole process over again because some people
gonna colonize Mars so be they're going to colonize the
moon some people call an eye some other solar system
of course each of those will have different geography and
again the process of speciation will begin again the people
on Mars will do too you know low gravity will
grow taller their heads will grow bigger whatever the people
on the moon will something else will happen to them
people on some aquatic planet will grow flippers and fins
and gills and whatever else and then that will happen
and then of course after that happens then and then
we invent some sort of even faster and better traveling
technology we'll be able to get them to start to
interbreed with each other and then of course that's just
humans what about when humans start to encounter aliens and
then of course as soon as we start to encounter
aliens we're gonna have sex with them and then we're
gonna interbreed or even if we can't physically interbreed for
whatever reasons if our genetics are similar enough to allow
for viable offspring which is probably likely we could still
get their DNA or they can get our DNA and
we can do cloning you know by that point we'll
be advanced enough to do cloning and we'll do advanced
genetic engineering and we can just think like human genes
and then alien genes and create some new hybrid creature
and then that will happen and then will breed with
it mm-hmm if we can and so this this process
just is another example of divergence and convergence of consciousness
that's what this is but notice that there's a problem
when people don't understand that this is what's going on
at a high level they get attached to these boundaries
and they say oh well but my indian culture is
the best culture i got to preserve my indian culture
or i got to preserve my american culture or my
german culture and then people fight to the death to
preserve their german culture or whatever see or their race
and then people get scared over things like immigration or
cultural appropriation they get offended by this as though somehow
it's unnatural for a white man and a black woman
to have sex or something like that I mean literally
this is what people believe 50 or 100 years ago
they would have told you your parents would've told you
that it's unnatural for you to to get married with
someone of a different race or of a different culture
in fact your parents could still probably be telling you
that you know I bet for most of you if
you're uh like a white woman and you try to
try to get married to a black man you bring
home a black man your parents are gonna have a
problem with it maybe I mean it depends how progressive
your parents are but many of them still will see
and then people get really defensive about this but what
are you defending against I mean these divisions that have
happened they're not gonna last see when you see this
bigger pattern when you understand what all of life and
all of consciousness is doing then you stop resisting the
reunion otherwise people act ignorant li and they somehow get
offended by reunions happening or they can also get offended
by divisions happening - it's not as simple as reunion
being good and division being bad in fact good and
bad is a division and they need to be reunited
you see none of this is good or bad all
of it is the play of consciousness see just by
using your mind to walk around the world and to
judge things that's good this is bad that's good this
is bad that itself is the process of consciousness diverging
and then converging see the way you were raised most
of us in school and by your parents and by
your peer group they taught you how to judge they
taught you how to divide the world using your mind
and then by watching actualize that org a lot you
know I teach you the opposite often I teach you
how to stop judging I teach you how to see
the interconnectedness of diverse things divided things we're using the
mind to integrate things here with this teaching most of
the time of course we do some division as well
but but mostly we're more interested in reunification and so
by the time you're done with this work here that
we're doing you start to reunite good and bad and
you stop looking at the world that way and that's
a different way to live life and then your experience
of life changes as a result of that usually it
becomes better how about war is a great example of
unity and division so again we have two groups of
people two tribes that separate and isolate themselves and at
first there's peace because they're separate they don't interact very
much but then as they both grow they start to
encroach on each other's territory and they also start to
see that all of those other guys they have valuable
resources that I might want I might want to steal
their land or steal their their a cattle or steal
their women or whatever I might want to enslave them
and use them for labor I might want to you
know steal their houses and live in their houses and
so then the two start to plot against each other
and this isn't this is division now we have a
war but what is a war really a war is
one group trying to absorb the other group usually a
war is not about total eradication very rarely does one
group of people just wish to completely eradicate the other
group of people sometimes that happens you know like in
really toxic situations like with the Nazis I think that
that that was literally their intent was to exterminate the
Jews not to absorb them but in most other instances
it wasn't like that and in fact even the Nazis
didn't have that intention towards other countries around them mostly
they wanted to absorb other countries like they didn't go
to France and try to exterminate exterminate all the French
know they tried to basically absorb the French so but
this absorption what is that but réunion to absorb is
to reunite now of course then there's a question of
who's absorbing who but also it's very interesting because he
if the Nazis actually did manage to go to France
and to like just so overwhelmed the Europeans that they
you know they got a stranglehold over the whole continent
militarily and they were able to you know create a
hundred year reign of the Third Reich nor whatever and
they started to assimilate the French but see it couldn't
have been how Hitler fantasised it would be it couldn't
just be that all of Europe would be assimilated under
the Nazi culture and all the Nazi aryan ideals it
would also be that the Nazi ideals would be influenced
by the French culture or the Polish culture or the
Russian culture or whatever you know they'd they dominated and
so there would be a mutual reconnection of the two
it wouldn't simply just be that only the Nazi ideals
and culture would dominate over everybody else now I'm not
saying that would have been equal you know it depends
it's not always an equal reunion some some parts can
contribute more than other parts but but something new would
have resulted from that and that's of course one of
the things that someone like Hitler doesn't really quite understand
when he's hatching his grand plans for in a world
domination but usually the two sides you know after a
lot of fighting neither side wins neither side is really
happy with the war both sides suffer massive casualties and
massive suffering then they realize the stupidity of their ways
and then they make a ceasefire and they create a
truce and there's an agreement a peace is reached and
of course this peace is usually under some larger unified
banner so after World War two we got the European
Union we got the United Nations these were higher larger
umbrella organizations whether Europeans realize that hey you know if
we have a third world war we're gonna kill each
other forever so we better unite under a larger banner
recognize that all stakeholders here have a say everybody deserves
to be heard we got to work together coordinate because
we got bigger fish to fry rather than fighting each
other and that's how it was historically small tribes had
to band together through war a lot of times they
have to be conquered and dominated to unify them so
some big chieftain comes along forcefully unifies the tribes but
why does he do that it can seem like it's
very oppressive and egotistical to do that but there's a
there's an even deeper intelligence behind it is that the
unification is necessary because they have a common enemy who's
an even bigger tribe somewhere you know on another continent
at one point at one point they'll have to face
so it's smart for the European nations to band together
and create the EU because they got America to deal
with they got China to deal with they got Russia
to deal with and so if they weren't united they
could easily be picked off and divided and conquered by
one of those larger powers see so a lot of
times the unity is necessitated by a common enemy and
for example if aliens came to earth tomorrow Independence Day
style and started to attack us if they were stupid
egotistical aliens had they started to attack us and they
came in violence and not in peace and in love
then what would happen all of the petty little disagreements
that we have right now between China and Russia and
Europe and Africa and America these would all become irrelevant
at least for a while while we're fighting off the
the aliens because we have to unite as a species
to fight off because our survival you know is so
threatened that if we don't defeat these aliens and none
of us will be alive so of course we're gonna
unite and we're gonna fight those aliens and let's say
we defeat those aliens yeah the independence a style it's
a bit outlandish but let's say we managed to do
that okay so we defeat the aliens now what now
you know we're united we were divided now we're united
but in in this in this reunion we would start
to again fight with each other because now the common
enemy is gone and now we're gonna get back to
our petty squabbles our petty little differences and we're gonna
divide ourselves again until some new aliens come and they
don't have to reunite again that's what's going on how
about clan warfare in the Middle East you got the
Sunnis and the Shia's fighting with each other you have
dictators like Saddam Hussein who try to unify these tribes
into larger nation-states the Middle East is still a very
very tribal culture Spa dynamics staged purple in a lot
of places in the Middle East so they still have
a lot of development and growth to do and in
the Middle East it's still difficult just to maintain a
country because if you don't have a tyrant like Saddam
Hussein holding that collection of people together through cruelty and
authoritarian tactics what's most likely to happen is exactly what
did happen after the u.s. invaded Iraq and destabilize the
region is that the the different competing interests the Sunnis
and the Shia's and the Kurds and so forth they
all divide up and they each want their own little
region they don't want to be united they don't want
to have a democracy and then of course larger stakeholders
in the region like Iran or maybe even Russia or
something you know they also they're opportunistic so they want
to exploit these law smaller countries and these smaller new
regions they're easy to destabilize they're not as united as
they were before under Saddam so now they get in
there they infuse money they infuse weapons and military because
you know they want control and they want to manipulate
all that for their benefit they want the oil and
so forth and then you got various terrorist groups that
are eyes that want to reunite everybody and some sort
of Islamic caliphate and then of course but the Sunnis
and Shiites you know that's that's a division within Islam
but then each of those if you go on Wikipedia
you can research this I was looking at just today
they have individual subdivisions within the Sunnis and within the
Shiites many of them sometimes up to a dozen different
subtypes of Sunnis and subtypes of Shiites she is and
and so isn't that interesting is that even the Sunnis
and the Shia's themselves can't be united because they have
different opinions about how their religion should be organized how
it should be actualized and how it should be embodied
in the world how it should be taught and so
forth what kind of laws should be passed how about
the 13 American colonies when the United States was founded
the key word there is United it's right there even
in the name of the country United States it's a
unity of divided things which is just another metaphor for
what reality is it's a unity of divided individual things
so we had the thirteen colonies originally we had the
Articles of Confederation that was prior to the forming of
the United States and at that point people were happy
with that situation they wanted a lot of independence and
autonomy the individual colonies they have many many of the
founding fathers were very apprehensive about forming a United States
they believed that it should just be 13 individual loose
colonies but then higher wisdom prevailed and people realized pretty
quickly that hey you know what we're gonna be attacked
by them by the by the English we're gonna be
attacked by the French maybe we're gonna be attacked by
other nations in the future so we got a rally
together and so they did and they created the United
States but still even though the United States is united
as one country still there's a lot of difference in
division we have individual states 50 of them they have
their own laws their own court systems see so we
function as both a unity but not just a total
unity of of just a complete merging together we merge
together but still remain individual to some degree we remain
autonomous to some degree and that's what's happening all up
and down the chain of reality of course the European
Union is the same thing the EU was formed after
World War two that brought economic prosperity and peace to
the region which was really good for them but also
it brought their own problems because certain players in the
EU are not contributing as much of their players certain
players are dragging the whole thing down they're exploiting it
whatever you know different countries want to maintain their nationalist
identities because of course you know those spotlight a message
blue people in Poland or in Hungary or in Italy
or in France or in Germany they don't like the
idea of some European identity they want their German identity
they want their Polish identity their what their Hungarian identity
they want their Italian identity and so you have nationalist
parties rising right now in all these different countries you
have brexit what is brexit so we had a reunion
of the European uniform ation European Union that was good
for a while but now we have we have fractures
we have a division with the brexit thing happening but
of course see the bridges of thing is so difficult
precisely because the Union is so beneficial that it's really
difficult to leave it you would think all let's just
leave the EU and just be by ourselves well if
you do that you're probably gonna have a worse life
than you did when you were in the EU but
many of those stage Bleu people who are for brexit
you know all they care about is their British identity
they're basically nationalists and so they don't want to be
beholden to some sort of higher entity called the EU
and the same thing happens United States you know the
United States many right-wingers and conservatives saij blue people they
don't like being beholden to some United Nations something larger
than the United States yet at the same time if
we want to have peace in the world we want
a more globalized interconnected world where people can travel freely
and do trade freely and easily around the world where
we have internet all around the world and people can
talk and share around the world we want to have
some sort of unified laws see so we have to
to interconnect the different nations that's what the EU is
for and that's very important but many right-wingers don't understand
this they think this can somehow be avoided you can't
avoid this the world is gonna become globalized technology will
demand it people will demand it Travel will demand it
you know you want to be able to travel to
someplace in Africa and not get your head chopped off
and the only way that's gonna be possible is through
globalization see you want to make sure that if you're
sitting in America on your computer and some somebody from
Nigeria hacks your bank account and steals a bunch of
your life savings you want to make sure that you
can sue them in court and not have that difference
between you know just because there's an atlantic ocean between
you two doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to sue
some nigerian who stole all of your money in america
right now that would be very difficult to do but
in a hundred years and a thousand years we're gonna
have international laws international courts which will make it very
easy to sue people from Nigeria or America or Australia
or Canon or wherever else see so those are some
of the benefits now of course to get those benefits
there are costs so there's like I said there's no
purely positive and purely negative there's trade-offs always when you
unite things and there's trade-offs when you divide things and
that's tricky there's no clear simple black and white answers
about how much shouldn't we be united and how much
should we be divided it's really a combination it's division
within unity within division within unity within division within unity
it's a it's a nest picture one of those Russian
dolls those nesting dolls that's that's what it's like it's
oh it's a fractal of this and it goes all
the way up and all the way down try to
imagine for example how your body would function if every
individual cell in your body wanted to maintain maximum independence
and autonomy for itself like and even we could even
take this to a to a bigger level like each
get in your body let's say that each organ in
your body didn't want to unite and coordinate but it
wanted to be arrogant and just do whatever wanted to
do like your heart was gonna only pump the blood
to those places where it wanted to but it wouldn't
pump the blood to the kidneys or it wouldn't pump
the blood to your hands or to your feet because
it didn't like those it wanted to be free see
you you couldn't be alive this way to get a
complex organism you need sophisticated coordination and this is what
many libertarians and right-wingers don't understand about how society and
civilization works because they only tout individualism as though an
individual's is with some absolute good and freedom as though
freedom is an absolute good freedom is not an absolute
good and individualism is not an absolute good all of
reality is deeply interconnected and no part of reality is
totally free or totally independent of the other parts and
certainly this is not possible with in any biological life-form
in fact the individual cells in your body have to
be very selfless and very willing to participate in some
sort of larger cause or purpose in order for your
body to function as it is because if every cell
in your body just wanted to do its own thing
and it said [ __ ] you to everybody else
I'm just gonna be a libertarian I'm gonna follow the
libertarian ideals of just whatever is good for me that
doesn't work and of course it doesn't work in a
society either humans can't behave this way and still maintain
a highly coordinated society where we have amazing things like
space travel and jumbo jets and airports and international laws
and the internet and so forth for that stuff to
happen there needs to be massive coordination it needs to
be very sophisticated delicate and nuanced you can't just live
as though you're living for yourself if you want to
live that way in that kind of society then you're
talking about living in a more primitive state than hunter-gatherer
tribes in the Amazon because even they need to coordinate
significantly to be able to survive in that jungle see
this is what the libertarian mind doesn't understand is just
how much human life and survival is contingent upon collectivism
and it's actually only because of the enormous and sophisticated
collectivism collective organization of hundreds and thousands of previous generations
of humans that we've been able to become so technologically
advanced to the point where now you could be a
libertarian in current times and you can sit back and
you're in your apartment by yourself thinking that you're an
individual and that you're not part of a society and
that you can just you should be able to do
whatever you want you should just have total freedom you
should be free to own a gun you should be
free to own a tank should be even a little
free to own a rocket launcher you should be able
to freeze to say whatever you want to say you
should be able to free be free you know I
should be able to be free to start a business
and to exclude whoever I want I can exclude gay
people I can split black people I can exclude some
you know short person I don't like whatever because hey
you know freedom but that freedom is only possible through
this massive collective organization that we have and you have
to appreciate your role in that you see it's the
height of arrogance to think that somehow you are entitled
to freedom and to individualism you're not entitled to these
things at all not at all this is a benefit
that you earn through lots of coordination and cooperation otherwise
you'd probably be dead already your entire family line would
have been exterminated a long time ago if humans truly
operated on their under these libertarian principles of maximizing freedom
and individualism now with that said of course there's also
the opposite danger there is a danger of becoming too
integrated to merge together it is possible to trample individual
right it is possible to create some sort of monstrosity
borg collective where everybody is just like a pawn or
a cog in the machine so to speak and there's
no privacy there's no freedom and you're basically completely enslaved
so what's the right way to build society well it's
not through any one of these ideologies it's through a
very delicate interplay between all the nuances and details of
this see which is why no individual ideology like communism
or libertarianism or capitalism or whatever else none of these
will actually be sufficient to create the kind of society
we need to create if it was as simple as
coming up with some sort of stupid black-and-white ideology that
just said oh we got to maximize workers rights to
the hilt or we got to maximize corporate freedom or
we got to maximize individual gun rights or whatever if
it was that simple we would have already done it
and we would be living in a utopia it's not
that simple the devil is all in the details and
then we're we're politics and economics gets really screwed up
is when people adopt these simplistic ideologies thinking that they
understand how to build a great society without realizing this
very delicate interplay between division and unity which is happening
all the time not just in society but you know
society is just one instance of a much larger pattern
that we're talking about here how about China's treatment of
Muslim minorities and the Tibetans you know try it china
is trying to build a unified civilization in the hopes
of achieving that they're willing to go to great lengths
they're building a massive surveillance state their citizens are not
able to participate and vote in many ways we might
say that China is sort of going towards that extreme
of overall a collectivist overly trampling on individual rights you
know they don't respect religious minorities they're they're doing terrible
things with their Muslim minorities they're sending him into indoctrination
camps reeducation camps basically concentration camps treating them terribly you
know the stuff they did to the Tibetans quite terrible
as well various crackdowns they're doing in Hong Kong also
problematic you know but from their point of view what
is China doing all this for are they evil is
that what they're doing now of course of course not
China is actually doing it out of love love of
courses Union reunion another word for reunion is love so
from the Chinese perspective they're doing this because it's important
for them to become a superpower in the world they
spent a lot of time in poverty they have over
a billion of people most of whom weren't who were
in poverty or you know just as recently as fifty
years ago and so they need to do a lot
of rapid development and they have been doing that and
in many ways they're they're outpacing Americans and they're gonna
be the biggest nation in the world they're gonna be
the biggest superpower in the world pretty soon they're gonna
be the biggest economy in the world pretty soon and
so they're emerging as a world superpower and from their
point of view that's more important than maintaining individual religious
rights see now I'm not justifying what they're doing I'm
not saying that what they're doing is good or bad
there are trade-offs you see the mistake is to look
at the China situation to see oh the Chinese are
so evil because they don't respect privacy and they're bad
to the Tibetans and they're bad to the Muslims no
it's a mixed bag there are certain things that the
Chinese are doing which are very problematic and there are
certain things that our Chinese are doing it which are
great which are helping the whole world you know they
have mmm giant manufacturing centers that allow for the production
of most of the world's products at cheap prices which
enables you to enjoy the luxury that you enjoy here
in America you see so while you're sitting here simpleminded
Lee criticizing the Chinese you're simultaneously not realizing how much
you're benefiting from what China's has been doing over the
last 50 years see so this isn't about judgment or
criticism of anybody it's about realizing that there's something much
larger going on in the universe here consciousness is going
through a process of polarization and depolarization division and reunion
it's not about good and bad it just is what
it is before you judge it understand what it is
that you're judging understand how complex and sophisticated it is
understand that all of your stupid little ideologies whatever they
are are utterly inadequate to explain and to understand and
to navigate what's coming in the future you know the
Roman Empire is a great example of division and reunification
there were many different individual city-states all across the Mediterranean
the Roman Empire came to power they dominated all the
way up to Britain all the way down to Spain
and even into Africa and into Egypt and all this
they dominate all this land and all the way out
to Persia all the way into Germany but then they
got too big the Roman Empire was so massive that
then started to decay it was hard to keep that
order and that giant monopoly on the Mediterranean intact and
so slowly the other nations and tribes started to pick
them off from the sides there was internal corruption internal
division and then it all fell apart and then it
reunited 2,000 years later now we have the European Union
which in a certain sense is almost like a version
2.0 of the Roman Empire now of course it's not
dominated by Rome anymore but but that was in a
certain sense like what the European Empire was trying to
do what the Emperor's and Caesar and Augustus especially we're
trying to do I think they're ideal for the Roman
Empire was something like the EU with of course on
top so of course that was in their self-interest to
do that but but you can see that it wasn't
actually an evil intention it was actually coming from a
loving place they wanted to unite all the different city
states and tribes of the Middle Eastern area so that
there could be peace there could be prosperity that could
be easy trade there could be roads there could be
ship ship travel and there could be common currency right
cuz this is good for everybody when you can unite
the problem is how do you get millions of diverse
divided peoples and entities and organizations to all agree on
uniting together you see because they all have their own
self agendas they all have their own unique needs the
people in the north have different needs and the people
in the south and the people in the east versus
the people in the West so who gets to say
how we structure this Empire and then there's a battle
over that and in that battle of how to unite
us is the very thing that ends up just dividing
us you see the year the Soviet Union similar situation
happened there at the height of the Soviet Union there
were like 20 different satellite states of the Soviet Union
of Russia and then with the fall of communism and
the collapse of the Berlin Wall all of that divided
see as it's funny because in in Berlin the Berlin
Wall you know there's that separation between East and West
Germany so as that wall fell and Berlin and Germany
got reunited from being divided the opposite thing happened with
the Soviet Union the Soviet Union which was united now
became divided now you have all these individuals states that
split off from Russia interesting how that works is one
better than the other no there's trade-offs to each sometimes
things get so divided that it becomes untenable unsustainable and
a reunion is deeply craved and needed that's what happened
for example with East and West Germany in Berlin the
Berlin Wall or sometimes you have the opposite is that
the Union gets so extreme and it becomes so unstable
and untenable that it has to break apart and it
has to divide which is what happened with the Soviet
Union couldn't be maintained it's very interesting that even spirituality
is not immune to this you would think that all
will spiritual people because they're there studying this stuff they
should have a deep grasp of unity and they should
be able to maintain unity at all times but this
is obviously not the case if we look at religious
history what do we have we have different religions arising
different churches at first there United you know Christianity was
originally United but of course even when I say that
already it's not true because Christianity was a division of
Judaism so originally we had what we might say we
had a United Judaism but then of course even within
Judaism that split apart into various groups one of which
became Christianity then the Christians you know they rose to
power and they took over the Mediterranean region and it
was a united Christianity at first but then that broke
apart into the Catholic Church and that broke apart into
the Orthodox Christians and the Catholic Church broke apart into
the Protestants whereas the Catholics then those broke apart even
further than when Christianity came to America that broke apart
even further then we got Mormons then we got you
know all the different denominations of Christians the I don't
even I don't even know them all the Episcopalians the
Presbyterians the whatever we thought all those see you see
even the most spiritual people can't keep their [ __
] together they divided and of course Islam was just
an offshoot basically of Judaism and Christianity and then of
course Islam couldn't keep their [ __ ] together either
because then you had the Sunnis yet that Shias you
had the whatever the Kurds and others and then each
of those even those couldn't keep their [ __ ]
together because even they had to split apart even further
and of course you might say oh well Leo that's
that these are the Abrahamic traditions in the West in
the East it's better no it's not it's even worse
in the East in the East there was Hinduism tons
of different schools of Hinduism in the East there was
Buddhism which was basically an offshoot of yoga and Hinduism
and then Buddhism itself started to split into the three
major schools of Audrianna Theravada and whatever else I'm forgetting
the Tibetan Buddhist and then and then those split even
further and further further and then you got Sean from
China which was the predecessor to Zen then you had
Zen in Japan then in Japan Zen split into RINs
eyes it rinse eyes in Soto's then and then there's
others then Zen came to the west and now in
the West we have basically a Western American version of
Zen see even Zen you might say Zen is the
most hardcore or the most like uncorrupt of spiritual traditions
no even they can't keep it together and yoga is
this way - what about yoga how many schools of
yoga are there there's hundreds hundreds you could even take
one school of yoga like take Kriya yoga which I'm
a fan of how many versions of Kriya yoga exist
probably hundreds why does this happen see that's my question
to you I want you to contemplate ask yourself why
does this happen why does it keep happening this isn't
something that happened once or twice it's not some sort
of fluke or accident this always happens why does this
happen if there's one God and one truth why does
this happen while the war why different sects why different
countries why do we care about maintaining borders between countries
why do we form different alliances why do we have
different tribes that fight each other why do people have
a problem with globalism why do people have a problem
with nationalism why do we have different races why do
people have a problem marrying or having sex with other
races why do we have racism I want you to
find the larger pattern here look at it from birds
I you look at it from a God's eye view
how about the example of the rise of the Internet
you know when the internet first started there was a
massive proliferation almost like speciation of different small mom-and-pop websites
everybody was starting their own website their own storefront their
own blog their own platform their own social bookmarking site
their own social media site their own forum but then
over time as the internet became more commercialized things started
to solidify more and a lot of these little mom-and-pop
web sites and stores and so forth they got at
first we had this diversification this division and then we
start to get a unit unification we started to get
larger platforms that came out on top we got Facebook
we got YouTube we got Google we got Amazon we
got a few of these key websites that dominate the
majority of the Internet there aren't a hundred different video
sharing sites there's only one or two there's not a
hundred different social you know friend platforms there's like one
two maybe I don't even know if myspace is around
anymore there's like only one search engine basically oh there's
Bing there's a few others but they're so small compared
to Google that for all intents purposes there's one there's
basically one website that dominates all e-commerce which is Amazon
ain't this sort of monopolization of the internet now you
might say oh this is terrible well it's terrible from
the point of view of little mom-and-pop shops the gold
rush era of the Internet is over it's very hard
to start your own very successful website these days because
most of the niches are already taken and well occupied
and it sort of sense that's terrible you know I
was I was involved with the internet from the very
beginning almost like I remember I was on the Internet
in 95 96 and I remember I started my first
website I created a website back in 98 it was
a Pokemon web site I was into Pokemon I was
literally just like 12 years old but I was so
interested in the internet I I learned how to do
HTML and I coded my own Pokemon website I don't
think I even published it live but I like I
put a lot of energy into this Pokemon website but
it was good it was a good experiment learning experience
for you know future stuff that I'd create you know
that's no longer possible to really do and so you
might say it's terrible that we have a few of
these large companies dominating everything well in a certain sense
it's terrible but in another sense it's great because you
know Amazon's very convenient you can go to one place
and buy all your stuff there good prices good shipping
the shipping can only be so fast and now they
have one-day shipping the only reason you can have one-day
shipping is because you have the economy of scale of
unifying you know why it's essentially a bunch of different
ecommerce sites together into one and that's what allows for
really fast shipping and really low prices their profit margins
can be a lot smaller than if you had a
bunch of mom-and-pop shops same thing with Facebook if we
had 10 different friend websites where you meet your friends
you know everybody's would have wood it would all be
split apart you couldn't really go to one place to
talk with all of your friends because one friend would
be here other friend would be there you'll be hard
to get them all together so the whole value of
Facebook is that you unify them all together but of
course that value is exactly what's the problem with it
because once everybody is unified together it just becomes this
incestuous cesspool of just like you know the same friends
all jerking off to each other wasting time together and
all of them of course being milked and exploited then
by Facebook so there's pros and cons where people really
go wrong is they get stuck on one end of
the pole or the other end of the pole and
they either think Facebook is all evil or something or
like YouTube is all evil Amazon is all evil and
they don't see actually what is being provided there by
this unification then we have what's going on in the
corporate sector which is we have over the last 50
years there's been a lot of mergers and acquisitions of
companies there's been a lot of monopolies making going on
in the last 50 years companies because the antitrust laws
in America are so terrible they're basically unenforced and so
large companies buy up smaller companies they just keep buying
him up and buying him up and buying him up
and buying him up to the point where it's becoming
toxic because it's getting hard to start a company even
because these larger companies how do you compete with AT&T
how do you compete with Disney how do you compete
with Amazon how do you compete with Google how do
you compete with coca-cola used to be a lot easier
than it is now cuz these companies have hundreds of
billions of dollars to to beat all their competitors with
and even if you do succeed they'll buy you out
in fact that very process of starting a company on
being bought out by a bigger company that is the
very process we're talking about here of divergence and convergence
division and unity because when you start a small company
what you're trying to actually do when you start because
you want to compete against the big guys so first
what you want to do is you want to differentiate
yourself from the big guys you want to say that
all where this little company we give you personal service
we're not these corporate giant overlords we we love our
customers more we cater to our customers more blah blah
blah so in this way we're differentiating we're dividing ourselves
from those giant corporations but then as we grow we
become more successful because people like that they come to
us they buy our stuff they love it there's a
great customer and a corporate relationship that we got going
but that grows the business as as we grow bigger
as a corporation we become more greedy we stopped caring
about our customers as much and we become more interested
in reuniting with our competitors so now all the sudden
you know once my company is big enough now I
want to be bought out by those people that was
competitors that I hated because if they can buy me
out I can walk away with a giant sum of
money I don't have to care about anymore and then
this little company that started now becomes a part just
an organ in the larger organization of AT&T or Disney
or Google or whatever else and then sometimes we even
have the opposite trend where companies become so big and
so bloated these mergers that even the companies themselves realize
that this is not workable even they don't want it
so you have giant mergers like AOL Time Warner and
then they decided oh we got a we got to
split it off sell off a o L or something
or you have for example eBay which purchased PayPal and
then they spun off PayPal into its own company after
they bought it which you would think like why would
they do that well because they found that it wasn't
it wasn't effective to have this one giant corporation so
it was better for them to split off and to
be individual and so they did that and maybe in
the future they'll reunite again who knows and now that
we have these giant monopolies what are we gonna have
we're gonna have a populist uprising in America and we're
gonna have progressives come into power and they're gonna put
some strong antitrust measures into place I'm gonna start splitting
up these companies like Facebook Google Amazon AT&T Disney these
companies really need to be split up because it's getting
to the point where it's really hurting average ordinary citizens
because these companies have so much money so much power
that they're they're almost getting bigger than the government so
they're able to manipulate the government too much see there
needs to be a delicate balance between the size of
the government inside the corporations because if the corporations become
so rich and so powerful they overtake the government then
this undermines democracy and then basically you become enslaved to
the corporation because you don't have a say in what
the corporation does at least with the government you get
a vote once every few years not with the corporation
not unless you own half of its stock or something
like that which nobody does the corporation's basically in a
is a tyranny in effect or an oligarchy rather than
a democracy see how about the whole process of just
birth and life birth is a division or a polarization
within consciousness consciousness literally splits itself into two different organisms
creating a sharp distinction between two parts of itself then
this organism grows up it runs around and eats other
organisms see the only way an organism can survive is
by eating other organisms unless you're unless you're a plants
maybe even if you're vegan you're still eating other organisms
you're just really in denial about it so you're eating
these other organisms but what is the process of eating
just to put one organism in your mouth is already
the process of réunion you divided yourself from the other
organism now you're eating this other organism you're putting into
your body you're reuniting with it you're using his energy
to fuel you see then of course your excreting those
parts of it that you can't utilize and that process
of excretion is a process of division so see just
by eating that's a reunion excretion is division then of
course to have different mammals you have different genders of
mammals that creating of a male or a female mammal
is itself now a division sort of within the species
then of course that is done so that we could
have sex that allows for a reunion in the future
so that gets reunited and in that very process of
reunion is when a new birth happens so male feeling
will come together new birth happens as they're united at
the very moment of maximum union is when the next
division is created which is literally the next birth so
the egg and the sperm come together they meet and
then that meeting of them creates a new united entity
Hill zygote or whatever you call embryo and and that
thing then then grows and separates from the parents creating
a new being or a new life pretty cool huh
very beautiful when you think about it but it doesn't
end there now you have your little embryo you know
the fertilized union of the egg and the sperm so
they all mixed together to create one cell at first
it's just like one cell then what happens how do
you get a human you have to subdivide that cell
so you cut it in half then you cut that
in half you cut that in half cut cutting in
half every cell keeps cutting in half and then quickly
you get millions and billions and trillions of cells through
what a process of division this division all ultimately leads
to one unified baby this baby come becomes old enough
it divides from the mother there's a division baby comes
out cut the umbilical cord now the baby is divided
on its own in individuated unit of consciousness but this
baby still needs the mother so now there needs to
be a new reunion so debate as soon as the
baby is divided from the mother in the doctor brings
it back to the mother after running a few health
checks brings it back to the mother now the baby
is sucking on the mothers teat reunion see but of
course over the years the baby grows up the baby
becomes more independent but the baby still lives with the
parents within the family so the family is now a
unit but eventually the baby becomes a teenager the teenager
starts to rebel against the parents again a division now
is forming what was a cohesive family unit now there
needs to be a separation because the the teen eventually
needs to leave the nest and totally separate from the
parents and start their own family and this whole process
begins again and of course then the parents die the
parents get old and die through a process of reunion
the very death of the parents will be a reunion
of the parent into infinite consciousness and then the child
will grow up and ultimately die as well and when
the child dies the parent and the child literally reunite
in the very opposite of the birth process tada that's
what's going on nothing else but this how about atoms
at the physical chemical level you have atoms which are
individual units of stuff of matter and then they come
up with Maalik they constitute up molecules you know you
get a bunch of atoms together that makes a molecule
that's a union then those molecules unified together even further
to create a protein then those proteins unify further to
create a cell which unify further to create an organ
which unify further to create an organism which unify further
to create a family a tribe ethnicity a nation a
planet species how about the way that various intellectual fields
sub-specialize so early on in human history there was no
science no religion it was all basically philosophy there was
one intellectual pursuit which was philosophy which included natural science
or the early beginnings of it it included some religion
some mysticism and other things like this it even included
mathematics but then as these different fields started to develop
on their own they started to split off from philosophy
so from philosophy we got Natural Science and ultimately modern
science and then from philosophy split-off mysticism and religion and
and then of course each one of those that split
off then itself became further sub specialized so science split
off then science split into chemistry biology physics psychology sociology
mmm and all the other ologies but then each one
of those split even further so physics split into quantum
mechanics splitting the general relativity split into cosmology split into
us astronomy or yeah astronomy and on and on even
even those so within even within quantum mechanics there's different
subfields of quantum mechanics same thing with mathematics mathematics split
off then mathematics split off into other mathematics you have
topology you have statistics you have geometry you have calculus
you have trigonometry you have God knows what else and
then each of those keeps splitting and splitting and splitting
as this happens human knowledge becomes siloed and very fragmented
slushee you could spend 50 years studying one little narrow
sub sub sub sub sub field without seeing the bigger
picture and now what's starting to happen is that scientists
and others are starting to realize that wait a minute
we can't just go into the direction of infinite specialization
forever we need to start to communicate between these different
siloed subfields and so now the big trend in academia
is you know how do we get different fields talking
to each other how do we get like chemistry and
biology talking to themselves how do we get psychology and
physics talking to themselves what kind of interesting interconnections there
and so the science now the newest science the most
cutting-edge science is about reuniting what was divided siloed knowledge
and so this is now the emergence of systems thinking
in holism and now there are attempts to find the
grand theory of everything the theory of everything is only
found by now taking all of this fragmented knowledge and
unifying it together and asking ourselves ok from the big
picture if we zoom all the way out what is
all of this different science mathematics philosophy religion what is
all of it pointing to what is all of it
telling us and of course that's that's where my work
comes in I'm very interested in holism and theories of
everything and so that's kind of what I'm giving you
is I'm integrating all the different areas of knowledge from
psychology sociology developmental psychology physics and mysticism and religion and
all this so we're combining it all together self-help business
marketing politics economics we're trying to unify it all so
that we can understand like what what is human life
about right now science and religion or science and mysticism
are separated still and some people believe it should be
that way but it's not going to stay that way
science and mysticism will reconverge together and that's part of
what I'm doing with my work is helping in the
future to get that reunion to happen so if we
really want to advance science the next level then what
we need to do is we need to start to
integrate science with the deepest insights of mystics we got
a integrate psychic phenomena with with science we got to
integrate the first person with the third person the objective
with the subjective we need scientists doing meditation we we
need scientists doing yoga we need scientists doing psychedelics we
scientists having paranormal experiences themselves and studying the stuff and
integrating it and then spreading it throughout culture and society
now that will happen there's a lot of resistance to
it but it's already starting to happen slowly it'll it'll
take hundreds of years to fully actualize that but it's
starting to happen that's the that's the reunion of science
and mysticism see originally 2,000 years ago they were the
same discipline then they separated and now they're gonna reunite
in the next thousand years how about 3d modeling have
you ever 3d modeled something those of you who had
I used to be big into 3d modeling I did
a lot of work in Maya and 3d studio max
was my favorite for 3d modeling work and how do
you make a detail 3d model usually the way that
I would begin is I would just literally begin with
a square you take a cube a cube volume you
start with that and then let's say you want to
create some sort of creature or dragon or something you
take that then you start to subdivide it almost likes
subdividing an embryo to create a human it's almost the
same process in 3d modeling you start to subdivide the
polygons you split it you extrude it extrude it some
more extrude some more subdiv that one a little bit
more a little bit more and each time you subdivide
it you can get finer detail you can subdivide and
pull out individual polygons extrude them create legs crates tail
create arms create claws create fingers all of this this
is a process of subdivision and then what's interesting about
it is that you don't stop there once you've got
your whole extruded shape the whole dragon let's say then
you you actually now you begin the process of reunification
now what you do is you create these things called
smoothing groups which means that you take individual parts certain
subgroups certain subgroups of polygons on your model that you
want to be like smoothed out you take those like
if you were building a car for example you might
take one side of the car combine these polygons on
the door and then you apply a smoothing group to
it designating this to be one kind of smooth shape
and then you create another smoothing group for the top
of the car for the roof another one for the
hood another one for the taillights and front lights and
so forth and in this way you create these different
smoothing groups and then you assign different textures to it
and then ultimately all of this subdivision and all of
this reunification creates the ultimate grand unity of the one
individual model object that then you can take you could
put that into a 3d scene you might have built
a scene with different other 3d objects you take individual
objects were divided objects individual files right each model has
its own file but then you can come combine them
all into one scene like if you're creating a movie
or something or a video game put it all into
one scene which is made up of individual distinct files
that it's pulling objects from and then you can render
that to create one unified picture or movie or whatever
how about caste systems like in India they had the
caste system of different hierarchy of castes and now that
that caste system is started to crumble in Europe there
was also a caste system it was called the ancien
régime and then with the French Revolution what that was
about was breaking down the caste system because before the
French Revolution you had the aristocrats and the nobility and
the landowners then you had all the sort of like
serfs and plebs down below then you had the bourgeois
class all this and all of this had to kind
of crumble with the French Revolution and now in the
West we don't really have a caste system although now
with rampant capitalism run amok and neoliberalism run amok what
we're getting is we're sort of getting a new caste
system which isn't based on titles and nobility and our
stock recei but is based purely on your wealth so
we're now starting to get a division this gross income
inequality where the millionaires and billionaires are getting richer and
the rest of the 99% are stagnating and even experiencing
a decline in their in their in their wealth and
so this has been going on for the last 30
or 40 years in America especially since basically Reagan came
into power and now it's coming to a head people
are getting pissed off about it we're having populist uprisings
and eventually this is not going to be sustainable this
gross income inequality is not gonna be sustainable and they're
gonna have to be right now there's a division that
was created in last 30 or 40 years since Reagan
that divisions gonna have to collapse s there's gonna be
a redistribution of wealth which is why there's a now
a renewed interest in talking about socialism people like Bernie
Sanders and so forth coming to the prominence and popularity
and this will just keep going more and more and
more there will be a more and more interest in
socialism as the income gap grows wider and wider and
wider and then if if someone like Bernie Sanders comes
to power or some other Democratic Socialist comes to power
then they will try to narrow that gap by doing
a redistribution of wealth the mistake that many people make
is they they they think that there's one absolute good
here they think that either redistributing wealth is the best
or capitalism rampant capitalism is the best but that's not
the case the case is that it's a delicate balance
between these two things and it's going to change over
time depending on what is needed at the time when
this is not understood that only deepens our problem because
people get ideological about like all taxation is evil or
socialism is evil or redistribution of wealth is evil no
it's not but neither is capitalism evil to see people
also then if they like redistribution of wealth then they
get this idea that well if socialism is good that
means capitalism must be evil but that's also not right
both extremes are wrong which is not to say that
we take the middle point between the two it's a
dynamic equilibrium it depends right now our pendulum has been
swung so far to the to the right with neoliberalism
and with rampant capitalism in libertarianism that now it needs
to swing back to the left to socialism and democratic
socialism and redistribution of wealth and higher taxation and populism
once that is you know goes too far then we
got to swing it back again to the opposite end
how about the social justice warriors versus the anti-socialist warriors
so the social justice warriors are the ones who want
more unity and the anti social justice warriors are the
ones who might want more individualism and less collectivism more
division how about the example of global warming how does
global what are we happy well there are oil deposits
separated divided from each other all over the earth underground
a bunch of different pools of oil all separate and
divided we also have a bunch of ice on mountain
ranges and in the North Pole and in the South
Pole this ice is water that has been separated and
divided from the ocean from the ordinary hydrological cycle so
this ice doesn't really change much it just kind of
sits there it's locked divided but then as we tap
the soil suck it out and burn it what happens
is that we reunite the oil with the rest of
the planetary system it used to be locked into just
a pool now we reunite the oil with the atmosphere
by melting it as we do that of course the
planet warms up and this melts the ice on the
the locked ice on the north and south pole and
on the mountain ranges and as this happens we're reuniting
that divided and separated ice with the with the ocean
and the the kind of normal functional hydrological cycle it's
no longer locked of course that increases the the whole
diameter of all the water on the planet leading till
rising sea levels and as that's happening what's happening is
that we're actually taking and we're taking the energy because
the energy of the of the core of the planet
which is really hot at the center of the planet
and we're reuniting that we're we're merging that with the
outer cold temperature of outer space in which the planet
is situated so constantly temperature from the plant is leaking
from the atmosphere and so forth into outer space trying
to create an equilibrium between outer space and the earth
so eventually over billions of years if the earth just
sits here it will all of its internal temperature will
dissipate out into space and it will become cold and
then of course the Sun is doing the same thing
it's it's the leaking energy out from its core some
of it is hitting the earth warming up the earth
so the temperature difference between the Earth and the Sun
there's a we might say there's a division between the
two because one is low temperature there's high temperature but
that Sun is leaking its energy out and it's trying
to find an equilibrium an equilibrium just means a reunion
and eventually the Sun will burn itself out and reunite
with the empty space that it's found in how about
within relationships intimate relationships at first you two are totally
divided man and woman let's say then you two meet
you start to date start to fall in love romance
happens and you're both desperate to get together and to
reunite and so you do that you reunite you have
sex it's wonderful that's what you really want but do
you want to stay in that Union forever of course
not as soon as you have sex immediately there's a
countervailing force which pushes you apart and now you want
your space you're too close together it's too much intimacy
so you want to separate after sex but then of
course you like the sex so you want to come
back together have sex again so you do that but
then the more you have sex the more you want
to separate again and so the more you have sex
the more you fight the more you fight the more
you make up the more you make up the more
you fight again and so there's this this delicate balancing
act between intimacy and distance which is happening all the
time because the problem with too much intimacy is that
you lose your sense of identity in your sense of
selfhood your sense of autonomy you know you to move
in together and now all the sudden your life feels
cramped you can't you can't have all the same freedoms
you used to have once you're moved in with your
girlfriend or your boyfriend now you got to share the
same toilet the same bed the same kitchen and all
this not that leads to more fighting then when you
used to leave live separately of course there's benefits that
come with it too eventually maybe you get married of
course that is a reunion but then the marriage becomes
2 to 2 United to be comfortable you want your
autonomy back so you get divorced right that's all this
is that's all it is how about gender roles genders
are first divided into male and female for many thousands
of years mankind has lived this way because that was
important a strong division between male and female was important
because the physiological difference between the two were more prominent
important back then when technology wasn't sophisticated now the technology
has equalized men and women at a physical level now
that physical prowess is not so important anymore now male
and female can can basically do the same job in
many cases and also the importance of the family is
less important now that we have overpopulation and so this
old notion of being gay versus being straight the importance
of being straight is not a big deal anymore and
so now we have um more people going gay we
have people blending the boundary between male and female transgenderism
and various other kinds of genders and people want to
use gender different gender pronouns and all this sort of
stuff and this is freaking out a lot of traditional
people why is it freaking them out because the old
boundaries are getting questioned and broken down but really if
you understood this giant perspective that I'm sharing with you
here is you would have understood that there's nothing sacred
about the male-female boundary or between gay and straight one
is not better than the other these are artificial boundaries
these boundaries were created these boundaries will be destroyed division
and reunion we've had a lot of division on this
front for thousands of years now we're getting some reunion
but people are people are worried about it you know
there's a big brouhaha about transgender bathrooms what is that
literally people want to reunite bathrooms after they've been divided
for thousands of years and then people freaked out over
it well you wouldn't freak out if you saw this
larger perspective that I'm sharing with you which is not
to say that you have to have only one bathroom
there might be some value in keeping them divided but
also if it turns out that there's value in uniting
them you should be open to uniting them see this
is what it means to have an open mind you're
not attached to anything you're willing to go with whatever
works not with some tradition or some ideology that was
programmed into your mind by some people in the past
we have a lot of different cuisines where are these
cuisines come from we have the French cuisine Italian cuisine
Japanese cuisine Chinese cuisine Indian cuisine you know these were
developed over a thousands of years because these different ethnic
groups lived in different parts of the world which had
different fruits different vegetables different animals different products they had
to use what was local to feed themselves and of
course around this developed different kinds of cuisines but now
we have a fusion of cuisines that's what it's called
fusion there are fusion restaurants which combined French and Japanese
this is like the latest trend in fine fine dining
combining different cuisines American with Italian or Italian with Chinese
or whatever and then you get interesting new combinations but
then some people are purists and they say well you
know that's not authentic Italian food that's not authentic Japanese
food because you've corrupted it by unifying it with or
fusing it with French or with something else you know
they want the pure bread they want the original French
fruit unadulterated by any other influences but if you take
that rigid position then you're missing out on the beautiful
fusions that could fusion dishes that could be created you
see there's there's pros and cons there's certain value in
maintaining the integrity and purity of French cuisine as it
used to be in the olden days but then there's
a lot of amazing stuff that you'll miss out on
if you are just closed-minded in that way and to
purist you're gonna miss out on a bunch of like
cool fusion dishes but then also if you fuse all
the cuisines together that's also not good because if everything
is fused together just becomes one muddled mess you know
you don't want to go to restaurant which literally fuses
Japanese Chinese French Italian American Russian and African all into
one single dish that would probably taste very gross and
then if you had only one dish in the world
you would be sick of it you'd want diversity imagine
if we made a soup out of every ingredient that
every culture on the whole planet ate this giant stew
this infinite stew which is just as a complete muddled
mess it has a flavor of everything has sugar pepper
salt you know garlic in there fish and meat and
vegetables and fruits all of it together into one this
would be the nastiest thing and you'd be so sick
and tired of eating it every day you'd want something
more individuated and you'd invent it and that is literally
what the universe is doing see the universe started out
as this giant infinite stew completely undifferentiated but then it's
sort of you might say it got bored with itself
and it wanted to differentiate itself and to specialize speciaiiy
itself into all sorts of different ways but then as
soon as it did that now it got lonely and
it got frustrated with all the divisional limitation created now
it has to reunify itself and get back to that
original stew state that's what death is and then once
you're dead then you'll be bored of that and then
you'll come back and you'll you'll incarnate is something else
some other creature and then you'll get bored of that
and then you'll go back into the infinite stew then
you'll come back out again actually looking at the example
of stars is really cool you know I was talking
about the Sun earlier so the Sun will eventually release
all of its gases or actually no let's let's redo
that how does it start even get born the Sun
gets bored by a bunch of diffuse gases in matter
uniting together under gravity gravity is the force of réunion
literally the physical force of réunion is gravity it's really
the physical equivalent of love matter reunites together creates a
giant ball of hot gas that's the Sun these atoms
first it's very light atoms like hydrogen and lithium and
so forth they fuse together and create heavier atoms and
heavier atoms and heavier so really what's happening you might
say is that the molecules are basically having sex with
each other and creating denser and denser molecules and this
whole thing is becoming this denser and denser denser denser
ball of of matter in the Sun until eventually the
fusion becomes so dense it's such a deep reunion that
it explodes and a bunch of this matter flies out
throughout the universe but also a bunch of it clumps
together even further creating a dense black hole a black
hole is like the ultimate culmination of reunion and then
this black hole now sucks the stuff into it because
it has so much gravity is so dense that even
light can't escape it after a certain you know after
paths the event horizon and so that's just like sucking
everything in is it becomes so so dense it's just
like a black hole is basically the physical embodiment of
love of course the love is so deep it'll kill
you so don't come close but that's what love does
see if love is too strong literally it kills you
which is why you're terrified love the ego is because
the ego is built on division the ego is a
division it came out of unity so the ego is
always struggling to maintain its division from its environment and
reunion is what the ego calls death but even the
black hole it doesn't stop there the black hole doesn't
just stay a black hole there's out actually something called
Hawking radiation which means that the black hole gradually radiates
from from like the north and south at the poles
it gradually radiates little particles molecules so that all the
stuff and all the information particles it sucks in eventually
over millions and billions of years we'll all radiate out
in the black hole will dissipate so this is just
an example of how a perfect reunion can't stay a
reunion forever it will divide itself again and what about
the Big Bang our entire universe as they say started
out just a little tiny singularity smaller than a mustard
seed that was all the matter in the universe all
the energy and matter in the universe was just you
know the like a little mustard seed including you and
me all of us were over this little dot and
then what happened it polarized it exploded it inflated and
then out of this came hundreds of different atoms molecules
and things you know quarks and leptons and protons and
neutrons and electrons and whatever other kind of weird particles
exist all that came out of this that was the
process of polarization from that came the planet came the
Sun different solar systems came humans came animals all this
stuff human societies all the technology we have today came
from all that that was the process of polarization and
then what's gonna happen and what's happening now is that
eventually the whole thing is is gonna start to approach
heat death the universe will cool down and cool down
everything will kind of equalize into that infinite stew until
it becomes a totally indistinguishable unity and notice when it
becomes a total indistinguishable unity you might say well so
then how does the universe restart because if it started
as a little dot and now it blows up and
spreads out and just becomes totally flat and even then
that's it it seems like the universe just kind of
exhausted itself and it was just this one bang and
that's it but here's the trick that many scientists and
others don't understand is that if this thing flattens out
into a completely indistinct massive infinitely flat object that infinitely
flat indistinguishable thing is indistinguishable from the singularity from which
it originated so literally the end is the beginning therefore
creating a perfect strange loop such that when the universe
ends it will just be the beginning of the next
universe that's one possibility I'm not sure that that's exactly
what will happen scientists are still debating about whether there's
gonna be an infinite expansion and a total heat death
or whether the universe because you know the space-time can
be curved different ways the universe might expand out to
a certain point and then they'll start to contract back
in but if that happens that also leads to the
same result because if it does start to with what's
called do the Big Crunch you know it goes out
expands then it starts to crunch back together eventually it'll
all merge back together to the into the one little
tiny singularity that will be the complete reunion of all
energy and matter and then once that happens of course
it'll blow up again and the whole thing will begin
anew but really there's not much of a difference between
whether it does the Big Crunch or it does what's
called the big rip the big rip just means that
it expands out forever and just becomes completely indistinct because
either way zero and infinity are identical the beginning in
the end are identical it's a perfect loop reality is
and so if you have a singularity just imagine it
this way if you take a circle and you collapse
it down to a to a point with zero dimension
that point as soon as it literally has zero dimension
it also simultaneously expands out and has infinite radius zero
radius and infinite radius are actually identical this is what
a lot of scientists don't understand see that's one of
the benefits so understanding on duality then you can understand
the stuff and then you can do better cosmology and
better physics and so forth and finally I'd like to
point out to you what entropy is entropy maybe you
heard of this this is a physical concept which is
traditionally defined as a measure of disorder or order depends
on whether you say there's high entropy or low entropy
so usually high entropy means a lot of disorder low
entropy means a lot of order but scientists don't quite
fully understand what this is they treat it mathematically but
what does entropy really mean entropy is just a measure
of unity or division because unity is the inverse of
division and divisions are Cu inverse of unity and so
entropy usually is called like chaos as a measure of
chaos so high entropy means that a system is very
disordered and like in a high entropy system you can't
have life for example because life depends on order basically
a lot of randomness but that's not really what entropy
is entropy is not chaos or disorder entropy is high
entropy is unity total unity a lack of distinction a
lack of division where you can't tell anything apart total
unity is God or love as an absolute it's absolute
truth that's what we're trying to reach with awakening is
to realize total unity you might say it's that state
of the singularity before the Big Bang and then low
entropy and what life is really all about is about
division so entropy is a concept from thermodynamics that basically
tells us how all of life unfolds how all of
physics unfolds how molecules spread themselves throughout the universe and
so of course all that molecules are doing is they
are moving towards greater and greater levels of unity and
this drives everything this drives your air conditioning this drives
your car this drives the Sun this drives your metabolism
of your body everything is driven by by heat and
by fluctuations and entropy basically see to have motion at
all the only way we can have motion is through
a division because you need to create one position here
and one position here that means there needs to be
a difference between positions and now only now can we
have a sense of motion and then to actually fuel
that motion with energy there needs to be an energy
gradient there needs to be high energy here low energy
here and then there needs to be some sort of
like path that goes from high energy to low energy
so that they they equalized out but after they completely
equalize out if all positions and all energies equalize throughout
the whole universe and there's no differences in distinctions between
anything anymore literally we're in total unity and so of
course in total unity and total non-duality in total oneness
you can't have anything distinct you can't have anything specific
and of any forms you can't have any motion there
isn't a sense of time if you want those things
if you want motion division space-time you have to divide
consciousness and that's the key that science doesn't understand yet
is that science thinks is these are physical processes that
are happening randomly accidentally for whatever unknown reasons that's not
what's really happening what's really happening is that this is
consciousness subdividing itself intelligently on purpose by design so that
it could experience itself as God and as love this
is what God is so what science that understand is
that science is in the business of studying God it's
just that science is always looking at a little at
God through a through a little magnifying glass so it's
always looking to narrow to actually see the the entirety
of God because to see the entirety of God you
need to completely zoom out you got to take off
your glasses and all of your microscopes and telescopes you
got a completely zoom out and then you see God
and then you can zoom in and you can see
individual aspects and parts of God facets of God of
which there is an infinite amount of them but that's
that's what science is doing but it doesn't know that
it's doing this because it's too it's too siloed and
it's not holistic enough to realize this yet it's not
conscious enough yet this is a meta scientific discovery because
science itself is a division within consciousness so the recent
science can't understand the ultimate nature of consciousness is because
science is just a small part of consciousness whereas consciousness
is the totality you can't grasp the totality with the
part science is in the business of dividing consciousness whereas
to grasp what consciousness is you need to be in
the business of unifying consciousness and that is where mysticism
and meditation and yoga come into play in fact yoga
literally means in Sanskrit Union Union the union of all
things and especially subject and object perceiver and perceived life
and death matter and energy mind and body that's the
business of yoga see and if if scientists actually did
some seriously okay they would understand this but they don't
but they will in the future so we're getting there
I'm getting there see here's an interesting little thought experiment
let's say we take a container just a glass box
and we put two gases in it and we put
a glass sheet or barrier between the two so that
we have two gases that are different now they're divided
what's gonna happen over time over time this glass barrier
is going to decay little holes we're gonna form it's
gonna rot it might take thousands of years but eventually
the glass barrier will decay the seals in the barrier
will will have to break down and when that happens
these two gases will start to mix together and mix
together until they're completely mixed and you just have one
uniform container and if we wait long enough even the
outside of the container will all dissolve and decay and
unify and if we wait really really long all of
it will just become one unified indistinguishable stew an infinite
stew of particles perfectly even that would be the highest
entropy that would be perfect unity see and this is
the natural tendency of all systems take any sort of
ordered system like you could build a statue you could
build a house you could build a car you could
you know build a snowman outdoors and then just leave
it there and see what happens build a skyscraper or
leave it there for a thousand years see what happens
it's gonna all crumble and collapse all the order is
going to all the division that you did to maintain
that it's all gonna break down and it's all going
to unify so what does life have to do to
fight against that see if you want if you're interested
in maintaining a certain shape or structure like let's say
you build a snowman and you really want that snowman
to keep being a snowman for longer than a few
days what needs to happen you need to give that
program thatthat snowman some programming instructions which allow it to
move in its environment in such a way that maintains
its snowman shape you're gonna have to tell that snowman
to avoid the Sun during the day hide under a
tree call me the gold code live inside of a
refrigerator for a while then maybe come back out in
the wind in the winter time and during the summertime
you got a hibernate otherwise you'll die you got a
program the snowman with fear fear of the Sun fear
of the summer fear of stoves fear of anything that
will melt that snowman see and if you do that
then that snowman might live for longer than a few
days maybe they'll live for a week maybe for a
month maybe for a year maybe for a hundred years
but eventually it will die it will melt and once
it does melt it will unify with its surroundings and
it will become infinite love see the snowman came for
love and it returns back to love just like you
it's really crucial to appreciate that unification comes with costs
and benefits it's not an absolute good even the ultimate
unification of death comes with costs and benefits so when
you fully merge into infinite love what's the cost the
benefit is that you're in total peace you're an infinite
bliss and there's no more problems there's no more survival
there's no more worry you don't have to worry about
sex you know if they worry about money you don't
have to worry about any of the human stuff you've
worried about and you're perfectly at peace and happy but
the downside is is that you're totally indistinct you're not
any particular way you're no way whatsoever you're nothing the
downside of that is that you can't enjoy an ice
cream cone you can't know what it what vanilla tastes
like you can't enjoy sex you can't know whether a
human being is you can't enjoy having a cat or
a dog because you literally are merged with the cat
and dog you are the vanilla you are the sex
you are every possible thing merged into one thing see
so if you want to know what vanilla tastes like
you have to incarnate as a human if you want
to know what sex is you need to divide yourself
into male and female so that you could reunite and
have sex if you want to know what war is
you could divide yourself into two rival tribes and then
go kill each other if you want to know what
death is you have to have life if you want
to know what reunion feels like you have to divide
yourself see if you're totally reunited you're so reunited that
you don't even have a way to tell what it
feels like to be United you're so United that there's
not even a difference or a distinction between unity and
division see so if you want to know what it
feels like to reunite you have to divide if you
want to know what it feels like to become God
you have to create the illusion of not being God
that's a very real trade-off that's the only problem with
God is that God is nothing and so totally indistinct
that it can't even really know itself because even the
process of knowing oneself requires there to be a knower
and a known because knowledge is a dualistic divisive enterprise
or pursuit God can't really know itself because it is
itself God can only know itself through a limited incarnation
and then of course all knowledge of God becomes limited
because it's divisive knowledge by its very nature is divisive
and then people wonder well why can't I know God
why doesn't God reveal itself to me because God is
nothing God is completely indistinct how can God reveal itself
to you when the nature of God is lack of
distinction to ask God to reveal itself to you is
to ask God to limit itself for you see that's
a problem because if God showed up to you and
in the form of Jesus or if God showed up
to you in the form of Ganesha or God showed
up to you in whatever form a bearded man in
the clouds you know whatever you would think oh my
god that's what God is it's that it's that shape
but that's not what God is ultimately God is totally
indistinct it's nothing you see but humans are constantly confused
by this because God does reveal itself and make itself
known to humans through various mystical visions and so forth
and then people get hung up on down and say
oh well God looks like an elephant God looks like
a bearded man God looks like Jesus God looks like
the mother Mary God looks like something else but that's
just one manifestation of God actually God is totally infinite
and indistinct which means you can't grab spit you can't
define it you can't say it's like this you can't
draw a picture of it see which is why the
Muslims are smart not to draw pictures of God of
Allah and of Muhammad they do that because to draw
any picture of Allah would be to diminish Allah to
be true to Allah you got to leave Allah under
on but then the scientists and atheists they make the
mistake of thinking that all well if you can't draw
God that means that God doesn't exist no he's just
not understanding the situation people often resist unification and they
sometimes hold unification as oppression but uh oftentimes unification only
happens through great pressure you know oftentimes reunification requires war
death cruelty torture murder rape of power that's part of
the totality of what's going on to understand this helps
you to come to peace with all the evil that
happens in the world because really all the evil that
happens in the world it's often just pressure to reunify
it's for you reunification happening in a sort of twisted
perverted way they see like ultimately Hitler was acting out
of love with what he was doing his master plan
was based on love but don't get me wrong it
was it was very problematic in the sense that the
way he was going about it was delusional because he
was trying to create a unified culture or a society
by conquering others he was literally trying to reunify the
world through division which is insanity see literally insanity wouldn't
try to do that but at the same time he
sort of succeeded because after World War two led to
the higher union of a European Union I don't think
people would have been down for a European Union had
there not been fifty million lives lost in World War
two the lives lost in World War two is what
was necessary to to wake people up to the idea
that okay we need to unify see that's the deeper
intelligence of everything that's happening I want you to notice
that that even in all the evil stuff that is
supposedly happening around the world all of it ultimately has
a deeper intelligence you just aren't conscious of it because
you're not looking at it with a wide-enough perspective now
you might say that well Leo you're just justifying evil
now but what you don't understand is that there is
no such thing as evil there's only love there's only
intelligence but from your little egotistical perspective it certainly seems
like there is evil and certainly threatens you that it
seems like what I'm telling you is some sort of
justification for evil it's not at all I'm not talking
about justifying or rationalizing anything I'm talking about how God
works it's not about justifying behaviors it's about understanding the
structure of all of reality and why it unfolds exactly
as it unfolds the fundamental rule of reality is this
that all divided entities will reunite and all unified entities
will divide another fundamental rule of reality is that no
one part can gain a monopoly over the whole because
the whole is unlimited in every part is limited the
limited will never conquer the unlimited no matter how hard
it tries so it's futile all such efforts will fail
right now the human species has been gaining a monopoly
on this planet but this cannot last eventually the human
species will not be able to maintain a monopoly on
this planet so it's important to keep that in mind
so that we stay humble and don't turn into massive
Devils see ultimately what God is doing with it with
its infinite intelligence is that it's it's seeking to maximize
diversity of form because that's what it is that's what
infinity is its diversity of form it's the maximum possible
diversity of form so what God is its ultimate unity
through diversity diversity is not the opposite of unity it
is the very definition of unity in the same way
that in mathematics if we take the natural number line
from zero to infinity C infinity doesn't mean some very
large number at the very end of that line that's
not what if it means infinity means all the numbers
endlessly forever together but also distinct so infinity is not
a single digit out in the future somewhere on this
number line infinity is zero and one and two and
three and four and five and six and seven and
eight and nine and ten all at once that's infinity
infinity is not a number see but even that is
way too limited because here what we're talking about infinity
in and the natural numbers only but actual infinity absolute
infinity what God is is the infinity of all possible
forms not just numbers it's the ultimate unity of all
diversity and why does God want diversity because that is
the expression of of what it is it's pure infinite
creative potential see nothing gives God greater joy so to
speak than expressing its own true nature in the same
way that like if you're a great singer nothing gives
you more joy than singing for other people if you're
a great musician nothing gives you more pleasure than then
playing the violin let's say or piano for other people
but if you're infinite creative intelligence and pure potential if
you're infinity nothing gives you more joy than to spawn
infinite diversity and to share that with who who are
you gonna share with yourself because there's nothing but you
you're one when your infinite you're one so you can't
share your own self with anyone but yourself so what
you do is you separate yourself fragment yourself into a
million different pieces and then you share the joy of
God with all those pieces by having them reunite and
recreate you and this process goes on forever and that's
what reality is and that's what your life is dada
and evolution evolution is not just a biological process that
doesn't happen through random mutations evolution is a universal process
of differentiation and reunion Unova Lucian is driven by love
and by intelligence and the key to evolution is maintaining
this delicate balance intricate balance infinitely intricate balance between division
and unity if you get too much division you get
hell if you get too much unity you get hell
you need something in between and there's no simple rules
for how to balance this it has to actually unfold
beware of ideologues who hold division or unity as absolute
goods or beware of people who make a do allottee
out of division and unity as though these two are
separate things they're not separate things there are really two
types of unity there is unity with a lowercase U
and there's unity with a uppercase u the unity is
an absolute versus unity is relative relative unity is the
unity which is opposite of division absolute unity is the
realization that actually the division between unity and division itself
is relative and that therefore all of it is included
into one single hole see unity with a capital u
is a unity which includes infinite division and in fact
there cannot be a unity unless there is division because
how can things be united unless division is included in
the unity you see if God was to exclude division
from itself then it wouldn't be total it wouldn't be
a true unity a true unity necessitates its own division
TV infinite requires that infinity includes finiteness in the same
way that look to have infinity on the number line
we can't exclude the number one or zero or two
or three or anything infinity on a number line includes
all the numbers as soon as you exclude one number
it's no longer infinity the mistake people make is they
think that infinity is something separate from the number one
two three four or five no it includes all those
and then it goes on forever it's endless it's very
important that you don't cling to division or to unity
too much but that you appreciate the importance and interplay
between the two sort of like the yin and the
yang they're both necessary and important beautiful and valuable and
also to realize that both are impermanent see my episode
called understanding impermanence where I talk about this so there
you have it life and reality is one giant fractal
of infinite consciousness this fractal is guy this fractal is
you this fractal is love this fractal is division and
it is unity your birth was a division and your
death will be a reunion and everything that happens in
between will just be variations on that theme and nothing
else can happen in reality because reality is nothing but
diff Suzanne distinctions imagined by infinite mind and then unimaginable
in Atlanta unimaginative distinction you just reunite what was distinct
and the two were never really distinct all of it
was just one unity with an upper case you over
the next week I'd like you to do this homework
assignment which is simply to walk around and notice how
every object and situation around you is an example of
in some way division and unity the car you drive
the dog you have the children you have the spouse
you interact with the stuff you see on the evening
news what's going on in politics or in the economy
when you open your closet in the morning and you
look at which clothes to put on notice how all
of this is variations on division and unity and the
more you do that the more you will start to
appreciate the wonder and magic of of life and the
more all of it will start to make sense and
the more appropriate your behaviors and reactions will be to
what's going on around you see notice how you yourself
and everything your mind is doing is also intimate intimately
related with this process of unity and division how your
mind is constantly dividing the world and then also reuniting
the world by listening to teachings like this one all
right that's it I'm done here please click that like
button for me and come check out actualize that world
yes my website you could find the book list you
can find my blog you can find a life purpose
course other resources I'll be releasing in the future the
forum's there if you'd like to support me on patreon
you can do that by finding a link down below
actualized you know it's so yeah it's patreon.com slash actualized
if you'd like to support this work so I can
release more content in the future and maybe do a
little bit of advertising have a little bit of budget
for that I appreciate those who support me and the
last thing they'll tell you is isn't it nice to
be able to understand what the hell is going on
in life like I want you to just appreciate how
powerful understanding is just understanding not necessarily something changes in
your life but just the very fact that you understand
something at a high enough level that's a big deal
that changes you it changes how you look at the
world and it will certainly change your behaviors and attitudes
in the future as well actualized that work from the
very beginning has been one of its highest values has
been holism I want this to be a meta teaching
a teaching of all possible teachings sort of a grand
theory of everything even though of course a theory or
everything isn't really possible because everything is not a theory
for that you need actual awakening but still there are
some teachings most teachings which are very limited very partial
locked into a little paradigm whether it's science or religion
or even yoga or mysticism even even teachings on non
duality I hope you've noticed by now if you studied
some of it read some books they tend to be
very narrow and limited they're not really holistic they're not
really interested in comparing multiple perspectives very few enlightenment teachers
really have a holistic understanding of enlightenment they're usually coming
at it from a very narrow tradition one pathway that
they came at it from whether it was Hinduism Buddhism
Zen advisor loga Christianity whatever maybe they got some awakening
but it's still limited it's still limited so one of
my goals from the very beginning was to not do
that to not fall into that trap to to present
a teaching that was truly holistic and that really took
into account science math physics evolution religion mysticism psychology sociology
history in politics and all of it of course one
of the challenges are trade-offs of this endeavor is that
it's very sprawling right it it's it's not only is
it wide but it's also deep at the same time
which means that there's a lot more volume to it
which means there's a lot more to listen to it
takes a lot more time from you to understand it
but also it's it's really is amazing when you're able
to get this amount of breadth and depth in in
a teaching and in your understanding of reality that's really
the only reason I'm even passionate about shooting this material
is that I wouldn't do it if I have to
just narrowly teach one teaching the only reason I do
it is because I'm passionate about the diversity of it
the breadth of it and also the depth of it
to show you how enormous reality is how enormous you
are see to me a small narrow teaching isn't actually
true or faithful to what the universe is because the
universe is not small and narrow the universe is infinitely
wide and infinitely deep and so I feel that a
teaching needs to reflect that otherwise it's not really a
true teaching it's too limited and partial now even though
I say this of course my teachings are still limited
and still partial it's impossible to have an infinite teaching
but you know it's a matter of degree some teachings
are broader than others some teachings are deeper than others
and some teachings are both broader and deeper than others
so if you like that stuff then you're in the
right place we have more common in the future stylist
agent you
