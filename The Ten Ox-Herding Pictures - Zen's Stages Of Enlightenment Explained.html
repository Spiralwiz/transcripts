[Music] you in this episode I'm excited to be talking
about and explaining to you the ten ox herding pictures
of Zen which is a metaphor or a model with
ten stages for the stages of awakening or enlightenment these
ten ox herding pictures which we'll be talking about in
great detail I'll be showing you the pictures and what
they all mean this is a model that emerged a
long time ago almost a thousand years ago it emerged
in China before there was even Japanese Zen when it
was known as Chinese Chun in the twelfth century so
really really ancient and there are various versions of this
model out there as you might imagine they've evolved and
changed but I will be heavily relying on not just
my own insights and ideas but a rare book called
the lectures on the ten ox herding pictures and here
is the book and this book is actually an out-of-print
book it's very rare difficult to find I paid around
$100 for this book and if you try to buy
it now on Amazon or elsewhere you might see it
for sale for several hundred dollars and it's a very
small book as you can see here very thin it's
only about a hundred and ten pages long but it's
filled with timeless wisdom especially for those of us who
are interested in non-duality and pursuing awakening so this wasn't
actually written by Yamada mamon it was a speech that
he gave this was a lecture that he gave to
his Zen monk students so this is some of the
most advanced wisdom because this wasn't just taught to regular
people this was too serious monks who were in the
Zen monastery with him doing these serious practices so these
are of course his words but also they were translated
by Victor seg√∫n hoary so credit goes after him as
well Yamada mamon is no longer alive he died in
1988 so it's precisely because this book is out of
print and it's rather expensive and difficult to access that
I wanted to do this in-depth video about the ten
ox herding pictures where I will be quoting extensively some
of the wisdom from this book in fact what I
did is I just I took all the stuff that
I underlined in this book as I read it and
I'll be reading that to you here and this is
just one of the books one of the gems you
can find on my book list of over 200 different
books so if you want more dad go check that
out so what are these ten ox herding pictures this
is a map in a certain sense it's sort of
like spiral dynamics like spiral dynamics is a map of
different stages that you evolve through and grow through well
this is a map for the different spiritual stages or
different stages of awakening that you go through and Zen
is not the only tradition that has this kind of
map so does Christianity you'll find maps for awakening there
you'll find various maps in different forms of Buddhism Tibetan
Buddhism and so forth the Sufis have their own Maps
the Jews have their own maps of course basically every
single religious tradition has their Maps because they all understand
that you go through different stages of awakening it's not
just one and you're done there's more to it than
that and so that's where this model can be valuable
is that it it helps you to see just how
much more there is to it then you originally thought
it keeps you humble it shows you that even after
you've obtained your awakening there's still many stages beyond that
that you probably weren't aware of and it also helps
to point out the various traps along the way now
this particular model has ten different stages but of course
there's nothing special about this number ten various Christian models
have five stages Tibetan models might have six sages or
three stages Sufi models might have somewhere around there as
well so I mean you can slice and dice the
process in different ways you have to understand so there's
nothing at all special about the number ten now I
want to give you a warning here before we get
into it this is a very advanced teaching don't let
the simplicity of it deceive you it's a simple model
but there's so much here and most people are not
going to be ready for this wisdom because the highest
wisdom requires that you be prepared and that you be
at a certain ripe stage in your life where you
are ready to get on the path which most people
are not which is why with actualized org I have
many other lesser teachings you see I cover a broad
swath of different types of teachings from very advanced ones
to very simple and newbie ones because not everyone is
ready for the most advanced teachings so let's begin the
first picture is searching for the Ox and the verse
goes like this beating around the endless wild grass you
seek and search the rivers broaden the mountains stretch on
and the trails go even deeper your strength exhausted and
spirit wearied no place allows you refuge the only sound
evening cicadas shrilling in the maples every one of these
images is gonna have a verse that goes along with
it and then I will give my commentary and then
I will also quote from the Zen master himself Yamada
Malone so this is stage number one this is where
most people are at this is before you really understand
anything about the path this is you just stumbling around
in life try to figure out what the hell is
going on suffering and scratching your head and maybe you
accidentally stumble into actualize that organ you see some of
these videos and maybe you hear some people talking about
enlightenment or awakening or non-duality and maybe you've heard about
Eckhart Tolle or you've heard about meditation maybe you've smoked
some weed and you've got a little hit of something
but basically you're lost and you're clueless so what does
the Zen master say about this stage he says quote
there are people who lack the fire to bring light
into their own future they lapse into wishful thinking hoping
someone else will provide that light for them have nothing
to do with this kind of thinking you must resolve
to create that light yourself you must affirm the vow
never to give up until you have become a Buddha
and brought peace to this world all of your practice
is in vain if you do not make the affirmation
of the vow we are not saved by our Satori
we are saved by our affirmation of the vow that
we must attain Satori attain enlightenment end quote so this
is very important a lot of newbies get it into
their head that somehow the desire for awakening is wrong
in and of itself because of course they hear the
platitude that all all desire is wrong all seeking is
bad and that you must end seeking and so of
course in their foolishness they say well well that means
I shouldn't even seek enlightenment that means I shouldn't even
begin the path and this is the classic mistake that
I like to refer to as burning your ship before
you've used it to cross the river or the ocean
or it's like destroying your car before you've reached your
destination this is a very foolish move so you got
to watch out the path begins with a serious desire
for awakening now later and we'll get there in a
few more pictures later you will need to let go
of that desire but right now you need that desire
and you need it in spades you need a lot
of it you're really missing it so don't worry about
seeking for enlightenment and how that's gonna trap you in
some sort of spiritual ego that is the least of
your problems right now because you are completely lost you
are suffering you are clueless as to how to live
life and what life is about you were operating completely
under the conditioning of your culture and your society which
has misled you and has and has addicted you in
a various ways and has deluded you in various ways
and now you're gonna have to fight through all of
that he goes on to say quote when you first
affirm the vow to attain enlightenment at that very moment
there is already a splendid enlightenment end quote now of
course that's not really true so don't misunderstand what he's
saying here just by affirming that you want to become
enlightened that's a very important step that's where the whole
path begins but of course that in itself is not
enlightenment enlightenment is something altogether enlightenment is the Ox you
might wonder what is this ox why this metaphor of
the Ox and what does it really stand for the
Ox is enlightenment it's your true nature it's the absolute
truth it's what you're seeking it's the answer to everything
you've ever one wanted in life it's the answer to
all of your suffering it's the answer to the purpose
of life it's the answer to what is death it's
the answer to what is reality it's the answer to
what is God it is consciousness it is your true
nature it is the awareness of God or absolute infinity
or void or nothingness or emptiness or moksha or Nirvana
or the big self or the no self so we
have all these different words from all these different traditions
eins oaf and that's from the Jewish tradition and then
we have Allah from the from the Islamic addition we
have Brahman from the Hindu tradition so you have all
these different words they're all pointing to the Ox that's
what you're trying to find now the Zen master goes
on to say a quote with discriminative thinking you fall
into the relative world you jump into making comparisons but
discrimination only brings more discrimination which only brings more discrimination
until finally you don't know what is what and quote
and that's where you find yourself right now is in
this discriminatory dualistic mode of looking at the world and
it looks something like this quote I'm happy or I'm
sad I win I lose that was good this was
bad these are the flames of discrimination which blaze up
around us like a conflagration plunging us into an all-consuming
discrimination which traps us no matter which way we turn
you think to yourself where do I find this thing
called kensho and by kensho he also means Satori these
words are synonymous and that's synonymous with awakening just so
you understand the Zen vocabulary here and so he says
in your impatience you may even start to think who
even needs this kensho anyway I'll take my deluded self
just as it is everyone experiences a time when he
says I can't do it I failed at this time
especially you must not think to give up and return
to your lay life to the ordinary life of delusion
so the this notion that I sometimes hear quite often
when people hear about awakening or enlightenment sly Kali oh
but but yeah all this all this seeking and searching
all the spiritual questing I mean what's what's the big
deal I don't want to get uh you know all
hot and bothered about that um my life's not that
bad what's the problem leo well you haven't suffer yet
see you haven't suffered yet when you really suffer you're
gonna then maybe come back and rethink that line of
thought people trick themselves out of even beginning the journey
you see that's the greatest trick the devil plays is
to get you to believe that there's not even a
reason to begin this journey because the devil will say
something to you like well ah emptiness nothingness well who
cares about this leo if i attain emptiness that sounds
pretty bleak sounds pretty nihilistic why would anyone want to
attain emptiness how's that gonna improve my life why would
I want to end the ego leo I like being
an ego I just want to like eat good food
and chase girls and earn money what's wrong with that
I think that'll work just fine that's your ignorance see
that's the devil in you speaking that's the ego speaking
you gotta be smarter than that not to fall for
those tricks and lastly he says quote remember the saying
a person of great talent is slow to mature a
person of great characters develops slowly enduring great suffering along
the way so this here is preparing you for the
long trek ahead to catch this ox and sometimes people
criticize me instead they'd say Oh leo why do you
tell people that it takes thousands of hours why do
you tell people that is it involves suffering and it's
so difficult when Leo it's so easy it's here right
now you're already enlightened look it's so simple it's so
simple there's nothing hard about this it's to prepare you
it's to prepare you this is a difficult journey now
if you get lucky and it happens to come to
you easily great but don't go in expecting that this
is like a journey to clown to climb Mount Everest
so you have to appreciate the significance of this journey
that you're undertaking only then will you succeed because otherwise
as a fool you just sort of rush in thinking
that you can just run up the mountain and then
you realize wait a minute I'm running out of breath
and it's getting cold and I'm running out of food
and I need water and I'm getting tired and my
legs are hurting and there's the snowstorm coming and then
what happens then you you run back and then you
never try it again that's the foolish way to go
about it the smart way to go about is to
understand that this is something serious this is something valuable
this is something that's worth your your careful attention and
the investment of your time and your effort and it's
worth a little bit of suffering and challenge and it's
worth a couple thousand hours of work and the Zen
master also says quote you will achieve nothing if you
work on your Co on only when you happen to
think of it and by cohn of course that's one
particular technique of attaining awakening but he also here means
meditation he means yoga he means self inquiry or any
other spiritual process that you're using to attain your awakening
so he says your efforts will result in nothing more
than froth carried away in the stream but if you
push on straight ahead single-mindedly without brake then there will
be a time when suddenly your eye opens see so
you got to be very consistent and persistent with this
work now picture number two seeing the footprints the verse
by the water and under the trees tracks thick and
fast in the sweet grasses thick with growth did you
see it or did you not but even in the
depths of the deepest mountains how can it hide from
others its snout turned towards the sky so this is
a stage where many of you are at this is
the stage where you've heard about meditation you've heard about
awakening you've read a few books about it you watched
some videos of Rupert spirit or Mooji or Eckhart Tolle
or of myself talking about this stuff you've heard anecdotes
you're a little bit excited about it you're interested in
it you're studying your reading you're watching videos you're even
doing some practices maybe you done 15 minutes of self-inquiry
here and there maybe you've meditated 20 minutes here and
there maybe you've done even a little psychedelic and you've
got a little a little glimmer of something or maybe
while you're meditating or doing your yoga you've got a
little glimmer of something and you're like wait a minute
what was that or maybe you were watching one of
my episodes like the one about what is actuality or
the one about what is perception and when I'm demonstrating
something to you and I'm trying to point you towards
the ox you get a little glimmer of it but
then your ego kind of something clicks in your ego
and your ego kind of freaks out your heart starts
to pound and then you realize something weird is going
on but then you only get a little like taste
of it like a second or five seconds of it
this is you seeing the footprints this is you starting
to smell that wait a minute this locks this ox
that I've heard about it's there actually is such a
thing as an ox now I haven't seen it yet
I only see the footprints and this is a very
important stage because a lot of people again trick themselves
out of even getting to this stage because this is
where the skepticism and the rationalism comes in and these
smart-aleck skeptics they start to say things to me like
Oh leo why don't you prove prove awakening to me
prove that this ox is real why should I believe
you science doesn't know anything about this ox if it
was true then all the scientists would be talking about
it this kind of delusionary thinking here's what the Zen
master has to say about this stage quote despite the
fact that there are so many traces of the Ox
everywhere still you haven't seen it this is because you
are stuck in the weeds of self-delusion the thickets of
self-delusion are choked with overgrowth it does not matter how
much you seek how much you search always you are
buried under a mountain of self-delusion choked with weeds of
mistaken thinking with weeds of intellectualization end quote so that's
their trap you're gonna fall into here is that there's
gonna be this tendency to hear about non-duality and Awakening
and enlightenment and rather than actually doing the practices rather
than sitting down doing self inquiry you're just gonna read
books and you're gonna watch a bunch of videos then
you're gonna gather a bunch of theory and you're gonna
build a philosophy of non-duality thinking that oh I'm already
awake and look I've got it I figured it out
I understand what's being talked about here and really what
you're doing here is you're just deluding yourself you're building
an imaginary ox you're not actually going out there to
find the real wild ox in the wilderness you're just
concocting some fantasy ox in your mind and thinking that
that's what enlightenment is and that's very dangerous so watch
out he also goes on to say quote sometimes you
hear it said that Zen monks do not have to
read books or to study where did this misleading idea
start it's ridiculous to think that this could possibly be
true we say Zen is a separate transmission outside of
the scriptures but it is only because there is a
teaching that there is something transmitted separate from it if
we do not first study the sutras and ponder the
records of the Ancients we will end up going off
in the wrong direction altogether the ancient teachers engaged in
all branches of scholarship and studied all there was to
study and quote that's very important so again some of
these new inviting folks say they like to criticize me
say Oh leo but but what are you talking about
reading books and studying non-duality all this is nonsense all
you got to do is you just got to sit
down and you just got a self inquire or even
worse you're already enlightened well the Zen master disagrees and
you have to understand that when I give advice I
don't just give advice from my own experiences and opinions
i ground my advice in hundreds of sources high-quality sources
not just high-quality sources but some of the most high-quality
sources ever ever in human history and one of these
sources is the Zen master that I'm quoting to you
right now see these people have decades of experience they're
not dilettante their masters and these masters understand nuances of
these paths that ordinary people and even most regular teachers
don't understand so it's wise to listen to them he
also says quote in the Lotus Sutra it has written
that daily duties and attending to work is nothing other
than true reality when we do business or farm or
do temple work or engage in politics and economics all
of this is Buddha Dharma if without studying the sutras
you merely sit in zazen and get swell-headed because you've
passed some Cohen's or even heaven forbid you have had
Satori and received permission to teach you will become as
n devil unquote and here I will refer you to
my in-depth video about the topic of Zen delery calling
called becoming a Zen devil go check that out it's
a it's a very common phenomena people get a little
bit of a of a taste of the Ox and
then they think they've figured it all out and now
they think they're ready to teach and they think that
now they are immune to delusion and of course that's
precisely when they become the most deluded they become a
Sun Devil and this is why we read and we
study and we listen to masters because they have decades
of experience they understand all of the newbie traps they
understand that the path is deeper than it first seems
just because you've had one little glimpse of something doesn't
mean that you've really attained it yet and there's still
a lot of potential for abuse delusion creating cults of
various kinds and misinterpreting whatever satoori you think you've had
all of these are possibilities and I guarantee you that
you will be deluded about non-duality if you do not
read and do not study now of course here the
Zen master was talking about reading reading the the scriptures
and the sutras but now in modern times we expand
that notion out so you're not going to be really
reading that many sutras per se if you're following actualize
that org but like you're gonna be reading lots of
books on my book list for example about non-duality one
of which of course is this book and there are
many others that you will need to read besides this
one in order to learn about all the pitfalls and
traps of this awakening process and lastly he says about
this picture if you've seen the tracks then do not
throw down your staff in frustration and call it quits
follow up the tracks until you have finally caught it
so long as you not give up the affirmation of
your vow so long as you do not break with
this do not break your staff in frustration for certain
you will be able to catch the Ox and code
so sometimes people say olio but this awakening you make
it sound like it's such a rare thing such a
difficult thing what are my odds of awakening if I
put in all these thousands of hours how do I
know that I'll actually awaken and the answer is is
that if you're serious and if you make this vow
the way that he's telling you you should then it's
not gonna be a matter of probability or chance you
will awaken it's just a matter of how serious you
are and when I say that the majority of people
will never awaken 99% of people will never awaken well
firstly that's because most of them never even begin this
path at all they don't even know that such a
thing is possible secondly it's because they deny and they
resist they they actively are skeptical about this and so
they never actually do any practices so that already eliminates
95% of people but then also the reason I say
that is because they don't have that desire and that
commitment that thirst for truth they don't have that they
also don't study the various traps along the way so
it's because of this that it's very easy to predict
that most people will fail and that therefore the failure
rate is like 99% but that doesn't matter to you
because you're gonna be the serious one you're the what
you're gonna be the one who has laser focus desire
for the truth and you're gonna read all the material
you need to read and study everything to learn about
all the traps and then you will have a hundred
percent chance of awakening as long as you're persistent in
your committed now picture number three seeing the ox the
verse in the trees Nightingale sing and sing again Sun
warms the soft wind green willows lined the banks here
there's nowhere left for it to hide its majestic head
and horns no artist could draw so this is a
very critical stage in the awakening process because here you
see the ox for the first time in the flesh
up until this point you've heard all sorts of stories
you've heard all sorts of metaphors and allegories and you've
seen all the pictures and and all these people talking
wonderful things about it but here now you get a
look at it and this is what I would call
your first mystical experience it's almost like a really good
comparison is that it's almost like having your first orgasm
you discover this amazing new world the world of sexuality
opens up to you for the first time and all
the sudden use you realize oh oh so that's what
all that sexual stuff was about that I didn't understand
as a kid like why were people interested in kissing
and hugging and and why were men chasing women and
why were women chasing men and all of this romance
stuff that I saw oh now it all makes sense
see so this is what happens when you have your
first mystical experience then all the sudden it's like oh
[ __ ] oh my god this is amazing this
is like a whole new a whole new gateway opened
up a whole new world now I understand all of
the all the spiritual mumbo-jumbo and all the hippies and
all the people talking about oneness and this and God
and divinity and and all the religions oh oh oh
it wasn't just talk see it's actually something the Ox
is a real thing it's not just footprints it's not
just wishful thinking and also what happens is that when
you catch glimpse of this ox you realize man we're
gonna need a bigger boat I'm gonna need a bigger
rope to catch this thing this thing is way larger
than I ever imagined this thing is a [ __
] monster it's a beast this changes everything this is
nothing like what I imagined the Ox was like it's
almost as though you were chasing this ox and you
thought this ox was like a chihuahua sized creature and
then you discover that this ox is actually a [
__ ] dragon a Tyrannosaurus Rex and you're gonna have
to catch this thing and so that can be a
little bit daunting usually what happens that when you catch
sight of the Ox for the first time it's so
astonishing and so powerful and it just hits you so
out of the blue like a lightning bolt that it
catches you completely unawares and you're not able to hold
on to it for more than a few seconds it
freaks you out it scares you it terrifies you it's
awesome it's so awesome it's terrifying and then what happens
that you recoil and you quickly get back into your
old ego self and then you look around like where
the Ox go because you only caught a little glimpse
of it it's so magnificent you can't you can't stand
to look it in the eyes it's so magnificent you're
gonna have to develop yourself just to be able to
look this thing in the eyes let's see what this
end master has to say about this quote still you
have not really caught the Ox you have just caught
a glimpse from behind you still have seven more stages
to go to catch the Ox and train it is
no easy task but first you must catch you must
catch sight of it and quote so this is a
very important stage because once you do catch sight of
it and it as you and also terrifies you at
the same time now you can get really serious about
this work because now you know it's real and now
you're clamoring to get another look at it it's almost
like seeing a rare bird lost in the rain forest
and then you you catch sight of this bird just
kind of flitting through the leaves and it's such a
beautiful magnificent bird it's like I want to see it
again but it took you years just to catch a
glimpse of it the first time deep in the jungle
well now you got to spend a few more years
to catch another glimpse and that can be quite frustrating
he goes on to say quote one could not capture
in a picture the beauty of his horns their fine
shape to attempt to draw them would be to make
two things where there was one and quote and this
is the whole problem of communicating the in communicable communicating
non-duality how can you communicate the Ox when the very
communication itself is a part of the Ox all language
is dualistic all maps are never the territory and here
were interested in getting to the territory itself the territory
is the ox and the map is this this model
that we're talking about these ten pictures and all of
the teachings and all the scriptures and everything I've ever
said in actualize that org that's the map and the
territory is the Ox itself he goes on to say
quote kensho or awakening achieve sitting on a zazen cushion
is weak in action through contact with the outside world
you must also grasp the life that throbs there the
power that you have built up through Samadhi is smashed
to pieces by the sounds of the outside world it
is shattered by the sights of the outside world end
quote so you see this whole awakening process is going
to be more than you bargained for it's going to
be more challenging than you initially thought initially you thought
that hey I would just get my enlightenment BAM one
day it will just happen and then it all be
easy and downhill from there I wouldn't need to do
any more work I would just be enlightened and I'd
get to walk around and tell people how enlightened I
am and I'd get to pride myself on how how
awesome I am and how spiritual I am that's our
initial newbie ideas of what awakening is like and then
we discover that no no no this whole thing is
gonna turn your life upside down and if you really
want to embody the Ox that's gonna require a lot
more than just catching a glimpse of it here and
there he goes on to say quote salt in running
water is not visible to the eye similarly the glue
that is always mixed in the artist paint is not
visible to the eye the eye sees only the colors
blue or green or red in exactly the same way
our Buddha nature has no shape or form all is
the Ox if you are looking but cannot see the
Ox that just means your mind is full of unnecessary
thinking prejudice false knowledge and mistaken opinions and quote picture
number four catching the Ox the verse with your last
ounce of strength you take it but stubborn and strong
it won't be broken now it's suddenly climbs on high
ground then it descends to vanish deep into the mist
this is a stage where you're trying to catch the
Ox and own it for yourself this is you going
beyond the initial first glimpses and starting to really embody
awakening in your everyday life and also realizing how much
more difficult it is to do that than you thought
here's what the Zen master has to say quote just
catching the Ox is not enough you must get a
tight rope on it tame it and make it your
own a mind of thoughts and attachments can't possibly fathom
the spirit of the Ox that is called original face
with your head full of thoughts of good and bad
pretty and ugly even should you seek out the spirit
of the Ox of Buddha nature there is no way
that you would be able to recognize it if you
saw it don't deceive yourself into thinking that you can
feed it your desires and attachments your passions and self-delusions
the Ox of fundamental wholeness will run away at the
mere smell of them if there is even the slightest
whiff of impurity the Ox won't touch the grass the
Ox of fundamental wholeness detests even the smell of the
actual it is strictly pure it hates the world of
a desires and attachments passions and self delusions and it
will trot right off to the mountains end quote so
here is where you're in for the sort of rude
awakening that in order to really catch this ox you're
gonna have to completely surrender yourself turn your entire psyche
inside out your egotism stands in the way of you
catching the Ox and taming the Ox and so now
you have to make a choice your devilish ego-self and
your old depraved deluded life full of attachments and cravings
and suffering and desire and addictions and hedonism or the
ox you can't have both and you can't attain the
ox so long as you have your fantasies about what
spirituality is what religion is what God is what the
what the Ox is what good and evil are what
the devil is your various political ideologies and your your
economic ideologies and capitalism and socialism and liberalism conservativism and
all of this all of this junk all this fantasy
all of this social programming this you have to discard
if you want the Ox you cannot have the full
ox and also maintain all of that nonsense that your
ego was using to maintain its grip on reality see
a lot of egos what they try to do with
spirituality is they think that oh well I'm gonna catch
this ox and then I'm gonna own this ox I'm
gonna monopolize the sauce for myself and then I'll sell
the ox and I'll make a bunch of money off
the ox and then I'll have a bunch of sex
using the ox and then I'm gonna look cool using
the Ox I'm gonna get a bunch of Fame and
status using the ox I'm gonna build a religion in
my name using the ox and I'm gonna develop this
cult using the ox and that won't work because all
of that stuff is fantasy and the only reason you
want to do any of that stuff is because you
don't really have the Ox you haven't tamed the Ox
you haven't fully realized what the Ox is because if
you did the Ark's would irradiate and expunge blot out
all of this egotistical craving within you all of these
schemes and machinations and manipulations that you are trying to
attain in the name of the ox and this is
how all of the world's greatest evils happen all of
the evils of religion happened this way is that rather
than actually fully pursuing and surrendering to the Ox the
religious person tries to turn the Ox into some kind
of religious system but the Ox will not ever be
turned into into any kind of system into any kind
of picture or model or map because the Ox is
the territory not the map and this is where people
get caught in the trap of talking about the Ox
theorizing about the Ox building a philosophical system about the
Ox when they really aren't avoiding the very difficult thing
which is letting go of all this surrendering all of
that emptying yourself before the Ox only then will the
Ox allow you to approach it closely enough so that
you can tame it the Zen master goes on to
say quote you have caught the [ __ ] you
you may have caught the Ox but it is no
easy matter to break it and finally to make it
your own it is like killing a snake it's still
twitching your mouth is going Moo but your tail is
still twitching you are not completely dead yet so long
as you do not first attain the great death the
samadhi of Moo you will never catch the Ox end
quote so Moo in Zen is just another name for
the absolute for God for the Ox for infinite consciousness
your true nature that's Moo the realization that all of
reality is nothing that's Moo you see so even though
maybe you've glimpsed Moo the question is have you fully
dyed to it or is your ego still twitching and
it's gonna come back to life like a zombie and
now it's gonna turn into this sort of spiritual eyes
zombie where now you of course you've got a little
taste of awakening and you kind of know what it's
like but your ego is still alive and kicking it's
still on its last breath and so if you're not
careful that ego will make all sorts of devilish work
out of this glimpse of awakening that you've had and
that can become very dangerous you might for example want
to start a cult now based on your little bit
of Awakening and in that cult though is gonna be
fueled by all the cravings and attachments of your ego
which you are still not willing to fully surrender in
order to to truly awaken because if you were truly
awake you would never start a cult because cults are
falsehood and awakening is truth and there's also no need
once you're awake to have admiration from others or to
build any kind of pyramid structure with you on top
you don't need social status you don't need Fame you
don't need money you don't need sex none of these
things aren't needed anymore because the ox has satisfied everything
within you the Oxus made you complete but that's only
once you fully tame the Ox at this stage you
haven't done that yet so you still have various kinds
of base needs the bottom tier of Maslow's pyramid of
psychological needs food sex shelter survival and self esteem and
need for love and all this you still have these
even though you've had a little bit of Satori now
picture number five is taming the Ox the verse not
for a moment put down whip or rein unless the
Ox wander back to dust and desire pull again and
again till it's tame and gentle of itself it will
follow without bridle or chain this is the stage where
you get really serious about taming the Ox about embodying
this enlightenment and let purify you so this is a
stage where a lot of spiritual work and inner work
is done a lot of spiritual purification happens and this
can be a stage that can be quite challenging it
can be quite grueling because you realize more and more
just how much egotism and devilry there is within you
that you need to surrender to fully tame this ox
and so it's just this constant struggle of of self
reflecting and finding more and more ignorance and devilry within
yourself all of your selfishness all this has to go
it's sort of like opening a garage and seeing just
how much mess there is in the garage when you
have to have the task of cleaning up the garage
you didn't think it was that messy and how you
see the severity of the task before you here's what
the Zen master says about this stage quote well now
you have finally caught the Ox but this ox will
not do what you want it to do that's why
you have to train it and make it your own
this is what is otherwise known as post Satori practice
kensho or awakening is our goal but without any follow-up
tensho amounts to nothing you must tame that ox which
you work so hard to catch for us training and
practice continue right up until we die the most important
chapter of the ten ox herding pictures is this one
where you sit down and chew the cud of Satori
fully appreciating its texture and quote and this is another
place where a lot of people get tripped up especially
if they follow some neo invitin teachings or teachers is
they think that all okay now I've awoken I've had
my Satori and now there's nothing more to do right
this is what separates the noobs from the Masters the
master is the one who has gone through this entire
process of letting the awakening purify him of all his
selfishness and that's usually a process that takes years and
decades and of course that's why nobody wants to do
it and that's why it's so rare and that's why
masters are so valuable it's very easy to trick yourself
into thinking that once you've had your Satori well that's
it there's no more work to do leo what's the
point of any other kind of work well then why
do these Zen masters spend decades perfecting their Satori's because
in practice they have to otherwise they're still gonna have
cravings and desires and all sorts of low consciousness speeds
and psychological hang-ups and shadow elements and all of these
sorts of stuff and that's what separates a great teacher
from a mediocre teacher is that the great teacher has
worked all that stuff out and usually by that time
he's 50 60 70 80 years old he's like a
shriveled little man not some strapping young lad because it's
taken him that long to really fully ripen and mature
and to to train this ox the Zen master goes
on to say quote you may search the world looking
for truth but there is no truth in the world
it arises from the heart mind when the heart mind
that is looking is true then the world also is
true when the heart mind that is looking is false
then the world being looked at is also false what
is it for you to always be true it is
a matter of ridding yourself of thoughts the true state
of being of the human person is no thought consciousness
it is no mind consciousness the true nature of our
heart mind is like a mirror spa is like a
is a mirror like spotless condition unmarked ought the many
unreal thoughts and ideas we have our images cast upon
this mirror no matter how much you search there for
truth there is no truth there our original nature is
that condition like a spotless mirror we're fundamentally there is
nothing so the key idea here is this notion of
no-mind that is ultimately what you're moving towards not just
an awakening that's hard enough but still rather easy what's
really hard is no mind training your mind to completely
shut off and not have any thoughts that's what you
need if you want to become a master so take
a look right now how many thoughts your mind is
thinking every single mode of the day and imagine a
condition where at some point in the future you will
not have a single thought for hours you will be
able to sit effortlessly with no thoughts that's what you're
ultimately training towards that's what it means to finally tame
the Ox at that point you've let the awakening fully
penetrate your mind and rewire your entire psyche and how
everything works and it's only then that you're able to
see God and oneness and non duality everywhere all the
time this is you working towards an abiding non-dual awareness
unsullied by thoughts he goes on to say quote moment
to moment no mind just advance down this path and
you will be alright to maintain this consciousness to proceed
in moment to moment mindfulness is what is meant by
taming the Ox this post Satori training this is post
Satori training only a person who has trained and attained
Satori does this kind of post Satori training those who
have not seen their own true nature who have not
attained Satori or Awakening can do nothing but stir up
more unreal thoughts when the Ox has been tamed though
you do not use the whip or the line it
will always follow you like a well-trained dog though you
forget all about cones you will always be in no
mind you will get so that you will always just
be blank thinking of nothing you must train the Ox
so that you will not lose kensho so that you
will not lose Buddha nature it is truly a great
pleasure when you know that you can always savor the
world of no-mind in this way there is no pleasure
as great as this it is not just a matter
of one or two days spent training or taming the
Ox it is not a matter of merely a five-day
session a session is a Zen enlightenment intensive you must
live in continuous concentration upon mindfulness so this is where
the bulk of spiritual practice lies is in this constant
never-ending mindfulness just grounding yourself over and over and over
again into the present moment and as hard as that
was during llamada mamonas time it's even harder today in
the 21st century in the year 2018 because now we're
in undated with social media cell phones computers advertisements Facebook
magazines strange political news which is sensational and shocking and
food which is designed to titillate all of your taste
buds and to a dict you and various kinds of
drugs and pills and substances which addictive berries kinds of
businesses which addicted you so all of this is removing
your natural ability to be mindful and present in the
moment so you're gonna have to work extra hard these
days in order to achieve this state of no-mind let's
move on to the next picture number six riding the
Ox home the verse riding high on your Ox leisurely
you head for home trilling on a nomads flute you
leave in the evening mist in each beat and verse
your bow this feeling to a close companion what need
to move your lips so this now is the stage
where you have finally started to attain some serious embodiment
of your awakening and you are now well on your
way to becoming a master and at this point there's
not much of a need even to talk about it
anymore it's not some fantastical thing that you've attained it's
starting to just become your ordinary way of life here's
what the Zen master has to say about this quote
having liberated yourself from the round of birth and decay
you must once again return to the world of impermanence
which is the ordinary world when one attains kensho then
on returning to the original world of impermanence that world
of impermanence becomes the world of reality so here this
is my commentary so here what's happening is that you're
bringing the non-duality back into the world of duality you're
bringing the absolute back into the world of relativity you're
bringing the mystical back into the mundane and you're fusing
these things two things together to form a true non
duality and he goes on to say to be right
in the very middle of the ceaselessly churning just this
is the Pure Land of serenity and Nirvana one who
refuses to to return is not genuine in the everyday
world of common sense flowers are red and willows are
green but in zazen one destroys that world of common
sense and enters a world where flowers are not red
and willows are not green but then one must not
stop at this point only when you have returned to
the world of where flowers are red and willows are
green has one really attained truth and quote so here
is again where the true master is born is when
all of these lofty mystical states and Samadhi experiences when
those are all fused back into your everyday life and
you can just walk and talk and cook your food
and do your dishes and and take a shower and
do your business in the world and engage in in
economic activities engage in relationships and all of this still
is infused with the non-duality because you've really tamed the
Sox next he says quote as training the Ox proceeds
unreal thoughts fade away the struggle between delusive passions and
desire for enlightenment subsides both delusive passions and enlightenment fade
away samsara and Nirvana fade away person and ox fade
away Cohens and Zaza and fade away this is truly
to be immersed in kensho here you have reached the
pinnacle of life one who says I want this or
I want that or I want to do this or
I want to do that is still wandering around in
life's path but when you have reached the peak there
is no need to climb anymore no need to toil
and sweat anymore you just gaze up at the sky
or look down at the world below end quote so
it's at this stage that many enlightened people will give
the advice to newbies wrong lead at all well there's
no longer anything to do there's no higher to climb
there's no work to do and so then they give
that advice to a newbie and then the newbie misinterprets
that advice and thinks all well then there's no work
for me to do but that's only from the vantage
point of someone who's already done an enormous amount of
work decades of work have gotten gone in to bring
a person to the point where they can say oh
I no longer need to do any work I no
longer need to sit on a cushion and meditate I
don't no longer need to do my yoga I no
longer need to self inquire I no longer need to
be mindful and to practice and to read books I
no longer need that yes after you've exhausted all of
that then you're good sort of like once you've launched
the rocket into outer space and it's outside of the
Earth's gravitational pull right yeah you don't need rocket fuel
anymore after that point but when you're sitting on the
earth and you're trying to get up into space you
need a shitload of rocket fuel so make sure you
understand that distinction he goes on to say quote those
who still think about making money about making a name
in society are wandering around at the halfway point you
worry about neither seeking Satori nor about extinguishing delusive passions
cutting off all thought there is no one in the
world do you think either nice or nasty with the
mind of no mind you meet everyone as if for
the first time with that relaxed and expansive attitude you
casually leave everything to the Ox so that wherever it
goes you feel at home end quote the next picture
is number 7 ox transcended the verse astride your Ox
you've reached the hills of home with ox put away
you two are at ease the sun's risen three pulls
high yet still you're dreaming your whip and line hang
idle under the thatched eaves this is the stage where
you have now transcended the seeking of Awakening and enlightenment
and this is the stage where some people could say
well there's no such thing as enlightenment there's no such
thing as the Ox yes because you realize that you
were the Ox the entire time everything is the Ox
this very moment right now right here that you're experiencing
is the Ox so of course there's no hidden thing
that you're gonna find all you're gonna find is the
very present moment that's happening right now but what will
happen is that it will get radically recontextualized and it
will completely transform your life so don't make the mistake
of thinking that well well Leo if there's nothing to
find then it's just this present moment man that's kind
of depressing what's the point of all this work if
all I'm going to end up with it was just
this present moment no you don't understand if you think
that way that means you still haven't found the ox
you don't realize what the present moment is you don't
realize as significance the magnificence of this present moment it
hasn't actually been recontextualized for you the recontextualization is a
very real thing and it needs to happen that is
the finding of the Ox that happened several pictures back
but for many of you listening you haven't had that
recontextualization yet so don't fall into the trap of thinking
like oh well but the Ox will get transcended and
all there will be is just this present moment all
there will be able just to be the self Balea
that I already got that no you don't you don't
got that what you have right now is a bunch
of delusion you have no idea how magnificent the ox
is yet the Zen master has to say quote having
completed the practice you get trapped by Satori you start
saying things like I have had kensho I'm not your
average monk I must have a bigger cushion and my
tea must be serves in special utensils I have completed
Zen practice so that means I can now drink I
can do anything I want in this way Satori makes
people into its servants and strips them of their freedom
this is what is meant by the phrase fettered by
the Buddha fettered by the Dharma this is why when
you have attained Satori you must forget about Satori when
you become a rich man you must forget about money
if there is any distinction between the self that has
awakened to the Dharma and the Dharma to which the
self has awakened the awakening is not genuine the self
and ox are one the ox pictured here is being
used only as a symbol as a convenient teaching device
and the search for the Ox represents the practice and
discipline required in seeking the dharma end quote don't get
confused by this word Dharma all this means is it
just means it's it's the work of spiritual practice it's
the path towards enlightenment and liberation it's basically what the
Dharma is so the path and the ox and yourself
are really all one in the same that's non duality
so all these boundaries that you thought existed all these
different categories and different objects all of them get realized
as absolute unitive non-dual consciousness he goes on to say
quote in order to catch a rabbit you must set
a snare but the object is to catch a rabbit
not to catch a snare when you have caught the
rabbit you no longer need the snare the Ox is
used in the same way as a means of achieving
awakening to Buddha nature we created a snare called the
Ox but once you have understood Buddha nature you no
longer need the Ox and quote see and again sometimes
people make the mistake of thinking well if I don't
need these snare then that means a newbie doesn't need
the snare either but no the newbie needs a snare
because he hasn't caught the rabbit yet a hungry person
needs the snare once your belly is full of rabbit
you don't need the snare anymore so it's very easy
for a person who's just stuffed himself full of rabbit
to tell the hungry person ah don't worry about rabbit
you don't need rabbit that's only from the point of
view from a person whose belly is full from the
hungry person's point of view from your point of view
who's still trying to find the Ox it doesn't help
that advice doesn't help you need to build a snare
you need to glimpse this thing called an arse does
that master goes on to say quote once a student
came to me and asked what is the purpose of
life when I replied to play he was disappointed just
to play is that it he asked and went away
once you have reached the last station at the end
of the line there is nothing to seek all one
does is play here to have things is fine not
to have things is also fine to live is fine
to die is also fine to be happy is fine
to be sad is also fine if it rains that's
fine if it shines that too is also fine every
day is good every day is good end quote that
is liberation that is unconditional happiness happiness which does not
hinge on any kind of external circumstance again newbies sometimes
make the mistake of thinking but leo if I'm gonna
be happy under all circumstances whether I'm rich or poor
or whether I have sex or not or whether my
kids are healthy or not if I'm gonna be happy
under all of those circumstances then what's the point but
you see what you're setting up there is you're you're
setting yourself up in a in a sort of rigged
game where you can never win because by definition then
if you're if you're rejecting unconditional happiness that means that
you what you want is you want to be suffering
half the time and of course that's exactly what you've
got is a life that's half suffering and half good
so what liberation means is precisely that you take yourself
out of the equation of life you realize no self
and then what you realize is that once you're dead
once the self is dead and that is what we're
talking about here we're talking about suicide in a sense
not in the physical sense that you think that you're
gonna harm your body but we're talking about the suicide
of the notion of a cell or a you that's
when awakening is that's what the discovery of the auxes
but why is that so magnificent because once you're out
of the equation then all there is to life once
your dad in a sense is there's pure positivity everything
is bonus everything is just sort of a cherry on
top nothing can ruin your day because you're dead you're
not attached to anything anymore you have nothing to defend
anymore you're not trying to defend your life your body
your self-image your social status your wealth or your notions
of religion or family or politics or government or anything
you're not you're not defending anything anymore because you surrendered
everything so completely that now it's sort of like your
nihilism has gone full circle and at the very end
of nihilism is an inflection point where the nihilism then
explodes into just infinity emptiness explodes into everythingness and once
you're dead you realize that that's it that's the worst
you've faced the worst thing that could possibly happen to
you and you did it by your own hand it's
sort of like you took a sword and you slit
your own throat and at this point that's it there's
no more problems every day that you get after that
is just a good day everything is fine no matter
what it is that is liberation and it's only from
that place that now you can play and hear Yamada
mamon says that the purpose of life is to play
and I've said that in the past before because I've
had that exact same realization when I've had my Satori's
is that there is no purpose to life other than
life itself being itself and then what do you do
with the rest of your life after you realize that
what do you do with the rest of your life
after you've died you just bask in the beauty of
it it's just pure beauty it's just pure magic it's
all extra it's all bonus it's all heaven you're literally
inside of because you have nothing more to lose because
you've already voluntarily surrendered any attachments that you've had and
ultimately your entire life that's not meant metaphorically that's meant
literally you've literally surrendered your entire life by this point
if you've gotten this far and now you can see
why this is so difficult are you willing to lay
your neck on the chopping block and surrender your whole
life in order to attain heaven Nirvana and everlasting peace
are you willing to make the radical transformation in your
psyche to be happy unconditionally all the time under all
circumstances no matter how bad or ugly you may have
thought they were before such that you're happy no matter
what if Nazis are taking over you're happy if terrorists
are bombing the world you're happy if nuclear weapons are
going off you're happy if there's millions of poor people
starving and dying you're still happy most people would say
no Lee I don't want to be happy under those
conditions I would rather suffer I want to fight I
want to create a good world and I want to
help people and I want equality I want to save
the polar bears and I can't be happy when there's
global warming and I can't be happy when there's terrorism
and I can't be happy when such and such a
person as a president and I can't be happy in
this country and I can't be happy under this condition
and I can't be happy ever well there you go
that's why you're not happy this is a very deeply
counterintuitive move to surrender yourself to be happy under all
conditions very very counterintuitive you're gonna have to hit hit
your head against that wall over and over and over
again until you realize realize the foolishness of the way
you've been living your life and your insistent on your
insistence on conditional happiness every fool insists on conditional happiness
every fool can be conditionally happy when he has money
and sack and healthy children and all this stuff but
that's not gonna last even if you acquire all of
that stuff it ain't gonna last you're gonna lose your
good looks you're gonna lose your teeth you're gonna lose
your health you're gonna lose your children you're gonna lose
your dog and your cat and your wife and your
husband will probably leave you at some point you'll get
divorced and it'll be nasty and if you feel good
and happy right now tomorrow you'll lose that if the
economy is good right now tomorrow it won't be if
violence and terrorism and genocide is under control right now
next year it won't be the Zen master goes on
to say quote to penetrate right through judgments of good
and bad isn't that your original face isn't that Buddha
nature when the clouds of good and bad have been
swept completely away then isn't that the moon of reality
shining there to think that the clouds represent bat and
the moon represents good as a mistake the clouds represent
both good and bad when the clouds of both good
and bad have been swept away then a brilliance appears
as eternal and unchanging as the gold which has been
refined from the ore and quote again another very very
counterintuitive move is made here by the master he surrenders
all discriminatory thinking all judgment and all ideas and notions
of good and bad most ordinary people think that if
you did this then your life would go bad and
you would attract all sorts of bad things into your
life but they don't realize that good and bad are
two sides of the same coin and at the same
time as you're judging certain things good automatically that's bringing
bad into your life by saying that's a good person
the only meaning that word has is because there's some
other bad person that you're pointing to a minute later
that you're using as a foil to contrast the good
and the bad and so of course you're going to
love the good but you're gonna hate the bad and
so that hatred is gonna permeate you you're gonna be
afraid of those bad people or those bad circumstances so
the counterintuitive move is to to get rid of the
good and the bad and when you do that something
very counterintuitive happens everything gets transformed into goodness with a
capital G this is no longer good relative to your
ego or to your personal desires this is good in
the sense that the entire universe now is good all
of reality now is good to you everything you don't
discriminate any longer remember you've silenced your mind so now
you're constantly in a state of no-mind so literally you
no longer have thoughts of good and bad something happens
in your life which before you would have called bad
which most people think of as bad you think well
it really is bad my dog got run over by
a bus but that's really bad that's how you used
to think now you don't even have a thought about
it anymore and now that's peace that's happiness that's liberation
now you can play that's quite radical most people if
they were given an option to push a button and
to transform their psyche into this mode of being they
would probably not push that button of course not because
the ego will say no no no no I want
to judge I want to judge because Leo there really
are good things and there really are bad things this
is not relative this is not just a projection of
the mind this is this is real my dog was
really good and my dog dying is really bad so
I'm not gonna push that button cuz I don't want
to be happy if my dog dies I want to
suffer and be miserable well you got it there you
go that's your life that's your mode of being that's
how 99% of people are by the way don't misunderstand
me this is very difficult to achieve we're talking about
some of the most advanced stages of human development right
now and consciousness so if you're thinking to yourself well
leo but this is all wishful thinking this is not
possible I don't know any human beings my my friends
my family members my boss my co-workers I don't know
any people not even my prep professors and teachers who
have this kind of motive of being who have this
level of consciousness that's right that's why none of them
are Zen masters at this point we're not just talking
about a little awakening we're not just talking about some
hippie who smoked some weed or does one or two
psychedelics and thinks he's seen God we're not even talking
about Zen monks who have spent 10 years practicing Zen
and have had some Ataris but still are are kind
of shaky on it we're now at the level of
we're talking about Zen masters we're talking about people who
are like one in a million extremely rare so yeah
these are people who have completely surrendered their entire lives
and transformed their entire psyches that's what taming the Ox
was so at this point for them this is not
wishful thinking this is their reality this can be your
reality but only by undergoing a radical transformation with lots
of work to get to this point would require thousands
of hours of work 5,000 hours 10,000 hours 20,000 hours
that's what we're talking about to get to this level
just so you understand though don't create a limiting belief
out of this but just so that you have a
realistic idea of what it really takes in the same
way that you came to me and you said Leo
I want to become a brain surgeon what do I
got to do I would tell you get ready for
10 years of grueling study and residency after residency after
residency and cramming for tests after test after test and
working in hospital after hospital after hospital for thousands of
hours many many thousands of hours 10 years at least
then you've got a shot at becoming a brain surgeon
right that's not a limiting belief that's just the reality
of what it takes to become a brain surgeon and
to to fool yourself into thinking that you can become
a brain surgeon by reading one book and watching a
few YouTube videos and maybe operating once on a dead
cat that you found on the side of the road
and now you think you're a brain surgeon well you
can see how that leads to all sorts of disaster
and it does in spiritual circles it definitely leads to
disaster this is where you get teachers and and so-called
fake gurus and frauds who create all sorts of cults
who lead people down bad roads who who run various
kinds of scams and pyramid schemes and even though they
might be trying to teach you spirituality they themselves are
still deluded and they will teach it to you in
the wrong ways and then maybe they will sexually abuse
you molest you psychologically manipulate you or try to start
a religion of their own use it to aggrandize their
ego all the sorts of stuff that's what happens the
Zen master goes on to say quote once you have
separated out Satori from delusive passion then that Satori never
gets mixed together again with delusive passion and quote but
remember there here's my commentary about that don't expect that
to happen without having done the work that will only
be true once you're now at this stage seven that's
the picture we're at here seven now once you're at
stage seven after years and years of work now finally
you've separated out your egoic delusions and devilry from Satori
and now it will stay that way but it won't
stay that way after your first taury after your first
satorious things will get mixed back together and in fact
that devilry within you will try to co-opt the Satori
and use it for its devilish purposes now let's move
on to picture number eight the ox and the self
both transcended the verse whip in line you and the
Ox all gone to emptiness into the blue sky for
words too vast can a snowflake survive the fire of
a flame pit attain this and truly be one with
the Masters of the past so this is a very
advanced stage this is where basically you transcend everything you
surrender everything the Sufis might call this stage fauna al
fauna the passing away of the passing away everything passes
away the ox passes away all of your techniques pass
away meditation pass away yoga methods pass away and even
the self passes away and all of your ideas about
non-duality pass away all effort passes away it's a complete
emptiness which is why this picture is just a blank
circle true emptiness of course don't mistake this for some
kind of bleak nihilism it's the exact opposite of that
because this emptiness goes full circle and if there's an
inflection point where all that emptiness also spills out into
infinity all of the form all of reality the entire
present moment all of it is you you realize that
you are God you also realize that everything that has
ever happened has never really happened it might seem like
some stuff is happening in the world and there's important
stuff going on and evolution is happening and all of
this but at this stage at stage number 8 you
realize that none of the universe has ever even transpired
none of it has happened it's all pure emptiness or
mu pure nothingness this is a shocking and radical depth
of non-duality way beyond a merely a little ordinary satoori
way beyond even the the inside of no-self this is
this is a complete radical nothingness very radical nothingness which
is shocking and horrifying at the same time but also
wondrous and magnificent and divine all at the same time
sublime an utter mind [ __ ] you've been completely
mind [ __ ] by this point in the journey
here's what the master has to say about this quote
there is no Satori or awakening no Dharma to be
awakened to and no self awakened here Buddha nature stands
completely and totally revealed this is the culmination of practice
and the completion of the discipline it is in other
words the perfect circle perfect roundness suggests vast emptiness it
lacks nothing and has nothing in excess it is neither
male nor female neither young nor old neither rich nor
poor neither learn or unlearn it neither good nor bad
it is the complete just so world of Satori and
quote so here he's describing the ultimate depths and degrees
of non-duality the realization that all distinctions collapse all boundaries
all objects everything you can't even distinguish existence from non-existence
anymore you can't distinguish life from death because none of
it is real at this point you realize the origin
and source of the entire universe where it came from
and where it's going namely that it never really happened
at this point you understand the answer to the question
why is there something rather than nothing you've answered this
question the master says quote those worldly feelings of needing
a drink by which he means alcohol or desiring a
pretty girl have long disappeared at this stage if you
go around thinking I have had Satori I am enlightened
this is not really Satori or enlightenment if you think
I am pure mind then you have just muddied it
it should not be recognizable by Tom Dick or Harry
it's still not good enough if your consciousness is the
kind that inspires awe gratitude and people that makes people
talk about you if this is it it is just
a disgraceful scene he's a living God a miracle has
occurred if this is what is being said about you
that's bad and an even uglier spectacle are those people
who deceive others into saying such things both the whip
and the line which you have used to train the
arcs have become unnecessary cones have become unnecessary the person
who was awakened and the dharma to which the person
has awakened have all turned into emptiness all have swept
away leaving not a speck of dust no matter what
you are doing go straight into the samadhi of MU
and die cleanly it is because you are still trying
to hold back some breath that you fail you must
throw your life away then there is no self that
remains not even so much as the tip of a
hair's worth of self remains not even the move that
you have been working on remains there is nothing there
is neither training hall nor zazen just an empty mirror
honed and polished not even that remains end quote so
he's talking about fauna al fauna the passing away of
the passing away the complete extinguishing of the self at
this point you were never born the idea that you
are a biological creature who was ever born to a
mother or father this idea has gone away and you
do not think of yourself that way anymore there is
no more self you've never even been born try to
understand just how radical and freaky that is I'm being
very literal now these are not just stories or metaphors
try to actually imagine what it would be like to
be alive but to no longer believe that you were
ever born that's what this stage is like and finally
the master concludes with this injunction you must push yourselves
to the utmost and attain this state at least once
that quote and now we come to picture number nine
return to the source we're still not done notice we're
still not done and that's why this model is powerful
because many people would be tempted to think that this
is the end I've already reached the end and yet
there's still two more stages the verse you return to
the origin went back to the source such wasted effort
how much better to just be blind and deaf from
inside your Hut you don't see outside your Hut let
the streams just flow on and the flowers just bloom
read honestly at this point I don't have a good
personal understanding of of what this stage really is I'm
gonna quote the master here in a second but personally
you know I haven't attained all these ten stages I
I've had various glimpses of these different stages and especially
because I've used psychedelics very powerful psychedelics which of course
are not really accounted for by this model it's a
little bit hard to put my own progress into this
simple linear sequence and so if you're gonna be using
psychedelics don't expect all of your attainments to follow this
simple ten step process so I still have a lot
of work to do I still anticipate a decade or
more work that I have to do to really fully
embody and tame the ox I don't even consider myself
to have really tamed the ox but also because I
have access to these very powerful tools that I've discovered
I have been able to see some of the ultimate
deepest levels of what mysticism and spirituality and non-duality entails
deeper then then Zen monks who have been at it
for 20 years I've seen deeper that doesn't mean that
I embody it deeper all the time it just means
I've had those glimpses and the power of that there's
sort of an upside and a downside of that the
power of it the upside is that it lets you
really see what this path is about and that makes
you very motivated and it also helps you to understand
various traps that exist and it also helps you to
see just how much further there is to go how
deep this thing goes and that so few people have
actually gotten to the very end of it it allows
you to see all that which otherwise would be unimaginable
and virtually impossible only the most advanced practitioners one one
in a million one in ten million will ever get
this far even of those people who become enlightened only
a small percentage will get this far so that's why
it's that's a huge upside the downside is of course
that you see the full potential of what you can
be and how deep this goes but then of course
your ability to embody it is is still very weak
and that just shows you how much more work to
do there is for you and of course that can
feel very overwhelming it can be frustrating because you've seen
these very deep glimpses but then you've still got all
this grinding work to do obtaining the Ox and of
course I know that the Ox is right here right
now so there's nowhere for me to really go to
tame the Ox I mean this is the Ox I
am the Ox oh there is no Ox there is
no self this is nothing this is Moo but um
but it's it's one thing for me to just kind
of say it or to be conscious of it now
in the moment as I'm talking about it's another thing
to be able to embody it throughout the entirety of
your life under all circumstances that requires a lot more
work on my part so also at this point it's
good to tell you don't take these steps to linearly
and to seriously this is a general guideline it's a
map it's rough don't think that all well I haven't
gotten to stage four yet and that means bla bla
bla bla bla or it's like well I'm at Stage
five but it seems like I didn't go through Stage
four is that possible yeah there's some variations and of
course if you're using unorthodox techniques maybe if you're doing
some Kundalini Yoga or are you doing psychedelics or combination
of all the above and and whatever you know you're
spiritually gifted your path might be different so this is
sort of an idealization of the bath model I'm am
NOT the territory so here's what the Zen master has
to stay about picture number nine that place where immaculate
mind without thought is completely identical with the universe and
all of its myriad things nothing other than this can
be considered absolute ground returning to this place is what
is meant by return to the source that's what this
picture is in Zen what do we take as the
fundamental nature of the universe it is ox and self
both transcended here there is neither self nor ox only
the one perfect circle within the pure immaculate heart mind
in which there is nothing there is no distinction between
self in the world there is no intellectual obstructions or
problem about the fundamental nature of the universe its purpose
or anything else all of your metaphysical questions have been
answered when you have gained Satori then the world we
live in just as it is is the Pure Land
is heaven after Satori is the same as before Satori
and quote and that is sort of the ultimate realization
of non duality now I know that's the same thing
I said in the previous picture as well so you
might be wondering well Leo it seems like in every
one of these pictures you're saying that the ox and
the self it's all one so what's the difference between
all these different pictures and all of this these different
levels of oneness is it different degrees of the same
thing or what are you talking about well this is
where it's a little tricky is that yes there are
sort of like different depths of realizing the oneness of
everything at first maybe you realize that you are one
with the whole universe and that's a big epic mindfuck
and very revolutionary for you but then you realize wait
a minute that still wasn't complete because I was leaving
at other people I still there was a still subtle
duality between yes I knew that I was the whole
universe but I didn't fully realize that I'm also all
people and so that duality breaks down and then maybe
you know if you're if you're a Christian or you're
a Buddhist there might still be a subtle duality for
example you realize now that yes you're all people but
there's a subtle duality between you and Christ or you
and the Buddha because somehow in the back of your
mind you were told that well the Buddha is this
special enlightened being Christ is the special Saviour the one
in the only prophet and all this but then you
break that down and you realized wait a minute I
am the Buddha I literally am Christ everybody is Christ
to say that I'm the Buddha that I'm Christ is
not some arrogant position or to say that I have
some reincarnation of Christ it's just to realize that everything
is one you always were Christ everybody is Christ there's
nothing special about you the dog is Christ the dog
is Buddha so there's sort of like a more fuller
and fuller real as of the non-duality and then it
gets embodied at a cellular level deeper and deeper and
deeper within you such that your behaviors and your relationships
to the world they become less and less dualistic the
way that it normally is for people and more and
more non-dual that's basically what all of these pictures are
talking about in various degrees and then the master says
quote in order to go back to the source you
had to exert yourself to the utmost on the outset
it looks as though you went to a lot of
unnecessary trouble all that work for nothing this here now
just as it is this very moment if this is
your goal then you did not have to put yourself
through such trials of searching for the Ox end quote
and of course that's precisely correct and that's why people
say that there's no there's nowhere to go there is
no spiritual path because wherever you go you're already going
one step too far beyond the truth beyond the present
moment that's what makes it so tricky and difficult because
our mind is used to going through some linear sequence
to get somewhere that's easy for us even if it's
a long sequence we can do that what our mind
doesn't know how to do is how to be perfectly
still and take the zeroth step you need to complete
the journey where there are no steps how do you
do that that's actually harder you might think well I'll
just stand still and do nothing no that won't work
see because by doing nothing what's gonna happen is you're
just gonna go along with the currents of society Society
will just carry you away and if you just sit
and do nothing with it in practice what's gonna happen
you're not gonna become enlightened what's gonna happen is that
you're gonna become a slob living in your mother's basement
eating Cheetos and playing video games and hanging out on
all right forums bitching and moaning about how you can't
have sex and how feminists are denying you and how
white genocide is coming this is what's gonna happen to
you or some version of that whatever your version of
that is that's what's gonna happen to you if you
do nothing if you don't take the path but if
you take the path you're also wrong because you've already
gone one step too far so what do you do
it's a paradox you're stuck I recommend you take the
path and then you'll realize how to sort of track
your way backwards to nothing the greatest danger is doing
nothing and getting swept away by the currents of society
that's what happens to 99% of people who don't take
the path and lastly we've gotten to stage 10 the
end this is called re-entering the marketplace the verse with
bare chests and feet you come to the market under
dirt and ash your face breaks into laughs with no
display of magic powers you make wizard Ruiz burst into
flower so this is the ultimate this is a you
complete the path so fully that you forget that you
even ever took the path and you don't brag to
anyone about it you don't even talk about it to
anybody you are just a fully enlightened master and you
are so ordinary now that you just completely blend in
you're so humble that there's nothing special about us so
ever there's not even an ounce of selfishness or ego
left within you and so you don't go around flaunting
your credentials or how many years you've spent on the
cushion or you don't even talk about non-duality to people
you just completely blend in you're completely ordinary such that
what an ordinary person is talking to you on the
street at the bar in the marketplace they wouldn't even
know there's anything special about you and to me that
is one of the ultimate marks of a true master
is what I've seen from interacting I've interacted with various
kinds of enlightened masters and teachers and wannabes and students
and so forth seekers and what I've seen is that
those who I think have the deepest mastery I've seen
that they're the most humble there's a very very profound
humility about them it's awe-inspiring it's amazing and you can't
really see this as a newbie unless you've already gotten
pretty high up the path you can't really see this
humility you don't appreciate it yet because your ideas as
a newbie of enlightenment are still like well I'm gonna
become enlightened and then I'm gonna be special and I'm
gonna be cool and I'm gonna sit there up on
a pedestal in and lecture to people and talk to
people and people will love me and all of this
and then I'll think I'm the hotshot and I'll be
one in a million I'll be that rare human being
and I'll be the Buddha but all this is still
ego in areas you don't realize yet that you're gonna
completely lose yourself there's not going to be an ounce
of self left within you and that is what's necessary
to be able to demonstrate that humility that humility that
I'm talking about it's the ultimate honest signal you can't
fake it and that's one of the ways how I
evaluate and judge enlightened teachers and masters I look at
how how their humility is how they carry that and
that's how I separate the the fakers from the real
ones here's what the what the master has to say
about this though you've attained this unexcelled realm of the
absolute you forget about the elevated realm completely and instead
clad and ragged robe return to the marketplace to settle
among ordinary people the ideal is not to put on
purple robes and to wear a gold picaud bra cod
kesa and March in a procession of dignitaries with that
sanctimonious I would not harm a flea look on your
face of someone who has attained Satori instead you must
throw away everything become completely naked melt completely in with
ordinary people and live alongside everyone else covered in dust
if you cannot quickly doff those robes and go live
at the bottom of the social scale you are not
a person of religion end quote and this is I
think what was remarkable about Jesus and why he's such
a powerful role model to this day 2,000 years later
is that this is precisely what he did right when
you're driving around in your Rolls Royces and you have
a big following of people who worship you and give
you sex and food and luxuries and you have your
own community and all of this source of stuff you
know nothing against Osho I think he was a legit
enlightened master but there's still something about that that's just
wrong they're still sort of like elitism about that that's
still not quite right yet Mata Boulogne continues and says
he needs no shirt he needs no title exposing his
hairy chest down to his navel barefoot he walks the
streets of town or heads for the outskirts since people
will be nervous if he shows that he has attained
Satori he does not reveal that he has mastered the
discipline nor does he show any trace of learning he
just laughs laughs like a great fool dobbed with dirt
and covered with ashes that laughs how could you describe
it he laughs so hard you think his jaw would
fall off people who come into contact with that laughs
returned to their original nature and awaken to their Buddhahood
though he does not preach or lecture everyone who sees
the old monks face is saved just by laughing and
smiling he leads those who are rough and coarse at
heart to discover the light in their lives he does
not preach miracles he just laughs he just drinks with
them he just sings with them when you have reached
this highest awakened state where the world just as it
is is the Pure Land is heaven were you yourself
just as you are are the Buddha then you must
throw away Satori and for the sake of those and
suffering and distress descend to the bottom of society to
the farthest corner of society and awaken everyone else to
this Pure Land as well and that is the end
of the path so now you know what you're in
for yes it can be a little bit daunting it's
a lot more than you bargained for or that you
initially thought in a certain sense we have to sucker
you into non-duality and enlightenment because if you were told
all the trials and tribulations upfront of what this path
entailed you would probably be scared off and you would
just kind of go back to your old ways you
would never even begin but by this point you're probably
already in passed the point of no return you already
know too much you can't really go back asleep after
you've heard all of this after you've seen all the
potential of what you can become now after you know
how much suffering you create and how much of a
devil you are how much of an ego you have
now that you've been given all the answers to all
the existential questions of what consciousness is what God is
what enlightenment is what existence is why there's something rather
than nothing what apps that infinity is what God is
after you've been told all this what are you gonna
say no are you gonna say no I'm just going
to go back to eating Cheetos and and jerking off
to porn and playing video games no this is what
you've been born to do to awaken to realize Moo
to get to the 10th picture that is the purpose
of life so make your vowel go back to step
number one and make your vow hone your desire and
start following the footsteps and get excited about meeting the
ox will you be wise enough to follow this advice
you are extremely lucky to stumble upon this recording however
you got here through whatever confluence of accidents and events
somehow you ended up here and this you know deep
down in your heart you know that this is exactly
what you've been looking for this is your path you
can feel that it's right for you you might be
scared you might be confused you might not know all
the details and how all of it will work out
you might not know what this means for your family
for your love life for your relationships for your finances
for your business but none of that matters because the
most important thing is knowing what the path is knowing
what the highest priority thing is once you've got that
trust that everything else will fall into place yes it
will be difficult yes there will be fear yes there
will be obstacles yes you won't know what to do
yes you'll be confused yes there will be suffering the
counterintuitive thing about the spiritual path is that it promised
use the Liberty promises to you the liberation from all
suffering and it will deliver upon that promise but only
after a long trial of ever-increasing suffering and suffering and
suffering and then one day that suffering will just drop
to zero and so you need to be able to
keep yourself motivated and encouraged and to console yourself while
you're climbing up the mountain and you're going through all
the trials and tribulations and obstacles and all the threshold
guardians you got to keep consoling yourself that it's going
to be worth it and how do you know that
not by trusting me but by feeling into your heart
your heart will tell you that this is the ultimate
path for you to take and how will you know
that's true because you'll be scared shitless of what this
will mean for your life because you are laying your
neck on the chopping block and if you want a
little bit more insight about that go check out my
episode called the ultimate hero's journey or I forget what
I titled it the true hero's journey I think that's
it yeah search for hero's journey and you will find
my explanation of that and that will that will help
to comfort you in your trial in your trials and
tribulations as will this episode here there is an enormous
amount of wisdom contained in this episode and in this
book if you can find this book I definitely recommend
buying it and reading it even if you pay $100
for it it's totally worth it but if you can't
I have distilled the nuggets of it for you here
the only question is will you be wise enough to
follow this advice only about one in a million will
be wise enough to follow this advice and an even
smaller number and we'll be able to complete all ten
of these pictures in their own life and to fully
actualize their awakening so what I recommend is that if
you're gonna be on this path you return to this
episode here and you review the wisdom laid out by
this Zen master maybe you reread that book if you
have it once a year just to refresh yourself and
to keep yourself on the straight and narrow path because
you will be tempted to diverge in various ways and
that's exactly the value of having a master in your
life is that he keeps you on the straight and
narrow path well luckily through modern technology we have the
wisdom of this master here in this video here in
this recording which you can play back to yourself anytime
you want until you've made it all the way and
then you throw it away you don't turn it into
an ideology or a Dogma remember all of it you're
gonna burn away throw away and that's the end I'm
done here please click that like button for me and
come check out my website actualize that org there you
will find my blog the forum the life purpose course
and the book list my book list if you're still
on the fence about buying it it's very affordable but
really what you get for it is you get a
bunch of gems like this book many many more of
these are on there books that will transform your whole
life and I'm still adding more to it I've updated
my book list at least five or six times since
I've released it I try to update it about twice
a year so make sure you check back there's probably
more books there that you should check out and the
books that I'm reading these days are the most powerful
books the most wise books because I've read so many
books at this point hundreds of books that uh most
books the days if I try to read it I
can't even finish it because it's just not a very
high level of wisdom I already possess more wisdom than
most of these books have but I still read because
you never know when you've missed something I still got
to keep myself humble and there's still great books that
I find out there and so I'll still be adding
more in the future and it's the ones that I
add in the future that you really want to look
out for because those the ones that are gonna really
be juicy so check that out the updates that I
do every year are free for those who've purchased the
book list so it's a very very good value on
that stay tuned in the future we may cover other
models of awakening maybe we'll cover the Sufi model or
the Christian model or some Jewish model you know I'm
still researching these various models and as I find stuff
that's valuable I'll put it out there for you and
then by cross-referencing all these models then you get a
really robust sense of what this path is like you
