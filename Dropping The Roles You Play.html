hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to talk about the roles you play
and how to drop them have you noticed yet that
people tend to live their life acting out roles acting
out roles that are obvious to everyone around them but
are opaque to themselves and of course when I talk
about people I'm talking about you you're doing this you're
playing a role without knowing or being conscious of the
fact that you're playing this role and that this role
is actually a contrivance so what I want to help
you to do is to see that in yourself and
possibly to start to move towards dropping it just outright
dropping it so that you can live more authentically so
what do I mean by roles well I'm going to
give you a long list of many examples of roles
so you'll have a very clear idea but in the
abstract what I mean by a role is sort of
like this costume that you put on this character that
you are that you somehow picked up probably in your
childhood or your teenage years or early adulthood and now
you're wearing this costume and you've confused this costume for
your authentic personality in the same way that you have
goth kids remember the goth kids in high school maybe
you were one of them hopefully not but you probably
know that stare is that right so we got the
goth kids now these got kids they do their goth
thing they put on their goth makeup and they wear
their goth clothes and they think that they're cool and
whatever they're different but if they're unique but when you
look at it it just seems so contrived it seems
so silly and pointless it seems like a bunch of
apes at the zoo who have been rummaging through some
you know circus costumes and have put them on and
now they're walking around in a tuxedo is like an
ape walking around a tuxedo thinking that it's now this
hotshot ape when really it's as absurd as an ape
can get that's what it is so I want to
help you to see that in yourself imagine if you
will an alien looking down on the Earth from outer
space and he looks at the entire narrative of your
life and he can clearly spot the role that you
are playing what would that be for you can you
start to suspect what your own contrivances might be and
how silly they are and yet how seriously you take
them some of these roles could be personal some of
these rules could be cultural some of these roles could
be related to career or to business or to family
life and so forth there's a lot of different subcultures
and sub subcultures that we find throughout Society and a
lot of that you're going to see in all these
different stereotypes that I'm going to throw at you here
I've taken a while to brainstorm a big big list
of roles a lot of stereotypes a lot of research
went into this some of these are fun so it's
going to be a fun episode because mostly I'm just
going to be listing all these roles now what I
want you to do is I want you to sit
there and to listen to these and even though there's
going to be a lot of them and you might
have various judgments that come up and you can probably
spot these roles in a bunch of your friends and
family members and co-workers and so forth people you've known
what I really want you to do is to listen
for that one or two or three roles that really
sticks for you that you feel that you've been embodied
for a good chunk of your life and what you
should be looking for is just sort of like aha
moment was like oh yeah that's it that's the role
line playing you got me that's exactly what I've been
doing but I wasn't conscious that I was doing it
I hadn't put a label on it yet I hadn't
realized that there is this role I thought that that's
just how life is I thought that that's what it
means to be a human being but no it's just
a role so listen close as I go down this
list this is one the perfectionist the rebel or the
iconoclast or the nonconformist mr. macho or the alpha male
this one's very common or mr. cool or mr. Shaw
offer mr. James Bond the bad boy or the badass
the winner the loser the moocher or the Hagler or
the penny pincher the player the nice guy or the
nice girl or the doormat the victim or the Wounded
Bird or the mistreated one the abused one the whiner
the know-it-all or the smartass or the whippersnapper the professional
with a respectable businessman the responsible one the dependable one
the mysterious one the cynic the skeptic the socialite the
attention or the show-off the drill sergeant or the rule
keeper or the enforcer of the law the Crusader the
martyr the shy guy or the Wallflower the nerd or
the eek the Care Bear or the bleeding-heart the vixen
or the the version the tormented artist or the starving
artist the achiever the guru the free spirit the team
player the addict the vegan the Bohemian the environmentalist the
rationalist the scientist the philosopher the libertarian the anarchist the
intellectual of the mastermind the knight in shining armour the

Alpha businesswoman the loan Wolffe the prima donna or the
drama queen or the diva the up or the black
sheep in the family or the prodigal son the golden
boy the trihard the gentleman or the lady the good
Christian or the born-again Christian the sinner the celebrity the
hero the villain the oppressed minority the misunderstood genius the
conspiracy theorist the exemplary mother or father or the opposite
of that which is the terrible mother or father the
critic or the snob the outcast the Guardian and defender
of truth the savior of humanity or the chosen one
the Joker the underdog the slick salesman or the wheeler

trickster the hipster of the avant-garde the artsy fartsy artist
the frat boy the gym rat the jock the hotshot
the airhead the alcoholic the clown the New Ager or
the flower child the idealist the rags to riches story
the metrosexual the flamboyant gay the confused and tormented homosexual
the preacher tending to his flock the healer or the
shaman the jolly fat guy the patriot the American the
Arab the Jew the Hindu so that's the list of
some of the roles did any standout for you if
they did good jot that down keep it in your
mind it's a gut feeling you have of like oh
I've been caught it's like I spent the last 10
or 20 years playing this role and now it's like
wow I've been caught that's what I've been doing that's
exactly what I did I've been playing the role of
the perfectionist in my relationships in business in my art
in my family I was the perfectionist the whole time
or it's like no I've been playing the role of
the wounded bird in my relationships I was the wounded
bird I keeping the wounded bird with my you know
everything I do is my career it's like I'm always
the victim someone's always hurting me someone's always doing something
to me someone's always sabotaging me I'm the wounded bird
or like with my health I'm the one did bird
I've been having just like health problems over and over
and over and that's turned into an identity that I
now embody and I that I actually feel as myself
and I lived that way the question I have for
you is who were you before these roles before you
picked up this role and you did pick it up
you weren't born with it you picked it up in
fact what I'd like you to do right now is
just for a few seconds close your eyes think of
this role whichever role that you feel you embody the
most in your life pick one and now go back
to a time in your life before the role was
adopted and remember how different life was before the role
let some of those memories those early memories come back
to you what was it like when you were living
without any rolls can you remember can you pinpoint the
moment when you started to adopt this role that you
play there was a moment where it started to come
into existence and it was still new you had to
create it you have to put on this costume and
at first it probably didn't feel quite right didn't feel
authentic but over time you just put it on over
and over and over again until you forgot that it
was a costume to begin with okay go ahead and
open your eyes I'll have a worksheet for you that
you can use to go deeper and to really explore
this but what I just want to say here is
that why do you need this role what function does
it serve could you start to let it go what
would your life look like if you did let it
go who would you become the key theme of personal
development work is shedding the artificial layers the taking off
the masks taking off the costumes recognizing our own contrivances
and calling them out for what they are and sorting
that out for more authentic personalities from our authentic motivations
are authentic values and if you had a healthy childhood
then that's something you can use as an anchor point
if your childhood was healthy you still probably adopted roles
just later on in life maybe it's in your teenagers
in middle school maybe in high school but an elementary
school you're probably relatively pure and that's something you can
come back to and anchor yourself in that in those
memories to remember like oh yeah that's what it was
like to be somewhat of an authentic human being and
now I got corrupted by all this nonsense by society
by my parents and so forth now if you did
not have a relatively normal childhood and your childhood was
traumatic and abusive and that means you adopted a role
very early on and in fact your earliest memories might
be so toxic and distorted that already you don't know
what it's like to feel that authentic pure clean slate
that you started life with right you might not have
those memories in which case you're in a more difficult
situation now that doesn't mean you can't drop your role
you can still drop your role it'll just take more
work because you don't have those memories as an anchor
point that you can go back to all right you
can still drop the mess okay but this is just
something that I want you to be aware of the
way that you drop a role is first and foremost
of just becoming aware of it and just seeing how
artificial and contrived it is until it's like you're that
goth kid in high school who's putting on all this
goth makeup and stuff and then one day you realize
like wait a minute why the am I doing this
this is so silly and stupid unlike that putting on
a tuxedo walking growling he's James Bond thinking that he's
the ladies man right when he really is just an
eighth in a tuxedo when it becomes that transparent to
you you can see the ridiculousness the absurdity of it
then it'll naturally just kind of wither away and fall
off on its own but to help you do that
I do have a worksheet so this is the end
of the episode it's going to be short and simple
all I really wanted to do is just share this
list with you but do the worksheet because the worksheet
have some powerful questions and I want you to really
think about what these questions are pointing you to do
a little bit of journaling and brainstorming about this so
that you can get very clear about the in authenticity
that you act out every day in your life so
make sure you do that worksheet all right that's it
I'm signing off please click the like button for me
post your comments down below share this UPS with a
friend and lastly come check out actualize that runs right
here this is my website I have some cool stuff
on there I have free resources through the forum there's
a new blog that I recently launched which has some
more advanced and miscellaneous insights that I don't get to
share with you via the videos so check all that
out but most importantly just stay tuned stay tuned for
more and start doing the work that this theory is
pointing you to what I share with you is largely
theory I'm a conceptual kind of guy and also because
of the format that we're in we're talking that's all
I can really do to you is just talk so
of course it's going to be all theoretical what I
need you to do if you really like the theory
and if you're falling because you like some of the
advanced concepts I'm sharing with you and they're kind of
interesting and fascinating and maybe you're a philosophically - have
a person here's what you got to do you got
to start doing the work do the work you can't
just listen to Theory all the time if you're a
fan of the theory and you're a conceptual person like
me and you're philosophically minded person like me the cost
that you need to pay is to do the work
that's the cost of being a philosopher you cannot just
be a philosopher sitting on your ass listening to theory
all day and reading a bunch of books right that
way lies a lot of misery and ultimately self-destruction that
way lies what they call crazy fox then jaco's then
you're going to turn into a crazy despicable Fox that's
what's going to happen you can have all this knowledge
all this theory but then you're not going to be
able to actually embody it and it's going to slowly
destroy you from the inside and you're going to wreak
havoc in your life and with everybody else around you
so be careful if you really love the theory then
honor the theory by putting it into practice and then
that will create more space for more advanced theory in
the future and in the future all be introducing a
lot of really cool but subtle and advanced concepts that
you will not be able to follow unless you do
the work now so start laying the practical foundation and
then from that it's going to be like we're building
a pyramid or a ziggurat right or being full building
layer upon layer upon layer with this work so if
you really like the subtle stuff then get the basics
down handle the fundamentals then you can have your dessert
you
