hey this is Leo for actualised org and this video
we're gonna talk about setting SMART goals smart goal setting
so what are smart goals we're going to break that
down and we're just gonna talk about how to set
goals in a smart way and we're going to talk
about how do you set powerful goals goals that you
can achieve versus the type of goals that most people
set which are not achieved and do not create the
kind of success that people want from their goal-setting process
so SMART goals by SMART goals smart is actually an
acronym spelled smart and it actually stands for something in
the goal setting process so this has been a really
widely publicized concept you've probably heard of SMART goals if
you work in a corporate environment or do any kind
of personal development work basically all across the world so
smart what does smart mean there are basically five points
here and it tells you what kind of goal it
basically defines the goal so that you know that if
your goal hits all five of these points then it's
a good goal and if it doesn't hit these five
points then it's a bad goal so let's talk about
it smart and I'm gonna list each one item each
letter in the word smart and then I'm going to
go through and in detail talking about each point so
first is specific the essence smart stands for specific your
goal needs to be specific the next point is M
measurable the next point is a attainable the next point
is are realistic and the final point is T timely
so those are the five points of a SMART goal
so you can literally use this as a checklist that's
how it's intended to be used is that once you
create a goal you use this rubric this checklist and
you go through and you ask yourself is it smart
is it specific measurable attainable realistic timely now you can
probably just from what I've said right there already get
a lot of value if you just go and analyze
all your goals based on that simple model without even
any further explanation because these these ideas are self explanatory
but let me go into some of the nuances here
and then I'm gonna actually give you my improved version
of the goal-setting process because I think that smart is
okay but I think there's a better way to think
about Cole's than to use this smart checklist and in
fact I don't really use it I don't find it
as valuable as some other ideas that I have so
smart specific I think actually this is the most valuable
component of the whole smart five part system is that
your goal needs to be specific and I do buy
into this idea I think it's really really important that
when you create a goal you try to specify it
in as much detail as possible the biggest reason that
people do not achieve their goals besides the fact that
they don't really set goals is that they're not specific
a vague goal like I want to lose some weight
or I want to get into a relationship or I
want to make more money or I want to improve
my my wardrobe like these are very vague goals if
you set a goal like that then what tends to
happen is you first of all I would not even
call this a goal this is not a goal this
is a vague desire that you have and a vague
desire is not a goal and it's not going to
accomplish anything like what a goal will accomplish to set
a good goal you need to be very specific that
means details as much imagery and as much how much
detail as you can so for example if you want
to live in a nice house instead of saying I
want to live in a nice house or a nice
place you specify where exactly do you want to live
what size of house like what location what city what
part of the city how many bedrooms like be very
very specific so maybe you want to live in San
Diego okay you want to live in San Diego what
part of San Diego do you want to live in
a suburb do you want a little bit condo do
you want to live in a high-rise do you want
to live in a duplex do you want to live
on the beach do you want to live in a
city where okay let's say you want to live in
a high-rise if you want to live in a high-rise
how many square feet should it be which direction should
be looking should have an ocean view should have a
city view should be near a good school should it
be near some clubs or some restaurants like what aren't
one of the details of all that how much should
it cost do you care how much it costs go
ahead and fill in all those blanks and what really
I find helps is actually visualize it picture it in
your mind play around with it use your mind as
kind of an experimentation chamber where you are are just
prototyping rapid prototyping your your ideal life what you want
for yourself so be very very specific about your goals
drill down on them this is huge the next point
is measurable how are you gonna know when you achieved
it this is pretty easy for example in the case
of this of living in in a high-rise you're gonna
know because you're sitting in it and you're looking out
your window at your ocean view let's say and it's
a 2,000 square foot condo in a high-rise so there
you are you know but it's important that you do
have that kind of memento fide so you can measure
that easily so if I ask you have you achieved
your your goal to live in San Diego you can
easily say yes or no you have some sort of
objective metric by which you can tell and I can
look at it and say yep you're right you did
or you didn't because I can say I can I
can ask you for your address and if your address
is not in that condo that you wanted then it's
very easy to tell for everyone not just you that
that goal did not come about or that it did
if you do have that address so make your stuff
specific and make your stuff measurable now measurable might be
a little bit more tricky for example in a business
you know maybe a goal that you have is that
you want to pull in more clients you want to
pull in more sales you want to pull in more
traffic to your website you want to pull in more
customers to your store right maybe you want to be
better known in your industry well what does it mean
to be better known in your industry how are you
gonna measure that and this has to be something that
a panel of judges let's say we have a pan
of judges sitting like the Supreme Court and we can
bring forth to them some sort of document or some
sort of evidence and say here we go look I
am now more reputable in my industry what would that
look like that might look like a news letter article
like a news magazine article written about you maybe you
get the front-page cover shot in in a trade journal
that you're part of maybe you have a website that
receives an X number of visitors every month and those
are industry related maybe you now work in a new
job where you're more visible you're more public maybe now
you have people calling you maybe you have two people
calling you every week asking you about your industry or
asking to work with you because you're so visible in
your industry so those are some specific points but you
can see that a lot of people will have this
goal of like yes I want to do better at
my job yes I want to be better in my
business yes I want to have more afford a in
my industry but then they don't they don't specify what
those what those points are so important measurable then attainable
is your goal something that you can attain all right
if I set the goal of flying to the moon
that's not something that's really attainable given my given my
skill sets given my desires it doesn't really align with
what I even want to do in my life so
it's not really something that I should be shooting for
so make sure that what you're going for is something
that is actually matching your talents matching your strengths matching
mere desires it's something that can be done the next
point are is realistic so again realistic means that you've
set it up in such a way that it's possible
to do given the expectations that you have so is
it possible to do in the timeframe that you set
it in right is it possible to do right now
given your skills or do you need to to radically
revamp your skills in order to do it you know
is it possible to do at all and that's a
bit of a tricky question because who knows what's really
possible I think most people limit ourselves in that respect
you know it probably is possible for me to fly
to the moon if I was really dedicated and I
really wanted to do it but not not right for
me right not right for me and certain things are
just too unrealistic in the way that we set it
up just the process of it I tend to find
is what's unrealistic is people expect some sort of fast
traximus or a shortcut like they want to earn a
million dollars in a month that is highly unrealistic but
if you want to earn a million dollars totally realistic
for anybody you just got to have a realistic plan
in place so get that into place and then the
last point of smart is of course the tea timely
that means you put a time frame on on whatever
it is you want to accomplish this is also called
time bound putting time boundaries so when are you gonna
have that condo in San Diego when are you gonna
have your your picture on the front page of a
trade magazine when are you gonna have a marriage we're
gonna have find your spouse by win by what day
be specific year week month day minute as specific as
you can get that's more specific the better all right
so that's smart we've covered every point I think it's
pretty clear about which each one of those means I
think the way that you use this is you simply
run down whatever goal you've got whether it's a goal
that you've got personally or for your company want a
product that you're working on and run through this process
and make sure that it hits all these points especially
the one I think I'd say about being specific you
want your goals to be very very specific so now
I'm gonna give you my thoughts really quickly and I'm
not gonna go into too depth much depth here I
don't have that much time about a better way to
set goals I find that the smart process is not
necessarily the best for me this is the essentials of
setting amazing goals all right you ready and it's really
simple one make sure your goals are specific yes they
do have to be specific so we're still keeping that
point next make sure your goals are huge big inspiring
telling goals these goals need to get you fired up
and excited and motivated don't set wimpy little small goals
those wimpy little small goals those realistic goals those layup
goals that you're setting those are actually gonna be harder
to accomplish than the big ones because they don't generate
any kind of excitement or passion or motivation within you
so make sure your goals are big then I would
say the third point make sure your goals are aligned
with you they have to be aligned you have to
really want them don't set a goal that's just for
example to earn a lot of money when what you
really want is spend time with family that's ridiculous you're
gonna waste years and years of your life chasing money
when what you really want is to spend time with
family in fact it's gonna be tracked from your family
time because you're new spending it all at your job
so be very clear about what it is that you
want this is where Values Clarification comes into play and
feelings identification identify what feelings you want to feel and
make sure that the goals that you set are going
to actually connect with your top values and your top
feelings the connection has to be there and the closer
the two are to each other the better you don't
want some long circuitous route where you say well if
I go and earn more money then I can start
another business then that business will earn even more money
and then that money will allow me to then retire
and then when I retire I can finally spend time
with my family yeah good luck doing that why would
you want to create that that's that's totally wrong if
you want to spend time with a family go directly
to what is gonna get you to spend time with
your family right okay and then the next point is
look at your goals visualize your goals in as much
detail as possible every single day for me I've made
a mental we for myself a law and my law
is that I don't consider myself having set a goal
unless I look at that goal and review that goal
for at least a minute or two every day so
if I set a goal the only way I can
even count it as a goal otherwise I say it's
just a vague desire it's only a goal if I
write it down I have to write it down and
I have to review it look at it think about
it every single day every single day until it's accomplished
otherwise it's not a goal it's just a big desire
I've made this rule for myself because it's too easy
to not write stuff down it's too easy to be
wishy-washy it's too easy to be vague and then nothing
happens so that is my my little version of the
smart process so that's how I think I would approach
setting goals I think this is what gets you the
biggest biggest result if you follow these points that I
mentioned all right so this is it I'm at a
time I'm gonna sign off please leave me your comments
tell me what kind of goals you're setting and how
this has helped you and then please like it and
share it that's why I release this content for free
