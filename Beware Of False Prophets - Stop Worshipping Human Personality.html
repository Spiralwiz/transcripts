hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
video we're going to talk about how to beware of
false prophets eloquence at its greatest pitch leaves little room
for reason this is one of my favorite quotes from
David Hume and one of my favorite quotes of all
time and especially when I was growing up and I
was going through high school and through college I really
adopted this quote and I really fell in love with
this quote because I felt like there was something so
true to this there's so much so much nonsense so
much disinformation that comes when people get sucked in to
the cult of personality and that's what I want to
talk about in this video because this is a very
dangerous thing that leaves many people astray in their personal
development dooms them for life makes them lost for life
makes them believe stupid ideas makes them buy into dogmas
makes them angry bitter resentful defensive egotistical violent and many
many more negative qualities like this which we want to
avoid with personal development actually the quote goes on Humes
quote goes on and it goes like this it says
eloquence and its greatest pitch leaves little room for reason
or reflection but addresses entirely to the desires and affections
captivating the willing hearers and subduing their understanding which is
exactly the danger of it when something sounds really nice
when something sounds very flowering when someone's very eloquent when
someone's a good speaker when someone can make a really
good case present something beautifully someone knows how to pitch
something to you that's usually when you got to wash
out the most because all of that all that talk
it's not letting you come in contact with the truth
via direct experience what you've got no matter how well
said something is is what you've got is you've got
hearsay you've got someone reporting something to you and you
always have to keep this in mind so the key
here is to understand that there is a cult of
human personality and human nature is such it's like your
mind and your brain is literally programmed hardwired for following
strong leaders this is how the human species is just
evolved we evolved presumably because in the past we used
to live in tribes and in these tribes these tribes
were run by leaders so there was always the few
who were passing down Authority and information to the many
and the many would work for the few and there
was a hierarchy like a caste system this is just
part of our evolution and our history now the problem
is that in modern times we've really come a long
ways and we've shed a lot of that which is
great it's amazing I think it's one of the most
important developments in human history and evolution is the doing
a way of these caste systems and false Authority but
still our brains leave us very susceptible to giving authority
to people very easily and just trusting that authority and
not just Authority but it's like it's not just we're
like buying in and believing from people I mean that
definitely happens but I'm actually even more interested in this
video to talk about the more nuanced case where you're
an intelligent human being you're smart you're well educated you
went to college you view yourself as independent you do
a lot of personal development and yet still you fall
into the trap of the cult of human personality and
this is simply that you're really persuaded by someone's likeability
and someone's charisma this is something that's very difficult to
separate yourself out from so for example you're watching a
video on YouTube someone's presenting some sort of information or
point to you maybe it's me maybe if somebody else
does it matter now you're listening to this person this
person can have a different manner different style different personality
they can be funny they can be they can be
abrasive they can be very calm and peaceful it doesn't
really matter what their style is but inevitably what's gonna
happen is that you're gonna resonate to certain styles and
personalities more than you are to others and you're gonna
tend to make this mistake of saying well I really
like this person he really resonates with me there's something
that like he really understands where I'm coming from or
she the way she talks is it's funny and interesting
and I really like it it's really humorous to me
or whatever so there what's happening is that your tastes
are getting played on and that's fine there's nothing wrong
with liking someone that you're listening to I mean I
do that too but you have to be very careful
because it's a very slippery slope and what tends to
happen is that as soon as you fall in love
with the style and manner and personality of this person
and maybe you even then fall in love with his
ideas too so you know it just kind of like
starts this the slippery slope and then sooner or later
what's happening is that you're just seating your own authority
and mind over to that person and you're not all
the sudden being as analytical and as critical as you
ought to be of their ideas I say this about
myself and I say this about other people right I
just like I see sometimes in the comments section someone
say oh you're a genius or oh this person is
brilliant or look at this like it's this sense of
of worship right it's it's worshipping of false prophets that's
basically what it is you have to be really careful
about this whole style thing because the style and manner
of what is being communicated to you if it's a
serious communication is irrelevant it really doesn't matter and if
you're attracted to the style this will get you very
lost in life very lost and even if you're attracted
to the ideas because you feel like oh this idea
it's really cool idea I always thought that way myself
I know this is right or yeah this you know
this is just a very important articulated idea you have
to be careful about that too because just because an
idea is beautiful just because it sounds nice to you
just because it's simple and elegant and eloquent says nothing
about the validity of that idea and even if that
idea is valid that's hearsay no matter how you slice
it it's always hearsay everything I tell you including what
I'm telling you right now is just hearsay you have
to have an independence your own critical thinking your own
faculties to analyze all this stuff and piece it together
for yourself do not outsource this to anybody else very
very dangerous I see people outsourcing this and just saying
you know let that person handle it and usually they
you don't do it consciously so you don't say that
eh I'll just let him do all the critical thinking
for me that usually is not how it happens because
that's too obvious your brain is very subtle about this
in the ways that he gets deceived politicians will do
it religious leaders will do it YouTube celebrities will do
it self-help gurus will do it spiritual gurus would do
it leaders at work will do it your business partner
might do it the person in your marriage might do
it it doesn't really matter this is how humans work
is that we we try to persuade and influence each
other and persuasion we always think and we tell ourselves
well persuasion I get persuaded by logical arguments and I
get persuaded by the meat of the matter but that's
very rarely the case usually if you're very self honest
and this takes a lot of open-mindedness and self honesty
to admit because you can see yourself doing it when
you're persuading somebody else when you want something from them
it's very difficult to stay objective it's very difficult to
stick to the issues usually what happens is you start
to diverge and talk about all sorts of irrelevant stuff
basically you're building up that cult of personality you're trying
to persuade people persuasion doesn't happen usually through logical argument
it's hard to persuade someone through the logical argument it's
a lot easier to persuade them through emotions and so
that's how persuasion usually happens is through emotional Appeals what
are some examples of this I mean I read a
lot of comments I read pretty much all comments that
you guys leave me under the videos and on my
website and I hear stuff you know who likes what
who doesn't like what what you guys are into who
you're watching who you're following and also you know I
follow some of these people too and I think that
some people are really great I mean I love learning
from experts so this is not to say that you
shouldn't learn from experts I think there's a literally thousands
of experts that if I could just send you to
all those experts that would be amazing and if you
actually were committed enough to study from each one of
those experts and you put the time and effort into
it I would send you to all those experts but
most of you don't have that time and the point
here is that experts are cool just like don't seed
everything to them don't put them up on a pedestal
don't idolize them this is not necessary in fact this
is very dangerous to you so here are some examples
a lot of you guys who watch my videos also
watch artisty videos or are HD videos are great I've
watched many of them but RSD is definitely a cult
of personality that you have to be really careful about
a lot of the rsd instructors they're charismatic they're funny
they have interesting and cool ideas and a lot of
that stuff blows your mind and it's great but also
I really see this kind of like cult of personality
happening there and I notice it myself because I watched
a lot of their videos and I really just like
it get sucked into it to the point where my
mind stops working independently which is a very bad thing
and as much as RSD talks about groupthink that's a
really big theme throughout all our st content is groupthink
groupthink how dangerous it is but actually RSD is a
very dangerous pit of groupthink so be careful about that
and I know personally a lot of people who are
involved with RSD I've met pretty much all the instructors
face-to-face and so I know these people and I know
the people that follow these people and there's this definite
tendency to just kind of like buy it you know
buy into the group thing Elliott Hulse I love Elliott
Hulse but again don't idolize him if he gives you
good ideas great the ideas are good let the ideas
stand on their own merits but not on his personality
because he's got a great person that personality is very
attractive that personality is like oh yeah I want to
be like him or he really inspires me that's great
but separate that out right you can be inspired by
Elliott Hulse but separate that out from the merit of
what he's talking about and I think he talks about
a lot of great stuff has amazing merit so you
know really no real bones to pick with him other
than that you can take heli it holds his material
and turn it into crap by turning it into this
false prophet situation Eckhart Tolle I think this is a
big one too a lot of people talk about Eckhart
Tolle as though like oh my god at heart Olay
amazing read the power of now read his other books
and it's like all it blows your mind that's you
know so enlightening and Eckhart Tolle is an amazing human
being he's enlightened human being you can watch his videos
you can read his books great I recommend it again
don't turn him into a false prophet and by the
way all of these people the people that I'm talking
about they will tell you the same thing themselves right
they actually faced this problem themselves because they have a
lot of followers they have a lot of viewers and
they'll tell you this themselves at least if they're very
honest they should be telling you this they should be
sensitive to this kind of stuff Tony Robbins a lot
of people love Tony Robbins people talking about Tony Robbins
because he's kind of like the the father of modern
personal development of self-help he's just like the easy example
to use and that's great and I mean I love
Tony Robbins I watched a lot of his stuff I
started on Tony Robbins material the first self-help book that
I read was a Tony Robbins book or actually was
a CD program of his so I mean that's awesome
but again don't think that Tony Robbins has every aspect
of life nailed and that he understands every aspect of
life because he doesn't I can I can find new
areas where Tony Robbins is deficient in his understanding of
life and that's fine that I'm not trying to say
like I'm better than Tony around like I honestly don't
care like I don't want to compare myself to these
people I'm just saying like don't just like seed blind
Authority to these people even though they have amazing accomplishments
I mean the stuff that Tony Robbins is accomplished I
would not accomplish probably in 10 lifetimes he's a very
notorious guy he's had amazing talent he's amazing speaker he
can do amazing things on stage and I'm sure he
helps a lot of his clients and stuff in really
powerful ways but don't turn him into a false prophet
you can also of course go back to the old-school
prophets the actual prophets Jesus Buddha Muhammad whoever else you
might want to follow from your you know based on
your religion or your tradition in your culture even these
guys you might think well but these guys are the
original prophets no they're not the original prophets in fact
these guys the way that that they have been false
prophet eyes turn into false prophets by all the people
that came after them after thousands of years it's really
turned into a travesty real travesty and if you read
for example the writings of Buddha you can see that
he's very much against this kind of stuff very much
against it Jesus I'm pretty sure he would be appalled
at what has been done with with his teachings after
2,000 years because it's been turn is it just complete
nonsense these kind of people they don't want you to
take them as prophets it's actually a very egotistical thing
to want to be a prophet to be put on
some sort of pedestal to think that you're special and
to use this kind of authority to influence people like
a self honest intellectually honest person is never going to
want to do that it's not a like it's just
a very disgusting way to lead others and it's not
that they're trying to fool you I think that actually
what happens here is not that any of these people
that we talked about is fooling you in any way
most of them are pretty honest individuals and they're doing
the right thing the problem is with you it's not
really with them you're the one who likes their personality
so much that you want to idolize them and you
want to think that they're amazing and you want think
things that are special than they're unique and there's something
about them that's like oh man they're a genius there's
just like something about this person like Oh Albert Einstein
Albert Einstein he genius I could never be like that
or he could never match that this is this stuff
you got to really be careful of this issue of
authority authority is important because what all these people have
in common people who influence lots of people what they
have is they have authority and the thing we understand
about Authority is that there's only one real Authority and
that all other authorities are fake authorities real Authority is
truth truth with a capital T and I'll talk more
about that other videos because this is a very important
idea and very people very many people are confused about
what truth with a capital T actually is and what
it means but just briefly truth with the capital T
is direct experience personal direct experience by you it's not
even that you can trust yourself to analyze the experience
that's already a step removed from truth although that would
be much better than what most are you guys are
doing which is living your life based on hearsay what
other people are telling you truth is direct experience it's
direct insight of the question and matter at hand so
even scientific knowledge which you might say has the pinnacle
of truth even this doesn't qualify really as truth it's
not real truth it's hearsay which is masqueraded under a
kind of an assertion of truth it's really a form
of persuasion that's what scientific truths are real truth is
direct experience of it so for example if you sit
down and you actually do the science experiment yourself and
you see what's happening there and you see the truth
of it there you got a taste of the real
truth that's real authority and notice that real Authority is
impersonal there's nothing personal about it it has nothing to
do with human nature or human beings it's impersonal it's
not even contained in language language doesn't carry truth very
well of course we have to rely on language we
have to rely on hearsay because there's just so much
stuff to know there's so many experiments to run that
we couldn't possibly run them all in our own lives
it would take us a million lifetimes to do it
so we have to rely on hearsay and of course
then there's the whole game about well which hearsay is
accurate and which ones are not which hearsay is not
accurate and you know that's a whole that's a whole
field of study you can go in there and start
to study and analyze all this stuff and compare the
stuff this is a passion of mine I spent a
lot of years comparing and studying different ideas different philosophies
I was a philosophy major for this reason because I
was really interested in dissecting and comparing and contrasting all
these different ideas and cosmologies and ways of thinking and
metaphysics and all this stuff and you know religion and
philosophy was just very fascinating to compare and contrast all
this stuff and so you know you'll do that but
don't trick yourself into thinking that just because you do
some analysis on the hearsay that you've actually got real
Authority real authority comes from direct experience this also means
that any authority that you give to a human being
is false and fake Authority even if this human being
is a really nice stand-up honest guy and he's really
funny and charming and he's actually telling you accurate and
true things that's still a fake Authority and that authority
sometimes it's him who appropriates this Authority but a lot
of times it's you who gives him that authority because
your mind is designed to follow sometimes it leads but
a lot of times it's designed to follow even leaders
are also great followers so just because you have a
leadership position does not make you immune there's still probably
somebody else out there that you're idolizing who you turn
into a false prophet because you want to give them
this this fake Authority it's like a constant battle in
your mind you have to stay vigilant throughout your entire
life to this thing it never really goes away you
have to stay vigilant and what I see is people
just are not vigilant and they want to relinquish their
vigilance and they just want to sit whatever I'll just
kind of coast through life and they end up coasting
through life and getting themself stuck into a lot of
philosophical mental masturbation just a real quagmire of conceptual and
also what this does is this creates dogma this creates
firm entrenched beliefs which close your mind down so that
your mind is not open enough now to explore other
areas of life that you haven't considered before and you
might think that well this is not too impactful to
my result into my development into my success in life
but let me tell you that this is incredibly impactful
and in fact one of the missions of actualized org
that I'm gonna be promoting more and more as I
shoot more videos is really open mindedness and like getting
away from the Dogma because dogma and closed mindedness is
one of the most dangerous things and one of the
things that really cripples your personal development the most it's
really dangerous on a personal level it's also dangerous on
a social level on a social level it could cause
real disasters the other thing interesting thing that I've been
really experiencing the last years I've been getting more followers
and my youtube channels been growing you know that's been
kind of cool I've never thought of myself as having
some celebrity status or anything but actually now like if
I go out sometimes people will meet me and will
recognize me like hey you you're that guy I know
you from somewhere that's always funny to me I just
goes like oh like I can't believe that someone would
recognize me but I've had people like recognize me at
the gym and stuff it's funny you know it's fun
it's cool but the one thing that I'm really recognized
in studying how people develop followings how people build YouTube
channels and how people build websites and how people build
you know political followings and stuff which you start to
discover is that authority is very easy to manufacture it's
really easy to manufacture and what's shocking is that people
don't understand just how easy it is to manufacture this
stuff it's really really easy and the reason that is
is because your mind is very quick to jump to
assumptions about people who you perceive out in the public
but you don't actually know so for example it's funny
because I'll watch people watching my videos and then below
in the comments they'll leave some sort of comment where
they say something like it's hard to come up with
a specific example but like the gist of their comment
will be something along the lines of oleo you know
he's got this part of his life handled he's got
it all handled like for example I have this videos
that's called how to stop caring what people think about
you it's a really one of my most popular videos
people love that video and in the comments so people
will write oh you know I shouldn't be thanking Leo
because he doesn't care what other people think of it
and this is like so ridiculous I can't believe that
people would assume just because I shoot a video called
how to stop thinking what other people think of you
and I talk about it you know I I bring
up some good points there I understand the topic but
that doesn't mean that I literally don't care what people
think about me that would be a very difficult state
for me to achieve I mean I'm always chipping away
at it but a lot of the stuff that I
talk to you guys about I'm not perfect with that
yeah I mean you understand that right I'm not perfect
at it at all so if you watch the meditation
video of mine I tell you to sit up straight
and I tell you to meditate for 20 minutes and
I tell you to clear your mind of ideas and
and thoughts and stuff what you tend to do is
you tend of sue Oh Leo Leo does that perfectly
and when I tell you to stop caring about what
people think about you you'll be like Oh Leo does
that perfectly and when I tell you that you should
that you should go and exercise or eat healthy or
something else like that you're gonna say oh he's telling
me because he's got it nailed he's got it locked
down and you know at some of this stuff I'm
pretty good at some of these things I've really worked
hard and I developed some really good habits but I'm
fallible like everybody else and not always do I have
this stuff locked down and it's funny because when I
see people assuming this stuff about me I start to
see all the sudden my mind it's like oh my
god that's how it happens that's how the false prophet
thing works that's why it spreads it's like a virus
that spreads through society because what happens is that someone
can be very genuine and honest and come up here
and tell you just very precisely all the stuff without
fabricating anything but what you're gonna do what your mind
is gonna do because you don't really know the person
you're making unconscious assumptions about this person all the time
and then when you meet that person face to face
maybe you have dinner with him like in a more
private intimate setting get to really know him you'd be
like oh damn you're totally different than what I thought
you were like because see you're watching me through a
little screen right here what I'm standing on our camera
that's like almost like wearing a certain mask that I
wear I try to be authentic here but still like
it's not the authentic meaning because of course I'm playing
up a little bit to my audience and of course
I know you have certain expectations for me and so
I have certain expectations for myself this is also kind
of like a business of mine so there's like a
lot of stuff that goes in here that doesn't allow
for like a totally genuine communication and also you're looking
at me in a very narrow context it's the window
it's very little window right you don't see me with
my family you don't see me with my with my
girlfriend you don't see me doing meditation you don't see
me doing a lot of this stuff and when I'm
doing those things you know I'm on a different headspace
I'm in a different mood I'm I'm behaving differently all
of us do that you can see this in yourself
when you're at work you behave in a different way
you have a certain mask that you put on when
you're at work when you're with your family you have
another mask that you put on there when you're with
your girlfriend or boyfriend then you have a certain mask
you put on there and so if I just observed
you only at work I wouldn't really get the full
picture of you I would have to observe you in
all these different areas to really get a good sense
of who you are as a human being and so
this is how the false prophet thing happens is because
when you don't have direct access to the person which
usually you don't write you don't really know for example
what Barack Obama is like you've never met him you've
only seen short snippets of him on TV in a
very very contrived setting you don't really know what George
Bush was like you don't really know what a sama
bin Laden was like you don't really know what Hitler
was like you don't really know what Jesus was like
or what the Buddha was like or what even Tony
Robbins is like I mean just cuz you you might
say well I've been a Tony Robbins event I seen
him in person well yeah maybe you've seen him in
person but you've seen him on stage in a huge
commercial setting with thousands of people watching him that's not
necessarily the real Tony Robbins have you seen Tony Robbins
when he's sitting with his wife or with his kids
yeah I imagine that would be very different Tony Robbins
you know maybe he's very authentic I believe he probably
is quite authentic and then he's probably got similarities between
how he interacts with his wife and his kids and
how he interacts with people but you know who knows
you don't know you just assume this you assume this
stuff but like there's no evidence to back it up
and what more interestingly is that the person you're assuming
it about doesn't even want you to assume it about
them so for example when people assume about me that
I don't care what other people think about me I
don't even want that because this is like a bird
that now I have to bear feels kind of heavy
because it's like oh damn like what if ever what
if someone ever saw me caring about what someone thinks
about me I would look like a hypocrite even though
I never went out there and said that I literally
don't care what people think about me it's just like
an assumption that someone put upon me you know that's
fine that's kind of the burden of being a public
figure and having people know you so you know I'm
not complaining about that I'm just saying that be careful
because it's you who's doing it it's you who's doing
it you're falling in love with the personality so the
bottom line is that number one no one is truly
authoritative no human being is authoritative number two is that
no human being is special number three is that no
human being is better than you number four is that
no human being is unbiased every human being is biased
every human being grows up in a culture in an
environment and within groupthink so even if the human being
that's communicating to you believes very honestly wholeheartedly believes that
everything they're telling you is true and accurate this does
not mean that they're immune from infecting you with their
groupthink and there are cultural influences and their traditions and
all that stuff is all still there in some people
less than others but it's all still there so the
biases are there there's commercial biases there's social biases they're
political biases there's personal biases there's a there's traditions and
cultures and religions there's so many biases that are being
communicated to you by each people that you watch and
that you admire so be really careful about that and
lastly is that no one is a genius I hear
this one thrown around like oh this person is untouchable
he's just a genius like pure brilliance as though you
couldn't arrive at that situation that place yourself so you
have to see yourself as just as capable as these
other people I want you to believe for example that
if you dedicate yourself hard enough and you work hard
enough that you can develop yourself to a really high
level within personal development you know whatever you think of
me I don't think of myself is like super personally
developed or whatever but like some people will say leo
are you are you self actualized to me this is
funny like self actualization is a process that continues for
your whole life there's no end point that you reach
but if you think that oh well Leo is pretty
self actualized and I would never be able to live
up to him like that's a really dangerous assumption you
should think that oh he's just a normal guy who's
just shooting videos sharing some information with me some of
his information is good some it's not so good let
me take the good stuff let me try it out
myself field test it apply it in my life and
I can become like him or I can become a
little different than him but whatever is you know I
can I can advance and develop and go even higher
that's they got to think you got to really flatten
the whole hierarchy thing there's no hierarchy in life nobody
is above you there's no like a magical Pope who's
infallible this is a really dangerous and silly idea and
the really bad news here is that you're listening to
all this and it's making perfect sense to you everything
I'm telling you this makes perfect sense but you're still
going to get lost you're still gonna fall prey to
this why because I notice myself falling prey to it
too even though I know of this stuff it's not
enough to just know it and to agree with it
you have to stay vigilant all the time and really
watch out for this cult of personality thing you got

the reason you really want to follow along is because
I really am excited about sharing these advanced mindsets with
you that help you to master understand your life are
really impassioned about helping you understand life I want you
to have this really big cohesive picture it's very accurate
that's very practical that you can use to create whatever
you want sometimes you talk about very practical stuff sometimes
we talk about more philosophical more abstract stuff it's not
immediately obvious how it applies to your life for example
this thing here a little bit more philosophical and kind
of mmm maybe profound or deep but uh but you
got to trust that all this stuff is gonna come
together for you like a giant puzzle that your assembly
every little piece comes together and so every week on

with this understanding of life you'll be able to self
actualize you'll be able to create the success the fulfillment
the peace the happiness you want the relationships you want
you know all that stuff starts with a very accurate
and deep understanding which I feel like a lot of
people are missing I know that because I've spent the
last five years developing this understanding for myself actually longer
because I in school I was really interested in this
stuff too so is if you take my schooling into
account it's probably more like 10 or 15 years and
I'm still I still feel like I'm just actually the
surface of understanding all the stuff that I need to
understand to really create the kind of life that I
want so I'm really excited about sharing that stuff with
you sign up for that because it's free you
