[Music] happy Halloween 2018 I've been actually wanting to try
out this costume for a while now for a few
years and I've been putting it off but here we
are hope you guys like it it'll kick out of
it but be careful don't be seduced by this clever
little costume because what we have today is a very
serious topic we're gonna be talking about the radical implications
of oneness and I want to tell you in particular
about one very serious and rather scary implication of oneness
that you probably haven't thought about before even though you've
studied non-duality and you've heard about it and you heard
me talking about it but it's one thing to to
kind of dabble in on duality it's another thing to
really start to comprehend and contemplate all the full ramifications
of what non duality means most people have no idea
what non duality means or what oneness means oneness can
sound like a very fluffy Wu sort of phrase like
we can say oh we're all one we're all one
it's like we're all hippies and we're all one and
it's love for everybody and you probably have heard people
talking about about this before and maybe it struck you
as just some clever little poetic saying or just some
wishful line of thinking but I want you to take
it a little bit more seriously than that what if
you were to take it literally non-duality what does non-duality
really mean it means non-dual as in not - or
Advaita not - what is not to mean fundamentally it
means that there's no boundary or distinction or separation between
you and anything else that you might consider other than
you so literally what this means is there's no boundary
between me and you you and a tree you and
a car you and a house you and Adolf Hitler
that's what that means that's a pretty radical thing people
don't think this through I want to help you to
think through the full ramifications of this because this is
very eye-opening and this can really change your entire orientation
towards life because the way that most people live life
and the way that you're living life even if you
have heard about non-duality even if you agree that there
is such a thing called enlightenment even if you had
a low mystical experience here or there you still fundamentally
live from a dualistic orientation of you over here and
everything else the rest of the world somewhere out there
the bad guys out there the evil ones out there
all the demons that you create are somehow out there
and separate from you that's how most people live and
how they think in fact their entire thinking process is
fundamentally permeated by this assumption that there just is this
thing of like me over here and others over there
the bad guys are out there somewhere and that's because
we from our culture just pick up this attitude that
there are these separate individual selves like myself over here
and yourself over there and that there are therefore multiple
subjects within the universe who are looking at the universe
and some of these subjects they're the good guys they're
the kind people the loving people and some of these
guys they're the evil ones the psychopaths the crazy ones
the terrorists the the murderers the corrupt dictators and this
source of stuff but that's all duality non-duality means that
there's only one subject in the whole universe what that
literally means is that the thing that is looking through
my eyes right now the thing within me that is
conscious of this room that I'm standing in is precisely
the same thing within you which is conscious of room
that you're sitting in what is that thing what is
that subject well that's the transcendental I that's the ultimate
i am-ness of which we talk about when we talk
about spiritual truths and we talk about the the ultimate
self the the absolute self that subject it's pure subjectivity
it's not a thing per se there's not a thing
inside of you that's looking through your eyes and experiencing
everything actually what's inside of you is a void it's
nothingness so how could it be that the thing inside
of me is the same thing as that inside of
you because it's nothingness it's void the void that primordial
void of consciousness that has always exists that's eternal that's
ever-present that existed before the Big Bang and will exist
long after the entire universe is destroyed that is the
ultimate absolute subject which is experiencing the entire universe in
all of its infinite forms of which right now your
current lifetime your current incarnation is one see you have
to be careful though to distinguish between this Universal absolute
i am-ness the self with a capital S and the
self with a lowercase s or the ego the ego
is who you think you are when I point to
you the ego is the self image you have the
ego is the ownership you have where you feel that
you have over your life so if I ask you
whose life is that that's happening right there you'll say
well mine of course that's ego that's the lowercase s
self so of course your ego is not the same
as my ego but the thing that's aware of the
ego the thing that transcends the ego the thing that
was there before the ego that thing is the same
in me as it is and you they're literally identical
that literally means that I am you not in a
metaphorical sense literally so let me ask you this have
you ever wondered why you're you and why you're not
me or why you weren't born as some starving hungry
kid in Africa or why you weren't born Napoleon or
a billionaire or a u.s. president why are you living
that life right now if they're wondered this very interesting
philosophical question sometimes I get the sense that people might
speculate about this question but they do a purely in
a philosophical sort of way they don't really take it
seriously they never seriously consider that there could be a
real answer to this question and the answer is really
simple you are you and you are also mean and
you are also everybody else well you have to understand
what that really means what does it mean for you
to be you for you to be you means that
you're living that life right there and you're experiencing every
single word that I'm saying right now and you're conscious
of it and that you had your particular life history
you will bore in a particular City to particular parents
and went to a particular school and got a particular
job and married a particular spouse and all of this
that you consider your life that you have memories of
that's what you consider you that's the small self so
why are you experiencing that and not my life why
weren't you born in my city why weren't you at
my school why aren't you running actualized not Oregon creating
these episodes why aren't you looking through the camera right
now the way that I am well you are you
understand you are but for you to be me you
have to actually become me which means you have to
stop being you you get this you get how this
works you are literally me and what I'm experiencing right
now is you experiencing me now the mistake people here
make is they think that well Leo if it was
true what you're saying that I am you that means
I should be able to look through your eyes right
now and have all of your personal experiences as memories
no be very careful here if you had access to
all of my personal memories and experiences that means you
wouldn't be me nor would you be you you would
be some third kind of hybrid creature which is a
synthesis of your and my individual egoic experiences that would
be some sort of third thing you would be that
thing then you wouldn't be me to be me means
that you're fully me that means when you become me
you no longer have memories of having been yourself for
example so it's not like you can be in my
body and in my mind and still retain your memories
of being you and having gone to your school and
to your family and all the stuff that you did
in your life you're not gonna have access to that
what it means to be me is that I don't
have access to those things that's what I am and
what it means for you to be you is that
I can't access you you see this is a virtual
partition within consciousness that's what it is so when you
understand this what you understand is that literally you are
me right now one day in the entire let's say
history of the cosmos you will experience what it's like
to start actualize org and to shoot hundreds of videos
and all the the joy and tribulation and suffering that
I go through creating all this content thinking all this
stuff up and one day you will be standing here
right where I'm standing speaking to this camera saying the
exact words that I'm saying right now having exactly my
experiences in fact it's happening right now that's what's happening
right now the only problem is is that you're probably
not conscious of it because you're so glued to being
you and your ideas of being me or that it's
like you still stay you but then somehow you're also
able to access my experiences that's some sort of third
thing now you might say leo well could I be
that thing then too is there gonna be a situation
in the universe in the history of the universe where
I'm gonna experience you and both and me as this
hybrid thing maybe maybe I don't know maybe I guess
it's possible see but you have to understand what this
u really entails what your life really entails it's partitioned
consciousness partitions itself for the benefit of you right because
look if you had the access to the memories of
every single human that has ever lived you wouldn't be
able to live a productive life you wouldn't actually be
able to be you you wouldn't be able to individuate
yourself because you would be lost in a sea of
of memories of stuff that has happened to people billions
of times throughout human history right your your mind would
be so inundated you would literally go insane from all
of this it would be too much and it wouldn't
be conducive to you living your individual life so there's
utility in partitioning consciousness because that's how you create a
sort of individuality but you have to remember that this
individuality that you have been experiencing for the duration of
this lifetime it's a pseudo individuality it's not real it's
a virtual partition it's not an objective partition it's a
subjective partition and there's nothing fundamental about it in the
way that many materialists think they think that there this
individuated creature within Aladin oh no such thing no such
thing one of the most radical implications of non-duality is
precisely what i'm saying here and it is that you
will experience everything by the time your time is up
everything everything try to understand just how profound this statement
is that you will experience everything now by you what
do I mean - I mean the ego no the
ego will die the ego will not experience everything the
ego is one experience within everything so of course one
experience within everything can't experience everything but you as the
capital s self you as that I am you as
the Godhead this the subjective light of awareness that is
shining through you right now that is being conscious of
the words that I'm speaking that you the enlightened self
that will experience everything everything without exception it will experience
an infinity of experiences and forms in fact it already
has I'm speaking here as though we're talking about linear
time and you might get the sense that well if
I die then there's gonna be another lifetime another life
after that it's gonna be this linear sequence I'm gonna
take billions of years to experience everything yeah you can
think of it that way because we have to as
we're talking about this we have to put it into
linear time because that's that's how the human mind and
human operating system works is we only understand cause and
effect through linear time under ordinary conventional states of consciousness
but that's not really what's going on really what's going
on is it's all being experienced simultaneously as though you
took a pencil and you you made a little dot
on a big piece of paper a little on a
white piece of paper you made a dot and in
this dot is contained every single experience that can ever
possibly be experienced and it all happened in the blink
of an eye at once of course within that little
dot is contained a bunch of linear time lines independent
linear time lines which seemed to expand and unfold across
time so a really good metaphor for understanding this is
I think of it this way imagine a film reel
that contains every single film that has ever been recorded
in Hollywood throughout all of human history imagine we took
every film reel and we spliced them together into one
long supermassive Ultra comprehensive film reel and not only will
this film reel contain every film ever shot but also
every film that could ever be shot in the future
it contains the possibility space of all film ever such
that on this reel is contained everything that you could
ever possibly do within film it contains every possible way
that Star Wars could have been shot by George Lucas
it contains every possible way that any movie you've ever
seen could have been shot every single angle it could
have been shot and every single actor that could have
been in the movie every single different word of dialogue
that could have been substituted by some writer every single
different plot twist I could have been invented so you
see this is an infinite we're talking about an infinite
film reel there's an infinite amount of possibilities just for
one movie there's an infinite number of ways for example
to have shot star wars an infinite number of actors
you could have substituted for the ones that we know
and an infinite number of dialogue choices and subplots and
so forth so that's just Star Wars but now take
every possible movie that could ever be invented so now
we have this infinite reel so this is very interesting
you see now this reel contains everything that could possibly
be and that's like reality and then what we're gonna
do is we're going to take this reel and we're
gonna play it on a projector and what this projector
is fundamentally is just light it's shining light through each
individual frame of this infinite reel it goes on forever
to infinity that's that's how long it is so the
light is shining through this particular frame right here and
maybe this frame here is one particular frame of one
of the star wars episodes and it's shining through and
now you get to see that frame and that is
like what's happening right now that's what I'm experiencing right
now as I'm standing here that's what you're experiencing right
there as you're sitting there watching this video is you're
experiencing one of those frames and what your life is
your entire lifetime up from when you were born till
today what that has been is it has been one
chunk of this infinite reel that has been playing which
is just like one movie but there's like an infinite
number of movies see and so you're playing through it
and it looks linear it appears as though it's happening
one at a time but also what you can do
is you can take sort of a higher level perspective
a meta perspectives kind of zoom out and what you'll
see is that the the infinite reel just exists as
one solid entity which contains everything it's like one singularity
it is that dot that you made with the pencil
on a piece of paper you see in it already
is contained all the timelines all the possibilities everything it's
all right there and then you realize oh yeah I
am that entire film reel I'm gonna play through that
thing an infinite number of times over and over and
over again I'm gonna I'm gonna go through every single
iteration that's possible I'm an experiencing I'm gonna experience everything
that could ever possibly be experienced that's what we mean
by everything and in this case what is the thing
that's doing the experiencing of the film reel it simply
is the light it's not there's not actually a projector
or a physical mechanical projector which is a separate object
from the film reel because again we're saying this everything
is non dual right so a duelist would think well
there's the projector which is like the self the ultimate
self and then there's the film reel it's not quite
right because again that would require a boundary or a
division between the two so with non duality what we
mean is that all divisions and all boundaries collapse such
that there's not even a division anymore between the projector
and the film reel itself so imagine that the film
reel is the projector or another way you can think
of it is that pure light is shining through the
frame and illuminating the frame and in fact the frame
just is the pure light you see and that pure
light that's what we mean by the enlightened self or
the absolute self or the ultimate i am-ness that thing
and notice you know light isn't intangible light is what
another word for light is spirit or consciousness or awareness
and so that's the case but even as I explained
all this do you still realize the full implications of
what I'm saying let's make it very explicit I want
you to imagine that you will experience what it's like
to be a woman gang-raped you will experience what it's
like to be tortured in the Spanish Inquisition you will

every animal that man has ever inflicted every act of
torture horror and pain beyond anything you could possibly imagine
or dream up and everything that you hate you will
become that's what non-duality means but that's not all it
gets even stranger this is only half the story not
only will you be every victim you will also be
every perpetrator which means you will be Hitler issuing the
orders to build the concentration camps that will be you
you will be the Roman senators stabbing Julius Caesar you

spouse who divorces just to get all the money you
will be every perpetrator of evil that has ever existed
that's what non-duality really means no Leo this is impossible
this is crazy you've lost that you've gone off the
deep end you're just wrong there's no way this could
be true Leo you're misinterpreting non-duality is not what nine
new ality says this is not what the buddhist scriptures
tell us this is not what Eckhart Tolle says about
non-duality think it through for yourself though what does it
really mean to say that reality is non-dual just what
do you think oneness means if it doesn't mean this
you see it's just that the magnitude of one this
hasn't really hit you yet it hasn't sunk in for
you one is still just an intellectual exercise some philosophical
theory or something like this or even if you've had
a glimpse here or there of some version of non-duality
it's still the depth of it hasn't fully hit you
yet and now you start to realize why the truth
the truth of the capital T is so rare and
why it isn't possible for this truth to be mainstream
see and you also see why there's so much controversy
and misunderstanding about what God is because what I'm describing
here is I'm describing God God is everything everything everything
with no exceptions everything you learned in history everything you
saw in the movies everything you've ever experienced and every
experience that you've ever heard from other people God is
all of that and in infinite more see with no
exceptions whatsoever God is that infinite film reel sitting on
a shelf and what you're experiencing right this second is
one frame of that infinite film reel here we are
now you might be wondering Leo but but why am
I not experiencing the whole thing if what you're saying
is true I should be experiencing the whole thing but
then who's gonna experience the individual frames who's gonna experience
your life you see for God to be able to
experience the entire freakin film reel he has to go
through it one frame at a time at some point
for God to know what it's like to be you
he has to literally live your life which is what
he's doing right now I mean not he it you
are it this God is not separate from you of
course you're it you're living through it right now that's
what you're doing so the reason you're you is because
someone has to be you who else is gonna take
your shoes who else is gonna look through your eyes
there's only one subject to look through your eyes there's
only one subject to look through my eyes there's only
one subject there's only one light only one projector to
project through all of these frames imagine telling this to
a Jewish Holocaust survivor telling him that he will literally
be Hitler could you imagine telling the rape victim that
she will literally be her own rapist can you imagine
telling an evangelical Christian that he was literally the one
who nailed Christ to the cross can you imagine telling
a conservative that he will be one of the 9/11
hijackers or an illegal alien for Mexico or a communist
can you imagine accepting for yourself that you will literally
be that corrupt politician that you despised the most which
politician do you spies Hillary Clinton Donald Trump somebody else
well what if you're them can you imagine telling a
Greenpeace liberal that he will be a corporate tycoon funding
the military-industrial complex can you imagine telling a corporate CEO
that he will poison his own child with his pursuit
of maximum profits and the pollution that creates can you
imagine convincing someone for example like Jordan Peterson that he
will be Lenin Mao Stalin a social justice warrior a
feminist a transgender student how do you think that conversation
would go you think you would like that you think
you would agree with that can you imagine telling a
Sam Harris that he will be a fundamentals fundamentalist evangelical
or an Islamic terrorist how do you think that conversation
will go he think he's going to accept that you
think he's gonna agree with me you think anyone's gonna
agree with me can you imagine telling any of these
people that this is what God is that this is
what goodness is that this is what beauty is that
this is what love is that this is what truth
is that this is the ultimate truth you think they're
gonna object you think they're gonna have some excuses you
think they're gonna have some rationalizations for why I'm wrong
the ego cannot handle this truth because the ultimate truth
is just too much it's way too much it's way
too much the magnitude the magnitude of it just is
is utterly staggering staggering beyond your wildest imagination of what
reality could be when you realize this it's way too
radical it's outrageous it's utterly politically incorrect it's terrifying it
will terrify you it'll scare the [ __ ] out
of you the question is can you handle that can
you handle the truth are you open enough for this
truth to reveal itself to you most people aren't see
most people are way too self-righteous and that self-righteousness is
precisely what stands in the way of realizing the truth
of non-duality and the ultimate answer to the question of
how come existence why existence why is there something rather
than nothing the answer is there it is accessible I've
accessed it other people have accessed it but it requires
an enormous degree of open-mindedness and a willingness to surrender
yourself righteousness and a willingness to dissolve all of your
boundaries to experience this truth you understand that to experience
the entire real all at once requires that you surrender
your attachment to the particular frames that you're attached to
within that real which means that you need to be
able to surrender your life your birth and your sense
of death and all of your memories and all of
your attachments to who you think you are you have
to surrender all of that if you want to access
the entire real that's what it means to access the
entire real you access everything at once you can't just
stay who you were and access the real that wouldn't
be accessing the real so what I mean by yourself
righteousness standing in the way is of course that all
of your hatred all of your judgment and all of
your demonization that all of this you will have to
recognize as being a lie as being a smokescreen that
was erected by your ego that prevents you from realizing
this truth so the reason I gave you a list
of all those people who I wanted you to imagine
to explain this truth to who would never accept it
why wouldn't they accept it it's precisely because they're so
attached to their hatred their judgment their criticism in their
demonization and they've made careers and entire identities and their
entire lives have been turned into this process of judging
the other and they are therefore fundamentally committed to the
dualistic orientation towards life what they're doing really is they're
denying their full identity as God or as everything whereas
infinity and that's what you've been doing your whole life
every single time you've hated judged demonized or criticized anybody
really what you've been doing is you've been denying your
own self because your true identity is not that thing
that you think you were born as it's not the
family you grew up with it's not your nation it's
not your race it's not your ethnicity it's not whether
you're rational or irrational it's not what religion you believe
it's not whether you're an atheist or whoever else it's
not even whether you're human it is everything literally everything
infinity but you see this is so much it's too
much it's too much for you what you want is
you want something small and comfortable something manageable you want
to just be you your memories your little life you're
a little cushy position that you've constructed for yourself in
your life you see your identity that's what you've spent
your entire life developing is your particular identity whether it's
a religious identity a political identity a scientific identity or
anything else like that see you've been denying your own
oneness this whole time that's the challenge of reality that's
the ultimate existential challenge is to realize and understand your
fullness and to accept it and not to deny it
that's the hardest thing in the world to do that
is God's entire agenda you might wonder why did God
create all this what's the point the point is that
it's not that God created a bunch of stuff don't
think of it that way think of it and said
like this imagine that there was a moment in time
and this isn't quite right because of course God is
outside of time but let's just go with it as
a metaphor that there was a moment in time where
God was sort of born somehow he was born let's
say and there he was and now most people imagine
okay he started just creating stuff and of course he
knew he was God and he knew what he was
capable of so he just starts creating a bunch of
stuff but it's not so simple you see before God
can get to that God has to ask himself wait
a minute how did I get here why did I
come into existence where did I come from and what
am I you see there's a moment where God doesn't
really know yet what he is because it's like God's
not just bored with self-knowledge God God God needs to
go through a process to arrive at self-knowledge and this
process is what we call life that's what's happening right
now right this second that's what's happening every second ever
of everybody's life is it's God looking through itself exploring
itself experiencing itself in order to realize what it is
God doesn't know what it is until it's lived through
every possible experience an incarnation of consciousness to realize what
it means to be God you see and since God
is infinite there's an infinite number of forms it's forever
experiencing itself through every possible incarnation it's running through every
single film reel it has to do that to realize
what it really means to be God to realize infinity
the body of God so to speak is literally made
up of this present experience that's happening to me right
now and this present experience is happening to you right
now and every other experience that has ever happened to
any living creature all of that makes up the body
of God that's what God is it's this infinite singularity
but it doesn't really know itself to know itself it
has to go through this experience to see the consequences
of what it means to be infinite it's one thing
to just say oh yeah I'm infinite or just to
say oh yeah God is infinite it's another thing to
actually go through every possible experience of what it means
to be infinite what it means to be infinite is
that you're an ant crawling on a piece of wood
in the forest or you're a bear [ __ ]
in the woods or you're a dragonfly flying through some
pond or you're a human being going through a breakup
or you're a Nazi killing Jews or you're some corrupt
politician scheming away to to steal a bunch of money
from the government or something like this right it's it's
every possible thing that could ever be experienced that's what
infinity means and of course for God there's a really
a really tricky issue here which is that infinity is
so big and the consequences of our of it are
so astounding and marvelous and stupendous and horrifying that God
needs to not only be able to go through every
iteration to see what it really is it also needs
to understand well not accept it needs to accept what
it is and that's what this episode is about today
it's about helping you to accept what you really are
because you see when most people think of God what
they think of is they think of rainbows and butterflies
and unicorns and pretty things and nice things and love
and goodness and all of this they don't think about
the selfishness and the evil they hold this as separate
from God again creating a duality but of course with
non-duality we have to fold that in to this concept
of God because God is one is this one thing
you can't separate anything from it so the most challenging
thing with non-duality is to realize that your everything including
all the ugliness and all the stuff that you hate
so as God is going through this film real and
it's looking through every single imagine like for example if
you were sitting there in a movie theater looking through
an infinitely long film reel every single movie that could
be well you're gonna see some wonderful beautiful movies some
romantic comedies and children's movies and fairytales and this and
that with happy endings and that's gonna be great you're
gonna be happy but then what happens when you see
all the horror movies all the slasher films all the
snuff films all the violence all the video of all
the wars that have ever happened in human history right
you're looking through all of this you're looking through every
single rape you're looking through as though it was filmed
on a camera you're looking through every single act of
genocide and terrorism and torture and evil and corruption and
greed and all of this you're looking through all of
it how do you think you're gonna feel when you're
looking at that are you going to be man enough
so to speak to accept that as yourself that's the
greatest challenge for God is to fully accept itself as
what it is and not to deny not to create
smoke screens and excuses and rationalizations and all this most
people would be way too offended to entertain these ideas
that I'm talking about here spiral dynamics stage blue moralists
will think that oneness that I'm explaining here is actually
devilry because stage blue moralism is all about splitting off
and creating a duality between good and evil which is
what someone like Jordan Peterson does and which is why
he's stuck with that and he can't evolve forward and
spiral dynamic stage orange the materialists and the rationalists they
think oneness is just some wishful woowoo new-age metaphor and
that it can't possibly be real because reality is material
and physical and Leo the things you're describing here orderly
impossible but get beyond all of that and what I'm
talking about here is not just entertaining this as an
idea or as philosophy or as a belief I'm actually
talking about realizing that you are God realizing that this
is your true nature you are everything absolutely everything and
that this is the ultimate purpose of spirituality is to
realize this awesome truth and to accept it see the
problem is that you're way too weak to accept it
you have to surrender yourself to accept it it's not
like you can just sit back on a couch and
understand what God is in some abstract philosophical way you
need to put some skin in the game you see
this is a hands-on activity you literally are God living
through your life right now and so far your entire
life has just been this closer little existence and you've
been fighting so hard to create this little cloistered nest
for yourself what do I mean by this cloistered nest
I mean everything you struggle to work for every single
day the money there the love the sex the approval
the the fame that you want all the comfort comfortable
aspects of life you know the nice cushy house the
nice car and the good comfortable clothing and the bed
and all of this you're constructing this little bubble for
yourself to avoid experiencing the fullness of what you are
because it's so radical see you only want to cherry-pick
the full spectrum of possible experiences to get the best
ones the ones that are the pretty the happy the
sappy the sugary ones and you want to say oh
yeah I am this stuff here but then you want
to deny and reject all of this you want to
deny and reject all the all the murder and violence
and theft and evil that happens and then you want
to deny and have nothing to do with that so
you create this duality between the two and then you
spend all your time from this little nest that you've
built for yourself this little position of privilege and luxury
you get to sit up here and criticize all the
people over here all the people who were born into
abusive families all the rapists of the world all the
the murderers all the dictators all of them you get
to criticize all of them from your little comfortable position
because you've managed to delude yourself into thinking that somehow
you're separate from them and that you will never be
this way and that you could never be this way
and then you will say things to yourself like Oh
leo I could never be a rapist I could never
be a murderer I could never be a dictator I
would never do that I'm not that kind of person
huh yeah in this incarnation maybe you're not maybe you're
not in this incarnation because you were born to good
parents in a good country in a good environment you
went to good schools and you had money and you
had all of this and you had a good mental
health you weren't born disabled you weren't born crippled you
didn't go through all the suffering that all these other
people had to go through that made their life so
miserable that now they spread misery all across the world
which you judge and hate but one day you'll know
what that feels like you'll know exactly what it feels
like to be one of those people that are on
this end of the spectrum the selfish evils end of
the spectrum you'll know what it's like to be addicted
you know what it's like to be caught in a
cycle of poverty or criminality or violence or anything else
like this you see God's mission so to speak God's
ultimate purpose if God is trying to understand what it
is is to run through every possible experience the full
spectrum without judgment no matter how horrifying it might may
seem and you might say well leo but but why
would God want to torture and suffer this way no
no no you don't understand if you think that way
you're thinking from the position of the ego God doesn't
judge God wants to run through every possible experience in
the same way that when you're sitting in a movie
theater and you're looking at a film you enjoy some
good violence you enjoy some good rape on the movie
screen you enjoy some child abuse on the movie screen
you enjoy some horror movie where there's some [ __
] monster chasing someone some person down and mauling them
and eating them piece by piece you enjoy watching cannibal
movies horror movies are one of the most popular forms
of movie you enjoy them you go to all the
time but of course that's because you've got this safe
buffer this distance that's Green between fiction and reality you've
got that duality but you see when you're actually inside
the movie or now and you've got an ego and
you want to cling to some particular identity this little
comfortable identity that you've constructed for yourself as a good
moral person that's above all the others well all the
sudden that fantasy of yours now comes into contact with
reality and now that's a problem you can no longer
maintain that duality see so so God is trying to
experience everything because it needs to experience everything to realize
its full oneness if it says no I don't want
to experience torture and rape and and all that bad
stuff then that means it doesn't get to understand what
it really is it only sees half of itself it
denies the other half and this leads to all sorts
of pathologies and this now brings us to the ultimate
purpose of life and this brings us to the the
ultimate origin of love compassion and goodness now you might
think well Leo what does this possibly have to do
with love and compassion and goodness it seems like you're
describing hell to me there's no love here if if
God was truly loving he would eliminate all this evil
stuff so we don't have to suffer but again you're
speaking from a position of duality you're speaking as if
you're not God which you are you're speaking as though
you're separate from the creation God is not separate from
its creation it is the creation so how does love
play into all of this to truly learn to love
you must learn to love unconditionally you must learn to
accept everything you must learn to love yourself in your
entirety it's very easy to love this stuff on this
end of the spectrum the good easy fluffy stuff the
sugary stuff it's very easy to love that what's really
difficult to love is the full truth this is not
the full truth the full truth is this entire spectrum
that's your job is to learn how to love that
if you can love this you've learned how to love
yourself and you have in a sense completed the entire
objective of God how can you have compassion when you
haven't really suffered when you haven't experienced torture and rape
and murder and genocide and theft and corruption and all
how can you possibly love how can you have compassion
for anybody when all you do is live in your
little oyster comfortable existence as best you have constructed for
yourself that you defend every single day for fear of
what it would mean if that gets destroyed and now
you your experience spills over into at this end of
the spectrum how can you have compassion for for these
people over here when you think that you're separate from
them and that all of this stuff here is wrong
and bad you can't compassion and love comes from exposure
to the most brutal experiences the most difficult experiences this
is what makes life so challenging and so worthwhile this
is the ingenious nasai knife like I said in my
what is love episode I called life a love simulator
and maybe you didn't quite appreciate what that meant well
let's explain it here again why do we call life
I love simulator because your job is to realize what
you are as God and to accept and love yourself
unconditionally in your full entirety and that is the most
difficult thing for you to do as an ego in
fact what it requires is the ultimate sacrifice it is
impossible to accomplish this mission without completely surrendering yourself which
means death so you see the purpose of life is
to go full circle from life to death and it's
only after you face your own death completely and you
have nothing anymore that you cling to as an identity
and there is no more separate self that at that
point you have become in literally infinite and you love
everything now because there's nothing that you need to protect
within yourself you don't need to protect your body your
mind your ideas your religion your politics nothing and you
hate nothing and you judge nothing because you understand that
all of it is you and you understand the the
goodness of it all the absolute goodness of it all
absolute goodness includes the full spectrum not just the positive
side but also the quote-unquote negative side includes it all
you've integrated it all you'll become such a large being
that you have literally transcended your humanity into godhood Buddhahood
at that point you have realized the purpose of life
you've embraced everything you're conscious of yourself fully tada that's
what you're here for that's what you were born for
you might think you were here to make money and
to have sex and to play video games and to
do all this stuff no no no all of that
is just stuff within the love simulator your real job
here if you if you want to be excellent at
life your real job is to to complete the love
simulator you know you don't need to be in a
simulator if you're an ace pilot you put amateur pilots
in the simulator and you make them simulate all sorts
of difficult scenarios so that they get better and better
and better and eventually they become an ace pilot at
which point they leave the simulator they don't need the
simulator anymore so that's your situation so the reason you're
struggling in life the reason is so difficult is because
you don't know how to love and the reason you
don't know how to love is because you're selfish and
the reason is you're selfish is just because that's what
you need it to be to survive to get to
this point and now you just are to let go
of more and more of your selfishness and embody more
and more love unconditionally until you're dead and you love
even that and then you go beyond that and at
that point you become so conscious that you don't even
need reality anymore you don't need the simulator anymore you
could die and not exist and you're perfectly happy with
that that's fine by you because you've already seen absolutely
everything there is to see you've completed life you've finished
the movie you've finished the game the entire universe is
infinitely reincarnating it's playing through all of these experiences as
one entity in order to get to know itself to
know itself it must be itself again the duality between
knowledge and being must also collapse when we're talking about
knowing duality as a materialist you might wonder believe how
is this possible how is any of this physically possible
because like I've said before the universe is not a
mechanical physical object is a giant mind it's an infinite
mind and it can dream up and hallucinate whatever it
wants and so what we're exploring here is not physicality
we're exploring infinite hallucination and there's only one subject one
giant mind one subject but an infinite amount of dreams
and hallucinations within it subdividing itself to infinity forever and
ever and ever and you are that entire thing and
also right now you are identified with being one little
subdivision of that giant thing of course don't expect to
remember all of the various incarnations interations that you went
through because what it means to be you is that
you have your memories that's what it means to be
separated and individualized a sub partition see and when your
brain gets damaged and your body dies then the memory
basically gets wiped clean if you doubt that something like
this is possible there's a class of psychedelics that you
can take which will actually forget make you forget that
you took a psychedelic these are not ordinary psychedelics this
is not like LSD or mushrooms or DMT or 5mb
oh this is something a little bit more sinister and
scary this is truly the stuff of nightmares the stuff
of insane asylums you take one of these psychedelics like
salvia or datura for example and when this thing kicks
in you have no memory that you took this psychedelic
you have no memory of who you were as a
human being before that all of that is wiped away
you are immersed in a totally new reality that feels
completely lifelike and it's just pure hallucination that means you
can for example have a conversation with your parents or
your spouse on this psychedelic and you're having this conversation
for 30 minutes and you're you're debating with them something
important you're talking and talking talking then 30 minutes later
you realize that was just a hallucination it never even
happened and it felt completely real you might open your
window look through your window on the grassy lawn and
you might see a helicopter landing on the grassy lawn
and you'll hear the sound you'll feel the wind from
it all kicking you in the face and maybe you'll
see you'll see some police running out of the helicopter
running towards you and then you realize when they get
to you none of that ever happened it was just
a hallucination and while you're hallucinating that you won't even
know that you're hallucinating it will just feel completely real
and the reason that's possible is precisely because there is
no difference between reality and hallucination what you're experiencing right
now is a persistent hallucination and one day will end
and that will be that in your entire life will
be gone in the blink of an eye as though
it was just a movie I don't by the way
recommend that you try these psychedelics they can be quite
dangerous both physically and psychologically but you know for those
of you who are skeptics in the audience you need
to be aware that this stuff exists this is I'm
not making this [ __ ] up this is factual
you know if you want you go try one of
these and you'll see what we're talking about here you'll
understand this and so that's what consciousness does you see
consciousness gets lost inside of itself God gets so sucked
into the illusion the illusion becomes indistinguishable from reality because
there really is no distinction that God gets so sucked
into it that it ends up being where you are
right now sitting there right now feeling like you're inside
of your little bubble you're living your life being you
and that that's what's real right so you're you're completely
hypnotized by that illusion by that elucidation you don't even
know how to break out of it right just like
with a good juicy movie you're totally absorbed in the
movie to the point where when something happens on screen
even though it's fake your heart starts pounding if you're
watching a horror movie there's like a jump scare or
something and you're freaked out and it feels very real
and you get lost in it for a few hours
you see well this is what God is doing on
steroids with all of reality God is getting lost in
itself so there's a sort of a two-way street you
can either get lost and absorb deeper and deeper into
reality which is what something like movies do porn does
video games do virtual reality does marriage and children in
a career all of this is you can absorbed more
and more and more into this fantasy into this hallucination
and confusing it with reality and there's the opposite direction
you can go back up the opposite direction which is
raising your consciousness and getting Dee absorbed waking up in
other words and this is where spirituality comes in it's
a process of stopping playing within the hallucination and actually
trying to climb out of the hallucination and God will
do both God will get fully lost in the hallucination
and suffer deeply and enormous Lee you know there are
people in the world right now who are suffering through
herbal addictions terrible depression people who will shoot themselves tomorrow
people who will go commit violence people who will become
terrorists people who will get lost in business for 40
years people who would devote their entire lives to all
sorts of causes and purposes that are ridiculous and harmful
and pathological and all that really is it's just people
getting so absorbed in the hallucination and some of those
people are so far gone that there's no way that
they can wake up without death physical death that's the
only thing that will wake them up then there are
others like you perhaps who have already started the waking
up process I do some meditation some yoga and those
sorts of stuff but you still have a long ways
to go but lest you get depressed remember though that
this is still only half the story remember you as
God will also experience all the positivity all the joy
all the pleasure and all the beauty of life you
will experience every first kiss every hot man and hot
woman every intimate moment every orgasm every delicious meal every
smile on a child's face every birthday cake that was
ever eaten every Xmas gift that was ever given every
amusement park every sunset and sunrise every act of kindness
acting every act of courage every act of love every
sentimental moment every victory and triumph every success every stroke
of good luck every jackpot in Vegas every joke every
laugh every masterpiece of art every vacation every honeymoon every
beautiful person every mystical experience every ecstatic vision the birth
of every cute baby boy and baby girl that was
ever born you will experience the highs of every single
drug that mankind will ever invent from heroin to cocaine
to meth to opium and anything else in the future
you will experience the peak of five amiyo DMT joy
and pleasure and love beyond anything that you could possibly
imagine all of that you will experience because that too
is you that too is everything one of the most
difficult things to explain to a child is that life
is both immensely brutal and immensely beautiful both at the
same time try to imagine explaining this to a newborn
child who has so little experience with life try to
imagine explaining all the horrors of life all the evils
and also all the joys and all the beauty of
it how do you explain that to a conscious being
you can't it's too much it's unbelievable it's unimaginable it's
impossible the only way it can be known is by
living through it which is precisely why that child was
born is to live through it and to discover this
brutality and this beauty through direct experience not as a
story that was told to you but through direct experience
by suffering through it by working through it by going
through all the trials and tribulations of life think of
how much emotional maturity is required to handle everything that
I've been talking about above think of how much you
have to grow and develop yourself just to be able
to entertain these ideas let alone to actually embody them
and to open yourself up to the full spectrum of
what you are think of how much bigger of a
man or a woman you'd have to be to be
able to live this way think of how difficult it
is if it sounds outrageous and ridiculous it's precisely because
it sounds so difficult and so impossible and so beyond
how your friends and family live life and that's precisely
the case because mankind is in the dark ages and
our culture doesn't talk about this because this requires enormous
evolution enormous development and enormous maturity maybe in a few
thousand years this will be talked about in mainstream culture
because you would have to have evolved our way to
that point you know it's taken us thousands of years
just to evolve to the point where I can shoot
a video about this topic and not get burned at
the stake you know a couple hundred years ago would
not have been possible even in certain countries today Saudi
Arabia for example you can't release a video like this
in Saudi Arabia see so it's not an accident that
this stuff isn't talked about on your mainstream news or
on your Facebook feed or by your friends or your
family don't expect confirmation from your culture don't even expect
some spiritual guru to explain all of this in all
the detail because this is so much it's way too
much knowing light masters gonna tell you this because it's
just gonna freak you out it's just gonna drive your
ego nuts this is something you have to face all
by yourself you have to realize this no one can
tell you this this is not something you can turn
into a belief you need to rather than building this
cushy nest that you're building for yourself you need to
open yourself up more to the full spectrum of experiences
of life and that's that's really difficult to do it's
so much more attempting to construct this little nest of
yours by chasing money and sex and fame and all
of this then you can construct this nest but then
you close yourself off from from true love and true
compassion the only way you develop true compassion is by
taking on the suffering of the world as your own
that is one of the core pillars of spirituality you
don't do it because you're a masochist you do it
because you want the truth you want to experience the
fullness the infinity of what you are and also because
this strategy of creating a cushy life for yourself this
even if you're good at it for a while it
never holds up forever even the most successful people will
still experience the brutality of life in one fashion or
another in fact this is a common reason why many
successful people musicians and artists and celebrities end up committing
suicide or getting addicted to various kinds of substances or
spiraling out of control in their life he's because they're
they're building this cushy lifestyle for themselves but then the
brutality still comes through you can't hide from the truth
forever eventually you're gonna have to face the death of
your loved ones face the death of your spouse face
the death of your children face the various diseases and
the inequality in the world and horror and car accidents
and plane crashes and political fascism and and violence and
evil everywhere like you're gonna have to face this you
can't isolate yourself from this this is a part of
reality a part of who you are you can't just
sit on some lofty perch that you've built for yourself
and then sit and cast judgment on all this stuff
as being bad and evil that's gonna come back to
bite you because one day you'll have to realize that
actually you are too a part of that and that's
that requires a lot of emotional maturity to accept that
and to still be able to love yourself no matter
how rich you get how famous you get you're gonna
have to deal with old age with your looks deteriorating
you're gonna have to deal with money problems you're gonna
have to even if even if you're super successful at
all this you're still gonna have to spend every single
waking day of your life worrying about maintaining your success
maintaining your money maintaining your youthful appearance in your looks
and through all of that you will be suffering and
you will be scared and so what spirituality is about
is about facing your deepest fears your fears of of
death facing that head-on and surrendering it into it rather
than running away from it and being able to love
yourself in the whole world unconditionally and from that you
get true happiness in joy and that's why there is
no magic appeal for happiness and there is no way
to buy it and there is no way to hoard
it or to acquire it or to sell it because
happiness is just acceptance of your entire ultimate true nature
and the surrendering of all you're lying and your your
fear and your smokescreens and all of your [ __
] surrendering all of that surrendering your ego and nobody
can do that for you this is God's work you
must do this yourself if you don't do this nobody
else will do it for you because what you're doing
there is you're actually abdicating you're literally abdicating your work
is God and if you turn any of this into
a belief again you're abdicating your work is God this
needs to be experienced by you at a cellular level
not an intellectual philosophical level now if you're worried or
fearful about any of this that I said watch out
because what is that that's the ego that part in
you which is afraid of any of the things I
listed up above that's precisely the part of you that
needs spiritual purification that's the part of you that needs
to be surrendered because you see you've created an identity
out of a very particular and limited set of things
like you think you're tall you think you're beautiful you
think you're ugly you think you're attractive or not attractive
you think you're successful or not successful you think you're
intelligent or not intelligent all of these things you identified
with you think you're a man a woman black or
white or all of that whatever religion you think you're
part of a Jew a Muslim a Christian thought about
all of that right you've created identity out of that
skeptic a scientific person that's a very narrow identity and
what's happening is I'm telling you all this nasty stuff
as it might seem yeah it seems nasty from your
limited identity because it goes against your identity because what
we're trying to do is we're trying to scramble that
identity so that you spill out into the world so
yeah that's your work that's the hardest thing to do
in this work is to surrender more and more of
that and to accept more and more of everything selflessly
that's why this work is so difficult that's why almost
nobody wants to do it that's why everybody makes all
sorts of excuses for it that's why people spend so
much time mentally masturbating about this work and not actually
doing the work is to protect their identity from crumbling
because that's what death literally is it's the crumbling of
your identity that is death so yeah don't be surprised
this scares the [ __ ] out of you but
also remember that you can tap into your heart you
can tap into the highest wisdom and and intuitions within
you and you can use that to power through your
fear to power through your egotism this will be a
battle your ego is not going to go easily into
the night it's gonna struggle all the way and you're
gonna have to tap into the highest most godly parts
of yourself your deepest love and compassion and you have
to apply that to yourself you have to you have
to work with yourself every single day for many many
years to overcome and to sooth your ego and to
negotiate with it until eventually get to the point where
you are man enough or woman enough to surrender to
it to surrender to infinity to surrender your ego and
not need it more do not feel like you need
it to defend yourself because now you become so open
that there is no more need you don't even care
if you die anymore you have no more need for
any kind of defenses no more need for lying noble
normal need for [ __ ] no more need to
protect your possessions or anything else because that's how deep
your connection to reality becomes you transcend the human and
you now start to identify with the cosmos as a
whole with the entire universe you know the entire universe
doesn't need possessions doesn't need money doesn't need sex now
of course this doesn't mean that you'll never pursue these
things or ever have these things you can still have
a house you can still have clothing in a car
and all this but you're you're just not attached to
it is the point so I'm not telling you all
of this that you sort of fantasize and worry I'm
telling you this so that you start to appreciate just
how difficult the truth is the truth is an acquired
taste and it's a difficult challenging thing the whole purpose
of why you were born was to work and work
and work and work to accept the truth and you
were given many years you know as a human being
you have many years you have like 80 years to
live if you live prudently because that's how long you
need to fully surrender to the truth it can take
a lot of years and you've probably already wasted a
third of your life running away from the truth so
hmm be glad that you're human you have many years
left to live I'm also telling you this to Humble
you because notice people who resist what I'm saying here
fundamentally what that is is that's arrogance that's their arrogance
I'm also telling you this for when you're tripping on
psychedelics contemplate the things that I've said here when you're
tripping on psychedelics maybe you'll get a direct insight into
the things I'm saying here the action steps from this
episode is whether you do psychedelics or not anyways contemplate
this contemplate what I've said here take it seriously let
it humble you let it scare you a little bit
that's good but don't get too caught up in your
fear because ultimately what you got to do next as
an action step is you got to surrender to it
rather than resisting it and coming up with excuses and
trying to argue with me surrender to it continue tripping
continue meditating continue self inquire and continue doing your yoga
that's gonna be moving you towards this realization and then
one day hopefully it'll hit you everything I'm saying here
will hit you it'll all come together and that will
be one of the most epic days of your life
when you realize this for yourself and you're not just
hearing in his words from me all right I hope
that wasn't too scary for you after all this is
a Halloween but I'm done here go ahead and click
that like button for me please come check out actualize
that org dance my website you'll find my blog you'll
find the forum you'll find the life purpose course you'll
find the book list and the final thing that I'll
say is that this thing that we call non duality
be careful under estimating it it's much more serious than
you ever thought and it's different than what you thought
it was yes you do need to read the books
and learn about non duality you need to learn about
the theory that all that's important but then no matter
how much of the theory you learn you have to
always remember that the actuality of it is nothing like
what you imagined nothing like what you got from the
books that's what makes it so difficult there are many
radical implications to non duality which are quite horrifying and
scary from the perspective of the ego so keep that
in mind and in the future I will be talking
more about various ramifications of non-duality is by no means
the only this is actually just one ramification there are
others and they can be quite jarring when you learn
about them especially when you're not prepared so at least
now having watched this maybe when you do have this
insight for yourself at least I mean it'll still shock
you still shock you nothing can really prepare you for
the shock but at least you'll be like well at
least I'm not going insane cuz you know at least
Leo talked about this and so I guess it's just
part of the path I guess I just got to
work with it got to learn to accept it and
and to stick around for four more as we'll talk
about more ramifications and how to deal with it you
know a big mmm challenge of this whole work is
just keeping your own spirits high as you're doing this
because it can be difficult right you you can be
facing depression and sadness and and all of this you
can get nihilistic like all of this will happen to
you on this spiritual journey and the whole thing is
you got to keep chipping away at it and not
quit all too often I hear people who meditate or
do some yoga and they finally they start to get
some spiritual mystical experiences and they start to finally get
their results but then they're scared by those results and
they say oh that was so scary and my heart
jumped and all of this and oh my god something
weird happened to me and and now I stopped meditating
or I stopped doing yoga or I stopped doing psychedelics
well I'm trying to prepare you for that so that
you don't stop so that you keep going now of
course you do want to be careful you don't wanna
push yourself so much that you get to some sort
of breaking point where you know it's physically dangerous for
you or you feel like you're losing your mind completely
but you know sometimes it does feel like you're losing
your mind sometimes it does kind of feel dangerous because
spirituality is serious business it's done by serious people it's
done by hardcore people this is not airy-fairy fluffy stuff
that you see on Oprah this is serious [ __
] your very life is on the line here but
then again the rewards are also very serious so if
you want serious rewards for this work if you want
a a serious transformation in your attitude towards reality you
want something different than what the ordinary person has well
you got to expect it that's going to come through
some serious work and through some serious trials and tribulations
and so I hope that one of the things that
I can offer you with with my content is some
sort of like emotional support keep you motivated and just
keep you keep your expectations in line rights because when
your expectations get out of line you expect something sugary
and you get something a little bit bittersweet then you
might be tempted to quit so stick around and I'll
see you the next one you
