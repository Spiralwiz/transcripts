            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/23gbVOoRbtA' target='_blank'>I'm Leaving To Pursue Awakening & Healing - March 2020</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Gura's recent profound awakening</b>: Gura recounts an exceptionally deep awakening that was a life-transforming event, characterized by the realization of himself as God. This awakening surpassed all his previous ones. Although he had realized this idea before, this particular awakening provided a depth of understanding beyond conventional comprehension. He stresses that our current state of consciousness cannot fully grasp this notion. 
</li><li><b>His understanding of awakenings</b>: In this context, Gura explains that an awakening may feel total, but, given the infinite nature of reality, different layers of understanding and awakening remain to be discovered. He describes this as the paradox and challenge of these experiences as every awakening feels complete, yet there is always more depth to achieve. He affirms that each awakening complements others, deepening the understanding of existence. 
</li><li><b>Sense of self-creation</b>: During his awakening, Gura became entirely aware of how he was creating all of himself, that is, the entire universe. He notes that most people are not conscious of their participatory role in creating the universe and every moment in it. After an awakening, Gura explains that he becomes more able to live from this level of consciousness, although he acknowledges that more work is needed. 
</li><li><b>Disruptive nature of awakenings</b>: Awakening experiences disrupt Gura's normal life flow and routine, pushing him into a significant period of integration and deeper awakenings. He states that aligning his life with his "god awareness" requires undoing old habits, patterns and addictions, which is a challenging task. 
</li><li><b>Transcendence in awakening</b>: Gura claims that his awakening transcends all teachings, religions, masters, transcendental meditation, yoga, self-inquiry, etc. He shares that through this state of consciousness, he became consciously aware of the root cause of diseases and ailments, opening up the potential for miraculous healing. However, he admits that his understanding of how healing works at this level of consciousness is not yet fully developed. 
</li><li><b>Reality-bending abilities</b>: Gura discusses potential for abilities such as miraculous healing through this level of consciousness, but emphasizes that the act of awakening itself doesn't change external reality or provide immediate special abilities. He advises against equating such extrasensory abilities with the level of awakening or seeing them as ego-driven goals. Awakening means realizing that everything occurring is already by one's own will and creation.
</li><li><b>Living with awakening and aligning life to it</b>: Leo Gura elaborates that awakening does not immediately grant abilities like healing or extrasensory perception, it depends on how well one can embody the new level of consciousness daily. The desire to manipulate reality comes from the ego, miracles and healings come from a place of absolute love. He acknowledges that, although he is conscious of his creation of reality, he still lacks the deeper understanding needed to actively manipulate it.
</li><li><b>Importance of psychedelic use for personal growth</b>: Leo underlines that he has accessed levels of awareness that many teachers have not reached and emphasizes his belief in the use of psychedelics, specifically 5 Meo DMT, as the only effective means to achieve these levels. He acknowledges this may contradict some people's beliefs, citing from his own experience, observing practitioners of traditional methods like yoga and meditation, that these conventional methods are inadequate for reaching his level of consciousness.
</li><li><b>Streamlining his teachings and reducing tolerance for ignorance</b>: Leo Gura asserts that his teaching will become more focused on seriosity, radical open-mindedness, self-experimentation, and psychedelic use. He plans to reduce his tolerance towards ignorance, becoming more stringent in discussions online. He relays his ambition to create the highest teaching on realizing one's divine nature and promises to assist serious followers to overcome obstacles preventing this realization.
</li><li><b>Health struggles as an aspect of awakening</b>: Leo Gura talks about his ongoing personal health struggles, specifically chronic fatigue and thyroid issues, which persisted despite various traditional and alternative treatments. He interprets these health issues as signs pushing him towards deeper awakening. He also perceives general suffering and disease as clues to awaken, left by oneself as breadcrumbs throughout life, guiding to one's realization of divine nature.
</li><li><b>Next Steps of Spiritual Journey</b>: Leo Gura plans to go into a period of solitude to embody and deepen his awakening, have more awakenings along similar lines, and begin to understand how healing works. His intention is to first heal himself and then to use this ability to help and teach others. 
</li><li><b>Health Issues as Spiritual Challenges</b>: Leo has been struggling with health issues for a long time, which he views as a hurdle to overcome on his spiritual path. Despite good diet and healthy living, his health has suffered, leading him to believe that overcoming this situation is integral to his journey of self-realization and self-healing.
</li><li><b>Benefit of Personal Suffering</b>: Leo suggests that his suffering is self-created to deepen his awakening and lead to more profound work. By facing illness and understanding the experience of suffering, he believes he is developing greater compassion that will be beneficial in his teachings in the future. 
</li><li><b>Need for Spiritual Purification</b>: Leo believes that the universe is preparing him to become a vehicle for transmitting high-level teachings. However, this mission requires considerable inner purification, which he plans to undertake during his break from releasing content on Actualized.org. 
</li><li><b>Content Production Break</b>: Leo announces a 30-day break from content production, during which time he will work on his own spiritual development. The break might be extended based on the progress made, but he anticipates coming back to share content with a renewed vigour and a transformed understanding of his teachings. 
</li><li><b>Ongoing Transformation</b>: Leo Gura describes an ongoing transformation impacting his mind and body, preparing him for the next level of teaching and embodiment. Despite the deep desire to share insights, he recognizes the importance of turning inward and mastering his own understanding at deeper levels. 
</li><li><b>Changes in Teaching Style</b>: Leo warns that changes in his teaching style and energy can be expected as he progresses on his journey. As teachings become more advanced, they may appeal to fewer people and may be misunderstood or even demonized. 
</li><li><b>Self-Realization as God</b>: Leo advocates for the recognition that each person is God, constructing everything around them, including all spiritual ideas and techniques. However, this recognition can be challenging and can cause upheaval, including potential health issues or feelings of depression.
</li><li><b>Core Teachings for the Future</b>: Leo outlines the core of his future teachings as the recognition that everything is God without separation, and emphasizes that understanding this truth is an amazing realization that leads to the understanding that one is truth, consciousness, infinite, and love.
</li><li><b>Unawareness of Oneness with God</b>: Leo emphasizes that every individual is an explicit manifestation of God, with no separation in-between. However, unless one is consciously aware of this connection, they remain oblivious to their divinity. 
</li><li><b>Consciousness as the Basis of Reality</b>: The videos iterates that everything is consciousness. It is the pure, infinite, and fundamental aspect of our identity. Diverse states of consciousness represent the various ways our reality manifests and steers our individual experiences. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Love</b>: In these teachings, love is designated as an essential pillar. It is viewed as absolute and undivided, a selfless manifestation stemming from our deep love for ourselves, i.e., all that exists since we are one with everything. Pure, unconditional love is the solution to all problems and fears, eliminating any residual fear upon the realization that 'we are all that exists', thereby inducing intense self-love.
</li><li><b>Radical Open-mindedness as a Core Teaching Principle</b>: Open-mindedness is significantly emphasized. This involves a deep understanding of epistemology, the study of knowledge and justified belief, and challenges current grasp of scientific functionality. Leo plans to deconstruct and clarify these topics in future teachings.
</li><li><b>Removing Obstacles to self-realization</b>: The teachings aim to help individuals eradicate internal obstacles in several domains of liferelationships, finances, health, and epistemologythat obstruct one's realization of one's divine, infinite, and loving nature. 
</li><li><b>Change Implies Changing the Self, not Circumstances</b>: Leo insists that lasting change and problem-solving come from altering oneself, not merely the outcomes. He argues against the common desire to maintain self-identity while changing situations and emphasizes the need to let die the parts of self that cause suffering, leading to the emergence of a larger, stronger, truer self.
</li><li><b>Fear of Fundamental Change</b>: There is an inherent fear of fundamental self-change, perceived as an existential threat. People do not readily wish to change their lifestyles, worldviews, relationships, or perspectives, even if it means limiting their spiritual growth.
</li><li><b>True Transformation Requires Core Changes</b>: Leo underscores that real transformation requires addressing and adjusting deep-rooted aspects of one's identity, not just peripheral elements. This often means letting go of stubbornly clung-to beliefs and perspectives, leading to a profound and life-altering metamorphosis.
</li><li><b>Desire to solve fundamental problems and flourish</b>: Leo Gura stresses on the importance of overcoming deepest problems and challenges to flourish into one's full potential which is equivalent to realizing oneself as God. 
</li><li><b>Juggling social games cause unhappiness and sickness</b>: Leo suggests that the continuous struggle to sustain social games and norms in a biased reality lead to problems such as anxiety, depression, and even physical sickness.
</li><li><b>Becoming infinitely selfless to realize oneself as God</b>: Emphasizing the significance of selflessness, Leo explains that by purifying oneself from all falsehoods and biases, one can eventually become fully selfless. This infinite selflessness leads to the realization of oneself as God and the creator of all that exists.
</li><li><b>Reconfiguring life to align with ultimate truth</b>: Leo insists on letting go of falsehood to be able to see reality in an unbiased way. This would make them leaders and vehicles for truth and consciousness in the world, and would leave them truly satisfied. 
</li><li><b>Unforeseen comprehensive transformation is rewarding</b>: He suggests that though the process of change is challenging and may seem scary; the rewards of the process are overwhelming and transcend material desires.
</li><li><b>Identifying and overcoming mental obstacles</b>: Leo vows to assist individuals in overcoming various mental obstacles including negative social conditioning and personal traumas. He underscores that truly seeking goes beyond finite means, and is ultimately a quest for infinite love.
</li><li><b>Supportive platforms and resources for seekers</b>: In the end, Leo promotes his website as a significant resource for seekers with courses, a forum, and a book list available. He encourages viewers to watch his videos repeatedly for deeper understanding and realization. Despite a break, he reassures his viewers of his return with more enriching content.
