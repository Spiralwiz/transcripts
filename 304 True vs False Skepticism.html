            <h1><a href='https://youtu.be/5kzZdps9PG4' target='_blank'>True vs False Skepticism</a></h1>
            <ul>
    <li><b>Origins of Peronism</b>: Leo Gura discusses the origins of Peronism, the ancient Greek school of skepticism, founded by Piero of Ellis. This school of thought argues against dogmatism and the certainty of knowledge. Piero learned from Indian yogis that nothing is certain, a realization he brought back to Greece. Since Piero did not leave any significant writings, the insights into Peronism come from Sextus Empiricus' book "Outlines of Pyrrhonism," written several centuries after Piero.
</li><li><b>Concept of Eudaimonia in Peronism</b>: According to Peronism, the chief aim of life is eudaimonia or living the good life. However, unlike modern understanding of happiness as seeking pleasure and success, the ancient Greeks viewed it as living a philosophical life, seeking truth, and living according to principles of the ultimate good.
</li><li><b>Peronism's Ideology of Skepticism</b>: Peronism revolves around acknowledging that nothing can be known for certain. Both our senses and reasoning, the primary ways to access reality, are deceptive and unreliable. Consequently, any claims for certain knowledge become untenable as every piece of evidence would require further evidence to back itself, leading to an infinite regression of proofs which ultimately ends in groundlessness.
</li><li><b>Peronism's Position Against Dogmatism</b>: Due to the lack of solid grounds for asserting any knowledge, Peronism promotes the refusal to hold any particular views or take sides. It is skeptical about all doctrines regarding the truth of things and doubts anything beyond mere appearances. This approach distinguishes skeptics from dogmatists who firmly hold certain beliefs without acknowledging their inherent uncertainty. However, Peronism also maintains skepticism about skepticism, refusing to claim its position as the ultimate truth.
</li><li><b>Peronism's Influence on Leo Gura's Life</b>: Leo emphasizes the profound impact of Peronism on his life. His adoption of Peronism in his teenage years was instrumental for his progression into advanced self-actualization work. Peronism is not just an academic philosophy but has practical implications, and Leo aims to highlight how this ancient philosophy still holds essential lessons for modern intellectuals and scientists. 
</li><li><b>Peronism's Connection with Indian Yogis</b>: Leo mentions the significant influence of Indian yogis on the development of Peronism. During the conquests of Alexander the Great, Piero encountered the yogis, who convinced him of the fundamental uncertainty of all knowledge. This interaction significantly influenced Piero's philosophical thinking, leading to the emergence of Peronism in ancient Greece.
</li><li><b>Understanding Skepticism according to Sextus Empiricus' 'Outlines of Puritanism'</b>: Leo Gura explains that skepticism is a mental attitude that opposes all judgments to avoid dogmatization. This practice results in mental suspense initially, and eventually brings tranquility of mind. The skeptic neither affirms nor denies anything, ensuring a tranquil state of mind and soul. They believe that the quest for happinessor eudaimonialies in achieving peace of mind and refraining from taking positions on things that are not entirely certain.
</li><li><b>Skepticism and Appearance of Things</b>: Skeptics, he explains, do not deny appearances, but rather avoid taking them as undeniable fact. They acknowledge these appearances without drawing existential conclusions. They accept that things appear a certain way, but do not affirm that they truly are that way.
</li><li><b>Skepticism vs Dogmatism</b>: Gura further elucidates that skeptics do not dogmatize; they don't assert any non-evident objectives as scientifically definitive. They don't dispute appearances, but simply question the judgments made on these appearances. This distinguishes them from dogmatists who make assumptions based on appearances.
</li><li><b>Skepticism as a Mindset Not Ideology</b>: Gura warns against asserting skepticism as the only true philosophy as it holds its skepticism loosely, thus missing the trap of claiming authority. Skepticism allows for room for doubt and does not claim it to be an absolute truth.
</li><li><b>Skepticism, Happiness, and Eudaimonia</b>: He clarifies the pragmatic appeal of skepticism or Peronism by explaining that those who label things as intrinsically good or bad end up in perpetual disquiet. Skeptics or Peroneus philosophers, on the other hand, do not ardently pursue or evade anything leading to tranquility of mind.
</li><li><b>Understanding Reality Through Skepticism</b>: Ultimately, he reiterates the purpose of skepticism as challenging viewers' perspective on reality. It urges them not to become emotionally attached to their perceived reality. Instead, it promotes the acceptance of the appearance of things in their pure form without making existential claims. This practice discourages suffering and helps one to achieve eudaimonia or a state of tranquility.
</li><li><b>Concept of Proof</b>: Leo Gura discusses the inherent challenge in providing proof of truth due to the requirement of a continuously regressive series of proofs. He highlights that this eventually leads to a need for confidence in some base fact being accepted without justification, illustrating the limitations of beliefs and ideologies. He also elaborates that the true skeptic does not issue firm commitments to anything, maintaining an openness to the existence of absolute truth and avoiding dogmatic stances.
</li><li><b>Contrast between True and False Skepticism</b>: Gura contrasts true skepticism which is conscious of its limitations and employs self-questioning, with false skepticism observed today. He characterizes modern skeptics as aligned with science, logic, rationality, and naïve realism, often engaging in arguments and debates against other ideologies such as religion and spiritual concepts. This, he argues, is a closed-minded and outward-facing skepticism, rather than the introspective, open-minded nature of true skepticism.
</li><li><b>Dogmatic Nature of False Skepticism</b>: He criticizes false skepticism for its unchallenged acceptance and defense of paradigms and assumptions without questioning them, highlighting that it fails to apply skepticism to its own beliefs. He asserts that this dogmatic mindset leads to paradigm lock, implying that many modern scientists, atheists, academics, and rationalists risk being closed-off and entrenched in their beliefs.
</li><li><b>Characteristics of True Skepticism</b>: Gura explains the nuances of true skepticism as recognizing and questioning its own assumptions, maintaining a non-dogmatic, self-reflective stance, and acknowledging its potential for self-deception. Most importantly, it refrains from privileging any belief or ideology, maintaining an open-minded approach. 
</li><li><b>Paradigm Lock & Mind Deception</b>: Gura emphasizes that false skepticism and entrenched paradigms perpetuate ego, self-deception and limit learning. He asserts that true skepticism, on the other hand, serves as a tool for dismantling the ego and promoting self-honesty.
</li><li><b>Modern Skepticism as an Identity</b>: The video speaker discusses the tendency in some individuals to make an identity out of skepticism, turning it into a game of debunking and arguing, which goes against the true purpose of skepticism. This obsession with debunking others is seen as a form of ego gratification driven by an urge to out-argue others, leading to substantial suffering and delusion.
</li><li><b>End Goal of True Skepticism</b>: True skepticism aims at tranquility of mind and end of debate, seeking an open mind. True skeptics dont make strong positions or hold strong opinions, which would foster conflict or superiority over others. Their objective is enhancing the tranquility of their minds, which is the main measure of their quality as skeptics.
</li><li><b>Spirituality from True Skepticism</b>: True skepticism can lead to spirituality, not because it posits a belief in God, but by offering complete open-mindedness and freedom from all ideologies. The peace of mind attained through true skepticism becomes the ultimate God, once the mind is free from ideological and dogmatic positions.
</li><li><b>True Skepticisms Strengthens Inquiry</b>: Effective questioning or inquiry is pivotal in true skepticism. A true skeptic can keep inquiring and searching for the truth without taking any positions or harboring preferences, leading to radical open-mindedness, reminiscent of teachings found in Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta, and other non-duality philosophies.
</li><li><b>Practical Ramifications of Peronism</b>: Leo emphasizes how understanding Peronism can lead to radical open-mindedness, self-actualization, personal development, higher consciousness and its positive impact in everyday life domains like relationships, finances, businesses, and life purpose. This approach to living non-ideologically based on one's experiences and sensations can lead to mindfulness and profound states of tranquility and consciousness.
</li><li><b>Peronisms Benefits Against Mental Trickery</b>: Peronism creates a vigilance against the minds trickery, serving as a guard against getting stuck in one mindset or paradigm. It produces humility and modesty, leading to ideological humility that allows engagement with all sorts of ideologies in a non-judgmental manner. It provides intellectual freedom and promotes a holistic, multi-perspectival approach to learning. 
</li><li><b>Importance of Not Falling into Dogma</b>: Leo underpins the importance of letting go of positions and refraining from falling into the trap of ego and dogmatism. The focus should be maintaining an open mind, attaining tranquility of mind, or "landing the whale," rather than firm beliefs and positions that serve to solely fulfill the psyche's needs for identity and control.
</li><li><b>On embracing Peronism</b>: Embracing Peronism or true skepticism can lead to becoming a deep learner, capable of assembling big pictures and understanding reality on profound levels. The Greek concept of 'ataraxia', meaning robust equanimity, is what can be achieved through Peronism. This state of profound tranquility can be very transformative for an individual.
</li><li><b>On the power of proper use of reasoning</b>: Reasoning is powerful when used correctly to realize its own limitations. When misused, reasoning can hide its limitations, trying to crown itself as the ultimate truth. Being a dogmatist, regardless of the specific content of your beliefs, can never lead to happiness. Both religious and atheistic dogmatism have been noted to cause similar problems including closed-mindedness, ignorance of evidence and an inability to question one's own assumptions.
</li><li><b>On the dangers of modern skepticism</b>: Modern skepticism, when it becomes a paradigm or dogma itself, can be just as detrimental as religion has been. Science, technology, and materialism in the 21st century may pose a greater danger than religion due to their potential for harm when used excessively or without consideration of the potential repercussions.
</li><li><b>On the limitations of skepticism</b>: It is important to avoid turning skepticism into a dogma or using it as an excuse for inaction, laziness, or cruel behavior. True skepticism should turn one's attention inward, encouraging mindfulness, introspection and self-improvement. It should not lead to a nihilistic or depressing worldview or justify ignoring one's responsibilities. 
</li><li><b>On the practical application of skepticism</b>: True skepticism should be applied to question all of one's personal beliefs, dogmas, preferences and attachments. The ultimate aim is to internalize an ideological war that leads to personal growth and tranquility of mind.
</li><li><b>Emotion as a Clue for Attachment</b>: The video discusses that when an emotion disturbs you, it implies an ideological position and attachment. This disturbance can be because of the belief in the importance or danger of the matter at hand. To achieve tranquility, one needs to practice true skepticism and avoid holding a rigid position on these matters.
</li><li><b>Personal Development and True Skepticism</b>: The section highlights that practicing true skepticism isn't about being lazy or inactive, but about continuing personal development and avoiding rigid ideological beliefs. In the context of skepticism, personal development work helps dismantle attached positions and leads to tranquility.
</li><li><b>Relationship Between Purism and Enlightenment</b>: Enlightenment is described as the absolute truth, which cannot be argued or given evidence for  this truth must be experienced. Practicing Peronism puts one in an ideal ideological position to pursue non-duality, leading to the discovery of the Absolute Truth. In this regard, Peronism, enlightenment, and non-duality are intricately connected.
</li><li><b>Importance of Letting Go of Positions</b>: The video emphasizes the significance of refraining from latching onto positions. Our egos often try to latch onto positions to create an identity. To escape this trap, and to achieve tranquility of mind, one is advised to let go of positions. This is not an easy task, as it requires a great deal of self-awareness and consciousness development.
</li><li><b>Avoiding Ego and Dogmatism</b>: It's stressed that, to achieve tranquility of mind, one must not let their ego turn any pursuit (even letting go of positions) into a position or identity. This 'landing the whale,' or attainment of tranquility of mind, requires focused commitment and effort. It is suggested that one studies and embodies the principles found in the book "Outlines of Peronism."
</li><li><b>Utilizing Teachings as a Laxative</b>: The video likens the teachings to a laxative, implying that they should be used practically, tested, and then discarded once they've served their purpose of freeing the mind from attachments. The teachings should not be blindly accepted, worshipped, or turned into a new dogma. Progress requires embarking on a long journey of self-education and a commitment to growth, testing and refinement of beliefs, patience, and faith in the process.
