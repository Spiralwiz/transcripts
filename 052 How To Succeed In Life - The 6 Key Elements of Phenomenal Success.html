            <ul>
    <li><b>Self-Discovery</b>: According to Leo Gura, the first step to success is self-discovery. To achieve sustainable success, happiness, and fulfillment, it is essential to have a deep understanding of yourself. One must identify their top ten values, top five feelings, what they want in life, and what they dont want.
</li><li><b>Having a Life Purpose</b>: Having a life purpose ranked second in Leos list. He highlighted that successful people's daily actions lead towards a convergence point, which is outside themselves. It's about making a positive impact to the world. Clarity and commitment to the impact one wants to have are crucial.
</li><li><b>Setting Big Goals</b>: Setting big, ambitious goals is another key factor for success. Leo sustains that ambitious goals can supercharge motivation, resulting in greater success. Small and so-called 'realistic' goals often lead to underestimation of one's potential.
</li><li><b>Hard Work & Alignment with Purpose</b>: Hard work is a non-negotiable ingredient for success. There are no shortcuts or get-rich-quick schemes. The secret is to align your hard work with your purpose and values, which makes the work enjoyable and blurs the boundary between work and play.
</li><li><b>Discover Your Self</b>: Most people think they know who they really are but 99% do not. Real self-understanding requires an intentional journey and effort that includes clarity and articulation of your top values and feelings, articulation of what you truly want and don't want in life.
</li><li><b>Life Purpose</b>: A life purpose does not have to be super altruistic but should feel like a positive contribution to the world. This could be from impacting your family, starting a business, or creating an invention that benefits society. It's about what type of impact you want to make and being very clear about it and committed to it.
</li><li><b>Gargantuan Goals</b>: Ditch realistic goals for gargantuan goals. Don't limit yourself with what seems realistic and achievable. You'll often surprise yourself with how much you can achieve when you aim for ambitious goals.
</li><li><b>Hard Work</b>: There is no success without hard work. But the secret to effective hard work that doesn't feel hard is to align your tasks with your passions and purpose. This blurs the lines between work and play.
</li><li><b>Fulfillment in Work</b>: Finding work that aligns with your purpose and values can make your tasks feel less of a grind. As the divide between work and play start to become blurry, success becomes enjoyable and fulfilling.
</li><li><b>Blending work and personal time</b>: In order to achieve success, it is important to blend work and leisure time such that it feels less strenuous to work hard and accomplish goals.
</li><li><b>Working hard</b>: Successful people exert great efforts towards their goals. Sitting idle and not pushing oneself will not lead to success.
</li><li><b>Remaining persistent</b>: Successful people are persistent and stand their ground even in tough situations. They don't quit when things do not go as planned. 
</li><li><b>Embracing failure</b>: The most successful people have failed numerous times. Failure teaches more than success and helps in personal growth and tackling bigger challenges. 
</li><li><b>Mastering thoughts and emotions</b>: Emotional wellbeing is critical for success. It is crucial to have a positive mindset and not allow adverse emotions to take over.  Employing methods like journaling, meditation, and mentorship can aid in mastering thoughts and emotions.
</li><li><b>Studying Success</b>: Its essential to study the principles of success and learn from successful individuals. This could involve book reading, attending seminars, or joining groups of successful people.
</li><li><b>Resources for success</b>: The video host suggests using resources like his website, Actualized.org, that helps with advanced personal development, mastering thoughts and emotions, and guiding one on the principles of success.
