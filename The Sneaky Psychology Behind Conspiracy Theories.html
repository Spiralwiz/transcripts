[Music] all right let's talk about the stupidity that is
conspiracy theories this is juicy topic very controversial as well
so let's crack into it right off the bat have
you noticed that people who subscribe to conspiracy theories are
some of the dumbest people in society maybe there's a
deeper reason for that well of course there is which
is what we're going to explore here today people are
extremely susceptible to conspiracy theories especially now because there is
a confluence of several factors which are compounding upon each
other in today's day and age but of course conspiracy
theories have a long history that goes back throughout human
civilization but especially the problem we face right now is
that number one people have almost zero understanding of epistemology
or theory of knowledge therefore they fall into all of
the common traps within epistemology and epistemology is not taken
seriously within our education system it's not taught to anybody
basically and so therefore even people who go to college
and graduate college they're still basically epistemologically ignorant people and
therefore conspiracy theories of course are going to be prone
to happen the only way you can really avoid conspiracy
theories is by having a solid grasp of how epistemology
works which is advanced complicated stuff with many traps and
pitfalls and potentials for delusion and self-deception and uh that's
that's one of my favorite topics to talk about is
the the deceptions of the human mind and epistemology and
i've talked about that a lot in the past and
uh we'll talk more about it here today so that's
one reason a second reason is because of social media
social media now is creating these echo chambers of confirmation
bias where you're able to lock yourself into a bubble
an ideological bubble of like-minded peers and just create this
echo chamber where if you're a conservative you can just
listen to conservative news if you're a liberal you can
just listen to liberal news or whatever else you're into
if you're into conspiracy theories you can find entire websites
and radio shows and youtube channels and facebook groups that
are just going to reinforce all of your suspicions and
just feed you conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory and that's
actually another common trait of many conspiracy theorists is they
don't just buy into one or two generally if they
buy into one they're going to buy into a dozen
or more and that's because there's many common psychological factors
which contribute to the tendency for the mind to buy
into conspiracy theories and we're going to be discussing and
articulating all those factors here for you today so we're
going to take all the mystery out of conspiracy theories
here because we're going to look at them at a
deeper structural level and the social media platforms right now
are still in the early stages they're not well moderated
uh there's very little collective responsibility taken by the people
who own these social media companies it's mostly just uh
whatever gets clicks clickbait type topics whatever earns the most
money whatever has the best advertising revenue and a lot
of that stuff tends to be conspiracy theories because they're
very psychologically enticing and alluring and addictive even so uh
simply speaking you can make a lot of money peddling
conspiracy theories like people like alex jones have become multi-millionaires
doing this sort of stuff number three the third reason
why we're so susceptible these days is because we're in
late stage capitalism and there are several factors that come
with this late stage capitalism which uh make conspiracy theories
very uh alluring one is that we have this sort
of proliferation and freeing up the old mainstream narratives that
used to exist at sprouladamic stage blue if you're not
familiar with brother dynamics go check out my deep series
on sprout dynamics the old sort of judeo-christian or other
sorts of mainstream ways of interpreting the world these have
been breaking down over the last 50 years and as
a result there's a sort of a democratization of of
knowledge and information and even mainstream news sources are now
being questioned and there's this proliferation of news and different
points of view throughout social media and throughout the internet
because of the rise of the internet and so there's
a lot more perspectives in a sense this is great
it's a democratization of the media space this is great
but with it especially when you combine that with late
stage capitalism it creates a problem in that uh mostly
in late stage capitalism all the players in this field
you know because they're treating this news as a business
they're treating these the dissemination of information media is treated
as a business it's not treated as some higher purpose
to make people more conscious or more educated the purpose
is simply making money or becoming successful or famous and
so that being one of the goals of late stage
capitalism you know uh this sort of uh scramble to
get the most money the most clicks the most views
what what this means is is that our collective education
and intelligence as a society and civilization is for sale
to the highest bidder and uh so in a certain
sense the kind of the morality that used to be
there within mainstream religious ways of interpreting reality like within
christianity within islam and others this morality as problematic as
it was i'm not saying it was perfect but it
did serve a function this morality has been breaking down
and now it's just all about the money there's no
higher purpose to media or to education anymore in many
cases of course there's exceptions and then another problem with
late stage capitalism is that with lace age capitalism as
money is distributed and funneled upwards up the pyramid that
society is economically speaking majority of the resources go up
to the top one percent of the pyramid everybody else
the other 99 are increasingly fighting over scraps with fewer
and fewer resources and as a as a result of
this they are challenged to meet their survival needs and
when that happens these people of course become bitter they
become angry they become fearful they're struggling just to pay
their bills they're stuck in wage slavery this is very
frustrating it's exhausting they're working multiple jobs yet they're earning
worse of a living than their parents did back in
the 1950s or 60s or 70s and they're not sure
how to explain this and really getting into all these
complicated systemic problems with the economy and distribution of resources
and political issues and governmental issues this is way over
most people's heads and their intellects and so instead what
they need is they need a simple way to have
somebody to blame for this and of course that's uh
a lot of what conspiracy theories are about they they
serve as a very convenient explanatory mechanism which allows you
to make sense of reality in a rather crude way
but at least in some way because you got to
explain this somehow to yourself see so this is where
conspiracy theories become very alluring all right so uh really
i'm not interested here in this episode in debating and
debunking any one specific conspiracy theory that would be distraction
and that's a lot of the problem with conspiracy theories
is that they're extremely distracting to the mind it's very
easy to go off on a tangent down some rabbit
hole and you just get sucked further and further into
it and in that process you're losing something you're losing
perspective you're losing consciousness you're losing the ability to see
the big picture so we're going to focus on the
big picture here i want to make some meta remarks
about the mental attitude that is conspiracy theories it's a
mental attitude that people adopt what matters here in this
discussion is not the content of the conspiracy theories but
the structure and for this i refer you to my
episode called content versus structure where i explain this distinction
but basically see every conspiracy theory has a similar structure
but different content the conspiracy theory might be about aliens
or it might be about assassinations or murder or it
might be about war or it might be about some
genocide or some racist thing but the structure of all
of that is very very similar so we what we
want to do is we don't want to get stuck
on the content we want to look at the structure
this is what i mean by going meta you rise
above and you look down from a higher elevation perspective
to see what's really going on otherwise we get lost
in the trees and we don't see the forest so
to speak so the content of conspiracy theories varies wildly
but it's largely irrelevant it doesn't really matter whether aliens
are plotting to take over the planet or jews are
plotting to take over the planet or it's uh uh
you know it's the socialists and the marxists who are
plotting to take over the planet or maybe they're all
combined together it doesn't matter this that's not the important
thing the important thing is is how your mind is
thinking about reality and why you're getting drawn to these
sorts of narratives and ways of explaining reality in the
first place it's the structure which is very problematic epistemically
and politically and that's what we'll be looking into a
conspiracy theory basically is a projection of an ignorant ego
mind the more ignorant the ego mind is the more
proud and righteous and convinced it feels of its theories
and speculations about reality and it gets lost in the
labyrinths of its own mind in its own belief systems
of course this isn't just exclusive to conspiracy theories this
is the general problem of belief systems and paradigms and
ideologies i've talked about this in many episodes in the
past and so we're building upon that and we're going
to be bringing in those old episodes that you've hopefully
watched and connecting some of these dots related to conspiracy
theories how it all comes together see uh people have
a very difficult time distinguishing between their direct experience and
their belief systems they tend to conflate those two and
then they start to buy into these belief systems more
and more and more they get so convinced of it
they literally are unable to distinguish anymore between a belief
system and reality itself or their direct experience of it
and this becomes very problematic because this can lead into
all sorts of toxic ideologies uh cult-like behavior religious fanaticism
and and of course this is not just limited to
religion science is also susceptible to some of this and
i'll i'll point to that a little bit towards the
end so conspiracy theories are basically designed for people of
low intelligence who are intellectually lazy and are not interested
in doing serious epistemological investigation into the nature of reality
people who are not seriously interested in questioning their own
worldview but nevertheless they need some explanations for how reality
functions they want to understand uh and the appeal of
these conspiracy theories is that they make such people who
are actually ignorant feel like they're being very smart because
they're simply being contrarian and rebellious and iconoclastic uh when
in fact they're not really using their mind they're just
subscribing to a new niche form of conformity again i've
used this example in the past but it's a great
one it's this example of you know in high school
you have all the kids who are sort of conforming
and then you always have that little group of kids
that little clique of goths or punks or whoever who
are off doing their own thing and they think to
themselves that they're not conforming and then they have this
sort of philosophy well i'm anti-conformist but in that philosophy
they're all conforming together in the sort of anti-conformist way
and so even though on the level of content it
might seem like well they're not conformist but on the
level of structure they are conformist because they're just conforming
to some different content some punk content or some emo
or some goth content or whatever it is so let's
uh let's ground this discussion by actually articulating specifically what's
what some of these conspiracy theories are so we're not
just talking about abstractions so i'm going to run down
a list of very common conspiracy theories you can find
this on wikipedia and you can delve into them deeper
but again i want to caution you not to waste
your time too much going to this stuff because you
could you could spend the rest of your life lost
chasing down conspiracy theories you see the problem with that
is that it robs you of time and energy that
you could be using for other higher consciousness purposes all
right so here are some examples of course the flat
earthers people who believe the earth is flat and that
there's some sort of government conspiracy by nasa and others
to to to keep us from knowing that the earth
is flat why why would nasa and others want to
lie to us all these scientists in the world want
to lie to us about the the roundness of the
earth uh uh you know i've actually i've spent probably
quite a bit of time looking into these flat earthers
and what they actually believe i still don't really understand
why this conspiracy theory would be of any benefit to
anybody like it seems to have no practical uh import
or implications but anyways they believe it you can find
many videos online on youtube and so forth of these
flat earthers arguing about the flat earth in fact i
commonly get comments anytime i talk about the earth as
being round in one of my episodes just you know
off the top of my head i'll just say well
the earth is round you know as i'm talking about
some other topic and i'll usually always get at least
one or two folks down in the comments section telling
me how dumb i am for how how establishment i
am for for buying into the roundness of the earth
it's like leo you were talking about enlightenment you're supposed
to be awake and all this but yet you think
the earth is round how dumb are you so uh
yeah that's funny uh the moon landing being fake that's
also a very popular one the jfk assassination and then
of course with that comes all sorts of various kinds
of conspiracies about who did it and how they covered
it up and so forth david ike is very popular
uh and this sort of notion that there are these
reptilian races that are secretly siphoning energy from the humans
and somehow trying to enslave everybody through globalist government domination
and blah blah blah blah blah anti-vaxxers i i feel
like there's two version of anti-vaxxers they're sort of the
left-wing and the right-wing versions the left-wing version is uh
sort of opposing vaccines on the grounds that they're not
organic and healthy that they contain heavy metals that they
might cause autism and yeah there's probably some truth to
that um i myself am pretty leery of of getting
a vaccine because i'm very cautious about consuming heavy metals
i'm very paranoid about that because i've felt that the
toxic effects of heavy metals in my own system in
my own life it really can rob you of your
cognitive abilities and then there are sort of the right-wing
versions of anti-vaxxers i don't really i haven't studied them
that much but um uh but i i guess they
think that vaccines are like some sort of plot by
socialists and globalists to to mind control them or something
like that of course now with covet 19 that we're
going through here um in this year uh there's conspiracy
theories about its origins that it was engineered in some
chinese lab it was part of some weapons program or
something like that uh there's even different theories about did
it really come from china or someplace else then layering
on top of that there's conspiracy theories about bill gates
and the fact that he you know he's he's been
a big proponent of vaccinations uh he in fact warned
about the possibility of coronavirus in a famous ted talk
some some years before it happened and uh and so
so people say oh well that means you know he
he he wants to put microchips into vaccines and then
this is a form of mind control this is the
elites trying to control us and bill gates you know
he's the symbol of the elites because he's one of
the richest people in the world in all of this
uh the reality is that um and people will say
that oh bill gates has invested you know he stands
to gain billions of dollars from from from selling the
coronavirus vaccine with the microchip inside of it and that's
why he's doing it i always find this so silly
because in fact bill gates gives away billions of dollars
he's not making billions of dollars he's giving away billions
of dollars and he's not profiting off of these vaccines
uh that's that's not it's just absurd can you imagine
when you have as much money as bill gates he
has like 80 billion dollars or something like that maybe
more at this point and uh he's pledged to give
most of it away he's basically spending the rest of
his life giving it away but can you imagine having
80 billion dollars and then being like you know what
i need i need a scheme to make even more
money it's like no man bill gates has enough money
for uh anything he could possibly want he already has
purchased right so he he doesn't need a scheme he
doesn't need to race uh waste the the last 10
or 20 years of his life coming up with some
microchip vaccine scheme in order to earn an extra 20
billion dollars or whatever um because it would do absolutely
nothing for him he's already got all the money he
wants he's just giving back to the world at this
point but you know people people like to blame elites
so this is how they do it of course there's
the famous pizzagate conspiracy theories now these pedophile ring conspiracy
theories especially with the death of jeffrey epstein this just
fuels and pours fire on these theories and actually it's
been getting worse and worse so i was hoping that
they would be just like a fad that passes uh
it really got it got started with pizzagate maybe four
four years ago or so but it seems with jeffrey
epstein it just kind of gets get gets worse and
worse and worse and worse and of course now we
have q anon which is a very toxic problematic conspiracy
theory which says that there's a cabal of socialist globalist
satanic blood drinking uh devil worshiping uh pedophiles who want
to take over the united states government and the world
and that donald trump is the one who's gonna who
who's who is the heroically and valiantly defending us against
this it's crazy stuff but uh hey it's popular uh
then there's of course the old classic conspiracy theory of
the jewish elites running the world bankers and so forth
this has been popular for for centuries it's got a
bit of a resurgence now with the rise of trump
and trumpism but it was also popular in nazi germany
with hitler and so on uh usually the jews and
the communists are in league together to take over the
world in some way there's the illuminati the new world
order the term globalism globalists is uh is very commonly
used uh very thoughtlessly mindlessly used without a thinking about
what globalism really means uh george soros as being part
of this another conspiracy theory george soros has been the
funder of many uh progressive movements when in fact he
isn't a very common conspiracy theory that right-wingers fall into
of course the 911 inside job conspiracy theory uh i
see it seems like it died down in recent years
as we get further away from 911 but uh it
used to be quite popular you can find documentaries on
it and so forth chemtrails another one made popular by
alex jones i believe uh false flag terrorist attacks also
something that alex jones is notorious for he says that
the sandy hook school shootings in america were a false
flag operation and then he claims that many others were
false flag operations of course he's actually been sued by
the sandy hook victims the family members and the parents
and so forth and he's had to retract that since
but he's very shameless about how he does that any
kind of other deep state conspiracy theories are very popular
these days part of q anon or other you know
unrelated to q anon deep state conspiracy theories you know
this idea that that there there is a coup that
that the deep state is planning against donald trump the
fbi the cia you know they don't like donald trump
because he's he's trying to out them for their pedophilia
or whatever and for their satanic worship at the fbi
and that this is the deep state um there's that
uh obama birtherism started by trump and his lackeys and
still basically continue to this day and has various other
sorts of incarnations now with kamala harris as vice president
there's now a birtherism movement on her basically saying that
well is she really a u.s citizen and was she
really born in america this sort of stuff which is
of course groundless climate change denialism calling it a hoax
calling climate change just something that scientists invented or globalists
and socialists and marxists invented because they want to use
it to you know somehow enslave your mind and enslave
your children or whatever whatever the motives are cia planting
drugs and you know flooding black neighborhoods with drugs and
and so forth these sorts of conspiracy theories exist out
there mccarthyism the red scare that existed during the cold
war the origins of the iraq war often have a
lot of conspiratorial thinking around them like how the bush
and cheney administration how what what they really wanted was
they wanted iraq's oil and that's why they went into
iraq they had it all planned out and then and
then you could even lump 911 uh conspiracy theories into
that as well that you know 911 was just a
staged attack it was a false flag attack actually done
because they wanted to invade iraq and take their oil
and they needed some justification for it and so on
uh hillary clinton has a lot of conspiracy theories floating
around her how many people she's killed her emails and
the scandals involved there uh there's a lot of conspiracy
theories by the right wing around the clintons the death
of seth rich being a very uh uh prominent one
that used to be popular uh another theory is the
government is hiding ufo technology and in fact there's a
whole category called technology suppression conspiracy theories where there's a
various kinds of theories about how there are these advanced
technologies anti-gravity technologies fusion technologies free energy technologies that are
are all well known by governments and giant corporations and
elites and globalists but they're hiding it because they want
to make money from oil oil is just so profitable
that they're hiding this anti-gravity technology from us white genocide
is a conspiracy theory uh it's sort of a backlash
reaction against against the sort of progressive accusations of racism
um and segregation and other sorts of racist policies that
have been promoted in america for the last hundred years
and so white genocide is this idea that the actually
now you know because the whites were you know racists
and segregationists to the to the blacks and to the
browns for for all this time now the blacks and
the browns they want to get together with the socialists
and they want to do a genocide of the white
people they want to take it over that's why we
got immigrants coming over the border pouring through we got
hordes coming through and we've got we've got these caravans
of immigrants that's because you know george soros is funding
all this because he wants to create this white genocide
um cultural marxism this term popularized recently by jordan peterson
and his ilk and parts of the right wing um
this actually even though jordan peterson talks about cultural marxism
he never mentions to you that cultural marxism literally is
a conspiracy theory that dates back to like the 1940s
or 50s something like that i don't remember all the
details off my head you can actually go to wikipedia
and search type in cultural marxism you'll get a whole
page describing the conspiracy theory of cultural marxism it's actually
sort of a um this anti-semitic um conspiracy theory that
was basically [ __ ] concocted during uh the cold
war during the red scare and so forth uh which
tried to comb combine like the scary elements of of
of racism and anti-semiticism with uh anti-communist and anti-marxist uh
sort of pro-capitalist philosophies sort of combine them together into
this idea of cultural marxism this idea that they're they're
trying to sneak socialism and marxism in through our universities
and institutions that this is just like some sort of
plot to do this another common conspiracy theory is the
sort of whole second amendment they want to take your
guns away obama wants to take your guns every liberal
wants to take your guns and they're just looking for
some excuse and that in fact the sandy hook shooting
that was just a false flag operation because they needed
that they need all these school shootings in order to
take your guns away as justification because otherwise the people
won't stand for it and this is all just the
government's way of trying to defang the people so that
we couldn't stand up against a tyrannical government who wants
to you know take us over big brother wants to
take away your guns this one's very popular amongst uh
fanatics it's part of the whole gun culture they need
some way to justify having guns and and why you
should have a whole arsenal in your basement free masonry
is another common conspiracy theory fluoridation of water water and
the fluoride other chemicals that the government puts into your
fluoride in order to i don't know what make you
dumber make you more sheep-like make you subservient to big
brother now of course there is fluoride in the water
don't get me wrong government does put florida in your
water but the question is why they do it did
they do it because they want to control your mind
or they do it simply because it it actually there's
some evidence that it's helpful for for fighting tooth decay
you know dentists use fluoride toothpaste has fluoride in it
for those reasons uh now of course i'm not saying
it's healthy i'm not saying it's good personally i use
fluoride free toothpaste and i run my water through filters
to remove all the fluoride and other stuff from it
and if i go to the dentist i'm and he
wants to put fluoride in my mouth i'll tell him
no because i understand the toxic potentials of these chemicals
and i'd rather use more organic natural stuff i think
it's healthier you don't want fluoride in your brain and
so forth but uh do i think the government is
doing it on purpose because it wants to hurt people
no i think it's just the government doesn't have some
sort of higher consciousness conception of you know eating organic
foods and eating healthy foods other conspiracy theories include recently
we have we've had these fires on the west coast
in california and in oregon and right wingers have been
spreading these conspiracy theories that antifa has been setting these
fires actually joe rogan recently got into trouble because he
was spreading some of these conspiracy theories he had to
actually issue a retraction and an apology it was a
good heartfelt apology where he apologized for spreading the idea
that antifa was causing these oregon fires this is not
true but there's no factual evidence at least to back
this up but anyways they're popular and uh you know
if we want to go back to the old school
witch trials these were also basically conspiracy theories you could
think of them that way basically the whole anti-witch craze
was concocted it's very actually fascinating to read the history
of these witch trials and where it actually came from
i don't just mean the sale of mushroom i mean
the persecution of witches where did that come from it
actually stems back centuries prior to the salem witch trials
it goes back to european catholicism and uh you know
the catholics were very territorial they didn't want anybody infringing
on their monopoly on god and on religion so when
pagans and witches were practicing witchcraft and other pagan rituals
like taking psychedelics and doing astral projection and and consuming
various kinds of herbs and so forth you know witchcraft
is real it's a real practice um it's just not
what it's you know portrayed by the catholic church but
the catholic church started to demonize these witches there was
an entire council held with the mission to demonize these
witches and so they did and they went about prosecuting
persecuting them and prosecuting them putting them on trials executing
them condemning them and demonizing them there was a whole
campaign to demonize witchcraft which is why witchcraft is still
demonized and thought of negatively by most people today and
in fact today if you talk about witchcraft as being
a real thing many people will think you're crazy it's
like leo everyone knows witchcraft is fake no that's just
that's just the nonsense this catholic church cocked up uh
concocted uh centuries ago witchcraft is real it's just it's
not what it's been portrayed to be it's different than
what you think it is so some of these conspiracy
theories are left-wing theories but more of them are right-wing
and that is important to notice if you're thinking well
shouldn't the conspiracy theories be equally spread and distributed between
left and right wing between liberals progressives and conservatives no
not at all because the kind of mind that a
conspiracy theory appeals to is at a certain level of
cognitive moral and spiritual development for this to really appreciate
what i'm saying here you need to go watch some
of my series on spiral dynamics and on the nine
stages of ego development these are developmental psychological models that
have been developed by high quality scientists and psychologists researchers
who've studied this stuff what it shows us is that
the human ego mind goes through these different developmental stages
and these are stages of higher development and more consciousness
the more conscious the ego mind gets the less ego
one has the more humane the more sophisticated ones understanding
of the world the less animal-like your understanding of the
world the more animal-like your mind is the more prone
you will be to conspiracy theories the more intelligent you
are the more wisdom you have the more consciousness you
have the more spiritual you are the more moral you
are uh the less you will be prone to these
conspiracy theories and as i've said in my conscious politics
series and other episodes where i talk about politics the
left and the right wing are not just two sides
of the same coin they're asymmetrical they're asymmetrical in their
cognitive moral and spiritual development right-wingers and conservatives don't like
to hear this but the fact is that overall and
there's of course exceptions overall generally speaking very generally speaking
in the big picture sense liberals and conservatives and progressives
are more conscious and more cognitively and morally developed and
more mature than conservatives and right-wingers and the more conservative
you are the more right-wing you are the more fanatical
you are about your right-wing conservative beliefs the lower your
cognitive and moral and spiritual development and the more prone
you are to conspiracy theories now that doesn't mean that
liberals are perfect and that progressives are immune from all
problems they're not and they can also fall into some
conspiracy theories all right so don't misunderstand what i'm saying
here i'm trying to be objective the problem in trying
to explain this to a conservative or to a right-winger
mindset is that if you have that kind of belief
system you're so stuck in it that if you hear
what i'm saying here it's gonna feel like a personal
attack upon your belief systems and going to feel like
leo you're just being some left-wing biased shill here you're
just hiding your own biases i'm not hiding my own
biases yes i have a left-wing bias in the sense
that i value consciousness selflessness and truth and it's not
the case that those things are equally divided between the
left and the right the right values consciousness selflessness and
truth less so than the left again there are many
exceptions and that does not mean that the left is
perfect but this is what it is uh now you
might also be thinking here but leo aren't you just
being a shill here for the establishment you've mentioned all
these conspiracy theories but hey i thought some of these
are true are you just saying we're supposed to accept
the mainstream narrative of course not but here is where
you have to start to make subtle distinctions of course
there is corruption in the government and in the police
force there is corruption in the military there's corruption within
business of course the fbi the cia the nsa and
the military do secret things of course there is bias
and propaganda in the media this idea by noam chomsky
called manufacturing consent is is a very real systemic problem
within our media of course capitalism distorts the flow of
information because you know money corrupts education and many other
systems of course even science and history cannot be taken
for granted and even they contain various kinds of delusions
deceptions and corruptions so corruption is a very real problem
i have a whole episode called how corruption works go
check that out if you really want a deep understanding
of corruption corruption is a serious problem but conspiracy theories
are not a valid way to think about and understand
how corruption works in fact a conspiracy theory is just
adding corruption on top of corruption conspiracy theories are themselves
a corruption of the mind it's a corrupt way of
thinking about the corruption that you see out there corruption
is a very sneaky counter-intuitive and a deeply threatening topic
to talk about because if you really want to understand
what corruption is ultimately what it's going to lead you
to if you think about it deeply is you will
realize that the corruption is not just found out in
the world the corruption found in the out in the
world is actually a reflection of your own inner personal
corruption and this is precisely what many conspiracy theories are
preventing you from realizing because they externalize the corruption and
paint it onto some evil cabal of globalists out there
who are trying to mind control you or whatever so
by no means am i some establishment chill i'm very
in a certain sense radical and progressive with my ideas
i have some very visionary ideas for what i think
humanity should be doing how government should be restructured i'm
not at all happy with the current systemic problems and
corruptions of of our government they certainly exist and with
our economic system and with our policing system and with
our culture in large and with our education system many
of these systems are deeply deeply corrupt but we are
not going to fix that by engaging in this david
ike style conspiratorial thinking about reptilians and jews and cultural
marxists and globalists trying to you know mind control us
that's not what is really going on there all right
so there's different ways of of criticizing and thinking about
the problems that come with mainstream media and with the
establishment in fact and i i've i've mentioned this in
in other political episodes of mine you have to make
a distinction between criticizing a thing or a person from
above or from below see this is very very important
people confuse this all too often and especially conspiracy theorists
a lot of times there's a critique to be leveled
at for example the government but you can critique the
government from below or from above so a critique of
of the government from below would be something like a
libertarian critique of the government something along the lines of
like well the government is illegitimate and it's just you
know it's a monopoly of force and it is just
uh it's taxing us in tax everyone knows taxation is
just theft and so therefore we need to dis dismantle
and reduce the size of the government because the government
is is is stealing my taxes from me my right
earned taxes and so forth uh there's that kind of
critique of the government this is a critique from below
someone who doesn't really understand why government is there what
taxes are really for how monopoly of force works if
you want more uh info on that go check out
my episode called libertarianism is nonsense where i deconstruct libertarianism
uh and but then a critique of government from above
would be something like um a critique along the lines
of that for example our government is still not fully
democratic we have the electoral college for example in america
here we have gerrymandering we have other kinds of arcane
uh systemic processes that are holdovers from you know centuries
ago during the founding of the country which have become
antiquated now and need to be updated because there's still
a lot of people minorities and so forth in this
country who are not being properly represented in the senate
in the house of representatives in the presidency on the
supreme court and in local governments and elsewhere for example
puerto rico doesn't have representation in the senate because it's
not officially a u.s state even though it has to
abide by u.s law in many cases which is determined
by the senate in many cases and uh also washington
d.c doesn't have representation in washington d.c kind of an
ironic strange loop how that works um but so there's
a case to be made for example for making washington
dc a state or even making like a territory like
guam a state or let them become independent if they
want to right so this would be a sort of
a critique of our current system from above it's from
above because what we're actually recognizing here is that there's
there's certain blind spots and unconscious areas selfish ways unjust
ways in which we're treating people with our current system
see um so yeah it's fine to be anti-established but
make sure you're being anti-establishment from above and not from
below i notice a lot of youtube channels and youtubers
and other political commentators and pundits and so forth who
are critical of the establishment but from below and not
from above it's sort of a a stupid critique rather
than a highly conscious systemic critique now you might be
wondering but leo what about all the conspiracy theories that
came true aren't you ignoring those very conveniently here what
about watergate iran contra the iraq war the gulf of
tonkin the cia involvement in cuba and staging coups in
south america how about the caa involvement in iran and
recently in um what is it venezuela uh nsa spying
programs how about the project mk ultra the cia mind
control program which is documented to have some legitimacy to
it how about co intel pro where the us government
went after communists and socialists and various kinds of radicals
and hippies and blacks and and others other minorities and
so forth gays and whatever else um because you know
the government had a sort of conservative right wing bent
to it and they perceive those as all being um
a threat to established power uh famously nixon nixon famously
basically started the drug war specifically in order to uh
persecute his political opponents which he thought of as the
blacks the hippies the gays the psychedelic users the the
weed smokers and um that's why the drugstore the drug
war was basically started you can actually find documented quotes
i actually have i have uh posted these quotes on
my blog in the past you can go look for
those if you want so there's you know so it
is true that sometimes people do shady or evil [
__ ] that's true sometimes the government does abuse its
power and uh behaves in selfish ways but this is
not the same thing as a conspiracy theory you need
to distinguish between a conspiracy and a conspiracy theory these
are different things and we'll get into in a minute
here what that distinction really is you see um many
times when you argue with conspiracy theorists they will cite
some of these legitimate conspiracies that happened as evidence for
the fact that you know some crazy other conspiracy theory
that they believe in like reptilians or globalists or you
know jews or whatever taking over the world that that
that could also be true you know if the gulf
of tonkin incident was true if nsa spying was true
if the cia staged some sort of coup in south
america if the cia did some co-intel pro thing or
whatever uh and if we started the iraq war for
some suspicious reasons you know there were no weapons of
mass destruction that was a lie uh and and it
seems like you know dick cheney knew that it was
a lie or whatever um if that is true then
surely some of these other ones must be true as
well and that's exactly c that's exactly how sneaky the
mind gets when it starts to deceive itself so really
of course conspiracy theories are just a breed of self-deception
i have a whole series three-part series on self-deception go
check it out self-deceptions part one and two and three
which explain a lot of this and we'll dovetail nicely
with this material here but what you have to understand
about the nature of falsehood and deception is that it's
never unalloyed unabashed pure 100 falsehood the way the devil
deceives you is by sprinkling falsehood into kernels of truth
the best falsehoods they conflate falsehood with truth such that
the two are alloyed together and very difficult to disentangle
such that it becomes very convincing you see and when
a naive mind that isn't very educated and isn't very
sophisticated gets to hear the entire alloy here together where
like for example you create some sort of documentary which
will alloy together little bits and you know sprinkles of
truth with a whole pile of [ __ ] and
mixes them together so perfectly that your mind just completely
buys into it and it can't distinguish the the truth
from the falsehood this is how a conspiracy theory is
is truly spread it's not just pure lies see naive
people think that well if it's a lie it's just
it must all be a lie no no no if
it was all a lie obviously you would reject it
that's the easy case the difficult case that you have
to really contemplate and take seriously is that the things
that you're being fed are not pure falsehoods but they
aren't truth either they're somewhere in the middle they're perverted
twisted partial versions of the truth that's what a conspiracy
theory really is so if we take a look at
something like pizzagate if i say pizzagate is a conspiracy
theory and it's [ __ ] people will say who
are into the theory they will say ah leo but
but what about those emails that i read and what
about the fact that you know there there really was
this pizza parlor or whatever in washington dc and it
really had some sort of symbols on its menu and
it really did connect with this and with that and
with this and and it's all connected together and here's
how it is like you're ignoring all that evidence yeah
well all of those individual pieces might have some truth
to them i'm not denying that there might have been
a pizza parlor i'm not denying there might have been
some email about something somewhere you know in the podesta
emails and the clinton emails i'm not denying that there
might have been some symbol on some menu somewhere but
that doesn't mean that when you connect all those things
together it means what you think it means what your
conspiracy theory alleges happened in that pizza parlor you see
actually when you go into that pizza parlor you discover
there's not a basement in there where children are supposedly
held to be raped there's no basement at all right
but see the way the mind works is that it
cherry-picks information and it combines little bits of truth with
with overly exaggerated narratives and then it comes up with
this story which is very very difficult to debunk once
it's been lodged into somebody's mind see because once it's
in your mind it's stuck in there and then if
you're a low consciousness person you don't want to really
question your own mind very much and that's exactly the
appeal of these conspiracy theories is that they externalize your
attention such that your attention is riveted outwardly rather than
turning inwardly and one of the best ways to do
that is with very sensationalist and morally stimulating bits within
the theory so this is why pedophilia is so popular
as a conspiracy theory because see basically it's a form
of demonization so what is the what is the most
evil thing you can think of in the world well
many people would say it's the abuse of children the
sexual abuse of children right and yeah it's a very
problematic thing when it happens and i'm not denying it
happens of course it happens and see one of the
things conspiracy theorists will say to me is something like
oh leo but you're denying pedophilia no i'm not of
course pedophilia happens nobody is denying that uh the problem
though is the kind of narratives that you spin about
pedophilia and who you call a pedophile without any kind
of serious evidence you see so the appeal of the
appeal of pedophilia is is especially strong with the right
wing because what you can do is you can you
can you can reject somebody else's world view simply by
calling them a pedophile and then what that does is
that that removes you of the responsibility of actually for
example going and reading some karl marx or trying to
actually have a conversation with a socialist to understand what
the socialists ideas are are about how to restructure the
economy or to maybe consider the possibility that hillary clinton
is not this evil person that you think she is
i mean maybe she's not the greatest person in the
world but you know is she a pedophile is she
a pedophile enabler i doubt it um you see so
but but if you really hate hillary clinton and you
need some reason to hate her or you really hate
socialism and you don't want to study it or you
really hate marxism or you really you know hate some
person or some group of people the easiest way to
smear them and to remove responsibility from trying to understand
their point of view is to call them pedophiles to
spin up some sort of narrative for how they're enabling
pedophilia because when you do that there's an immediate gut
level reaction of like oh my god that person is
is so horrible that i can't even listen to them
the only thing they deserve is imprisonment or death or
something like this see now again that doesn't mean there
aren't pedophiles of course there are but uh one of
the one of the most toxic and pernicious conspiracy theories
that is very popular these days is this idea that
elites are somehow extra pedophiles it's like all the elites
are the pedophiles and to me this is this is
a very very silly idea because there's no reason why
elites or millionaires or billionaires would be pedophiles any more
than poor people would be so my question to you
if you're buying into these pedophile conspiracy theories is why
aren't you going after the poor pedophiles why aren't you
going after the middle class pedophiles because after all how
many millionaires and billions are billionaires are there in the
world less than one percent by definition the elites are
like less than one percent so by definition pedophilia is
much more common in the other 99 so really if
we want to get serious here if i'm going to
use the same kind of logic that you've been using
against the elites here with pedophiles let's say are you
in are you in the lower class are you in
the middle class so it's very obvious if you think
about it just for a moment for a minute it's
very obvious that there are way more pedophiles in the
middle class than that there are in the upper class
and there's probably even more pedophiles within the poorest class
than there is in the middle class simply because there's
more poor people than middle class people and there's more
middle class people than there is um uh these one
percent elite millionaires and billionaires now the harm done to
children is the same it doesn't matter to a child
if he or she is molested by a poor person
or a middle-class person or a billionaire in fact if
you wanted to choose who to get molested by you'd
probably want to get molested by by a billionaire because
at least he'll do it on a yacht somewhere on
some fancy island rather than you know in the more
ordinary conventional way in which most children get molested which
is just like in some dirty motel room or even
in just some you know poor house or some project
or whatever in some ghetto see but it's not as
appealing you see because if you're in the lower class
or the middle class you've got a gripe against late
stage capitalist elites you've got to gripe against late stage
capitalism but you don't understand that in many cases so
you need some way to demonize them and to blame
it on them so rather than doing a deep systemic
analysis of the problems of capitalism instead what you do
is you say ah it's those it's those billionaires who
are actually raping children they're the real problem if only
we get rid of them then the world would be
a better place see but actually it's your class it's
the class that's criticizing the elites that has more pedophiles
in it but you don't care about that because that
doesn't serve your interest it doesn't serve your ego's agenda
you also need to distinguish between conspiracy theories versus investigative
journalism so many of these so-called true conspiracy theories uh
you know the iraq war and watergate and nsa spying
tapping and so forth a lot of these came out
through high quality investigative journalism this is different than conspiracy
theories there is legitimate stuff to be investigated and investigative
journalism is a serious endeavor which is underfunded and we
need more funding for investigative journalism which is why you
should support you know high quality newspapers and investigative journalists
we need more of that but investigative journalism is difficult
it's rigorous you have to be careful you can't just
publish whatever scandalous accusations you want and speculations about people
you can't just publish random theories about people being pedophiles
you need to bring the evidence you need to be
careful because if you publish something that's false you're going
to get sued and you're going to have you know
um various severe penalties upon you but conspiracy theories you
know they're not held back and conspiracy theorists are not
held back by any kind of journalistic standards journalism requires
serious standards of integrity which conspiracy theories utterly lack people
like alex jones also you should distinguish between conspiracy theories
and systems thinking so a conspiracy theory is usually trying
to blame some group of elites at the top it's
trying to paint people as evil and us as the
good guys the ones who are holding the conspiracy whereas
systems thinking go check out my episode called intro to
systems thinking sees how complex parts within a larger system
like an economy or within government or within culture are
interconnected and play play into each other various kinds of
feedback mechanisms exist where parts of the system are not
blamed but it's all seen holistically in a sense what
we're talking about here is sort of a systems thinking
about the mind we're seeing how the mind is working
with these conspiracy theories we're seeing the mind as a
system we're seeing these conspiracy theories of sort of like
software that gets lodged into this into into into the
mind as a system and then how it gets reinforced
by various social systems like in the media or by
our economic system and and so forth and how it
serves the larger ultimate system of the ego and it's
survival you see so this is very different systems thinking
is very rigorous high quality thinking conspiracy thinking is just
speculation various kinds of beliefs and demonizations of of other
people so let me now give you uh a sort
of a more rigorous and fleshed out definition of what
a conspiracy theory is and here i'll be quoting from
wikipedia i have several quotes for you quote a conspiracy
theory is not simply a conspiracy conspiracies are actual covert
plots planned and or carried out by two or more
persons a conspiracy theory on the other hand is an
intellectual construct a template imposed upon the world to give
the appearance of order to events positing that some small
hidden group has manipulated events a conspiracy theory can be
local or international focused on single events or covering multiple
incidents and entire countries regions and periods of history conspiracy
theorists see themselves as having privileged access to special knowledge
or a special mode of thought that separates them from
the masses who believe the official account end quote see
that's a really really good core definition of what we're
dealing with here we're distinguishing conspiracies from conspiracy thinking and
conspiracy theorists and we'll be talking more about these elements
as we go i want to give you some more
quotes quote according to frank mitz conspiracism denotes belief in
the primacy of conspiracies in the unfolding of history conspiracism
serves the needs of diverse political and social groups in
america and elsewhere it identifies elites blames there for economic
and social catastrophes and assumes that things will be better
once popular action can remove them from positions of power
as such conspiracy theories do not typify any particular epoch
or ideology end quote that's from frank mitz and then
we have another quote here roger cohen has suggested that
the popularity of conspiracy theories in the arab world is
the ultimate refuge of the powerless al-munin saeed has noted
the danger of such theories for they keep us not
only from the truth but also from confronting our faults
and problems and then we have another quote here quote
conspiracism is a particular narrative form of scapegoating that frames
demonized enemies as part of a vast insidious plot against
the common good while it valorizes the scapegoater as a
hero for sounding the alarm end quote that's by burlet
and lions so this point about scapegoating and feeling like
a hero is a is one of the hooks of
conspiracy theories that's how they get you especially with the
sort of pedophile stuff the reason these pedophile conspiracy theories
are so popular is because it's an instant way to
feel like a hero you see if i'm just an
ordinary guy going about my ordinary life i have no
sense of purpose no sense of meaning i'm going to
my lame starbucks nine to five job i'm grinding it
out there then i'm coming home i got nothing really
to do with my life when i hear all of
a sudden that these rich billionaire elites are raping and
molesting children all over the place i get outraged by
it of course and then i feel like i'm a
hero because now i've got a crusade i'm crusading against
these pedophiles and i go online i go on some
forum and i gather other people who are interested in
this topic and we together we form a coalition we
are like the we are going to be the ones
who stand up against these evil pedophiles we're doing something
good for the world all of a sudden my life
has a sense of meaning and purpose i feel good
about myself and i don't really have to take responsibility
and of course i'm really doing nothing to prevent pedophilia
i mean that's that's the ultimate absurdity of these of
these pedophile conspiracy theories it does nothing to prevent pedophilia
in fact if anything it might it might make the
problem worse because by blaming and accusing people who aren't
really pedophiles of being pedophiles this waters down the accusation
and when this gets thrown around too much it's the
same problem as you know the boy who cried wolf
you want to be careful that when you call someone
a pedophile you have really solid evidence that they're a
pedophile and usually the only way you can do that
is through serious investigative work via the fbi via law
enforcement using courts using juries and because these are such
serious accusations with serious criminal penalties they must go through
some sort of highly accountable process like a court system
because if you're just going to use vigilante justice against
pedophiles it's going to turn literally into witch trials and
that's literally what has happened today in this era this
sort of jeffrey epstein era is that people like alex
jones have turned pedophilia into the 21st century wish trials
i mean that that's that's the best way to put
it who do you not like whoever you don't like
whoever you suspect whoever doesn't fit into your worldview just
call them a pedophile and then tar and feather him
and try to get him de-platformed and try to um
you know make his name so associated with pedophilia that
he can't even show his face on tv anymore because
of how much people hate him and all the death
threats he gets and all this that's i mean it's
it's a modern day witch trials the only thing that's
missing is the burning people at the stake now again
that doesn't mean there aren't real pedophiles out there there
are but the proper way to deal with that is
through classic law enforcement and if you're really concerned about
catching pedophiles and preventing that then i suggest you become
civilly active and you don't go out there and just
demonize people but that you actually start to research the
problem of pedophilia why does it exist why are people
pedophiles can they be reformed how do you change them
and increase funding for law enforcement pay more taxes you
see the irony is that uh right wingers are the
ones who who love to call people pedophiles the most
but then when it comes to actually properly funding the
government with taxes they want to cut taxes they don't
want to fund all these government agencies which are responsible
for looking after child abuse for example one of the
funniest things about this q anon conspiracy theory is that
they like to say well trump is the one who
is saving us from the pedophiles oh yeah well then
how come the trump administration has actually cut severely cut
funding for government agencies that are responsible for looking after
child sex trafficking how come the trump administration does not
support international organizations which are interested and devoted to researching
and preventing problems with child sex trafficking the trump administration
has no interest in this they don't they have no
interest in in serious policy solutions to any of these
problems they're just using this to rile people up you
see and that's that's a lot of what the right
wing is engaged in with with this particular toxic form
of conspiracy theory i have another quote for you here
last one from wikipedia quote a conspiracy theory is an
explanation for an event or a situation that involves a
conspiracy by sinister and powerful groups often political and motivation
when other explanations are more probable end quote so that's
one of the keys here is that a proper conspiracy
theory usually contains this element of sinisterness and evil there's
some evil group of people planning to do something evil
and what this does is this creates a separation between
us versus them we are the good guys we are
the guys trying to uncover the conspiracy theory and they
over there are the evil guys who have plotted this
conspiracy against us it sets up this dynamic it's implicit
in conspiracy theories the reality though is that when your
intellect becomes sophisticated when your consciousness grows what you realize
is that nobody is in control of reality and nobody
is in control of society society is a headless system
with no single individual or group of individuals in control
of anything there is no way in which an individual
can control the government there is no way in which
a couple of corporations can control the world or even
american politics these systems are way too complex and way
too distributed and there's so many countervailing forces that really
every element every actor in this system that we might
call the government or we might call our society or
human civilization as a whole every there's there are many
actors there are many agents with different survival agendas of
course these survival agendas cause people to behave in selfish
ways sometimes this selfishness gets expressed in very evil seeming
ways uh in criminal ways and so forth and of
course we should go after and prosecute those criminals and
we have a whole system devoted to that of course
it's been there for thousands of years but uh but
nobody is inc is in control of these systems there's
not one single judge or president or ceo or billionaire
or millionaire or a group of jews or a group
of reptilians or a group of anybody that controls this
and the reason that is is because the majority of
these agents are deeply unconscious they don't know what they're
doing they're behaving on pure survival instincts even the millionaires
and billionaires even the bankers even the elites even the
presidents they're not conscious they don't really know what they're
doing now can they come up with a plot here
and there to do something nefarious of course they can
sure the cia could come up with some plot to
depose some dictator or whoever somewhere um yeah they could
do that um the military could have various kinds of
you know plots that they run but but this but
the but the larger idea that there's some group of
of elites in control of anything is laughable nobody is
in control of anything that's the that's the miracle of
existence of human civilization it's a completely out of control
system you couldn't control it if you wanted to there's
no evil bond villain that is that it's gonna dominate
the world it's impossible it's it's literally impossible because no
one human can do it and no small group of
people could do it because every group of people you
see if there was some secret cabal of reptilians and
jews and globalists and communists and socialists all working together
to dominate the world those people themselves would not be
able to get along all of the problems that we
face in in the macro scale within society at large
where we can't get along with each other because we're
all different actors with different survival agendas and we have
different biases and different perspectives on the world such that
it's impossible for us all to agree on almost anything
well likewise if you had a cabal of of reptilians
and so forth they would all be fighting with each
other as well this idea that that they're just these
it's like this evil mastermind group where they perfectly know
what they're doing and and they're all in agreement about
what the what the plan is it's it's just silly
because if you have that group you're gonna have some
other group that wants to do something else you're gonna
have more and more groups you're gonna have hundreds of
groups all these groups will have different agendas and want
different things some groups will want money some groups will
want to have sex with children some groups will want
to dominate the world some group will want you know
freedom and love and peace and happiness and all these
groups will fight with each other and that's what society
is that's not a conspiracy that's that's society that's civilization
that's human history it's been that way since the very
beginning for thousands of years no one's in control what
we call evil does not come from truly conscious malicious
intent it comes from unconsciousness selfishness and ignorance not some
evil power for overlords the reason we're focusing on this
topic of evil so much here is because i think
one of the core functions of conspiracy theories is that
they help a naive human mind understand why evil exists
this is a deep and powerful question but most people
most human minds don't think about evil deeply they don't
want to think about evil deeply they want some sort
of easy answer to the problem of evil and the
way they answer that is oh it's the culture of
marxists it's the jews it's the reptilians it's the the
globalists or something like that when in fact the true
problem of evil is that evil is within evil is
a projection of your own mind for more on that
go check out my episode called uh what is the
devil where i explain to you how evil really works
but most people don't want to admit that they're the
devil which is why conspiracy theories are so useful so
there's no serious risk that you should be worried about
that the world will be dominated by some small secret
cabal of anybody it's just not going to happen that's
not how our system works so there's a general principle
that i want to explain to you of the mind
and this is the principle that the mind hates confusion
and not knowing the ego mind wants to know the
ego mind needs to make sense of its environment this
is fundamental you've been doing this since you've been born
you do it so effectively so seamlessly so smoothly that
most of us don't even understand that we're doing it
it'll take you many years to understand that your mind
is spinning narratives to make sense of reality so when
you're not conscious of this you go about the process
willy-nilly flying by the seat of your pants and you
fall into very many traps reality is so complex that
most minds cannot handle the complexity of reality so instead
what the mind does is the mind fabricates comfortable stories
gross oversimplifications and exaggerations and perverted distortions of reality and
it confuses these perverted maps and distortions for reality itself
most minds are unable to explain why evil and selfishness
exists in the world most minds are desperately struggling for
meaning and are deathly afraid of meaninglessness of nihilism and
most minds lack any kind of introspection or taking of
responsibility for one's own meaning making process or one's worldview
this worldview is just absorbed by osmosis from the culture
you happen to grow up in and so given all
of that it becomes much easier for the mind to
simply concoct a conspiracy theory than to deeply question reality
or its own worldview see i could admit that i
don't know anything i could admit that i'm ignorant i
could admit that i might be tricking myself with my
own mind but that would mean i would have to
spend years and decades reading books and contemplating racking my
own mind introspecting inwards questioning myself doubting myself doubting my
culture doubting all of the things that were taught to
me in school by my by my religion my teachers
by my pastors by my family by my friends i
could question all that and go through that whole decade-long
process but that would involve a lot of emotional labor
it would be very difficult it would be very time
consuming it would cause me a lot of uncertainty and
inner turmoil as i reflect inwards and i discover difficult
things and delusions within my own mind and i discover
just how little i understand reality i could do that
or i could take the easy route what's the easy
route hey it's the globalists they're pedophiles they're responsible for
the reason that i am stuck in this dead end
job the reason i'm a wage slave and the reason
that um you know i pay too much in taxes
and the reason that government is so [ __ ]
up wow look how simple that is i can quickly
summarize that in a few minutes i can provide all
sorts of evidence to to confirm that it's true if
i'm not too picky about about things uh and it's
it's very emotional i can get pissed off about it
i can create a crusade around it like okay yeah
now let's let's rally around this and let's go get
those globalists and pedophiles and so forth see and i
don't have to enter do any serious inner work there's
no emotional labor there's no difficulty of taking responsibility i
don't have to look inside to see that i'm the
devil that i create evil that i myself have various
kinds of shadow elements and dark sides to me and
that i also have sexual perversions as many people do
um and sexual repressions and things like this and i've
done bad stuff in my life as well see taking
responsibility for that is very challenging that takes a mature
adult mind to do that that takes seriousness that takes
a commitment to truth self-honesty and there's no immediate payoff
for it you're not going to earn a lot of
money doing that you're not gonna become famous doing that
people are not gonna you know praise you for doing
that you're not even gonna get much of a sense
of meaning from doing that whereas if you go with
this pedophile conspiracy theory bam instant sense of meaning instant
purpose the world seems fully explained there's no more questions
i don't have to admit that i don't know anything
anymore now i know everything there's no more confusion perfect
that's what the mind wanted the mind hates confusion the
mind hates not knowing and so there you are it's
very easy and convenient for the ego mind to trace
all the evil in the world back to one source
which is not itself and of course as you should
expect there's only one source of evil in the world
and that is yourself that's the one thing your mind
is avoiding that's what all conspiracy theories are basically avoiding
is the realization that the only source of evil in
the world is your own self that's what you're in
denial about fundamentally and that's why you come up with
all these distractions and you blame all these other people
out there because otherwise you'd have to get to work
on all the evil that's within all the selfishness that's
within all the ignorance that's within conspiracy theories also allow
you to feel superior morally superior to all those other
evil brainwashed people out there who are part of the
conspiracy or believing in the official narrative you see once
you get a hold of something like oh yeah i
understand how the pedophiles are taking over the world once
you get that sort of belief system in your mind
you start to feel special you start to feel morally
right you're like oh yeah i'm so good but that's
exactly how the devil tricks you when you start to
feel like you're good and that others are evil that's
exactly what then will get you to not reflect on
your own actions and it's the lack of reflection on
your own selfish actions which literally is the cause of
all the evil in the world again i explain that
in a lot more detail in my episode about what
is the devil spoiler alert you're the devil not some
pedophile not jeffrey epstein not whoever not even donald trump
you're the devil the only problem in the world is
you and that's exactly the last thing that you want
to hear so you're very busy denying it you've invented
very sophisticated highly elaborate and intelligent mechanisms for denying it
but you're not conscious of these mechanisms so these conspiracy
theories become a natural outlet for an ignorant and closed
mind so here's my fundamental problem with conspiracy theories i've
identified six core problems problem number one they promote a
fundamentally wrong view of reality and consciousness this view of
duality that there is us versus them that there's a
separation between my enemies and me the good guys and
the bad guys and of course i'm the good guy
everyone else is the bad guy between the criminals and
the law-abiding people between the elites and the non-elites between
the billionaires and the ordinary folk like me this is
fundamentally delusional reality the ultimate truth is that reality is
one reality is non-dual everything is interconnected there's no separation
between anything any evil i see out in the world
is really a projection of my own mind and everything
i see in the world is just literally myself now
this is a deep point that i can't really fully
go into here to really understand what that means you're
gonna have to go see my episodes about non-duality and
awakening and other advanced spiritual concepts that explain this oneness
but uh but yeah but this idea of separation that
there are people out there that need to be punished
or harmed uh who are doing bad things this whole
notion of good versus bad good versus evil all of
this is nonsense all of this is a fundamentally wrong
view of reality and it needs to be transcended and
conspiracy theories prevent this from happening because they reinforce the
duality and the separation so that's a that's a very
deep problem with conspiracy theories problem number two is that
they lead to a general outlook of suspicion judgment and
blaming of others this is a very toxic attitude to
take towards life if there are problems in the world
take responsibility for those problems and try to improve the
world rather than sitting on the internet judging blaming criticizing
and doing this sort of stuff you're not actually helping
the world in this way you would be much more
helpful to actually go commit yourself to doing some sort
of passionate thing some sort of artistic pursuit or some
sort of business that you would actually provide massive value
to the world through following on your life purpose rather
than just doubling down on your suspicions and building resentment
that's what these conspiracy theories do problem number three conspiratorial
thinking doesn't actually lead to a root solution to any
of these problems nothing is solved if we really want
to improve society and that's i propose what all of
us really deeply want is to improve society what we
need is to actually tackle the challenging root problems that
haven't yet been solved they haven't been solved because they're
difficult they're complex they're counter-intuitive and they require innovative creative
solutions that we haven't thought of yet this requires serious
intellectual effort to find solutions to these problems we need
to do science we need to do research we need
to read we need to study we need to test
different things we need to split test different solutions and
find which ones work better this is like a scientific
methodical endeavor see we need real policy solutions not just
blaming people all right your conspiracy theories solve nothing they
solve nothing and they in fact just waste time and
energy and that's the next problem is so what so
what if one of these conspiracy theories is true what
are you gonna do about it can you see the
trick here the trick is that it's a distraction from
your own inner work it's a distraction from self-actualizing it's
a waste of time so what if the moon landing
is fake so what if the earth is flat even
what are you going to do about it how are
you going to live your life what's the purpose of
your life you got to work on yourself you got
to improve yourself regardless of whether the earth is flat
or around or whatever the [ __ ] it is
see but most people are interested in working on themselves
so of course when you're not interested in working on
yourself what are you going to do with your time
you're going to sit on youtube and just go down
some conspiratorial rabbit hole this will make you feel excited
titillated entertained it's not going to improve your life it's
not going to improve humanity or the world it's not
going to solve any of the problems that you're outraged
about it's just it's a dead end the next problem
i have with conspiracy theories is that they radicalize people
polarize people turn people against each other to really solve
the root problems of society what we need is we
need to come together and work together we need to
dialogue with each other we communicate on a deeper more
honest level this is impossible to do with all these
conspiracy theories going around these conspiracy theories generally demonize some
other group of people making it possible to actually have
a communication with them see there's so much demonization these
days of pedophilia that the actual what's sad about is
that the actual problem of pedophilia this is a challenging
problem that society has not yet resolved how do we
resolve this problem because you know you you understand the
problem of pedophilia there's a certain percentage of of humans
who are born with basically a fetish for young people
a sexual fetish for young people that's what gets them
excited see that's basically what pedophilia is now i'm not
saying pedophilia is innocent it's not it can cause a
lot of harm to to children and it's it can
be very exploitative and abusive to children so it's very
problematic but it's not so simple as just demonizing the
pedophile right because like look think of it if you
really understand pedophilia think of it this way you have
some sort of sexual preferences i assume like uh you
like women with big boobs or you like men with
a certain kind of chest or you like uh abs
or you know you like this kind of hair or
you like feet or you know you like doggy style
or you like missionary position or you know whatever gets
you turned on whatever kind of porn you watch you
enjoy that right i mean you really enjoy it you
don't just enjoy a little bit you really enjoy it
and it's very difficult for you to just repress your
sexual cravings if i just told you you know you
know what from now on all that stuff you enjoy
the stuff that makes you come the hardest just uh
yeah just ignore that for the rest of your life
ignore it just pretend it's not real in fact your
sexual preferences are evil and criminal what would you do
you see you wouldn't be able to repress those cravings
and desires even if you wanted to there's no way
there's no way you would do it you can't do
it sexual craving is too powerful of a force to
simply repress it or deny it externally through some authority
figure by criminalizing it for example if you criminalize anal
sex people will still have anal sex now the problem
with pedophilia is is uniquely challenging because it's possible to
have anal sex where both parties are interested in doing
it and there's no harm done to either party now
it's it's it's almost impossible to have sex with a
child without harming the child and to have a consensual
so this is this is a deep this is a
deep challenge for society you see because some percentage of
humans will always be born with a preference for having
sex with young humans i don't know what it is
maybe half a percent of the population a quarter of
a percent of my days maybe one percent of the
population i don't know what it is you see and
just criminalizing that behavior is not going to solve it
because those you know you know from your own experience
you know sexually how powerful the sex drive is imagine
if you were born with a sexual craving because you
don't control your sexual cravings you didn't decide one day
like oh well i'm gonna be sexually attracted to women
or i'm gonna be sexually attracted to feet or i'm
gonna be sexually attracted to hair or to muscles or
to abs or to boobs or whatever you didn't decide
this imagine if one day you were born uh let's
say you reincarnate you're born with a sexual preference for
young people what do you do about it you didn't
ask for that you might even recognize that this is
bad in the sense that it harms young people to
act out on this instinct but what do you do
do you deny your sexual cravings for the rest of
your life that doesn't seem authentic on the other hand
what do you become a criminal what do you do
see i'm not saying i have a solution to this
problem i'm just saying the problem is much more complicated
than these conspiracy theories make you believe when you just
demonize the problem nothing is solved and now of course
just by me opening your mind to the depth and
complexity of the problem i will get called a pedophile
i will get called a pedophile just for talking about
the challenges of pedophiles see that's how that's how a
naive mind works because it doesn't want to actually go
into the root complexities of the issue i actually had
a one time i had someone who was a pedophile
who uh messaged me through my forum he was a
young guy um i don't know the full details but
he basically wrote me a a nice message and he
said because you know i get messages you got to
understand i get flooded with messages uh by thousands of
people with their problems like i i got depression i'm
suicidal i'm going crazy um i'm being abused i'm whatever
you know i get that so of course one in
a thousand might be a pedophile so i get one
of those right um and this was interesting to me
because i've never i've never had a genuine conversation with
a pedophile before so uh you know i read his
story he writes his story to me and he says
you know i was just i was always just i
had a preference for you know like young girls um
and um and that's like the only thing that that
gets me sexually aroused nothing else does i know that
i shouldn't act out on the simple this is what
he told me in the email like i know i
shouldn't act out on this impulse because um you know
obviously he understands that this this harms children and so
forth so it's not like he's some evil uh you
know pedophile plotting to rape a child no like he
knows that this is a problem he knows that it
has criminal consequences as well he knows that for example
he can watch child porn but he knows that even
that harms children because it's exploitative you know to produce
child porn but but then but so he's asking me
like leo what do i do what do i do
in this situation do i deny my sexual desires do
i find some kind of healthy outlet for what do
i do and honestly i had no answer because this
was news to me i've never faced this this issue
before um but the reason i bring it up is
because it was just it was a genuine authentic uh
communication and you know i just asked some follow-up questions
because i was just curious like you know uh how
does it actually work um like are you not attracted
to like grown mature women at all like is the
only way you can you can have sex is if
you're like jerking off to a to some like video
of like a 10 year old how does it work
i don't know um and it was just interesting it
was just interesting to have this conversation in the end
i couldn't really give him any solid advice because i
just i didn't i didn't know how to deal with
that problem it's it's a problem that our society has
not solved yet so like maybe one solution to that
problem might be for example virtual reality porn maybe we
could create virtual child porn which doesn't involve the harming
of any children which you could disseminate to to these
pedophiles and then they would have a healthy outlet for
for their cravings now even me just saying that people
say oh leo but you're endorsing child porn now no
it's it's just uh we're dealing with the complexity of
the problem you see when you understand how powerful the
sexual cravings are from your own personal experience you'll understand
that you're not going to be able to repress those
for the rest of your life you need some sort
of healthy outlet for it so of course obviously we
don't want to exploit children and harm children but at
the same time we need to we need to somehow
do something with these pedophiles other than just locking them
in jail now if you say william why don't we
just lock them all in jail or kill them all
well is that first of all is that a compassion
and humane way to go about it what if you
have a daughter or a son and he becomes a
pedophile again see if you're assuming pedophilia is just this
this evil thing that you have gotten yourself into like
almost like a gang or like like it's like you're
equating pedophilia with bank robbery or something this is the
wrong way to think about it that's not really how
pedophilia works pedophilia is is much more like your natural
sexual cravings it's more like a fetish and you don't
really have much conscious control over it it's not like
you can prevent yourself from robbing a bank yeah you
can do that it's a lot harder to prevent yourself
for example from getting aroused by looking at boobs so
can you prevent yourself from ever getting aroused by looking
at boobs can you promise me that you will never
look at boobs ever again in your life and never
desire them what if i criminalize looking at boobs you
see the problem so again i'm not saying i have
any concrete answers here i'm just trying to show you
the complexity of these problems and just how toxic these
conspiracy theories are towards finding some root solution by demonizing
people this is the problem of demonization when you demonize
criminals it at first it seems like well yeah they're
criminals so they should be demonized but what you don't
realize is that that doesn't actually solve the criminality if
you really had compassion you would want to find a
solution to prevent those criminals from acting out their criminal
impulses in the first place which might mean changing our
economic system it might mean better social safety nets so
that people don't fall into poverty it might mean some
sort of drug rehab programs to prevent people from becoming
you know drug dealers and drug abusers and so on
and getting addicted to that kind of stuff and and
that even extends to pedophilia as well there are compassionate
solutions and then there are just mindless demonizing solutions where
you just demonize them and lock them up and throw
away the key and don't think about it but see
that only happens when you're separated from the other person
you have to think that you're separate from the pedophile
when you realize that you could have easily been born
a pedophile or that your own son or daughter could
be a pedophile when you realize that when you realize
that your own son or daughter could be gay or
could be transsexual then you get compassion for those sort
of edge cases and those fringe people and you stop
demonizing and criminalizing that kind of activity um now of
course i'm not saying pedophilia should be decriminalized um yeah
it's difficult because you have to prevent the abuse of
children that's very important sex for children creates huge psychological
trauma and dysfunction that will last for for lifetimes so
that is a very serious concern i'm not dismissing that
at all and uh we got a little off track
there and uh and then the final uh my fundamental
my final fundamental problem with conspiracy theories is that they
decrease meaningful civil engagement so rather than actually going out
there and engaging in politics in a healthy manner it
just turns into like a partisan food fight and demonization
of others which is not productive conspiracy theories are a
subset of ideological thinking conspiracy theories correlate with hyper-nationalism religious
fundamentalism and racism because all of these come from the
same general levels of cognitive and moral development spiral dynamics
tier one cognition the lower stages conspiracies theories exist and
are found more and more at the lower levels of
consciousness and these theories appeal to lower and lower caliber
people folks like alex jones donald trump so why are
conspiracy theories on the rise now with donald trump and
trumpism why does donald trump love to promote conspiracy theorists
and conspiracy theories because he has no standards for truth
and because he himself is roughly spotlighting stage red he's
not very high on the spiral he doesn't have a
high level of moral or cognitive or spiritual development so
of course conspiracy theories are so appealing to him because
he can use them to manipulate large groups of people
into getting his selfish needs met so of course he's
going to rely on conspiracy theories and alex jones does
the same stuff he's also roughly a spider-dynamic stage red
and he's built an entire multi-million dollar empire uh pitching
various kinds of conspiracy theories and people lap that [
__ ] up people roughly at his level lap it
up and people roughly at trump's level lap it up
and in america and around the world we still have
a large chunk of the population not a majority but
still a significant chunk of the population who is roughly
at stage red or stage blue which finds uh that
kind of stuff very appealing maybe 20 or 30 percent
of the population will find that stuff appealing which is
where trump's most hardcore uh base support comes from conspiracy
theories are a survival mechanism of the ego mind they
confirm the ego mind's initial paranoias and fears in previous
episodes my spiritual episodes i've talked about how basically your
life and reality is a tug of war between fear
and love the more conscious you are the more loving
you are the less conscious you are the more selfish
you are the more fearful you are and these this
is sort of the the axis by which your entire
life gets determined is how fearful or how loving are
you so the more fearful the more selfish the less
consciousness you have the more you're going to be prone
to conspiratorial thinking because it feeds into your paranoia conspiracy
theories also involve a lot of circular reasoning they're self-justifying
bubbles of belief systems they also conflate interpretation with fact
a conspiracy theory isn't a theorist doesn't distinguish very well
between the facts of a case and then his interpretation
on it because it's not just that you're getting the
raw facts you're never just getting the raw facts you're
taking those facts the ego mind is interpreting those facts
spinning a story and a narrative out of it and
it's that narrative that you have to be very careful
of it's that interpretive process which is corrupted by conspiracy
theories of course conspiracy theories are our projection classic psychological
projection which externalizes personally undesirable characteristics and evil onto others
so whatever shadow elements you have you project that out
onto the world and so in fact the irony of
course with the popularity of pedophilia conspiracy theories among amongst
right-wingers is that i guarantee you that if you did
a full exhaustive study on whether there are more pedophiles
within the left wing and the right wing you're going
to find more in the right wing why is that
because the right wing is lower consciousness and more fear-based
and also precisely because they spend so much energy projecting
this conspiracy theory outward it's a projection which means it's
a shadow aspect of themselves that they're denying in the
same way that a lot of right-wingers will spend a
lot of time criticizing homosexuality precisely because they're insecure and
that they fear their own homosexual cravings and tendencies which
they are trying to suppress and to deny because it
makes them feel feminine and their culture has told them
that men are not supposed to feel feminine they're supposed
to feel masculine see so that's projection it wouldn't surprise
me at all that some of the most prominent promoters
of pedophilia conspiracy theories like alex jones actually for example
has child porn on his computer now i don't know
that for sure i don't want to defame him by
saying that um not like that he would he would
extend that courtesy to to me or to anybody else
but um but uh but yeah i mean the the
reason i can sort of suspect that is because that's
how projection works what comes to mind to me is
is this saying thou doth protest too much when somebody
protests too much about the evilness of of others you
have to always suspect hmm might you not be guilty
of that evil yourself i believe actually alex jones has
been caught there there is evidence of alex jones being
caught with trans porn on his phone that was a
story that came out some number of years ago there's
evidence of that um even though he denounces trans people
i think so um so yeah i mean these sorts
of contradictions are very common within right-wing ideology but again
i'm not saying the left-wing is immune to this certainly
there are left-wing pedophiles um but i would bet you'll
find more of them in the right wing notice also
that conspiracy theories are emotional attachments there's nothing factual or
objective about conspiracy theories they're emotional attachments you can feel
that emotional attachment within you if you are a conspiracy
theorist if you're going to be introspecting and being very
self-honest uh there's an emotional payoff that you get from
buying into these conspiracy theories that they're very emotionally satisfying
if you feel powerless they can make you feel powerful
which i think is a lot of alex jones's audience
people who watch alex jones and like his stuff that's
because it's emotionally satisfying to watch him and to listen
to him you listen to him every day it drips
on your mind and then it it creates this feeling
of empowerment like yeah we're in all this together against
the evil globalists and the chai comms and and the
pedophiles um one of the problems with conspiracy theories is
that the there's a refusal there to deal with the
complex reality and complex paradoxical and counterintuitive truths that you
would be dealing with if you were doing like the
kind of work that i advocate with actualized.org there's a
refusal to take responsibility as well collective responsibility is not
taken so in this example with pedophiles demonizing pedophiles when
you demonize criminals and pedophiles this is actually uh a
way of avoiding taking collective responsibility to take collective responsibilities
to say you know what if our society has all
these criminals in it what are we doing to create
those criminals it's not just that those people who were
born criminals somehow we structured our society such that these
criminals are flourishing why is that do we need to
take a look at our economic system is it the
way we teach in school is it a lack of
training is it a lack of social programs is it
capitalism what is it see but many people don't want
to take that responsibility because their mind is just so
preoccupied with just their own basic survival if all you
care about is personally getting sex money and fame and
success then you have no more space in your in
your psyche for actually caring deeply caring about fixing serious
social problems and of course to fix serious social problems
you need to be able to empathize with the people
who are suffering from these problems not just the victims
but also the perpetrators if you want to solve the
problem of of murder you can't just sympathize with the
murder victims you need to also sympathize with the murderers
and try to understand their perspective and where they're coming
from and why they're doing the murdering what's causing them
what's motivating to be murderers in the first place is
it the chemicals in the water is it the lack
of healthy food is it the lack of proper parenting
and education and health care and what kind of systems
could we create to to make that less of an
issue you see that's that's where the real problems are
solved conspiracy theories are also a misuse of skepticism skepticism
is easily weaponized by the naive ego mind i have
a whole episode about this called true versus false skepticism
go check that out where i talk about the way
that the skepticism is often misused and abused the true
function of skepticism is to turn the skepticism inwards on
your own selfishness and devilry and your own worldview so
the problem with the with the uh false skeptic is
that the skeptic will be skeptical of all of his
enemies and opponents but he will not be skeptical of
his own mind and his own defense mechanisms and his
own skepticism he will not realize that he's just using
skepticism as a weapon to create all those enemies but
he's never going to question the fact that hey maybe
these enemies are just projections of my own mind maybe
all the all the delusion [ __ ] i see
out there in the world is just simply a projection
of my own inner delusion and [ __ ] but
this doesn't occur to most skeptics conspiracy theories prey on
on emotional triggers like shock fear anger and other low
consciousness emotions and in this way you can get people
really riled up and you can build a large fan
base and you can sell them a lot of stuff
like alex jones does he makes millions of dollars selling
to people's anger and their fear and their shock of
course conspiracy theorists lack a lot of intellectual integrity and
honesty they're not charitable usually and this is this is
a problematic attitude when it comes to investigating the world
into learning about the world and and trying to understand
other people's perspectives you need a lot of intellectual integrity
honesty and you need to be charitable you need to
actually give people enough benefit of the doubt to see
that their perspective has some validity of it you can't
just deny someone's perspective just because you think they're evil
or wrong you need to actually be willing to step
into their shoes and look at the world from their
perspective that's what grows you i've talked about the importance
of perspective in past episodes uh uh a handy way
to think about uh conspiracy theories is that they're basically
an advanced form of gossip that's really what it is
it's gossip you're gossiping that's what alex jones does he
gossips he's a professional multi-million dollar gossiper uh joe rogan
also does a lot of this he does um he's
not nearly as bad as as alex jones i personally
i like joe rogan i think he's entertaining sometimes he's
he's wise but other times he says stupid stuff and
a lot of what goes on on joe rogan's show
is just pure gossip that's the appeal why does joe
rogan have one of the most successful and popular podcasts
in the world because it's fundamentally a gossip podcast and
everyone [ __ ] loves gossip and he's really good
at gossip he makes gossip into a gossip into an
art form he makes gossip seem intelligent and wise sometimes
it is but a lot of times it's just really
stupid stuff um and that's i'm not saying anything bad
about joe rogan here it's it's just like there is
a room for gossip in the world but you just
have to understand the limitations of it you can't take
it too seriously of course conspiracy theories reinforce close mindedness
dogma and selfishness they're used to mobilize crowds this is
how trump uses these conspiracy theories so see some devil
like trump will come along and will try to exploit
these conspiracy theories and try to use them for his
own personal power success wealth and advantage conspiracy theories also
increase with decreased political efficacy so as you feel more
and more disillusioned with the electoral political system and you
think that democracy is failing and that your voice is
not being heard and that the government isn't working properly
the more you distrust the government the more you distrust
corporations and elites the more you distrust fellow humans and
other groups of people the more prone you are to
conspiracy theories the worse your life is the more problems
you have the more abused you were as a child
the more trauma you have the more you struggle with
money the the more you struggle with your job the
more you struggle with your religion and fate faith rather
the more susceptible you will be to conspiracy theories because
all of that weakens your mind and then when your
mind is weak it needs some you know something something
to make it feel good and that's when the conspiracy
theory comes in that's when a cult comes in and
ensnares your mind but be careful i am noticing this
trend that's very popular these days of railing against the
elites whether it's through a conspiracy theory or not through
a conspiracy theory see you can there's sort of like
a gradual slippery slope you start by just railing at
the elites hating the establishment and mainstream media questioning it
and then slowly as you do that at first it's
not a conspiracy theory you might have some legitimate grievances
about corruption in government and so forth and maybe you
see some problem with billionaires you know hoarding money okay
that's legitimate but then see that takes you down the
slippery slope and then you go slipperier and slipperier down
towards the towards the bottom of the barrel where you
get into some of this really toxic conspiratorial stuff and
then you start to hate elites you start to distrust
them you start to hate millionaires and billionaires and rich
people and all this you develop a whole ideology around
it and this becomes very toxic and problematic remember you
can criticize the status quo but make sure you're criticizing
it from above from a position of consciousness not from
below not as an emotional reaction not as some sort
of needy activity a sort of emotional attachment that you
are clinging to because some other part of your life
isn't going the way that you want to and because
you're failing to take responsibility for improving your own life
something that a lot of people don't appreciate is that
one of the top functions of mainstream culture is to
shield ignorant people from toxic ideologies so today it's very
popular to criticize mainstream establishment media and culture as serving
the elite but that doesn't mean that non-mainstream culture is
going to be healthy and better than mainstream culture in
fact if i had to bet i would say it's
going to be worse as bad as mainstream culture is
conspiracy theories are worse stuff like alex jones is worse
a lot of stuff on youtube is worse it's less
rigorous it's less objective it's more biased it's more cult-like
one of the functions of mainstream religion is by enforcing
a strong monopoly on ways in which the human mind
can think on world views on values and norms on
the one hand it's oppressive because it's monopolistic and you're
not able to have the same kind of diversity of
thought that you would be able to have like you
know in the middle even in the medieval ages there
wasn't a diversity of thought about reality everybody thought along
the same you know if you grew up in europe
you thought along the same sort of catholic lines basically
in the medieval times and that created a sort of
a consensus that we could all gather around and actually
build a society around and you could say well leo
it was toxic mostly it was healthy it was toxic
in certain cases there was the spanish inquisition there was
the witch trials yeah there were toxic edge cases but
overall it was healthy because this christianity taught people to
you know be decent people be moral don't you know
don't don't be an adulterer don't be a thief don't
be a murderer don't be a rapist these sorts of
just basic ground rules were laid and enforced and they
were enforced not just legally but also culturally there was
a lot of peer pressure you know not to be
some sort of devil um but today that sort of
that monopoly is breaking apart uh and now this is
allowing all sorts of toxic small ideologies to to come
up and to you know just get really out of
control and the reason that mainstream culture tends to be
a little bit more healthy than some minor niche toxic
ideology is because for something to be able to scale
across hundreds of millions of people the way that christianity
has it has to have a relative level of health
to it it can't be utterly toxic and virulent and
cancerous you know people you know atheists and so forth
and scientists sometimes criticize christianity as being this toxic cancerous
ideology sometimes it can get out of hand but overall
it's not that toxic and not that cancerous the way
that you think uh especially when we compare it to
some of the niche cult-like ideologies that arise that are
not mainstream it's a lot easier to create a very
toxic death cult sort of ideology when you're only scaling
it across 10 20 100 1 000 people so that's
the difference between mainstream and cult hair in my eye
keeps bothering me all right so what people don't realize
is that we have a lot of uneducated and selfish
people in society in fact the majority of society is
uneducated and very selfish and completely unaware of their own
lack of education and selfishness these people are extremely dangerous
and heard such people have always existed but they require
leadership from sages and intellectuals thought leaders and visionaries who
can corral these people and get them to think and
move along healthy lines otherwise they're gonna spiral out of
control go down rabbit holes of of pure delusion and
insanity and that has happened from time to time throughout
history we need conscious leaders who will lead the vast
majority of uneducated selfish people and these are the elites
so be careful with criticizing the elites because if you
get rid of the elites you might find yourself in
this situation where you just have this horde of uneducated
and selfish and ignorant um non-elites who think that they're
better than elites but actually are dumber than elites and
will go down one of these toxic rabbit holes of
insanity and delusion and destroy themselves but that is not
to say that elites don't have their own problems of
course they do elites are also selfish but if i
had to choose between society being run by educated elites
versus a mob of uneducated selfish average people i would
choose the elites now you're going to say leo that's
because you are an elite and you benefit from the
elites sure you could you could make that case if
you want to but i would say that there's there's
some value to these leads that a lot of people
are overlooking so i'm not purely for elites uh i
i like the idea of democracy but also you have
to understand that we can only expand democracy as fast
as the people who are going to be getting that
democracy can wield it in a healthy mature uh intelligent
selfless way if we give democracy to a bunch of
devils what you're gonna do is you're gonna create hell
democracy in and of itself doesn't create heaven democracy needs
to be wielded by angels to create heaven and if
it's wielded by devils it creates hell and why does
this happen why do uneducated selfish people create these rabbit
holes of pure delusion because reality is mind constructed there's
no such thing as a objective reality in the way
that science has taught you what we have is we
have reality constructed as a culture our culture constructs reality
our minds construct reality and if we let it get
out of hand and we're not conscious of the fact
that our mind is constructing reality our mind will construct
a a nightmare some delusional bubble and if you go
back and look throughout history we see cases where this
has happened where mankind has created these delusional bubbles where
everybody in that bubble believed that that was reality you
know nazis really believed uh in hitler's time that they
were going to rule the world and that was the
proper way to look at the world is through the
nazi worldview of course it was all just mind-constructed delusion
but they were fully on board with that and that's
just one example you can go back to our history
and find tons of these examples and it's not just
history now today right now we're still constructing reality mostly
we're doing it unconsciously most people are in denial about
the fact that our mind is constructing reality most people
are in denial about the fact that reality is socially
constructed at least much of it is that's a topic
too deep to explore further here uh now you might
wonder what leo so are you telling me that i
i shouldn't be civically engaged now no i'm just telling
you that conspiracy theories are not a valid form of
civic engagement by all means be civically engaged take collective
responsibility be active politically in a healthy way but not
through conspiracy theories don't fool yourself thinking that that is
civic engagement now you might say but leo what about
theory x some theory isn't what is what if there's
a chance that it's true what if ufos actually what
if ufos do exist and the government is hiding the
technology isn't that possible you're missing the point the point
isn't that it's not possible the point is that it
doesn't matter the point is that it's a red herring
you must go meta and see how this is distracting
you in your own life personally actually i happen to
believe that ufos are real there's way too much evidence
out there that i've seen i haven't personally seen you
ufo but from all the anecdotal evidence that i've seen
and actually even some of the videos that have been
recently released by the us military and navy and so
forth um i'm highly inclined to believe that ufos are
actually flying out there and by which i mean actual
aliens in a [ __ ] flying saucer i don't
mean ufos as some unknown uh you know light in
the sky i mean actual [ __ ] spacecraft i'm
highly uh open to that possibility but uh the difference
is that i'm not creating a whole narrative around it
about how the government is trying to fool us and
that there's some secret technology they're holding back from us
because of whatever evil purposes and you know i'm not
spending i'm not spending a lot of time thinking about
this i'm spending most of my time doing inner work
on myself trying to awaken and trying to understand how
my own mind is tricking me and also i clearly
distinguish between the fact that this is a belief that
i have it's a speculation i'm not sure if it's
if it's true i'm not going to go out there
and say that it is true i'm open to the
possibility of it being wrong um you know so i'm
not i'm not attached to it there's no emotional attachment
whatsoever to the possibility of there being ufos for me
one way or another i'm totally open to either one
being true i'll be happy either way doesn't it doesn't
bother me i'm not building an entire life purpose around
this i'm not building a narrative around this i'm not
blaming people about this i'm very clear to distinguish that
from my direct experience of reality and that's very important
that's something that conspiracy theorists do not do generally speaking
of course conspiracy theories can also cause a lot of
direct harm think about how much harm alex jones has
caused to the parents of the sandy hook shootings think
about the harm caused by by pizzagate some dude from
from online actually went to the pizzagate pizza shop and
actually brought like a rifle in there started shooting the
place up because he demanded to see the you know
the the children the molested children who were locked up
in the basement when there wasn't even a [ __
] basement in that building right that dude could have
easily killed somebody in that luckily he didn't shoot anybody
he just like shot i think he fired off a
shot in the floor or something he didn't actually kill
anybody but he could have easily shot somebody you can
because when you're outraged by something that makes you more
likely to be violent also a lot of harm is
caused simply by smearing the reputations of good people like
i know anderson cooper has been dealing with with pedophilia
conspiracy theories bill gates uh um uh robert mueller you
know actually i think the reason alex jones got banned
off of apple and youtube and other platforms twitter and
so forth um it's not because the sandy hook shooting
stuff um i think it might have also been because
right around that time he was he was just like
i listened to it he was um he was pitching
like the most insane conspiracy theories about robert mueller you
know who was who was investigating donald trump so his
theory was that robert mueller is involved with the jeffrey
epstein pedophilia child ring and that actually the reason he's
going after trump is because trump is actually trying to
stop the pedophiles but robert mueller because you know he
and jeffrey epstein and the deep state globalists and all
this they are trying to you know they're they're they're
fighting trump and so that's why mueller was investigating him
and so literally he accused robert mueller of of being
a pedophile which you know really i don't understand why
uh he wouldn't have been sued by by robert mueller
for that because i mean it's just complete slander complete
defamation just like completely absurd zero evidence for any of
this [ __ ] and yet you know he's ruining
a good man's uh name and reputation um you know
nasa is a what seems like a a good decent
organization that does a lot of public good you know
nasa doesn't just explore the moon and other um stuff
in our solar system it also launches satellites it tracks
the weather it tracks climate change and many other things
like this there's a lot of good people working at
nasa but their name gets gets demonized by flat earthers
and and other people like that um and so what
you have to understand about these conspiracy theories that the
way the mind works that even when one of these
conspiracy theories is disproven or debunked it's always denied or
ignored for example alex jones has proposed so many conspiracy
theories many of them have been debunked and completely disproven
even in court like with the sandy hook shooting stuff
he actually had to go to court and um they
they forced him to basically make a retraction he actually
went on air and told his audience that he was
wrong about sandy hook he had to issue a retraction
but even though he does that the very next day
he goes back to creating more conspiracy theories so even
if a conspiracy theorist is caught peddling conspiracy theories and
proven wrong it's the attitude it's the mindset he can't
help himself in a sense he's just like a pedophile
he's addicted to seeing the world through the lens of
conspiracy theories and how do you how do you help
him he's incurable now some people might say but leo
aren't you a conspiracy theories after all you say that
reality is just an illusion you say that everything is
imaginary you criticize materialist science you say that the brain
doesn't exist you talk about god you talk about mystical
and paranormal and new age stuff you criticized trump leo
you even promoted the russia gate conspiracy theory so what's
the difference between all of that and conspiracy theories well
there is a very big difference my work is grounded
in direct experience my work is grounded in in deep
research and a deep questioning of my own mind i'm
not just up here presenting this material to you for
every hour of material that i present to you i
spent 10 or 20 or more hours questioning my own
mind i've been doing this for decades all right so
most of the work that i do on on myself
internally you don't see it the part that you see
is just me presenting some of my findings and conclusions
to you you don't see me actually doing the work
also as far as this russia gate conspiracy theory goes
i don't buy that it's a conspiracy theory now of
course there's different versions of russiagate um some of them
can get very outlandish like if you believe that rush
that putin is literally a puppet master for trump yeah
i don't i don't buy that and i never have
uh but this idea that there's nothing to rush a
gate at all i don't buy that either i think
trump has serious financial conflicts of interest and that much
of his loans and his financing comes from russia and
the reason that makes a lot of sense to me
is first of all because his sons actually are on
video saying it second of all because no one in
america would lend him any money and no no decent
legitimate organization would lend donald trump money only shady organizations
would lend him money and i know how the russians
work i'm russian i know how they work i know
the culture there i know how corrupt it is so
russia for trump would have been the perfect place to
get his financing because they're roughly the same level of
consciousness he is so it's very very likely that trump
has some financial beholdings to putin or to oligarchs in
russia and um this is this is really to me
again i'm not saying like i i fully have evidence
of this or i fully believe it or that i
even care very deeply about this but to me it's
just very intuitive that this would be the case um
so those people who deny that and say that there
is nothing to russigate i think the only reason you
can get away with that right now is because all
the evidence hasn't come out in the future i predict
that in next five or ten years when a lot
of more evidence of trump trump's shenanigans and devilry comes
out we will eventually understand we will historians will eventually
get to the bottom of all of trump's financial conflicts
of interest all that stuff will leak out after he
is out of office and uh you know people will
write books about it and eventually we'll know and i
think we'll see some deep deep deep and deeply troubling
um conflicts even financial conflicts of interest tied to russia
and that will explain trump's uh very obsequious behavior towards
towards russia and towards putin uh generally though so you
see when i talk about god when i talk about
spiritual concepts these are not just speculations or beliefs the
difference is that i'm talking about things that i've directly
become conscious of or directly realized and that you yourself
can realize and validate for yourself you see so the
point of my work is not just to present you
with all this new age beliefs that you buy into
and replace your old beliefs with that's not how this
work works the way this works is that you listen
to me talking about this stuff and then you get
interested in it and then you go and you actually
do the work to validate it for yourself you experience
it it's sort of like i say you know what
i went to australia and i saw some cool kangaroos
and koala bears and platypuses and you if you're not
from australia you're like what those are some weird animals
i've never seen any of those animals i want to
see some of those too and then you buy yourself
a ticket to australia and then you go and you
pet a kangaroo and you go you know hang out
with some koalas and some platypuses and you get to
see them in the flesh and then you're like wow
cool and that changes your life but if all you
do is you just sit at your computer and you
mentally masturbate yourself to pictures of kangaroos and platypuses and
ideas of of koala bears and you never actually connect
the dots to actually buy the plane ticket to fly
and see them in person then you don't really understand
what i'm talking about that's the difference so when i
say that the brain does not exist that the brain
is a hallucination that you're hallucinating right now there is
no brain obviously in your experience there's no brain this
is obvious uh the brain is purely imaginary but for
you to really understand that you need to have a
direct awakening to the fact that the brain is purely
imaginary you can have that it's not easy but you
can have it if you work towards it i'm proposing
that as a possibility i'm not saying that you should
believe now that brains don't exist if you believe that
this is going to make you look like a fool
you need to have a direct experience of it if
you believe that god exists but you have never had
a direct experience of god you're being a fool i
would rather have you believe that god does not exist
than to have a belief that it does but no
direct experience of it see everything mystical and shmystical that
i talk about is true only if you can validate
it if you can't validate it it's not true that's
the difference between the stuff that i teach and conspiracy
theories and cults so here are some key insights you
need to understand the mind can spin any kind of
story it wants all the mind is looking for when
it's spinning its stories is a basic sense of internal
consistency that's it it's not concerned with any attachment to
reality itself you can the mind can spin stories that
are completely detached from any notion of reality or facts
as long as the story is internally self-consistent the mind
can spin it and it can live inside that bubble
and it can feel very very real even though it's
not so just keep that point in mind just because
your mind can spin a really good internally consistent story
does not mean that that is equivalent to reality or
any kind of absolute truth see internal consistency is not
evidence of truth people often confuse that another point is
that literally you are imagining reality that's what's going on
even physical reality is imagined and hallucinated by by consciousness
this being the case you can see how easy it
is for the mind to then concoct all sorts of
crazy and outlandish theories and go down various kinds of
intellectual rabbit holes if you can imagine physical reality if
if your own body is imaginary then what hope do
you have with your conspiracy theories of them being somehow
true or objective not at all there's nothing objective about
the stories your mind concocts you also have to understand
the point that reason and logic cannot be trusted because
they are always hijacked by the ego mind to serve
its own selfish purposes so just because the conspiracy theory
seems reasonable and logical doesn't mean it's true do not
confuse reason and logic for truth all sorts of crazy
deluded theories and ideas are rationalized and justified with logic
you need to understand that virtually anything can be justified
and rationalized there are no limits anything can be held
to be true come what may by the mind as
long as the mind is willing to abandon all intellectual
integrity and commitment to truth if you don't care about
the truth nothing can stop you from living in a
completely imaginary world view divorced from reality even the stuff
that just seems completely obvious and factual and objective that
can't be denied it can be denied people don't understand
and appreciate the significance of this and that is because
all of reality is imaginary you need to start to
look inwards and to notice how your mind does this
notice how your mind creates narratives to suit its own
survival agenda it's not just that you're imagining stuff you're
imagining stuff specifically to suit your own survival it's a
very selfish sophisticated mechanism it's ingenious what your mind is
doing you're not just coming up with stupid things you're
literally constructing reality on the fly it's so powerful that
the reason it's difficult to believe it is because there's
literally no distinction between reality and your imagination but this
imagination process is so sophisticated most people think when i
say imagination it's like oh well it's just some sort
of fluffy easy thing like oh leo so if i
just imagine a million dollars i'll get a million dollars
it's just like that right no you fool imagination is
so sophisticated the reason you can't imagine getting a million
dollars right now is because you're too busy imagining not
having a million dollars literally and you can't stop you're
not conscious enough to stop imagining not having a million
dollars and you don't know how to stop and i'm
not even saying you have it in the power you
have it within your power to stop imagining that you
don't have a million dollars if you could stop imagining
that you don't have a million dollars you could have
a million dollars but you can't stop because there's something
larger going on here it's not just about your ego
mind being able to manipulate reality when i say reality
is imaginary that your mind is constructing reality i don't
mean that your personal ego mind now gets to have
whatever it wants handed to it on a silver platter
through a process of imagination no i mean the plan
that you think you're sitting on is imaginary and you
don't know how to stop imagining it so you're stuck
there you're stuck within your mind and you don't know
how to change it that's a deep problem or maybe
it isn't if you just resign yourself to it and
you stop wanting to change it after all who wants
to change it the ego mind which itself is imaginary
so you're lost within layers and layers and layers of
imagination so how do you tell that conspiracy theory is
wrong or bad as i talked about in my recent
episode understanding introspection or sorry developing introspection you feel it
you you can feel the dirtiness of conspiracy theories you
can feel how low consciousness it is if you just
practice turning inwards and self-reflecting you can feel that these
conspiracy theories are fueled by fear you feel that fear
you feel the paranoia you can feel the anger the
bitterness the hostility the judgment the blaming the scapegoating the
closed mindedness you can feel your own mind closing down
you can feel the dogma within you you can feel
the arrogance you can feel your mind going through mental
gymnastics to justify to rationalize your belief systems you can
feel the emotional reactivity you can feel the attachment you
can feel the us versus them thinking and framing you
can feel the sort of framing of the good guys
versus the bad guys you can see your mind thinking
in black and white ways you can feel and notice
your own mind projecting its shadow out onto the world
you can feel denial when you're in denial you can
feel an unwillingness to admit i don't know when you
truly don't know a thing you can feel the lack
of love in these conspiracy theories all of this screams
out ego ego ego ego ego warning warning warning warning
warning this is not truth this is delusion this is
the eco mind at work but the only way you
can do that is if you remember like i said
in the developing introspection episode you have to have a
genuine interest in truth your mind has to be genuinely
open you have to genuinely want to turn inwards to
introspect and you need skill in that it's a skill
you have to practice that you're not going to learn
that in a few days that takes years of practice
and it all begins with a genuine interest in truth
you have to care about the truth more than any
of your theories more than any of your personal biases
more than any of your grudges against other groups of
people more than any of your political attachments to any
kind of president or any kind of political party or
any kind of ideology you have to be willing to
surrender all of that in order to get to truth
and i have a lot of episodes explaining what truth
is so go check those out i have an episode
about what is truth i have an episode how to
discover what is true and so on so what is
the ultimate solution to conspiracy theories well of course introspection
is one of the ultimate solutions contemplation i have episodes
talking about how to do contemplation check those out open-mindedness
is hugely important i have many episodes about open-mindedness go
check out my episode how open-mindedness works education is an
important solution just basic factual education proper history proper science
this is all very lacking for many people remember most
people haven't gone to college and then most people barely
graduated high school even those people who did graduate high
school just think about the kind of people who you
hung out with in high school were they serious about
school work did they actually read the books did they
actually pass the tests no most of them were like
c-minus students who were just [ __ ] around in
school they didn't learn anything so just because someone graduated
high school doesn't mean that they're intelligent and that's a
majority of of people in america much less even worse
in less developed countries so we need a lot better
education and our education system needs to be improved significantly
to teach epistemology metaphysics philosophy and various kinds of topics
that i cover here in actualized.org looking for multiple diverse
perspectives is a solution to conspiracy theories because in a
conspiracy theory you're basically getting locked into one perspective so
to free yourself of that consider various other perspectives and
never get attached to any one particular perspective that's one
solution serious journalism is another solution science academic rigor these
are more solutions falsification is another important solution uh because
generally conspiracy theories are created through confirmation bias so what's
happening with the mind is is cherry-picking evidence from its
environment to validate its pre-existing worldview what needs to happen
you've got to force your mind to actually look for
disconfirming evidence this is called falsification so confirmation is important
but falsification in a sense is even more important you
have to if you're holding a theory you have to
look for falsifying evidence for example if you believe that
elites or pedophiles look for evidence that elites are not
pedophiles and i guarantee you will find a lot of
evidence that they aren't more so than that they are
another solution to have a sense of life purpose to
be creative when you have nothing to do and you're
sitting around and you're working a dead-end job and you
have a bunch of free time on your hands and
you're not creative in a healthy way you're going to
be creative in a toxic way i talked about it
in my episode the trap of the toxic life purpose
people who don't have a life purpose they fall into
conspiracy theories another solution is personal development and self-actualization the
more time you devote to self-actualizing the less time you'll
have for conspiracy theories and the more you'll be able
to see through the [ __ ] of them another
solution is stop judging blaming demonizing and scapegoating others period
stop all judgments this is something you should be working
on as part of your spiritual practice and self-actualization and
while you're doing that start taking collective responsibility don't just
take personal responsibility and don't just tell others to take
personal responsibility also take collective responsibility for your society notice
that you have an obligation as a citizen of your
society to create a more healthy more conscious more loving
more selfless society and that you contribute to the evil
and selfless selfishness of society with your own behaviors and
thinking another solution to conspiracy theories is systems thinking go
see my episode intro to systems thinking another solution is
to stop seeing others as separate from you treat others
as though they were your own family members and even
more than that as though they were your own body
when you see the body of some stranger look at
it in a way that you think of it as
your own body too this will draw uh draw you
two together and will draw you towards the truth intellectual
integrity and commitment to truth is crucial as a solution
to conspiracy theories another very powerful simple way is simply
admitting i don't know just have the balls to admit
when you don't know a thing rather than speculating about
aliens and pedophiles and god knows what else just admit
what's true what's true is you don't know who's a
pedophile that's the truth the truth is you don't know
about aliens the truth is you don't know about globalists
and reptilians that's the truth isn't it the truth look
look inside of you and it is what i'm saying
true right now that you don't know any of these
things and all you have is just ideas and speculations
that's the truth so stick with that rather than going
off into some fantasy land building castles in the sky
and be comfortable with confusion i have a whole episode
called how to deal with confusion go check that out
another solution to conspiracy theories is to distinguish very clearly
between beliefs and direct experience what are you believing and
what is your direct experience once you make this distinction
this is a game changer for you it's huge that
requires some work to make that distinction go check out
my episode what is actuality for a good exercise on
that point of course uh a very powerful solution to
conspiracy theories is to actually have some experiences of non-duality
mystical experiences and god realization or awakening that's a tall
order feel for most people but though that will very
quickly disabuse you of many of your conspiracy theories psychedelics
are helpful towards that end and the ultimate solution to
conspiracy theories is consciousness selflessness truth with a capital t
and love with a capital l when you truly discover
love with a capital l as i've talked about in
other episodes go check out my episodes what is love
part one part two and self love check out that
episode as well i have a lot of episodes on
love uh when you really discover love that's the end
of conspiracy theories love all right i'm done here but
uh i wanna just uh there's a lot of this
episode intersects with a lot of work i've done in
the past so i just want to give you a
list here of other episodes of mine that you should
watch if you found what i'm talking about here interesting
and productive check out my episodes called cult psychology parts
1 and part 2. check out my episode called how
ideology works check out my episode the mechanics of belief
check out how paradigms work check out true versus false
skepticism check out self bias check out self deception parts
one two and three check out understand understanding survival part
one and two check out developing introspection check out the
trap of toxic of the tr of the toxic life
purpose and check out system intro to systems thinking that's
a lot of stuff this is a very deeply epistemologically
significant topic and so there's a lot of tentacles that
flow out from conspiracy theories into all these other topics
that you will want to study and to understand to
really um free yourself of this cancer of the mind
of conspiratorial thinking all right that does it for me
here i'm done please click that like button for me
and come check out my website actualize.org you will find
exclusive content and resources there i post weekly exclusive content
on my blog sometimes videos sometimes little mini articles and
pictures images cool interesting stuff and memes that i find
whatever i try to share over there check out my
book list many of those books will help you to
overcome conspiratorial thinking and get you to see some higher
meta perspectives check that out check out my life purpose
course if you don't have a life purpose course i
mean if you don't have a life purpose defined for
yourself yet that will be very helpful for you come
check out the forum we have interesting discussions there all
the time i'm very very active on the forum so
that's a good way to get engaged with me and
our little community that we've built there you can support
me at patreon.com actualized that helps me to release this
content and to keep myself uncorrupted by various kinds of
corporate and advertising interests and the final thing that i'll
tell you is this we're getting ready to talk about
science we're going to go very deep on science in
the next few months i will release probably a two-part
or a three-part deep dive on the epistemology of science
we're going to talk about how science really works we're
going to explain science deeper than any scientist understands what
science is now science is nice in that scientific and
academic scholarship has high standards for good reason because the
ego mind can be very sloppy which leads to all
sorts of popular delusions like conspiracy theories and and so
on but even though that is the case and even
though i'm a huge fan of science overall the irony
is that even scientists and academics get fooled by self-deceived
thinking and by a lack of understanding of the trickeries
of the mind and epistemology they get fooled into materialism
into reductionism into atheism and we are going to be
exploring how exactly this fooling mechanism works that's an extremely
deep topic i've been planning to talk about it for
years we've been building it up up to it by
covering all these more minor topics i'm finally ready to
talk about it so make sure you stay tuned for
that that's going to be very exciting and yeah you
want to know what the what the real red pill
is the real the real red pill is understanding that
science is imaginary and i'll show you how that is
the case you
