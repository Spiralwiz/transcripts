hey this is Leo for actualised org and in this
episode I'm going to be speaking about how to be
more patient so that you can stop being so frustrated
and stressed over the lack of results you seem to
be getting in your life [Music] you how sad would
it be if you were on track set on a
guaranteed track to get some big important significant accomplishment in
your life and then you quit just inches ahead of
the final goal how many times does that happen to
you what I want to suggest is that maybe the
only thing standing in the way between you and the
success that you want in your life is actually just
patience or lack thereof it's really a problem of lack
of patience so I'm going to be using a lot
of different examples here from different areas of life but
what I want you to do as I'm talking about
how to develop patience is I want you to take
an example from your life where you're on some kind
of endeavor or you have some kind of project that
you're trying to accomplish right something big something important to
you and then use that for your example and then
whatever I'm talking about will apply not only to my
examples but of course to your example this is very
broad widespread applicable stuff that I'm going to be talking
about so you're on this journey of self actualization and
on this journey you expect to get results and what
happens a lot of times is that you feel like
you're not getting the results you deserve given what you're
putting in and it's very important that you remind yourself
over and over and over again on this journey to
be more patient because it's very easy to forget this
now the self actualization journey that's like one endeavor that's
the endeavor that we're doing here together with this content
but you know you might have other endeavors maybe you're
starting a business maybe you're working on your health and
I mean these could be part of the self-actualization journey
but also they could be separate things so maybe you're
trying to get married and have kids maybe you're trying
to get educated and go back to school to some
graduate program maybe you're trying to learn how to play
the guitar or the piano maybe you're trying to become
a great artist maybe you're trying to become a great
investor you know whatever your goals are maybe trying to
become enlightened or just a masterful meditator maybe you're seeking
emotional mastery maybe you're trying to overcome your depression so
this is what I'm talking about by these kind of
like accomplishments now what I would suggest to you is
that you know sometimes what will happen is that you
just have a bad technique or a bad method that
you're using which will never work which means you got
to go find a better method or a better technique
but a lot of times what happens is you just
psych yourself out you have the right method you have
the right technique you have the right information you're even
already starting to build the right habits but you just
psych yourself out halfway along the journey and you don't
complete it simply because this is how our mind works
see what our mind will do is it'll set unrealistic
expectations and there's a real tendency of the mind to
sabotage itself because it expects too much too fast especially
with large important goals there's a saying that I really
like from Tony Robbins I heard him say once that
people generally overestimate what they can accomplish in one year
but underestimate what they can accomplish in five years and
I find that to be very true especially when I
was younger all throughout my 20s I really struggled with
various business projects that I was working on I really
struggled to see them through to completion and mostly when
I look back on it now it was just like
a lack of patience I was expecting way too much
way too soon and like Tony Robbins was saying here
you know I overestimated what I could accomplish on this
project in one year but then I didn't think far
enough along to see how much I could accomplish in
let's say three years or in say five years see
what you got to realize about the mind is that
the mind sucks at distributing work evenly across time it
it tends to want the work that's happening early on
to bring the equal amount of results as the work
happening later on in this kind of curve we're kind
of mapping out and we're drawing like a curve or
a graph of the results you get by working on
some kind of project or some kind of endeavor or
with meditation or with self-actualization as a whole right the
mind sucks at working with big numbers so it doesn't
really understand a million or a billion doesn't understand these
kinds of numbers and also the mind has a difficult
time grasping your life in terms of like decades it's
really hard for your mind to see 10 20 30
years forward into your life and yet this is exactly
what's required in order to get the big success that
you want also the mind tends to forget or dismiss
this very fundamental truth which is that all big success
is actually made have thousands of tiny little steps a
giant success like becoming financially independent and having a business
of your own or becoming a famous artist or becoming
a great musician or becoming a great meditator or becoming
enlightened these things do not occur in one giant victory
they happen because you take little baby steps over and
over and over again and those accumulate and add up
to something that's ultimately very big and impressive right but
it's very easy to forget this when you're in the
middle of one of these projects and especially when you're
kind of in a a dip when you're in a
in a part of the project where it just feels
like there's no results happening there's some mistakes that happen
there's a setback and you feel like nothing is working
and then you feel like quitting and giving up what
you got remind yourself of is that results do not
come linearly there's an exponential growth curve for results in
whatever you're doing it looks like this right it starts
off very very shallow which means you're putting a lot
of work and a lot of time a lot of
emotional labor but you're not seeing much result but then
as you keep doing that more and more and more
and more months and years into the process then you
start to hit the knee of the curve and when
you hit the knee of the curve then there's like
an explosive growth and then sometimes what happens and it's
very a very surreal phenomenon is when you just persist
at something over and over and over again you hit
the knee of that curve results all of a sudden
just start pouring in and they pour in faster and
bigger than you could have ever dreamed of it's like
you have an abundance of riches at that point I've
noticed that happen with dating with relationships that happens that
happens with meditation that happens with enlightenment work that happens
with business like the first few years of your business
you're kind of just going along going long and you're
trying to make ends meet and you just can it's
a really really difficult struggle you're on the brink of
bankruptcy and quitting but then you hit the knee that
curve and then just like customers flow in money flows
in everybody wants to interview you everyone wants to do
business with you and then it becomes really sweet so
you got to remind yourself of the fact that really
what you're working towards is hitting the knee of that
curve the point where it stops being flat and it
starts going vertical that's really what you're looking forward to
so this is kind of like a long-term thinking kind
of deal you got to really appreciate that at the
beginning of every project that's the longest phase and that's
the most emotionally difficult part the beginning is probably more
than half the work is in the beginning more probably
like 80 to 90% of all the work and all
the emotional labor starts at the very beginning of the
project right and it could take a couple of years
like if you're starting a business it might take you
a couple of years might take you longer than you
expect there might be more setbacks than you expect in
fact I guarantee you it will take longer than you
expect and there will be more setbacks than you expect
now logically all this makes sense to you logically even
like a fifth grader I could tell them all this
and he'd be like yeah of course Lee I'm not
stupid I understand this stuff okay so logically you understand
it and that's fine you know you know it you
have that knowledge somewhere buried in your brain but uh
emotionally do you understand it that's the real question here
and that's the key do you grasp it emotionally because
if you did then you wouldn't be so frustrated and
stressed and overwhelmed at the beginning of every new project
or endeavor that you're undertaking if you're like me you've
struggled with this a lot and I know that every
product I would start I would just be kind of
like neurotic and needy and desperate for results and I'd
be like where are my results where are my results
I've been doing this for a whole week Leo where
are my results I've been meditating for a whole month
where are my results I've been doing enlightenment work for
two months where are my results you must be telling
us stupid ideas and stupid techniques here that just don't
work right I've been there I've been there with self-development
I've been there with business I've been there with programming
projects that I worked on web development projects that I've
worked on video game projects that I've worked on and
so on earlier in my life right um and what
always frustrated me is just that I could I could
kind of see that I was sabotaging myself in all
these projects because I would be so needy for the
result that eventually I couldn't take the pressure anymore and
then I just had to quit because I couldn't stand
not seeing the results fast enough so what needs to
happen is that emotionally you need to start to get
on board what I'm talking about here right this principle
of patience you need to start to apply the principle
of patience like an ointment or a salv on to
the emotional wounds that you experience at the beginning the
long dry spell that you have at the beginning of
every new endeavor whatever that endeavor is another important component
of this principle of patience is that the level of
patience that you apportion to a project should be proportional
to the significance of that project to your life let's
unpack that what does that mean let me give you
an example so let's say that I am planning to
write a world-changing book I want to write a book
that will transform the lives of millions of people and
this is something that's like my dream project and I
say okay I'm gonna sit down write this book and
I give myself one year to write this book well
six months into this project well I'll probably discover is
that man this is harder than I thought writing a
world-changing book is harder than I thought I don't have
the I don't have the staying power maybe I don't
have the writing skills I have I I need to
write this book maybe I don't have the research done
that I need to write this book maybe I don't
have enough life experience yet to write this book and
so what happens is I get discouraged I psych myself
out and I quit halfway through the project well that's
the normal way that it goes now if you apply
the principle of patience to this and especially this component
of proportional patience what it means is you ask yourself
something like okay how significant is this project well I'm
writing a world-changing book that will affect the lives of
millions of people all that's that's a very significant thing
well if it's that significant then I should be willing
to take some setbacks I should be very extra patient
with this process right so if it takes me instead
of one year it takes me two years fine takes
me three years fine takes me ten years fine why
because it's so significant it's still worth it still worth
it now for some projects you might ask yourself that
question no is it worth it is it worth it
doing if it takes twice as long three times as
long ten times as long you might come up with
the answer that no it's not worth it well in
that case you need to change your project you always
want to be working on the projects that are worth
it even if it takes you a decade to do
it so what are some examples of projects like that
well meditation is a great example that if it takes
you 10 years to become a master meditator instead of
the two years that you expect is that still worth
it and the answer is unquestionably yes it's still worth
it so that's a very good little rule of thumb
that you can use to judge what kind of things
you should be working on you know if you're writing
this world-changing book and there's the subject of this book
is important to you and maybe it's part of your
life purpose then hell yeah ten years fine ten years
who cares it's still worth it it's it's significant enough
that it's worth it it might be worth 20 years
of work Napoleon Hill on his book uh thinking Grow
Rich he spent like 10 or 20 years doing research
for that book that's impressive that's impressive and that has
gone on to become uh probably one of the most
best sold self-help books of all time it's sold probably
hundreds of millions of copies and you can see you
can see the love and the attention that he put
into that book it wasn't a flimsy little self-help book
written to get some publicity it was a real research
project and that's why it went on to become so
world-changing because there was real research in the in the
book there you can when you read the book you
see 20 years of work put in the book unlike
some books where you don't see that how about with
starting a business of your own if it takes you
five years or start a business of your own and
become financially independent rather than two years is that still
worth it to you hell yeah yeah it's totally worth
it if you're an entrepreneurial minded person and you love
doing your own work you love setting your own schedule
ah it's totally worth it for you how about with
the relationship if you're looking for a relationship and you
want you know a marriage with kids you want the
perfect marriage and you expect to get that within one
year and it takes you five years to get it
is it still worth it yeah it's probably totally worth
it for you it's totally worth even secu ten years
of work to get that marriage it's still worth it
for you right and so on and so on and
so on ah another point I want to make here
is that this principle of patience is extra important to
those of you who are newbies on this process and
not just newbies but what I would call like um
newbies coming from a place of deficiency like real deficiency
if you're starting at Ground Zero on your endeavor or
on your project like let's say you have never meditated
before you're starting at Ground Zero but not only that
but you're actually depressed so it's like you're not even
at neutral you're like in the negative you're depressed and
you have chronic anxiety and fear so it's like you
have no emotional mastery whatsoever you're in the negative okay
so if you're a newbie like that and let's say
you're depressed and you're starting this raising of awareness process
and you're trying to meditate you're trying to do self
actualization work you got to be extra patient with yourself
because you're in the negative it's going to take you
it's going to take you a while to get through
the very like shallow flat part of that curve where
you're not seeing any results but you're putting in a
lot of emotional labor the same thing like if you're
struggling with your finances if you're struggling with your finances
you're barely able to pay your bills and you decide
to start a business yeah I mean it's the same
thing it's kind of like being depressed and starting to
do meditation work it's like you're at the very very
very bottom you're a ground zero so oh one of
the most important techniques you should be using is this
principle of patience just like take patience and visualize in
your mind patience like an ointment right like imagine you
have a burn or an itch somewhere on your body
and it's really itching like you really need some results
because you're a newbie you're at ground zero you really
need some results so what you are going to do
is you're gonna you're gonna take this cool uh soothing
ointment and you're just going to like slather it in
very liberally in large doses all over your wound all
over your body so that it stops itching at least
for a little while to hold you over until you
can get to the doctor or until you can let
your body heal itself you know uh it's it's really
funny and kind of ironic and twisted ironic twist of
fate that for newbies their lack of results and their
need for results are exactly what keeps them being newbies
for most of their life because see a newbie comes
in and he's at Ground Zero and now he wants
results he comes in because he needs the results like
for example let's say I had a dry spell and
I haven't had sex in five or ten years and
I haven't had a good relationship in five or ten
years I really want some love and attention and I
want some sex and I want some companionship because I'm
feeling so lonely I met Ground Zero right and so
it's like all I need is that that result that's
what I really need to fix myself but ironically that's
exactly the thing that's going to keep me from getting
my result because that kind of needy behavior repels people
makes you repulsive and it's going to ruin your relationships
and it's Garou in your dating life well the same
thing applies for business if you come into business and
you're totally broke and you're trying to get this business
just to earn some money just to pay the bills
you just want to survive and you're just telling you
some everyday man if I could just get a little
bit of money and this business could work I would
be happy you come into it like that but again
you're just like that newbie who's so desperate that at
that point you're willing to take all these shortcuts in
business you're not going to create a high quality product
from that state of mind or a high quality service
so basically you're going to start end up taking shortcuts
and looking for get-rich-quick schemes and those will always disappoint
you because you're not building towards successful and sustainable long-term
what about with meditation or enlightenment work if you come
into enlightenment work or meditation and all you're trying to
do is you're trying to get some you know you're
trying to get some relief from the suffering in your
life and all you're doing it for is just relief
well that's going to be a very painful for you
because you're not going to get relief the first the
first few years of enlightenment work and of meditation work
you will see some results so I'm not saying you're
not going to see any results you will see results
and those results will be sort of nice but they
will be sporadic results and in fact what you'll see
is you'll see a worsening of your emotional state not
an improvement of your emotional state newbies come into meditation
thinking that all I'm going to meditate and feel relaxed
and then they rudely are awoken to the fact that
no meditation makes you anxious and it drives your monkey
mind crazy crazy that's why it works is because you
pass through that then there is a purging there's a
catharsis and then you get your peace after years of
work you get your peace not at the beginning which
is why almost nobody meditates because they're not willing to
go through the flat part the beginning of the curve
and they never get to the knee that then shoots
up exponentially and this applies to almost any important area
in your life whether it's fitness nutrition relationships emotional mastery
consciousness work meditation business finances you know whatever so if
you feel like you're a newbie and you feel like
you're kind of desperate my best advice to you is
just remember this principle of patience keep reminding yourself because
you're gonna be forgetting all the time so just keep
reminding yourself and just kind of slathering it on slathering
it on and just letting it kind of like soothe
you and reassure you that what you're doing is okay
now what that's going to look like what's that that's
going to look like it's like you're going to be
changing your self-talk here so one question you might have
is well Leo how do I apply the principle of
patience give me something tangible here's something tangible your self-talk
so the way that a newbie or an impatient person
talks to himself about a project or endeavor that he's
trying to succeed at is a very disempowering and counterproductive
you say things to yourself like Oh am I going
to get the result today oh man I didn't get
the result I didn't get it what's wrong with me
I must be doing something wrong or maybe this technique
you know something's fishy about this technique I knew it
I knew it that Leo Gallo he lied to me
he told me a technique that doesn't work I knew
it he was just a scam artist charlatan you know
you you start to have that kind of self-talk needless
to say that doesn't work very well instead you got
to recognize become conscious as much as you can become
conscious of yourself talk especially at the beginning phase the
flat phase of this new project you're working on and
then try to change it change it by becoming more
conscious of the long-term results and the bigger picture of
what you're doing become more conscious of the significance of
the thing you're working on become more conscious that you're
you're working really to break to the to the knee
of the curve that's where you're trying to break through
- hey so you tell yourself things like oh you
know it's okay that things didn't work out this week
because I'm in it for the long haul change yourself
talk to something like that or you tell yourself stuff
like oh yeah you know I'm just at the beginning
of the project I'm always gonna feel bad at the
beginning of the project the beginning of the project's the
hardest part if I can just get through the beginning
I'll be home free you see how much better that
kind of self-talk is that's what I mean by applying
that salv to your wound that's what you're doing here
also another way that you can implement the principle of
patience is to create more room in your life for
strategizing for looking at the big picture most people are
so busy doing stuff in life and entertaining themselves that
they don't create uh just like an hour block of
time every week where they can sit down and they
can actually be a strategic thinker I have a whole
episode that talks about that how to be a strategic
[ __ ] go check that one out it's one
my most popular episodes so we take the information from
that episode and we combine it here with patience right
a strategic thinker is he impatient or is he patient
think about a a really successful military strategist like a
general on the battlefield who has won many many battles
he's very very wise what does he do before he
goes into battle is he impetuous is he foolhardy does
he just rush into battle without assessing the situation without
thinking about the consequences of every possible action without projecting
into the future what this will mean not only for
this battle here but for the next battle and the
next battle how all that connects to the whole war
that he's fighting see a high quality general will think
all that stuff through and to do that he needs
to actually set aside time to sit down and think
to strategize when you sit down and you strategize what
will happen is you'll put your current week and your
current day which might have been a crappy day or
crappy week you'll put that into the context the larger
context of what you're doing you'll say to yourself oh
yeah you know this week I've been procrastinating and I
haven't been writing my book and you know things have
just become terrible wrong terribly wrong for me this week
but wait a minute that's just a week I'm writing
a book here that's going to change the lives of
millions of people and this is a ten year long
project and it's worth it even if it takes me
ten years to do oh yeah what's a week what's
a week what's a week in that larger picture it's
nothing it's a small price to pay Hey so create
this room in your life for strategizing a good starting
point is carve out at least one hour every week
where you can sit down quietly where you have no
work that's pressing upon you no social obligations no nothing
you're just sitting there quietly maybe late at night or
early in the morning maybe on a weekend when you're
totally free and just spend it thinking about your future
spend it thinking about where you're going it's better thinking
about how this project you're working on connects with that
other project and how that will synergize with this third
thing that you're doing and how all of it will
come together for you right and spend that time reassuring
yourself of like oh yeah I gotta remember to be
patient I gotta remember to strategize I got to remember
my long-term plans here because what happens is that you
can set some plans but then you go to work
for a week and you forget all about the plan
the big picture plan because you're so lost in the
details right and then and then you never come back
to the big picture plan until a year later but
you know by that point you've already quit so you
don't even come back to it and the third and
final a tangible thing that I'll give you here for
how to actually implement this principle of patience is simply
to slow down your pace slow down the pace of
your work on this project so when you're impatient for
results you really need a result what's going to happen
is then of course you're going to try to speed
up your pace you're going to look for shortcuts for
how to do things faster so let's say someone is
trying to UM someone is trying to lose weight right
there they're obese or trying to lose weight so what
do they come to me with if they come to
me for advice they're gonna be like Leo how can
I lose weight how can I lose 50 pounds in
20 days how can I do that and the answer
is you can't you can't do that the problem is
that you need to work and fix the root the
root is your impatience that's the problem here the problem
is not that you're fat the problems that you're impatient
so instead of trying to fix it in 20 days
try to do it in two or three times as
long a period slow down when you're trying to lose
weight the secret is not to go to the gym
for three hours when you first start the secret is
to go for 30 minutes but then to continue to
go every day for 30 minutes now to a person
starting off he thinks to himself well 30 minutes Li
up now 30 minutes that's not gonna make me lose
50 pounds that's not enough I know what I'll do
I'm so smart I'm gonna triple it I'm gonna triple
I'm gonna go for 90 minutes I'll show Leo I'll
show Leo 20 days he say I can't do in
20 I can do it in 20 days I'll just
go for 90 minutes and I'll do it twice as
fast that's about as silly as a woman thinking that
she can have a baby in half the time just
by trying to have it faster some things need time
to bake to marinate to come out well so don't
rush the project if this is a really significant important
project to you you should be willing to take twice
as long to do it you should be willing to
slow your pace by twice as much and if you're
not and if you struggle with that and you just
can't let go you're like no Leo I got to
keep my pace fast that's your problem right there that's
the reason you're not succeeding let go of that just
let go of it let go of needing the result
focus on the path focus on walking the path you're
on a path right now if you're following along with
me and you're on the self-actualization path you're on this
path right this path will completely transform your life if
you just stay on it and you don't try to
overthink it and psych yourself out and sabotage yourself somehow
the most important thing you got to worry about is
self-sabotage nothing will ruin your results more than self-sabotage and
impatience is one of the biggest forms of that now
I want answer an objection one objection that you might
have at this point is you might say something well
Leo it sounds like what you're just saying here is
that you know I got to sit around and wait
be more patient so be more patient means waiting but
isn't there a danger in waiting what if by waiting
I get complacent and lazy how can I know if
I'm being lazy well it's really simple are you taking
action patience only works when you're taking action I am
not telling you here to sit around idly doing nothing
waiting for a miracle to occur in your life and
to somehow expect a situation to spontaneously resolve itself that's
not what I'm saying at all I am a big
advocate of taking action if you believe you can just
sit there and wait for a spontaneous miracle that would
be sort of like if you got stranded in the
Sahara Desert in the middle of this vast desert with
no water and no food and you were stranded there
and you said oh I know what I'll do I'll
take Leo's advice and I'll use Leo's advice and I'll
just be patient I'm gonna sit down under this tree
I'm gonna sit here and just be patient I'm gonna
wait I'm gonna wait to be rescued and water will
come to me well if you do that you're going
to be dead within a week water will not spontaneously
come to you you have to go take action to
find it so the right strategy in this desert case
would be to actually go out and start looking for
water so what would you do well you'd have to
go around like looking for cactuses and maybe you go
you find one cactus you try to like cut it
open to get some some water out of it but
instead it sticks you with its thorns it has no
water in it so that one didn't work then you
go you look for another cactus you find another cactus
you suck some water out of that one but it
turns out not to be water but some nasty poisonous
juice and you have to spit it out and so
that didn't work and you see now you're on a
process of finding water now you're trying stuff and it's
not working and that's where you be patient so if
you're stuck in the Sahara and you're trying to find
a cactus with water and you know one of them
pokes you in the face and pokes you in the
eye well that's when you apply the patient's principle that's
when you need the ointment that's we need to reassure
yourself and tell yourself it's going to be okay because
there's a larger picture here this one cactus yeah it
didn't work out but you know there's more cactuses all
find water somewhere and you keep doing that you keep
keeping that mindset and then you'll probably survive if you're
resourceful so notice that I am I'm telling you to
apply this principle of patience only on top of a
foundation of you already taking action so if you're meditating
great that means you're taking action now apply the patience
principle to that if you're starting a business and you're
working every day on your business great you're taking action
now apply the patience principle to that and you know
if you have depression you're working on some depression issues
in psychotherapy great you're taking action you're going to therapy
you're doing journaling you're introspecting you're analyzing your past and
all this kind of stuff great keep doing that and
apply the principle of patience to it also watch out
for ineffective methods so it is possible for you to
stumble upon some method that you think will work and
it turns out that the method is actually totally ineffective
and you just keep doing it over and over and
over again for years and you get nowhere so I'm
not telling you to be patient with a totally ineffective
method the reality is is that you can quickly pretty
quickly guesstimate whether a method is working or not because
you start doing the method and you can already start
to see little tiny tiny little results these aren't results
you can you know you can really take home and
brag to your family about these are little little little
tiny results so when you sit down you meditate for
thirty minutes see a little little tiny result maybe going
to feel a little bit more calm after you finish
that session or maybe you're going to feel a little
bit calmer or a little bit more in emotional control
when you're in some angry fight with your boss at
work notice that and then you can see oh yeah
that little result is a little indicator of the larger
exponential results that I'll get years later down the road
so that's how you tell if a method is effective
if it's a totally ineffective method you're not going to
see those right months will pass you're going to see
anything if you're stuck on a method like that then
drop the method and find a better one so I
hope you're starting to see the wide-ranging ramifications of this
principle of patience in all the areas in your life
you can apply it you can apply to business projects
to your career - changing of habits - building of
confidence try to become more attractive to two women if
you're a guy it works great for that if you're
trying to become a better public speaker if you're trying
to learn something new if you're trying to learn the
guitar the piano musical instrument if you're trying to go
back to school if you're trying to go to graduate
school try to get a PhD if you're trying to
master some subjects like mathematics or physics or history you
know these are all subjects that take a lot of
time and a lot of effort to master and they
all have this kind of exponential growth curve so the
result they don't come at the beginning they come at
the end so just apply the patience principle over and
over and over again in these situations and also also
remember that your results are going to be so significant
in these areas so significant it's going to be so
worth it same thing for relationships trying to master your
relationships if you try to develop emotional mastery if you're
trying to develop consciousness or awareness if you're trying to
do self actualization if you're trying to meditate if you're
trying to do enlightenment work all this stuff remember that
the results will be so worth it and you have
to get realistic with yourself and you have to admit
that it's probably going to take you longer than you
expect in all these areas that I just listed from
business to enlightenment work it will take you at least
two to three to five times longer than you thought
that's the reality and it will take you to three
or five times more emotional effort than you thought in
fact as far as emotional effort goes I would say
the emotional effort is usually astronomically higher than you expect
so the time you can be off by a factor
of two or three or four on the time scale
so if instead of a year takes you four years
okay that's you know off by factor four as far
as estimating the emotional labor for something like starting a
business or reaching enlightenment you're probably gonna be off by
a factor of a hundred or a thousand by a
hundred or a thousand so you need to correct your
expectations because right now your expectations are are totally out
of line with the things you're trying to accomplish you're
treating the things you're trying to accomplish as cheap little
flimsy accomplishments when in fact they're super significant and super
important accomplishments which you need to take very seriously you
need to treat them with respect and expect that they
should take years not months to accomplish and to master
and decades really to master forget about mastery focus on
just getting a little bit of results a little bit
of proficiency don't even worry about mastery yet mastery takes
decades okay so I want to end this by giving
you a set of important questions that will help you
to determine patience and impatience and to apply this principle
of patience so here are the questions gather piece of
paper and write these down question number one is one
area in my life where I'm trying to go too
fast is fill in the blank it's not really question
to fill in the blank area in my life where
I'm trying to go too fast is blank okay second
one is why am I in such a rush why
am I in such a rush the third question is
if it took twice as long would it still be
worth it if it took twice as long but it'd
still be worth it next question if I embraced the
principle of patience I would fill in the blank if
I embraced the principle of patience I would fill in
the blank next question how would my expectations change if
I cared deeply about long-term results how would my expectations
change if I cared deeply about long-term results and the
next set of three questions that I'm going to give
you are all going to apply to some specific project
that you're working on so I want you to take
a specific project you're working on and then ask yourself
this what exactly does a lazy pace look like here
for this project what exactly does a lazy pace look
like here for this project and then follow that up
with what exactly does an impatient pace look like here
for this project what exactly does an impatient pace look
like here for this project and lastly ask yourself what
exactly does a wise pace look like here for this
project what exactly does a wise pace look like here
for this project alright go ahead and answer all those
pick something in your life that's very significant to you
and just check it out answer these questions and take
a look are you being impatient maybe you could change
